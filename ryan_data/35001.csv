"I'm having some joint and skin issues that could be hyaluronic acid related.  So I found this product and it is well reviewed.However, you may want to search ""hyaluronic acid cancer"".  It doesn't cause cancer, but it may help it spread.  Wikipedia has a somewhat technical explanation.  I'm nowhere near the expert.So what to do?  Certainly if you have cancer, it would not be a good idea to take this stuff.  I don't so, so far so good.Treat this like Vitamin A: your body produces it, but your body regulates the production of it: it only makes what it needs.  If you have enough, your body won't make more.  But if you take vitamin A supplements, your body can't avoid it and it can build up to a toxic level.If this helps you, then stop taking it and make sure you are eating the right foods to allow your body to make it.  Beans, spinach and sweet potatoes are good sources of food to help your body make what it needs.I'm not an expert but I think that taking this for a long time is probably not worth the risk unless you are in serious trouble without it.  I don't want to alarm anyone, nor do I have an opinion (heck, even I'm going to try it) but I don't think it's a good idea long term unless nothing else works and you are in bad shape without it.On the other hand, it isn't clear that if you take it in a pill form and digest it, it remains as hyaluronic acid, so who really knows!  I'm not trying to pass judgment, just to alert people to something they may not have thought about.UPDATE: After receiving the bottle and researching it further, I've decided that no one should take any of this stuff unless you are in very serious and continuous pain for which no relief is possible.  If it survives digested, it's like pouring gasoline on a fire to try to put it out.  It might work for your joints, but the dangers cannot possibly be worth the risk.  It's proven to help cause cancers to spread, and it is *not* proven to help joint pain.  I decided not to take it and urge you to do the search for ""hyaluronic acid cancer"" and make up your own mind.  Again, it doesn't cause cancer but it helps it grow and spread.  Who needs that?","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 21, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1EK61XRLIVAQ5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000GFHPFC#wasThisHelpful","R1EK61XRLIVAQ5","A3SUZA0C8QV8AW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3SUZA0C8QV8AW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I bought this product with two Seagate Barracuda 7200 1 TB 7200RPM SATA 3Gb/s 32MB Cache 3.5 Inch Internal Hard Drive ST31000528AS-Bare Drive.  You need at least one drive to make it work and the drive you can buy with the thing is not very good.  Buy it bare and then add two of the drives like I did.All screws were included with the drives.  Some people report that their drives don't come with screws.  If that's the case, use the screws from an old computer or buy Link Depot Accessory Computer Screws Kit 68Pcs or cheaper still StarTech 15SCREW6_32  632 x 1/4-Inch Long Screws (15 Pack).You can access your files remotely and the backups are automatic once you set them up.  As soon as the file changes, it is automatically backed up.  If you plug a laptop in to your network and log on, any files changed while the laptop was unplugged will get uploaded into the thing.If your disks have problems, you get an e-mail from the device.  If the thing stops working (because it gets unplugged, for example), your computers will tell you.The product works as expected.  I had previously used a seagate Mirra, which is no longer available.  In comparison to the mirra, the downside is that you have to add the disks in yourself (took about ten minutes - no special skills required, just a screwdriver), and you have to log into the computer for the software to back up your files.  The mirra would back them up if you turned on the computer but had not yet logged on.  The other big gotcha is that if power is cut and then restored, the Mirra would automatically reboot itself, this device stays off until you turn it back on.The upside is that the system has two disks, configured so that if one fails the other has a copy.  And, most importantly, your computer will tell you if it can't connect to the device.  My big complaint with the Mirra was that it did not tell you when there was a failure.  So as you can guess, there was a failure and I just charged happily along for 6 months without knowing that I had no backup.  When I needed it, I discovered it hadn't been working for 6 months.  The software for this device added to every computer it backs up tells you within a minute if the device is off.I've had it for about a year and a half and I'm happy with it.  It backs everything up from several different computers and I don't have to think about it.  If someone on my staff accidentally deletes a file, we can get it back.  If a disk on my server fails, I can get everything back.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 23, 2010","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ADBDEX0JRGG1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001MVIH24#wasThisHelpful","R2ADBDEX0JRGG1","A3SUZA0C8QV8AW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3SUZA0C8QV8AW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I saw the reviews, but decided to give the unit a try.  I had no problems with it at all.  I used it on a Motorola Droid 2 and a Veho 360 rechargeable speaker and it did exactly what it said it would do: it charged both of them to 100% at the same time, and shut off a few minutes after the last one was charged.Most chargers draw a small amount of current when plugged in, even when you unplug the device they were charging.  This device charges your rechargeable devices, detects the devices are full, waits a few minutes, then shuts off, drawing no power from that point on.  So if you charge your devices at night, the charger won't be drawing power all day doing nothing.You could get the same effect by unplugging the charger, but I never did, so this was ideal.It is also conveniently designed, with three USB plugs (which only supply power, there is no connection to a computer), two short cords to use, each of a slightly different style.  Or you can plug in your own USB cords, and they provide a cord management system to store the unused length of cord if you use your own.  If you can use their plugs, you can take your charge to work and store it in your desk to use for emergencies.Like a lot of ""green"" products, the energy savings won't make up for the cost, but if you like the idea of not wasting energy, thereby reducing pollution and saving the planet, and would like a clutter free way to charge your devices, this product is for you.  The earlier models sound like they had some bugs, but I experienced none of them so its possible they redesigned it.I'm pretty energy savings obsessed: you can see the first review for the Bunn NHBX-B Contemporary 10-Cup Home Coffee Brewer, Black (mine is the first review), to get an idea of the analysis I typically go through.  I would recommend this product, it's convenient and it saves wasted energy, but just remember that you won't save enough in electricity bills to offset the purchase price, but the energy savings, plus being able to use your existing charger as an emergency charger elsewhere, makes this product's purchase price worthwhile.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 15, 2010","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3QWU9S2EBRBDP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003P2UMR6#wasThisHelpful","R3QWU9S2EBRBDP","A3SUZA0C8QV8AW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3SUZA0C8QV8AW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This product really works.  I've been having problems with my right knee for a while and certain activities made it much worse.  I put this one and did the worst of them, and felt better afterwards than I did when I started.  I just ordered 2 more of the same product.Amazon thankfully ships it in a plain envelope - the retail package is large and a waste of trees.  Unfortunately, there are no instructions on the envelope.  Here are the instructions (I've edited them from the retail package):Center the pressure pad under the kneecap (i.e. the little hard tube goes in front of your knee, aimed backwards, the logo is in front, just under your kneecap, like in the photo).Use the shorter velcro strap to wrap the thing around your knee, just under your kneecap, then use the longer strap to tighten it.  (You basically use the shorter strap just to hold it on your knee and then the longer strap to make it tighter while it's held on your knee with the other strap.  There is a little groove right under your kneecap, it fits in that groove.)Hand wash cold, air dry.Update: I just ordered 5 more so I can have a clean pair whenever I need them.  That's right: I now have 8 of them.  They are that good.Uh oh, update II: After just under two months, one of them fell completely apart!  Both straps came off.  Realize that I have 4 pairs of these, and I rotate through them, so this was like two weeks of use.  Sewing them back together isn't the most fun thing but it's possible.  Just recognize that they might fall apart just when you need them!To sew them, take the two elastic velcro pieces and start with the longest one.  On the main piece, there is a little pouch three inches to the right of the logo.  Shove the non velcro end of the longest elastic piece into that pouch, with the velcro facing backwards (if the logo is the front).  Hold it there.  On the back side of the main piece, find the other pouch and shove non-velcro end of the shorter strap in that pouch, with the velcro facing the same direction as the long strap, towards the back side, the side with the beads in the tube.  Now sew through both pouches and both straps.  Cut away any of the old thread, it won't hold if you try to tie it off, just cut it away.  It should last.  The others have lasted for over a year.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 24, 2010","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3HC048FL5ICND/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00169YA2S#wasThisHelpful","R3HC048FL5ICND","A3SUZA0C8QV8AW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3SUZA0C8QV8AW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I saw someone using one of these about a mile away in the daytime!  When I saw that it runs on 4 AAA batteries (think - cheap rechargeables), I had to have one.  Or two.  So I bought two, LOVED them and bought two more.  Three months later, they have all broken.  They are made out of thin, brittle plastic.  If you drop it once, it's gone, shattered into a million pieces.  If something crushes it in your backpack -- Crunch.  Think handblown glass.  They are that bad.I started wrapping them with electrical tape to keep them from breaking, but even the handlebar mount is made of brittle thin plastic.  I broke two of them in one week.  You can't tape the mount.  I don't manhandle anything, but these are simply unsuitable for outdoor use.And this seller's price is ridiculous.  I've been paying about $6.50.I hope the manufacturer sees this and makes them out of a less brittle plastic.  The light output is outstanding and battery life is great.  You can actually see with them.  But the build quality is a catastrophe.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 1, 2010","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3QLASPD2GUR0Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002HMRYBM#wasThisHelpful","R3QLASPD2GUR0Y","A3SUZA0C8QV8AW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3SUZA0C8QV8AW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Some advice if you are thinking of buying one of these:First, go buy a bag of ice at the store for $2, see how long it lasts, and ask yourself if you really need an icemaker for $200.  That's a lot of bags of ice, and you still have to pay for electricity and fill it up and clean it!  If you can get by with a $2 bag once or twice a month for 5 months out of the year, this may not be the product for you!We decided on this one because it looked like the best one after looking at the comments of other reviewers.  We noted that ice makers in general have a pretty high breakdown rate, and so for the first time in my life, I actually bought an extended warranty that all consumer magazines tell you are a waste of money.  We'll see.If you buy it, while it's on its way, go buy a quart size container of vinegar.  The plastic smell this thing generates when you first get it is pretty strong.  That's just the smell AROUND the unit when it's on, I didn't even bother tasting the ice.Dump the vinegar and an equal amount of water in it and press the self clean button.  Run it twice then as it makes ice, throw the ice out.Now you have a second problem: the vinegar will smell even though you got rid of all the ice.  That's because there is 4 cups of water left in the thing when it looks empty.  The only way to get rid of the 4 cups of vinegar-smelling water is to drain it using the drain on the lower left.  Fill it again, run it, toss out the ice, drain and repeat until the ice stops smelling like vinegar.  We had to run it through several times.  It took several days.And then: it makes ice.  Enough to fill 5 large ice tea glasses in about 3 hours.  As another reviewer noted, the ice stays in an insulated bucket with holes in it that sits above the water reservoir.  When the ice melts, the melted ice drips into the reservoir.  When the level of ice is less than full, it makes more.The reviewer stating that he can't tell when it's on is absolutely nuts.  It sounds like a modestly quiet dishwasher in the rinse cycle.  You can tell when its on from 20 feet away.  It runs continuously until the ice bucket is full then stops and then it is silent until enough ice melts for another batch to be made to refill it.It's a fairly large appliance, but most of its size is dedicated to insulation that you WANT, so it's large in a good way.  13"" wide by 16"" high by 16"" deep.  About the size of a big office printer.It's more energy efficient than you'd expect.  It uses 2.4 amps to make the ice and 3.5 amps for the minute it takes when it's pushing the ice from where it gets made into the bucket.  2.4 amps x 120 volts means it uses about .290 kilowatts.  If you figure it runs about 4 hours per day, that's about 1.152 kilowatt hours per day, about 12 cents per day or $3.60 per month.A child can operate it.  Once it's set up, you just fill the tank with water (about 10 cups max), push a power button and it will run all day by itself, stopping and starting as needed to make more ice until you shut it off or it runs out of water.  They give you a shovel to scoop ice out of the basket, and the basket has handles s that you can lift the whole thing out and dump it into another container.The interior is made out of the same stuff any cooler is made out of and is easy to clean.We're happy with it.  If it breaks, I'll be back to report it and I'll also report whether the extended warranty was worth it or not.Edit: 4 years later, did it break?  No, because we never used it.  Arrrgh!  At least I didn't pay for it.  I rent extra office spaces and one of my tenants bought this thing after he said my ice tasted funny.  Never ever used it though. I think they thought it would be like an ice maker you get with a fridge.  This one takes actual effort: you have to fill it, drain it, clean it, etc. so they never used it after all my work cleaning it.Let me give you some good advice: buy 4 ice cube trays and put them in the freezer every night instead of cleaning this thing.  Then, in the morning, dump them into a gallon freezer zip lock bag and repeat.  It's easier, cheaper, costs little to do and you'll thank me in the end.  This was a complete waste.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 30, 2010","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJ4M9VN29CWIJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000KD68AI#wasThisHelpful","RJ4M9VN29CWIJ","A3SUZA0C8QV8AW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3SUZA0C8QV8AW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have three of the higher quality Klean Kanteen (KK) bottles, but decided to purchase one of these on sale at a local store to use as a bike bottle.  Klean Kanteen bottles are five times as expensive, so I figured I just wanted something I could beat up and potentially lose without worries and this fit the bill.The difference between the two products is pretty large.  The KK bottles are twice as thick, and are made out of a single piece of stainless steel.  This allows the bottoms of the KK bottles to be rounded at the edges (they are still flat at the bottoms) and not leak because it is a single piece.The Green Canteen (GC) bottles are made from thinner stainless, and the bottom edge is squared off, though it isn't remotely sharp and not ""razor sharp"" as one reviewer mentioned.  The practical effect of the difference between the two bottles is nothing.  I also note that a lot of the KK reviewers say their bottle tops leak, though I don't have this problem with my KK bottles or with this bottle.My GC bottle arrived with an oily, metallic smell that washing with normal dish soap and airing out for several weeks did not get rid of.  It took soaking overnight in automatic dish detergent and scrubbing with a brush to get rid of it.  It still imparts a slightly metallic taste.  I suspect they use a less expensive grade of stainless steel that you can taste or at least smell.  I had no such problems with any of the KK bottles.  I noticed that some KK reviewers mentioned the same problem with their bottles, and that none of the other GC reviewers have mentioned this problem, so it may be something that different people are sensitive to, or it could be that I just got a batch with some leftover polishing chemicals and the KK batches can sometimes have that happen too.Once I got rid of the metallic oily taste, I'd say I got what I paid for - a cheaper bottle that probably won't last forever, which I'm OK with.  If you want a cheaper, less well-built product, buy this one.  If you want something that will last a long time, and uses a higher quality stainless, buy the KK.  I'd buy each brand again without hesitation.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 6, 2010","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1LYHCXK4FPWR7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002J4UPM8#wasThisHelpful","R1LYHCXK4FPWR7","A3SUZA0C8QV8AW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3SUZA0C8QV8AW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Next to Walter Kennedy, John Roberts seemed as tall as a giant. Usually both men worked companionably side by side swabbing decks on the slave transport ship Princess. One day when they are not being as friendly towards each other, Roberts is sent below deck and we learn of his friendship with a captured slave. The Negro slave asks John, an unabashed Christian, how God views the slave trade.Before John can decide how to answer, the Princess is overtaken by pirates.John feels his captain would give the slaves a better chance at a good life than pirates; after all, aren't pirates greedy, self centered criminals? When the pirate captain declares they are there to free the slaves and return them to their home, John has doubts. This is how he joined the pirate crew.The first thing John learns as a pirate is that the ships are run under a very unusual set of rules.The second thing he notices is that the pirates are a mixed bunch. He begins to question his beliefs.Not long after joining the pirate crew, along with Kennedy, they experience a naval cannon battle.This time the pirates are after gold, which is what the sailors expect of pirates.Again, Roberts faith and belief are tested, as are his friendships.Kennedy becomes jealous and spiteful. John tries to do him a favor but true nature prevails.When it becomes necessary to name a new pirate captain and set new plans in action, vengeance rears its ugly head.This brief story sets the scene and tone for future volumes in this series.I was drawn into the telling and did not know how things would turn out.The characters are not complex but filled out enough to be interesting.The idea of pirates not being the evilest option was enticing.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R74EH76W2VT50/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0987809563#wasThisHelpful","R74EH76W2VT50","A18F9XLJ0UQF0E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A18F9XLJ0UQF0E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I read this hearing voices similar to Dr. Ruth and Judge Judy in my head.Sort of a New York Jewish accent, wisdom mixed with humor.Normally, the Julius and Rebecca Cohen Home for Jewish Seniors was a routine place for elderly folks to live. There was a consistent pattern and rhythm to each day. Seeing as the population consists of elderly people with medical problems and no place else to live, the occasional death was expected.As in any setting where people coexist, now and then there will be conflict and drama.Sometimes a death came about by means of unnatural cause. Mrs. K. seemed to find herself in the middle of those odd deaths. Not long ago she even found herself a suspect in a murder investigation.The story is narrated by Ida, best friend of Rose Kaplan, the aforementioned Mrs. K. Now, gossip and the spreading thereof, is seriously frowned upon by the Jewish religion. Ida does her best to stick to facts but as she tells us, it gets complicated.Vera Gold was not well liked within the community. She often stuck her nose in where it didn't belong and she seemed to enjoy getting others in trouble. When she became ill, it would not have been strange if people stayed away, yet her sister and her son made sure to take extra care of Vera. As it seemed she was recovering, suddenly she died. The senior home and doctor all took it in stride. As with Jewish custom, burial was swift.It wasn't until someone close to Vera insisted her death had been helped along, and requested Mrs. I'd help, that there were any doubts. Out of her past unfortunate dealings with the police, Mrs. K. made some valuable contacts. Once they were convinced the death was not from natural cause, they set their eyes on a suspect whom Mrs. K could not accept.She could not rest without her own full investigation.I think my favorite part of the book was when the ladies discovered a new restaurant. Between the drama and investigation, the book is full of informational passages.I received this book in exchange for an honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3M1C2SGIUILDJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TWE4FHO#wasThisHelpful","R3M1C2SGIUILDJ","A18F9XLJ0UQF0E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A18F9XLJ0UQF0E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I love this series! While the Booker series does have its dark and twisted side, even the general crime drama reader will become hooked if read in order. The characters become real and you'll get attatched. You'll worry about them and occcasionally want to smack them for decisions and actions you, the reader, know will not turn out well. At parts, I also laughed out loud.Booker was an honest cop. That sense of value got him black balled and unceremoniously TOSSED from the Dallas force. Fortunately, he still has a few trustworthy contacts from that life,or so he believes, but we are learning nothing is ever as simple or clear as it seems.When the Chief of DPD secretly hires Booker to hunt down a cop killer, you know there are enemies and danger on all sides, from ALL directions.The deeper Booker gets into the case, the more complex it becomes and it hits very close to home. The entire force is stymied but Chief Ligon puts heat on Booker for immediate results.Soon it is not only cops being killed. Is this someone on a vendetta?There definitely seems to be a masterplan and a hitlist.(Although this killer doesn't always follow the plan.)With an ending you won't see comingI received this book ine xchange for my honest review","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2EX46VKVAA137/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014EHIGIC#wasThisHelpful","R2EX46VKVAA137","A18F9XLJ0UQF0E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A18F9XLJ0UQF0E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Although this is written for a teenage audience, I am sure other older readers, such as myself, will also get pulled into this mystical tale. The main character, or family, are living in the midwestern US (Ohio) but the daighter and her father have Moroccan genes and all appreciate the Morrocan heritage and mythology, the values of the OLD country.When Kenza turns sixteen herm life (and dreams) begin to change. she never had overly much interest in boys before but one she meets in a dream, she can not forget. Now, the question is, was it a dream?Morroccan lore is filled with magic and genies, here referred to as jinns.Not only is Kenza visited by a protective jinn called Junny Zzaman, but she is whisked away to learn that her spirit can inhabit bodies from long ago. And her ancestor's spirit can come along in Kenza'a body for a ride.Unfortunately, some very evil spirits can also jump fprward from the past and desire to end Lenza's family.Written for teens, this is a well written, complex tale of danger, teenage angst and revenge, time travel amd Morroccan lore.

"A different kind of ghost story, a different kind of love (not actually) story.It would be a friends with benefits story but Izzy doesn't do friendship.Max is a ghost hunter. What's that? He corrects me. He is a Paranormal Investigator.He hasn't actually seen any ghosts or done any deep investigating, but he believes in ghosts and spirits and wants to start a business.Izzy has a business. As the last living Grant, she inherited the family antiques store and promised her grandmother she would run it. What the translates into is sit behind the counter waiting for anyone to stop in and reading biker romance novels. This makes Izzy so desperate she tries to take her own life.That is how she meets J.D. Rye.The story contains humor, danger and barrier breaking sex (for necessity, trust me.)Izzy, who has no friends and has never had a relationship, has two very different men chasing after her, wanting to be her one and only.

"An interesting cozy with a fresh approach; a mature amateur sleuth teamed up with the teenage daughter of a colleague, reminiscent of a pairing of Miss Marple and an aspiring Nancy Drew.Winter break at Twombly College allows an opportunity for less serious, more flexible classes. Mrs. Crawford is teaching crochet to a group of varied students, from 14 year old Madison and her mother, Amy, wife of a prestigious professor, several college students, including two male soccer players, and an adult accountant, suffering from pneumonia and boredom.Emory Crawford has adult children of her own and is beginning to feel pangs of empty nest syndrome. Fortunately she still has two cats and a golden retriever to mother. Emory also has some intuition or psychic awareness. The esteemed professor Twombly also has some extra sensory abilities, more developed than Emory's. The animals may have some intuitive intelligence, similar to Koko, the cat WHO, or it could just be Emory's desire for them to communicate with her.Strange things are happening on campus. Someone is breaking into rooms and leaving red objects. There is no explanation. It is just weird.One student who receives the mysterious red items is in the crochet class.Things escalate when she is drugged and kidnapped. Emory can not keep her nose out of the investigation.Even worse, the professor's P.A. ends up dead in his home kitchen after a loud argument with Amy. Madison can't sit back and watch her mother take the fall. She knows Amy is not guilty, but the evidence isn't clearing her.This is a quick read. The crochet talk is interesting and the food descriptions are tantalizing. I wish the incredible pot pie recipe was included, but from details given, even I can create it. Something about this author's writing encourages readers to cook.There are a lot of relationship issues discussed, some sleuthing over every dinner, and several mysteries to solve, including an ongoing curiosity about Emory's psychic intuition. Even after the main mysteries are solved, there is enough left unexplained to make readers look forward to another book.This does well as a stand alone, but some references are included to past events. I look forward to seeing the characters grow and develop.I did receive this book in exchange for an unbiased review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1AY33S0GLK5B9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=198785716X#wasThisHelpful","R1AY33S0GLK5B9","A18F9XLJ0UQF0E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A18F9XLJ0UQF0E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Although this quick escape read is the third book about Goose Pimple Junction, the events contained occur between the first two books and is the response from the author to requests from readers who adore this quirky, small southern community. Readers fell in love with the characters and wanted details about special events in their lives. While you may enjoy it more completely if you have already been introduced to this loveable, zany cast of everyday locals, it can be read and enjoyed as a stand alone humorous read. The book begins with various shorts where you will better understand personalities and be treated to one very elaborate proposal.We are also treated to great phrases of homegrown vernacular such as absogulldarnlutely. Many others come to play as the town seniors try to discuss adult relations in clean and mixed gender phrasing.The zingers continue in ""Is it Hot Enough for you."" The next stories show more of the spirit and mettle of GPJ townfolk and how it gets passed down.In the long tale, during Apple Day I had to laugh out loud when Lou interrogates her older sister about a mysterious beau, using the classic question, ""Who are his people?""If you enjoy small town antics and colorful southern language, you'll want to visit Goose Pimple Junction where the folk may argue amongst themselves but respect their differences and are quick to lend a helping hand... along with an opinion.I own the two other books in this series but was given this book in exchange for my review.

"There are shelves and shelves of self help and transformational books everywhere you turn. I bet you can buy a cheap book at the gas station or carwash with theories on positive thinking and the law of attraction.What you won't find in most of those books are the action steps necessary to improve your life or the reasoning behind why these steps work.Those other books give this genre a ""woo-woo"" nonsensical reputation.Author Toneka Etienne not only breaks the improvement process into understandable chunks of actionable behaviors, she gives excellent examples from her own life. This book is the result of using the process.She does not promise it will be quick or easy. It will go smoother if you trust and believe, but she even offers advice for those who are not totally convinced. She does an excellent job of covering mindset, attitude and perception.I have read more books on this subject than the average person.I've seen many that just repeat the same words as other best-selling or celebrity authors. This book is not just repetition. Toneka writes with openness and her personal style. You will get the most from this book when you follow along and do the exercises.

Love is in the air.What would a wedding be if there were not obstacles and complications while trying to make everything perfect?Poor Delilah seems to be taking the brunt of the frustration.

"I waffled over how to rate this book. There are definitely many five star chapters and moments.I will tell you the major drawbacks for me first, as there are far FEWER of them.Conspiracy theory.I felt it detracted from the storyline and if it was used, the topics should have been more fairy tale related.The disappearance and possible murder of Janie's biological mother. I felt there should have been more clarification.Bert, how we ALL love him, needed a little more backstory explanation. Why did no one ever try to kiss him?I felt it could have been a running joke or occurence that would have added much to the book, but then again, I did not write it. Admit it, you all have had the thought, ""if I had written this book, such and such would have happened or not happened.""I enjoyed the sarcasm and caustic wit used in the witty dialogue.The vague references, when caught, made me smile, e.g. the stepmother's name of Evangeline Kravits Grimm.While no longer a child, Janie Grimm is still at an age where she has much to learn and her emotions are nowhere close to stable. Having lost her father just six months before and now entering law school, that is quite understandable. Finding a talking frog who claims her father was murdered by a faerie curse and having to explain to her best friend that she was NOT crazy only add to her stress, discomfort and confusion. Starting another new school one is expected to make new friends. Janie's trouble is, she can't quite tell which friends are ""real"" and who is magic. She has no family to turn to, as her stepmother, the ""plastic Barbie doll of Botox,"" is quite literally evil but a necessary evil until Janie finishes law school.You will find characters from fairy tales you heard in your youth making an appearance (or a disturbance) in the storyline. Janie's life will be on the line regularly unless and until she can figure out what someone wants from her and who she can trust and count on. Oh- and not go crazy and fail law school during her first week. She may be struggling with her classes but she learns some good life lessons: ""Just because you haven't heard of it doesn't mean it doesn't exist.""After I read the book I thought back on passages that made more sense now and clues I might have not given enough weight to. I enjoy retellings and alternate endings. This book was a fun read that gave me a different viewpoint.I did receive this series in exchange for an honest review. I look forward to seeing where else it will take us.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3NM4PKUPWNU4S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VDSDZTQ#wasThisHelpful","R3NM4PKUPWNU4S","A18F9XLJ0UQF0E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A18F9XLJ0UQF0E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Daisy McDare series a light, clean, cozy mystery. I find it suitable for ages teen and up.Each of the murder victims is hated by a number of persons, so motives and suspects are plentiful.Daisy is not the smoothest of interrogators, so her questions often put Daisy into danger herself.I suggest she start wearing steel toes shoes.Often a random statement makes Daisy's lightbulb spark for her to solve the crime.For more information on each of the books, please see my individual reviews.In book 1 - the Deadly Art Affair, Daisy finds herself involved because the widow is an old friend.Daisy McDare, who loves to redecorate her own place, becomes a professional interior decorator, an old friend, Karam who has married wealth, asks Daisy to redo a room in her mansion. Daisy walks into a household torn apart by tension and selfishness.Eccentric and ill-tempered do not begin to describe Kara's reclusive artist husband.Daisy is shocked to show up for her second day on the job to find the man has been murdered.Along with the murder, Daisy's BFF Samantha, who owns the Sweet Tooth bakery, has an objective of her own: to find a boyfriend for Daisy.In book 2 - the Deadly Legal Affair, Daisy can not stand the injustice of the wrong person being accused.When she takes a job redesigning the offices of the most hated attorney in town, she learns that his own staff can not find one nice thing to say about him ~ even after he is murdered.  Daisy feels a collective sigh of relief from everyone who knew him! This makes the list of potential murderers infinitely long. Daisy must clear the accused woman's name by finding the true murderer.In book 3 - the Deadly Directorial Affair, well, we've all heard about what happens on movie sets!This time she is designing sets for a movie production.Daisy has great belief in her vision and thinks she has the sets perfect when the egotistical director, Hunter Hayworth, tells her to tear it all part and redo it in his vision, which is totally inapporpriate.It seems Hunter has made an enemy of everyone involved in this movie project. Still it comes as a shock when Daisy arrives the next day to find Hunter has been murdered.  Once again there is a long list of suspects and endless motives for murder.

"Being a Wisconsin native, familiar both with Old World Wisconsin and the Laura Ingalls Wilder books and historical sites, I wanted to take my time and enjoy every aspect of this book.Chloe and her sister Kari reminded me of my relationship with my sister, the two of us actually being a Laura and Mary pair. We even have some Norwegian blood.I loved the terms used for fans of the Little House book series including Laura Lookers.I was fascinated by the extra information about the Ingalls' family and being able to say ""I knew that!""I did not expect the murders to begin so soon or hit so close to home for Chloe.This cozy was complicated and kept me working on clues.I did not feel that the sisters' romantic and family issues distracted from my enjoyment of the book.Chloe has an education and career in historical facts and preservation.When her elderly neighbor presents her with a quilt from the 1800s allegedly made by the famous Laura Ingalls, Chloe is beside herself. She was fascinated with the Little House books as a child, even preparing a college paper on them to earn her degree. Recently she has been invited to present her findings at a scholarly gathering celebrating Laura Ingalls Wilder. This is a wonderful opportunity to spend time with her sister, from whom she feels she has drifted apart. Also to use her investigative nature to discover any connections this quilt may have to the beloved author.Her investigative nature and undeveloped psychic senses get quite the workout on this trip when people around her turn up dead. She also learns things about her family and loved ones she was not expecting. She may not find exactly what she was looking for on her road trip but at the end I think we are all satisfied. The Ingalls family survived unexpected circumstances and extremely difficult times. Still, they made the best of what they had and what happened to them.

"This is a sweet although tumultuous love story.Kelly is not looking to complicate her life with a romantic relationship. She had enjoyed a wealthier lifestyle as a stock trader until greed and insider trading landed her in jail. She had wanted children and chose to have a daughter via insemination. Now sweet Bree is four years old and realizes some kids have father's. So Bree decides to ask Santa for a Papa of her own.Tyler Manning had a promising future ahead of him.

"This debut mystery novel has so many wonderful elements that keep cozy readers coming back for more.Abigail Mackenzie was a strong, independent police officer working for a micro managing power hungry boss. He would string her along with promises of promotion but after seven years she was still a beat cop. She enjoyed knowing the people in her community. When an injury finally made her choose retirement, Abby stayed in the area, retreating to a neglected farm and her chickens and bees.Early one morning when she is delivering honey in town she discovers the body of a pastry chef who has not been accepted by everyone in town.When the police chief rules it suicide, the handsome, moody yet sexy brother of the chef hires Abby to look into the death.Abby agrees that there is more to the death. As she investigates there are plenty of people who wish she would mind her own business. The book is filled with characters we will appreciate spending time with in future books. The mechanics of the murder itself could have been more precise. I liked that Abby fought her attraction to her client for as long as she could and that someone else seems to be interested in her, complicating things.At the beginning of each chapter are tips and advice, with recipes included to tempt us.

"This is an excellent book for mature middle school age and high school students.It comes across religious in tone but not preachy. It covers extremely important issues about self esteem, trust, and sense of belonging.Mayah Lewis is fourteen years old. In her school system that means a new school and once again being low in status. Usually that affects any person's confidence. Recently Mayah also discovered facts about her adoption that made her question her whole life. She withdrew from her friends and even moved out of her adoptive parents home. Her story is about identity and support.A new student begins school with more going against her than just not knowing anyone. Despite that, Celeste Daniels is a positive force to be reckoned with. Her energy affects all she comes in contact with.The popular cheerleader, Kitty, seems to have it all together. Looks, money, cool friends, but she may have more secrets than anyone else. Mayah is shocked and suspicious when Kitty acts friendly.The story moved along steadily but a bit slowly for me at the beginning.I appreciated the important values and messages included in the book.I cared about the characters and wanted them to figure out how to relate and help each other. There are some very tense and sad moments. It would be a good book to discuss with younger readers and ask if they know anyone struggling with similar thoughts and problems.There are several excellent passages I had to highlight in my eBook.If you read an e-dition I believe you can see them.Passages about life being made up of different aspects, not all one thing, and life not waiting for ideal circumstances and acceptance by others.I was provided with an advance copy of this book in exchange for an honest review. It would make a tremendous addition to a church library or youth group reading.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RSSQ8JJ0I9IRB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1613097735#wasThisHelpful","RSSQ8JJ0I9IRB","A18F9XLJ0UQF0E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A18F9XLJ0UQF0E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Marley had nothing Toby couldn't top.Charmaine and Chris are a loving couple who had experience with dogs.Their beloved Dooks had passed away and time had also passed. The time was right to fill the void in their lives. Deciding to look for a dog needing a better life, they perused the online rescue listings.Have you ever done that and fallen in love with a photo? The expression on a face or something in an animal's eyes? It seemed to be love at first sight with Char and Toby's photo.Perhaps they did not ask the right questions or get as much information as they should have, but once the deal was sealed, Toby and his eccentricities were now part of the family. You do not give up on family.Chris does think about it from time to time, but time diffuses the anger and frustration of the moment.Fortunately they recruit the advice and help from an accomplished and patient animal behaviorist. It is not a quick fix or a magical cure.It is a fresh start for Toby and allows him to use his natural talents.Not having Toby's destructive behaviors happening to us, as a reader we can chuckle about them. It takes very special people to be patient and understanding as their home is destroyed.Watching Toby's world change is heartwarming and gives me hope.Being a memoir, I was prepared to cry at the end. His final hours are treated with dignity and love. I am happy to report the book does not end on that sad note. I hope someday I get to meet this dynamic threesome.I was honored to receive this book in exchange for an unbiased review.It now sits on my favorites shelf.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1VTN01YJ3HJ6Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007Q6P5XS#wasThisHelpful","R1VTN01YJ3HJ6Q","A18F9XLJ0UQF0E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A18F9XLJ0UQF0E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I found that these bunion pads slipped on my toes easily, and they are made of extremely soft and flexible material allowing them to fit different sized feet. I had no problems wearing these bunion pads with socks, I simply put the bunion pads on, and then put my socks on, and then put on my shoes.  I also appreciate the way these bunion pads are designed. They are soft against the skin, they do not rub, they do not move under my socks, and they do not have any kind of adhesive. Another thing that I liked is that each bunion protector will go on either foot, so there is no left or right, just position in the right position, and you are ready to go.  It does take some time to get used to, but I find it reasonably comfortable to have them on all through the day. You do need shoes that have a little bit of room to wear them in, get used to the feel of it, and eventually you wont notice the difference. I will certainlycontinue to wear these pads as long as they seem to be helping. I also found that these bunion pads do not absorb odor, and that they were easy to clean in the sink with mild soap and water to dry naturally, and that they do not retain the foot odor once you wash them. Its a well made product and seems durable. I would certainly recommend it.Received for discount/free price to provide my unbiased reviews.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1NMAIFI1YL894/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Y453ACW#wasThisHelpful","R1NMAIFI1YL894","AXZKQL8M69ZHN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AXZKQL8M69ZHN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I came across this product when I was looking for some solution to take care of my problem of big toes beginning to angle slowly. I have been pleasantly surprised to see that these spacers help keep my toe from being pushed inward without any pain.  They provide just enough material to push the big toes to the right and straighten them a bit. The super soft gel material that does not rub or feel uncomfortable at all easily stays in place. It seems a bit wide and awkward, so it does take some time to get used to, but I find it reasonably comfortable to have on all through the day. You do need shoes that have a little bit of room to wear them in, get used to the feel of it, and eventually you wont notice the difference. I will certainly continue to wear it as I dont want to have surgery. The pack comes with 2 deluxe spacers, and they are easily cleaned with a mild soap and water and dry naturally.

"My husband and i have recently started playing tennis few times a week .Since we are beginners i was looking for a racket that's not very expensive but at the same time a good one. Its a challenge to find  one with will cover both the requirements  and i found both of these in this racket. This racket is a great starter racket for the total beginner . I bought it a few weeks back  on Amazon for my husband to play and learn with minimal investment. We use this four times a week and my husband finds this racket a great one to play with.The oversize head size provides you with a larger sweet spot for a more forgiving racket which is  perfect as it is very encouraging for a beginners like us.The racket weighs in at 11.5oz strung (326g). Unstrung that would be around 10.9oz (309g) so it may be a bit heavier but works fine with him as a beginner. It's a very nice balance point.The strings are good and hasnt  broke which was nice given the fact that we are learning and use the rackets really rough.Overall, we are happy with the racket and will  recommend this racket for the beginner like us!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1JAF6MOFMHJ6L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TQKBPTU#wasThisHelpful","R1JAF6MOFMHJ6L","AXZKQL8M69ZHN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AXZKQL8M69ZHN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"First the gas stove:It seems reasonably well built and durable. The piezo igniter is nice and it works. It helps you save time and energy by giving you means to light or relight your stove when needed. The valve is fully adjustable, Im able to adjust from low, medium, and high. You can turn it way down to a low simmer, and it holds there, or turn it way up for high heat as and when you need. The stove is fuel efficient too. It comes with one orange color carrying case and very convenient to carry in your backpack.Now the 2-piece cooking set:This is nice little cooking set for any backpacking trip. The larger bottom pot holds 4 cups while the smaller pan holds 2 cups. These are made of lightweight aluminum alloy and come with a mesh bag that holds the 2 pieces together nicely. The gas stove can be easily accommodated inside the pot and pan when fitted together during storage or travel. This cooking set wash easily, stands on gas stove well, and perfect for any outdoor camping.Overall I find this a nice little cook set with an excellent all-purpose stove that will not let you down. Not only is it perfect for camping, but due to its small size, its portable enough to take anywhere. Plus its very effective too. For the price you cannot beat this product. I highly recommend it.Sample provided for free  for testing and evaluation purposes to provide my unbiased reviews.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1MI76HTJOO80P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014ZGONCK#wasThisHelpful","R1MI76HTJOO80P","AXZKQL8M69ZHN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AXZKQL8M69ZHN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Heavy-duty professional headset for real airplanes.  Noise-cancelling works like a dream in the noisiest of GA aircraft e.g. Cessna 172, 182, etc.  Bluetooth means you can phone the ground on your smartphone AND hear them!  Crazy expensive, but very high quality.  Boom microphone and down-cable can be switched from left ear (default) to right ear by unscrewing 2 phillips screws.  The unit 'plugs in' to the earpiece, simple to swap sides.  Bose support is for five years and it's 5 star support Monday through Friday.  The quality that RW pilots expect and deserve.  Also can work with a PC (for flight sim enthusiasts) with a third party USB to GA converter available from a company in Nova Scotia (about 79 USD street plus ship).  The ""side tone"" feature works well - you can clearly hear yourself.  The noise-cancelling earphones and mic are both head and shoulders above any other headset I've ever tried.  Given the fact that not missing a critical call to or from ATC could save your life - this is a ""must buy"" for anyone flying real aircraft.  Some have said the noise cancelling is 'too good' meaning it kills all the racket from the engine - so if the engine is mis-firing or other sounds are present indicating problems in the plane, you might not hear them.  To that I say - I'll take that over the annoying DIN of a roaring aircraft engine 4 feet away from me in a small GA aircraft.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RK5PZKG6EM7E9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003WKB810#wasThisHelpful","RK5PZKG6EM7E9","A1WJ3P43SZUNDM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1WJ3P43SZUNDM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I had high hopes for this item, as a good carry-on that might be fully-compliant with International airlines' carry-on measurements.  Truth is, it leaves something to be desired from several perspectives.  #1, it's noticeably HEAVY.  For a 'carry on' bag, this bag seems to be at the heavy end of the spectrum.  I disliked its heft when I removed it from the shipping box.  The handles on top and at the side are fixed position, and don't flatten out when placed in an overhead bin.  The 'alligator jaw' opening is awkward to load clothing into, and non-intuitive.  The zippers, which ""look"" robust, snagged and were difficult to open/close right out of the box.  The wheels are uni-directional (not spinner).  This puts a load on your shoulder/arm when you are lugging it behind you.  Spinner luggage is easily pushed with the handle, thus unloading your body and arm.  Although this bag seemed to meet size restrictions better than some other brands, its design characteristics led me to return it.","2.0 out of 5 stars","July 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RCWHQ8338I1JN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GKC5CN2#wasThisHelpful","RCWHQ8338I1JN","A1WJ3P43SZUNDM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1WJ3P43SZUNDM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Extremely high-quality golf ball, and the softest ball I've ever played.  Ideal during cold weather, clicks off your putter softly and reduces hooks/slices.  If you're a 'senior' golfer, this is DEFINITELY a ball worth buying.  We older gents cannot generate the swing speed of our younger brethren.  Thus if we buy the typical ""PRO-V"" ball which is HIGH COMPRESSION, we cannot hit it very far, because the ball doesn't compress enough upon compact to then leap off the club face.

Note to Microsoft Flight Simulator X pilots:  Sadly, FSX is NOT optimized for today's high-end graphics card.  IMHO, this card won't do a whole lot for you.  X-Plane 10?  Exact opposite.

"Small enough to fit into 'off-the-shelf' happy meals (example: DELL XPS 8500), this powerhouse will do what you want at a reasonable price point, and drive those speedy (but power-hungry) upper-end video cards!  Semi modular design means install time is greatly reduced, and no worries trying to re-invent the wheel in terms of cable routing!  Only major trick is newer mobos only have 4 power pins for the CPU, whereas older machines have 8.  You have to pay attention to plugging in the big 8pin connector onto your 4-pin motherboard header.  This WORKS and is actually BY DESIGN.  I discovered how to do it by Googling.  There is NO 4-pin connector 'per se' furnished with the 'modular' cables.  Those are 2 6-pin/8pin PCIe cables for video cards  (each cable has 2 8pin plugs, so you would only use BOTH if you had DUAL video cards installed)Could be better:  The modular cables are not sleeved.  No big deal.  Sleeving is more for looks than for robust performance.Whisper-quiet - and reliable.  Like all Corsair power supplies.

I am linking up to my YouTube video made with these video cards.I was reluctant to purchase these cards, feeling I might have been going too cheap.  But I love the cards, and they FIT inside today's smaller case Big-Box retailer PCs by companies like HP, Dell, Lenovo.  Even with the dinky standard power supply, this card runs cool and QUIET.  You CANNOT hear it!Frames were dazzling.  I kicked X-Plane up to near MAX with HDR rendering and very high anti-aliasing settings (watch my video).  NEVER EVER looked so good!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 7, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R20HOP1KXRA77Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009K1PY4W#wasThisHelpful","R20HOP1KXRA77Y","A1WJ3P43SZUNDM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1WJ3P43SZUNDM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Bought this when my old Logitech Harmony 1000 Universal Remote died after years of heavy abuse, including greasy fingerprints, cleaning with Windex, and more!  This unit is simple to set up and program, and replaces a basket full of remotes, including the remotes for the Tivo, Sony Blu-Ray, Panasonic TV, Pioneer A/V audio, subwoofer and Bose Surround, Roku Internet Radio, and JVC A/V switch.  Needless to say, pressing just ONE button on this unit beats running around the house chasing all those other remotes and pressing buttons on EACH of them to turn the devices on/off, change channels, etc.Logitech apparently has abandoned this nice-sized unit in favor of smaller units that cost the same or more.  My advice is to buy this NOW, while you can.  It's a great device!  It can learn signals from your existing remotes, I only had to do that with the JVC A/V switch, everything else just enter the device name and model number.Runs off an Internet website, so it's a no-brainer to set up and then send the programming to the unit while it's plugged into your PC.Must own!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 1, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Y1GB42D4KJ0G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001M5U5AC#wasThisHelpful","R1Y1GB42D4KJ0G","A1WJ3P43SZUNDM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1WJ3P43SZUNDM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Completely satisfied with these - have ordered and re-ordered them from Amazon.  I use them to make backup copies of some of my 'lesser' blu-ray disks.  These are single layer (25GB max) disks, which are not large enough to fully back-up a complex blu-ray with a lot of 'bonus features' on it.  Those generally are double-layer (50GB) disks, which I also buy from Amazon and have reviewed as well.  But if you have a pretty simple movie without a lot of extras, this is a great way to cover yourself against the kids scratching it or jamming it in the blu-ray player and damaging the recording surface.  Like any blu-ray disk, you must handle these carefully, don't touch the shiny side, and buy some kind of cover for them (plastic cases are best, but paper sleeves will do as well).","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 4, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R11AJLD0DA509K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003E8C7BA#wasThisHelpful","R11AJLD0DA509K","A1WJ3P43SZUNDM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1WJ3P43SZUNDM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Like many bachelors, I dislike sewing on buttons, and due to machine washing and heat from the dryer and the steam iron - over time buttons pop off.  I have searched long and hard for a quick down-and-dirty way to 'rivet' a button back onto a shirt in lieu of sewing.  So I opted to purchase this item.  Sad to say, the reality did not live up to the concept.  One look at the construction of the device told me what other reviewers have already said:  This device is not ready for prime time.  It uses the plastic ""T"" fasteners you see in retail stores holding price tags on your garments with those little nylon strings through the label.  You cut one end off when you get home to remove the price tag.  Great for pricing clothes, not so much for attaching buttons.  At the time I bought the device, I also ordered a pack of these refills.  Both items went back to Amazon refund desk.","1.0 out of 5 stars","July 4, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R11J8PYCSK0HXQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000YZCUNQ#wasThisHelpful","R11J8PYCSK0HXQ","A1WJ3P43SZUNDM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1WJ3P43SZUNDM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 2:07 MinsI have long trusted Logitech brand for all of my peripheral needs, they make excellent wireless keyboards/mice, and a nifty game pad (The G13).  Their speakers with powered subwoofer are legendary, so when it came time to buy a USB headset, I jumped on this one- and you can listen for yourself and decide if it's all that and a bag of chips!  I think the answer is YES.  The microphone rivals the quality of any high-end desktop microphone I've ever used, and the earpieces and headband are reasonably comfortable and produce crystal-clear professional audio, which is ideal for when you're piloting a heavy jet with a lot of interior noise in the cockpit. I use this headset exclusively to produce my YouTube videos, a copy of which is attached in lowered definition to meet Amazon video file size limits.The one suggestion I have for this is to build your own windscreen to cut out the 'popping' of your voice with hard consonants, such as ""K"" or ""P"", etc.  I took a piece of soft shipping foam used to pack hard disk drives for shipment, and cut a rectangle which I slipped over the microphone.  Works perfectly - no voice 'pops' (see video).  I have a large head, and this headset is comfortable, and the earphones cover my ears and are padded, I can wear them for 1 and 2 hour flights without problems.  Build quality is great for this price level.  Beat my expectations, and I'm betting will easily meet yours too.You can silence the microphone by pressing in on the right earpiece, press once more to turn the mic back on.  This unit has been in heavy use for nearly two years now, and I could not be more satisfied.  I like it so well I have recommended to many other simulation pilots, I would endorse it for other game-play as well.  For the modest price, you will NOT be unhappy with this purchase!  You hear my voice as the pilot talking to Air Traffic Control on my way from San Diego to Las Vegas.Besides games, I think this unit is stellar for other voice applications that require high-quality rendition (Skype, Recording Training Videos, etc)","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 4, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2W6J64B90YHF4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003NREDG4#wasThisHelpful","R2W6J64B90YHF4","A1WJ3P43SZUNDM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1WJ3P43SZUNDM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The plugs are designed to accommodate a wide range of cell phone or mp3 cases which oft-times have the earphone jack too deeply recessed which in turn makes a problem connecting a jack like this.The quality of this cable is high.

Cheapy blu-ray blanks can result in cheapy drink coasters!  I buy disks from Amazon that come from Japan.  They work well and are by and large reliable.Blu-Ray disks are more sensitive to scratches and fingerprints than their DVD cousins - this is particularly true of 'double layer' or double-density blu-ray disks.

"This bark collar is perfect for anyone who has a dog that just constantly barks. When anyone knocks on my door or ring doorbell when the mailman comes to drop off package at my door since their inbox so having us by color has definitely had her stop barking the way she was and I am hoping that eventually I can just leave the color off of her and she will know OK don't bark. I understand some people think this is cool but to be honest I tried on myself and my husband before I put it on my dog if it hurts me I don't want it on her so I find a level that doesn't hurt me and I keep it on that level for my dog. OK now some people might think ""OK but what if your dog can't take pain like you can"" well my dog is an APBT and any time she has hurt herself outside or had an ear infection, or anything like that she has never really shown it just like any typical APBT. Also this doesn't really hurt it's just like a static shock, so it's more annoying than anything. This collar comes with two size pronged for short or long haired dogs to reach the dogs skin. I use the small ones on my pitty and she has done fine. My dog does not act nervous or scared when I put this collar on her at all. It also is rechargeable so no batteries, yay! No batteries means money saved! The collar is really long so it's definitely sure to fit any sized dog, if it's too long you can cut some of the end off so it does not hang. I would definitely recommend this collar it's great quality one.

"This shower head is a great pick if you like options! It not only has option for the traditional rainfall water put out, a jet stream, and mist option, but it also is has an extended hose which makes bath time with my dogs much easier.

The shower head is 6.425 inches in diameter do it's s pretty decent size. This also comes with plumbers tape if needed for the shower pipe to prevent leaking.

"Not only is this grinder beautifully made, but it's well made and works great! This grinder has allowed me to grind up herbs so I can make my very own homemade teabags from herb leaves. I can also well as grind up herbs for making seasonings from my herb garden. This has brought my home-start-from-scratch cooking to a whole new level. I no longer need to buy crushed herbs in a bottle (which never taste as good as fresh herbs) or sit with a mortar and pestle to crush up herbs (that is tedious work and takes FOREVER). This saves me time, energy, and money! The grinders do not hit or get stick while grinding. It has an extremely strong magnet that holds the grinder together so nothing falls out as you grind. In fact the magnet is so strong at first I thought it was a screw top! It has 3 compartments, the top where the herbs go to crush them, the middle where the crushed herbs fall, and the last is where tiny crumbs fall. It's easy to get all of the ground herb out of this grinder and easy to clean it. This is definitely a grinder I would recommend if you're looking for a new one or your first one.

"These wired headphones are pretty cool they have amazing Chris clear sound and because they're wired I don't have to worry about any kind of interruption that I would have dealt with with Bluetooth headphones like lost connection or not connecting at all.

"I really really like this brush set. They work extremely well and I really like that it actually comes with, well kind of a manual, and it tells you what each brush is for as most sets don't come with one so someone who is just starting to use make up brushes is not going to know what brush to use for what although if they just use whatever they think is the right brush their makeup could come out great but their make up could come out a lot better if they know which brushes to actually use for each different saying whether they are putting on foundation, blending make up, putting on blush, applying cream or liquid foundation, applying eyeshadow, concealer, primer, this will help them know what to use for what kind of make up. This set has a Flat angled kabuki brush, flat kabuki brush, angled kabuki brush, tapered kabuki brush, round kabuki brush, Precision flat angled brush, a Precision flat brush, Precision angled brush, Precision tapered brush, Precision round brush and a black blender sponge. This set will help you get your makeup on perfectly every time. They are extremely well-made and every single brush is a very soft and smooth although very sturdy. Quality of make up brushes is huge because one if it's not a good quality they're not gonna last long and two is there not a good quality make up will probably look like crap. None of the bristles of these brushes come out or bend out of place, this should be a very long lasting set. I am extremely satisfied with how well each brush performs and does it's job. I believe this make up brush set is a great set for any beginner or someone who is an expert at using makeup brushes. I also believe that this set would be great for someone going to school to become a make up artist as it is has the little manual so you won't get confused and the brushes are amazing.

Not only is it great to have three different oil diffuser so I don't have to constantly clean one when I want to change the different oils is that because there's three of them which are pink, white, and black, I can change the look of the oil diffuser necklace with that little touch of color. cleaning these are easy I usually put alcohol in a jar enough to submerge it and put the top on it for a good hour or so, then take it out, hold it with tweezers and run it under hot water for about a minute or two.

These containers are the perfect size to bring home enough foods in each for my small family of four. I can also use them for sandwiches for my husband to bring to work with a side of chips. The best part about these containers is the lid is raised and not flat giving more room. I know that when I make his lunch nothing will get squished. I can even fit a few cupcakes, cake pieces, or pie in each without worrying a out the icing squishing on the top if I want to bring some home or take some somewhere in these containers. These are easy to clean with soap and water and have not melted when use them in the microwave. I have never had containers that say they are freezer safe and actually work in the freezer without cracking or becoming ruined these are great so when I make extra chili,  soup, homemade sofrito, or anything else I can put it in these containers and put them in the freezer for a later date. These are absolutely 100% my very own honest opinions after having received and tried this product for evaluation and inspection purposes for free in exchange for an unbiased and honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1U81A89N5Y36Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013WBBJF8#wasThisHelpful","R1U81A89N5Y36Z","A3TTMEDVM82DQC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3TTMEDVM82DQC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This doggy jacket is absolutely adorable, I received it in size 6X and it fits my dog perfectly. This is great for her to wear when I have to take her out to go to the bathroom and it's raining or if we go outside to walk and drizzling a little bit. Wasn't sure how my dog was going to like it as this is the first time she's ever had a raincoat and she has been quite picky about what kind of doggie clothes she will leave on. I was very surprised when she didn't immediately try to tear it off, so that being said I can only assume she felt comfortable in it. My dog gets ear infections quite easily so having a hood in this doggie coat is great so her ears are covered and won't get wet, preventing ear infections.  I chose blue because I liked it the best. Another thing that is great about this jacket is that it has a hole in the back where the leash comes out of and has a flap that goes over it so that way the water doesn't trickle in and get All over my dog so it still keeps her dry. Also has reflective stripes on it so even if it's not raining if you put this on your dog and your walking around at night people will be able to see her if they are driving past as the lights will reflect off of the reflector strips. These are absolutely 100% my very own honest opinions after having received and tried this product for evaluation and inspection purposes for free in exchange for an unbiased and honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R11LOTZSIGZZFW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015SR5N88#wasThisHelpful","R11LOTZSIGZZFW","A3TTMEDVM82DQC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3TTMEDVM82DQC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This workout top is comfortable and cute it's kind of a shorter kind of top around the stomach it's not a crop top but it is shorter than regular workout top which is fine I love how it fits that shows a little skin but not a lot there's no shelf bra for support but I have not had a problem with my breast flying all over the place while wearing this top. I also really like the fact that the stripes on the side are reflective so this is a fantastic top to wear if you're going to be walking or jogging around your neighborhood or on a main road.  I also have the matching shorts which are on a different listing that have the same thing and it makes a fantastic outfit to wear and I absolutely love it. This top is soft and stretchy but it Has great elasticity so that it is not stretched out when you put it on and take it off. I got a medium size top I am 106 pounds 5'3"" tall and I have 36C breast and the medium fits perfectly. This top is great to wear to be comfortable while working out. This top is not only great for working out but it's great to lounge around in because of just how soft and comfy it is. I would definitely record this if you are looking for a top that has great coverage, looks great, and feels comfortable.

This is a dress that can be used for almost every occasion, a formal event, out on the town, date night with your significant other, at the club, a meeting, like I said with the zippers it is very versatile and can look different for whatever the occasion.

"I really like using these wraps, they stick well to my stomach And don't move but to make sure they don't rub against my shirt, other clothing, or my blankets if I wear it to sleep, I wrap myself with one of those ab wraps (I don't really like going to sleep with saran wrap around my stomach which a lot of people do that I don't), nothing special, no neoprene, just a regular wrap to keep it in place is so it does not come off or stick to anythin. You can definitely feel it at first, it's a Little slight tingle but not so much that it's all you're thinking about and that goes away after about 10 minutes. I'll leave it on for the full eight hours to make sure I get what's worth out of it. I also like the fact that unlike pretty much every other rap I've ever tried this one doesn't make your stomach feel extremely cold so it doesn't feel like anything is on there aside from the slight tingle at first. You trap has its own backing she don't have to worry about anything being wasted because each one has its own thing and each wrap can only be used once I suggest when you put them on your stomach that you peel off the center backing first and stick that on your stomach and then do the side I recommend this because it's kind of hard to get it to stick if you continuously pull it off to get it in the right spot but if you put the centerpiece in first use it to make it easier to get everything else aligned correctly. I have not had any kind of skinny irritation or allergic reaction from using this. I like using me before I'm going somewhere special or before a photo shoot to tighten everything up on my stomach region. Is no special disposal I can go straight in the trash when you're done using it which is fantastic.  I also love that this is an all natural body wrap. I also recommend that when you use this rash or any rap that you drink lots and lots of water I try to drink half of my body weight in ounces a day, so I am 107lbs so I try to drink around 53.5 fl oz of water a day. I also try so stay away from anything fattening while using these as that would defeat the purpose of these wraps.

"This truck is pretty cool it has a weight to it so when you push it across the ground the wheels keep spinning like there's gears in there and keep it moving for a little while almost, it's a friction vehicle, it's like a pullback car but not a pullback car. My four-year-old and eight-year-old both love the truck. It's got a little handle on the side that you pull forward and the back goes up so whatever's in it can dump out so your kids can use it for pretend and act like they're on a construction site dumping stuff out and taking stuff away. My sons have sat for a good deal of time using this with all of their construction toys pretending. It is definitely a great choice for a Christmas, birthday, or a  gift  for any other special occasion for any child a boy or girl that likes to play with trucks. It's a great toy to encourage their imagination. This truck is extremely well-made and sturdy which is great because my boys are pretty rough with their toys.

"I was really excited to try the shower head that it has a rainfall and kind of like a waterfall type of sprayer and you can use the sprayer as well as the waterfall at the same time and it also comes with an extra attachment which is great because I have two dogs besides wanting to wash my own hair in the tub and it being easier with a shower head with a hose I wash my dogs in the bath so this makes life so much easier than have to fill water in a cup over and over again to pour on them to get them wet and to rinse them off. I have a 60lb pitbull and 40lb pitbull puppy so it's not like I can put them in the sink! The hose is a great length I am able to pull it almost all the way across my bathtub but and it reaches them wherever they are so I can spray down my puppies while they're getting their bath without a problem. Having the option to use the traditional shower spray versus the waterfall jetstream is awesome I like having those options depending on how I'm feeling with how I want my water to feel when it hits me.  I also like the fact that I can use both the hose attachment as well as the main shower head at the same time that's fantastic. So not only do you have two options on how the water comes out on both heads you have the option to use just the hose attachment, just the main shower head, or use both at the same time. I would definitely recommend this if you and your partner like to have a couple options or if you have animals or if you wash your hair in the tub on days that you're not hopping in the shower completely it makes it so much easier with the host hatchment no hair going down the drain are getting stuck in the drain while your bent over a sink now you can do in the tub not be right on top of the drain.

"These yoga pant bottoms are in a size medium they were a little big on me but fit my friends daughter perfectly! They have a line down each side that is camo and the rest of the pant is black. These are a great pair of pants for any type of workout, jogging, walking, or even just to wear them because they are comfortable! The fabric is soft and the material stretches with your body and does not stay stretched when you take them off so they do not become deformed or stay stretched out as the elasticity in them is amazing. She wore them all outside running around and walking and they did not fall down or rise up they stayed right in place and she loves them. She  has not had a problem with washing them in the washer or drying them in the dryer. I am 5'3"" 106 pounds and like I said the mediums were a little big on me I have other bottoms from Musotica in a small and they fit me perfectly so if you are around my size I would definitely suggest getting a small bottom.

"These workout shorts are comfortable, sexy, and are great for any workout routine. I got them in a size small and they fit great, not too tight, not too loose, but just right.  These are also extremely comfortable to lounge around and I also have the matching top making it an amazingly cute and comfortable outfit for working out or just hanging out outside during the summer. These are great to wear while running or walking. I got them in a size small I am 5'3"" tall 106 pounds and they fit perfectly. I have not had a problem with these falling down were rising up and Well giving me a wedgy, no one likes those.  The belt is a cute touch which is removable. The stitching is perfect there's not a stitch out of line everything is straight nothing is overlapped, loose, or missing.

"I have never had a sleeve before so this was a first and to be honest I was a little nervous to try this thing out. I mean look at it. The top looks like it might hurt but when you get it and actually hold it in your hand and see how it feels, it's really soft and flexible. It's a silicone material and it looks just like the picture. Is the front piece that sticks out on the head is great for our stimulation and the nubs around the entire thing are also great for massaging inside and give pleasure. It's easy to clean it simply take it off your significant other when you're finished and I clean it with mild soap and hot water. It's easy to get on and off as you can see in the pictures below I used a toy to demonstrate on for obvious reasons.  When you put it on you can roll it up and then roll it down just like a condom as well as taking it off that way. It stays in place while it's on the penis and does not come off while in motion. Has been says it's pretty comfortable for being what it is he wasn't sure how it was going to feel as it so much thicker than a condom. Also you do not have to use the sleeve on a live person you can use it on your toy just like I showed in the pictures below and it still works fine.  I also like that I can use water based lubricants with it if I want to or need to. Definitely a great item to add to my collection of bedtime fun stuff as my husband and I love to keep things interesting and fun. So if you are like us and looking to keep things alive and well in the bedroom I would definitely recommend trying this out.

"The cute little beach set and I love that the helicopter doubles as a watering can and as my four-year-old son loves to help me water my plants outside so this is a perfect little piece for him to use and be able to help me while playing with his toys. So not only can he water plants he can pretend to fly his helicopter. It also comes with A couple shovels, a rake, and a sifter and usually the sisters are just one big round thing that you hold but I like that this one has a handle on it which makes it easier for smaller children to use they can just put it into the ground and dig up sand instead of have to dump sand onto it with a shovel or other object. Each item is very lightly so it's easy for my little ones to carry. Its very sturdy which is great because my boys are rough with toys and these ones I have not had a problem with breaking. This is a great set to buy kids for the upcoming summer, have a sand box, if you're going on vacation, or live in a place that's always warm and sunny. Great for any child with a summer birthday to get them as a gift or for a child having a pool party for heir winter birthday. The copter needs to be assembled but it's really easy everything just kind of snapped in place and the front piece comes off so you can easily fill it up with water that way or you could fill it up through the top and I also like that the front piece comes off because you know children sometimes a stick things in there where if they for sand in there you can easily open it up and has a bigger hole for you to wash it out.

"This 10 piece set of bath toys is a great addition to bathtime for any small child my four-year-old loves to play with these their little squirt guns so Not only can they be used in the tub they can be used in the pool.  They float not sink, they're easy to squeeze which is great for little hands as they are made of a hard rubber material but not so hard that it's hard for them to squeeze on their own. There are nine squirter's and one squeaky toy, I don't recommend putting the squeaky toy into the bathtub only because when it fills up with water it's really really tough to get the water out of it and it won't squeak anymore so that one I let my son play with outside of the tub. There are three different cars, a helicopter, airplane, a train as well as three boats, and the submarine which the submarine is the squeaky toy.  They are big enough that they are not a choking hazard which is fantastic and if you have a child that loves bath time as much as mine then these are the perfect gift for the birthday, Christmas, or just because.

"This dry shampoo spray is fantastic I've never use the dry shampoo before so I was kind of worried about how it would actually work with my hair would feel greasy, sticky, feel nasty, if it would be hard to brush after using it, how it would smell etc. Likely when I tried it though it smells alright it has left my hair feeling nice.  My hair is not left greasy or sticky feeling I like being able to use this when I don't have time to wash my hair in the morning or if something comes up and I have to run right out the door I can spray this in my hair to look more presentable to be on my way in minutes. What's great about the dry shampoo is it doesn't flatten my hair, my hair still feels very soft, and is not dulled down by the spray. The dry conditioner spray is also fantastic, it has a scent to it that I am not too crazy about but isn't terrible that is not overwhelming and at first it makes my hair look wet and then that's goes away as it is absorbed into my hair and dries. Then my hair is even more silky smooth as well as shiny, not weighed down, my hair keeps a nice amount of volume, and the waves in my hair stay looking nice and not flattened out. I have also use the conditioner when straining my hair on a day where I have not washed my hair and it has come out amazing. Would definitely recommend this if you do not like to wash your hair every day but do you still need a little something so that your hair is manageable.

"This gold rose is absolutely gorgeous it's 24 karat gold for oil and it's just a very stunning peas if you have someone that you love on you conditionally this would be an amazing piece to get them. A lot of women like jewelry and things like that but I like stuff like this, hand crafted beauties, statues, crystals, pieces like this rose, even if it wasn't real gold it would still be a piece I would like as I has said it's a very beautiful piece, being 24 karat gold is a huge bonus and is definitely thinking outside the box as a gift. A lot of men may not want to get their women flowers because they say they're pointless because they die which my husband says that to me all the time so one year he got me a fake rose so when I was given the chance to receive this was like oh my God it's perfect. Now I plan on getting a nice glass case for this and setting it up and making it my very own ""beauty and the beast"" piece. It comes in a beautiful pink box which has a soft betting inside of a silk covering that the rose lays in where it is secure from breaking and it also comes with a certificate of authenticity.

"This adult sized hoppy ball is unbelievably fun. My adult friends and I have a blast racing on this and another adult sized hoppy ball I have. It's just as pictured with a huge face with a mustache! It comes with an extra pin for keeping the air in it which is fantastic in case the first one breaks. It's simple to blow up and if you have a mattress pump I would suggest using that over the manual pump as it will take a lot less time! This is a fantastic way to have fun with your kids outside! Not only can you hop pretty high on this but you can double it as an exercise ball if you wanted. I have had no problem bouncing with this on blacktop, hard flooring, grass, or carpet. If this is your first time using one of these I suggest hopping on grass or inside until you get the hang of it to avoid injury on blacktop or concrete. If the ball becomes a little deflated from bouncing a lot simply pull the plug out, pump it back up, plug the plug back in and go. Great gift for any older child like a teenager or gift for an adult that is forcer young!

"These patent leather red heels are absolutely gorgeous. I got them in a size 6 1/2 and they fit just as I expected them to, they fit perfect. I usually wear between a size 6 and 6 1/2 depending on the shoe style and brand so I went with the 6 1/2 to be on the safe side. I love is that it has the strap around my ankle being secured with the hook and gives the illusion that it's actually the traditional buckle because the hook is so much easier and quicker to get off then the buckle and it still looks fabulous. I was extremely surprised at how comfortable they are to wear. My feet have not hurt one bit while wearing these or after taking them off. The straps not the edges have cut in I or chaffed the skin on my feet. These are perfect for any occasion business, party, formal event, or going out on the town. These would also be fabulous if you do pin up or other modeling, they are just sexy! I would definitely recommend these heels for any women's shoe collection!

"My husband and I have been together for almost 6 years we have two children together we have two dogs that like to sleep in our bed and it can be difficult to find time to have fun together. When we are able to get that time we like every time to be interesting, sexy, and different. I own many bodystockings and each one is different although many people may not think they are different each one has a different style, a different look, different texture, there's different colors, although most of mine are black because I just love black,  send every single one is different I have some sleeveless I have some long sleeves I have some shorts leaves this one is three-quarter sleeves and has a very low-cut in the front and is also crotch list which is fantastic I love when the bodystockings I crotch list because I don't have to worry about ripping it to have fun time with my husband and I don't have to take it off to have fun, I can leave it on. It's a one size and it fits me nicely I am 5'3"" 106 pounds 36C bust and although if it's me it's still stretches a little bit. I would definitely recommend this to any one who is trying to spice things up in the bedroom with their significant other. Put this on with a pair of really nice heels like I have in the  picture below and there is no way your significant other will be able to resist you. Obviously as you can see I wore panties and a bra underneath this to cover myself but it gives you an idea of how it looks otherwise.

"This overbust corset is beautiful, sexy and comfortable! My husband loves seeing it on me. Not only is it absolutely gorgeous it makes my figure look even more amazing than usual! You do not feel the steel rods  that hold the shape when wearing it. The ruffles around the edges are a perfect touch of texture and style to this corset. The embroidery design on the corset is absolutely stunning I chose a medium. I am 5'3"", 106 lbs, and 36c bust.I love how it shapes my body and makes my breasts look. I chose white because I like it's elegant look and this would be perfect for any special occasion with a nice white skirt to give the illusion of a dress or with a nice pair of black leggings. Is also a grazed corset to wear if you want to be sexy in a badge and for your significant other.  It is easy to tighten and tie by myself and all the hooks and bobs on the front are aligned correctly and go together easily. If this is your first time with a corset I suggest making the back loose so you had no trouble getting it around your waist, then hook all the hooks and nobs together, after that simply grab hold of both loops in the back  pull, once you have it tightened tie them together into a bow and go. I just can't get over how absolutely gorgeous this corset is. The stitching is flameless and everything is straight and aligned the way it should be. It's definitely made out of quality material I have not had a problem putting it in the wash or dryer although I do out it into a laundry bag for washing. I think that this course that would also make the most gorgeous piece of a wedding dress is elegant sexy tasteful it's just gorgeous.

"I have had many Bluetooth headphones and a lot of them have been uncomfortable fall out of my ears don't sound well or all of the above so I was very excited when I put these on and the sound is unbelievably crisp and clear. They are comfortable and do not hurt my ears. You can also take phone calls while using these headphone and they do an amazing job of blocking out background noise while I speak. Pairing was simple, just turn it on and hold the pairing button UNTIL it flashes red and blue and select it when it pops up into your Bluetooth devices. Once connected you are ready to go! These are great for anyone who likes to listen to music and block out every other noise surrounding you.

"These vacuum bags are perfect to store clothes you aren't using in so you can consolidate them into a small stack rather than having boxes and bags filled and taking up tons of room. I do not have much closet space so having these helps a lot when the weather changes and I store what clothes I won't be wearing for months it takes up a lot less room and can fit under my bed. The big ones are over 3ft wide and long which gives of room to put in comforters or pillows or big items like that, still be able to close the bag and vacuum the air out and be able to put it nicely under my bed without worry of the items getting dirty and dusty.

"After almost 6 years, two children, two dogs and two birds later my husband and I find ways to keep our love alive and well. I mean we plan on being together for the rest of our lives so routine is not an option, Space it routines are boring and if someone is bored they find something else to do and in relationships case find someone else to do neither one of us wants that so to make things interesting, so toys, outfits, role-play, you name it we try it. So when given the chance to try this bodystocking I couldn't say no of course although I have a few other bodystockings everyone is different and could be used for different occasions because they're all different styles. Not only can I wear them on their own but I can wear them underneath my clothes so if we go somewhere it's already on to be taken off later. This is a rather wide fishnet type of body stocking, it's not closely knitted together, and is more of a sexy slutty look. It's sleeveless and also has a hole where your crotch is so if you want to have fun while wearing this you can it's very easy to put on and take off. Extremely stretchy and is one size but it's one-size-fits-all most I am 5'3"" 106 pounds with 36C size bust and it fits me quite nicely. The material does not chafer irritate my skin in anyway when I wash it I put it in a little lingerie bag and put it in the wash.

"This bodystocking is a soft lacey material in white and to me it is a more elegant kind of body stocking. I think this would be an absolutely wonderful item to wear on a honeymoon because of its book and color. It's extremely to put on and take off and it's very stretchy it's one size fits most I am 5'3"" 106 pounds and I have 36C bust and it fits me quite nicely. What's great about this body stocking  is it so something that you can wear it underneath your clothes as it is thin material, so if you want to be sexy as soon as you get home or if you get a little long time wherever you're going you can simply take off your clothes and your bodystocking is already on. This bodystocking is low-cut in the front with a whole around the belly as well as an open crotch area so there's no need to even take this off if you want to have fun with your significant other. If you like a more classy sexy than I believe this is definitely the right one for you. I have been with my husband found the six years now and I'd definitely like to have a variety of things to wear and use in the bedroom to keep things interesting as no one likes the same routine forever, routines get old and let's be honest, that's why people cheat and I don't want that to happen And neither does my husband so this was a great addition to our collection of bedroom fun.

"This necklace is beautiful and has a gorgeous raw pink stone. The stone is a beautiful and powerful accent piece to the moon. I love that it is raw and not cut to perfection, it's a more natural look. The crescent moon design is absolutely stunning. The gold glistens whenever light hits it. This is a piece that I believe would be great with any outfit. It would make an awesome amulet charm for a witch costume or maybe even a princess costume. It is very well made and the chain is sturdy which is a must because I am always around babies and babies love to tug on chains! I have not had a problem with this becoming tarnished or discolored.

"I have never had a shower head where the water comes out like rain fall and actually feel like rainfall like this one. This showerhead is really big and it is definitely just like it says it's a rainfall type of water fall. The attachment with the hose has great water pressure so whether you want to relaxing rainfall on your body while you're taking a shower or if you want pressured shower you can have it by just turning the knob on the side of the showerhead from the main shower head to the attachment and vice versa. The hose is very long so I can get my dogs in the shower and wash them without a problem whether they are on the side of the tub with the shower head or not. The rain fall feeling is very relaxing and soothing. Installation is extremely easy if it rained on my pipe without a problem and I didn't even need to use the tape as it has not leaked at all. Simply screws on interior shower pipe and it's pretty simple to know where each piece goes when you're basing the shower head the knob should be on the left the attachment should be on the right and of course the big showerhead goes in the center. The hose attachment gets screwed into the bottom screw piece and the large shower head screws to the front. Not only can you choose to use the large showerhead or the attachment you can also choose to use them at the same time and this Showerhead also kind of doubles as a mirror which is kind of cool.  So all in all recommend this if you like the feel of rain and do not want a high pressured showerhead although if you live with someone that does like a high-pressure showerhead they can use the attachment which sits right above the showerhead see you can still use it without a problem and it has high pressure.

"This vibrator is great for beginners and anyone wanting to have a quick to the point toy! It has little nubs on it for extra massaging power that feel great on the clitoris. It also has a small insertable shaft for your g spot while your clitoris is stimulated. It takes one AA battery to work which is not included and had you twist the bottom of the shaft to turn it on, off, and open it to get to the battery compartment. Remember this is a small g spot vibrator not a 7 inch vibrator or dildo. It is latex free which is great for those who are allergic to it and I can use my favorite water based lubes with it. Another great thing about this vibrator is it's waterproof! The vibration is pretty strong in the places it needs to be. This is a fun toy to use by yourself or with your significant other, I know my husband and I like to add a little fun to the mix so this is perfect for our ""fun time"".

"This bikini is absolutely gorgeous!!! I love the ruffles that hang down on the top and how well this bikini fits me. The material is soft and this bikini is very well made, the stitching is flawless, there are no missing stitches, no overlapped or loose stitches, and no crooked stitching. The top fits perfectly and so does the bottoms. I have no side boob showing, the strings that tie around my neck, back, and bottoms side ties do not chaff or irritate my skin at all, and the bottoms do not sag. We have season passes to a local water park and I like to think the water slides are a good test for how well bathing suits are made and how well they stay tied together. Well after going down slides several times in this bathing suit I have had no issues what so ever, the top stayed in place and so did the bottoms. I like the color of this bikini and I have gotten many compliments on it. I also really like that when I take this bikini off there are no marks from it left on my skin like some clohes and other bathing suits do.

"I really like these combat boots, I find them to be more like riding boots but that's okay because I love them anyways. I wear them with leggings, skinny jeans, or boot cut jeans, they go fabulous with anything I wear them with. I will definitely be wearing them a lot this fall and winter especially if I go for a motorcycle ride. I got them in a size 6 1/2 and black and they fit perfectly. They are very comfortable and warm. They have cute accent buckles on the outer side and on the inner side they have a zipper which goes from the very bottom to the very top of the boot which makes it so much easie to get in and out of these unlike some boots I have that have like a zipper that is only half the length of the boot.

"I thought I liked other serums that I have tried before the best but this one definitely surpasses those. This serum has a very silky texture, goes on smoothly and evenly. This eye serum also absorbs within a couple minutes so I am not waiting forever to apply makeup. When the serum does absorb into the skin around my eyes, it does not feel like anything is on it, it does not feel dry, or feel like anything is stuck to it. I use this every morning and evening after cleansing my face.  I have noticed my dark circles disappearing as my skin tone is becoming lighter. Other dark spot serums I have tried in the past have either made the skin surrounding my eyes look unbelievably later than the rest of my skin return the skin yellow and this does neither it looks natural and looks great.

"This one-piece bathing suit is absolutely gorgeous, I love the strappy back that it has. I wasn't sure how it was going to look but it looks amazing, it doesn't pinch my skin and make it look like I have a bunch of rolls or deformed it just kind of sits on my skin so you know it's not extremely tight although it is a snug but comfortable fit on me.

"This black gold plated ring is beautiful and stunning. Some people may not like it because it's pretty tall and wide but I absolutely love it. I bought this ring in size 6 and it fits great.  The red stones glisten beautifully when any kind of light hits them it's definitely a piece to make people turn heads. I have gotten many compliments on it. I love the way the red stones look against the black gold. The center stone is very large, each stone on the sides are a decent size, and they it something more than just being a solitaire stone ring. The stones are held very securely by the prongs and do not move at all, I have tried to wiggle them to be sure that they are securely in place and they have not budged. It would make a gorgeous engagement or promise ring for anyone. I would definitely recommend it. The gold playing is not cheap and has yet to come off.

"This selfie stick is Bluetooth enabled and connects right away to my phone. Is great you do not like having to ask people to take pictures of you and friends when you're out somewhere. This is great to take on vacation so you can take pictures of you and your family are you and your friends are a large group of people where ever you are. The battery lasted pretty long time on this before it needs charged again. It i heavy duty but a very light weight.

"I love this neoprene bikini have never had one before and it's definitely a different feeling material than anything I have ever owned. I chose the black and white one because it reminds me of cows and I love cows (weird I know but I love it). The ties that go around my back and neck for the top do not chaff or irritate my skin. The ties on the sides of the bottoms also do not bother my skin and all the ties stay in place and tied tight without becoming loose or undone throughout the day when wearing this bikini. I am able to put this in washer with no problem which is wonderful no special cleaning. I love the little gold accent beads at the ends of the ties to give it a little more color and pop. The stitching on this bikini is absolutely flawless there's no stitches overlapped, loose, or missing anywhere and they are perfectly aligned.

"This sponge set is the ultimate set. And as for unique shaped multi function sponges. You can use them wet or dry which is awesome because some sponges you just can't use wet. Each one will expand to almost twice it's size when wet. The sponges are securely attached to ergonomic wooden handles. Hypoallergenic, latex free, they do not break and crumble easily. Thanks to these sponges my make up game is flawless so far since I started using them I really have not had any streaks or bunched up make up on my face after applying my makeup. My skin doesn't look like I have make up on it at all. I like that the have a pointed side to use for getting into corners and smaller areas on my face such as the corners of my eyes or underneath my nose and my up for above my upper lip that the big sides of the sponges not fit or work on and would ultimately make me miss spots on my face.

"These wide leg pants absolutely fabulous, they are extremely soft, comfortable, and have excellent stretch. I am 5'3"" 106 pounds and I ordered black in size medium and they fit a little big but I expected that, so yes they got as expected as I usually wear small/xsmall. It's a great pair of pants to wear to work if you are in retail, if you are a businesswoman and a nice pair of pants, they're also not a great pair pants to wear on a casual night out. I love how they fit and feel on my body. They are just flattering and fun, I love them. I was very scared that they were going to cling to me, static cling, after washing and drying them but fortunately that is not the case they do not stick to my legs and they feel wonderful.

"To start off I would like to say that I am 5'3"" tall and I weigh 105lbs and I have these yoga capris in a small and they got like a glove, now that can give you an idea on what to order for your size, also I am usually a small in most bottoms so I would say they for as expected. The quality of the material of these yoga capris is beyond anything I expected.  It is extremely soft, smooth, doesn't leave those annoying marks from the seams on your skin after wearing them, and is so so comfortable I could live in them! The stitching is absolutely flawless there's no overlapped stitching, there's no loose stitches, nothing is snagged or torn anywhere, no crooked seams, no out of whack of stitches, everything is perfect. Now you may not think about it but I definitely do, another great thing about this pair of yoga capris is that it doesn't fit so tight in the private region that you get camel toe or anything like that. You can wash them in the washer, cold wash and low heat/delicate in the dryer. It is just as pictured, baby pink and white gold over top. Whether you want to wear these for your yoga sessions and working out or if you want to just wear them around the house to flaunt your assets in front of your significant other, these are perfect! I have the matching yoga top which is fabulous and I love that they are separate so I can pick the size I need! I would highly recommend this pair of yoga capris to anyone.

"This dildo is definitely a realistic feeling one.  I wasn't sure how I was going to like it since it's just a dildo and not a vibrator but this is definitely one of my favorite toys so far. It's about 7.2 inches and the testicles also feel real and are squeezable. I love that there's a suction cup on the bottom so I can put it on my headboard, on the shower wall, even my bedroom wall and have fun by myself or my husband can hold it and use it on me himself. It has life like veins, ribs, and everything in between on this dildo. It's also about 1 1/2 inches thick.  Because of the way it's designed to be extremely flexible and you can almost bend it in half it moves with your body's natural design inside  just like a real penis would and it just hits the right spots and feels great. If you are looking for a toy that is extremely realistic and feels amazing this is definitely the toy for you. This dildo is not so big that you can't enjoy it it's also not so small that you can't feel it I believe it is just the right size.

"I have owned many different flat irons of all different shapes sizes and brands and I must say so far this is the best and I absolutely love this hair straightener I cannot believe how amazingly well it works! I also recently dyed my hair and it has not stripped the dye from my hair. Below you can see a fore and after picture of my hair waves and straightened before and after I dyed my hair. All the buttons are on the inside of the street you would have never had before but I like it because I don't accidentally hit the buttons when I'm using the straightener. I also like that it comes with a heat resistant glove which is great because I've burned my fingers so many times when moving my hair using the straightener in this prevents that and it doesn't give my hair static frizz  while using it. It also comes with a very beautiful red bag for your straightener to go in. You can also curl your hair using this flat iron is the outside and inside both get pretty hot but right now I use it for straightening my hair only. This straightener also came with a sample of their argon oil which is fantastic and unlike most argon oils it smells amazing. The heat setting goes up to 450F and the LED screen turns green when your heat setting of give is ready, it will be blue when it's still heating and red when it's off. This flat iron is well worth the price and I am extremely lucky I was able to try it out. My hair is extremely smooth and shiny after using it which I was worried I hair would be full or damaged looking but it hasn't and I absolutely love this flat iron/straightener. I would highly recommend this product to anyone as it has been the best flat iron I have owned so far.

"I have never had a power inverter before but I am so glad I was given the chance to try one. This thing is fantastic. I love having this for when we go camping or on long cat rides because there are just something's you can't charge with a USB charger. It's great for a laptop needing charge cause your watching a movie or a tablet or other device that didn't come with a USB charger and you don't wanna buy one cause they are too expensive, this is great to have for everything. If your on a camp ground in an rv, hooked up to the campgrounds electric, and have a mini fridge or freezer you brought you can plug this into the cigarette lighter and plug that bad boy right in. Never worry about car chargers again if you lose one or have anything that needs one. It'll even work if your on a long trip (like from Jersey to Cali) and you want to be able to cook your own food instead of eating out you can buy what you wanna cool, plug in a portable grill or griddle, and cook!

"You remember that late-night sidewalk convo in The 'Burbs, or the ever camp but somehow compelling interchanges between the three male leads or that creep-out moment with Henry Gibson and his red paint? The mood, somehow silly but somehow serious and ever so very much fun to watch, was one I'd never seen before on film (as I was a child when that film was released). Well, in viewing this, wacked-out, crazy lightning strike of a film, one Space Milkshake, I found myself coming back to those moments, in feeling and mood and in the childish giggles I heard coming out of my mouth, as I stared in amazement at a perfect comedy unfolding before me.Comedy is remarkably personal. It never has the universal resonance we find in action or your standard super-hero films because comedy strikes us all in such different ways. What one person finds hilarious, another will find horribly grating or annoying, which is why I nearly never read reviews of comedy films. Nothing in cinema is so divisive. And so, all I can tell you that will be of any actual help is that this film, in many ways, reminds me of The 'Burbs and in many ways reminds me of Grabbers (another of my five star favorites) in tone and in feeling. In going further, it manages to evoke all the joy of watching the endlessly fun Futurama and Hyperdrive while simultaneously feeling very serious in that ""this is really happening"" kind of way. Like Red Dwarf in that it is a space farce but also not because it contains so much of that Stargate-like sense of genuine danger and excitement. Basically, it is the funniest thing I've ever seen, which is meaningless to anyone other than me, but if you loved any of these programs/films, you will most likely enjoy this film, if not adore it. If you disliked or hated any of these, you will most likely dislike or hate this.I loved it so much that, after watching five times free through Prime, I shelled out the eight bucks and bought the thing, just so these people will get paid. If you do watch this outrageous and lovable comedy, I hope you love it as much as I do, but if you don't, I hope you find another that makes you feel as happy as this film makes me feel every time I watch it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2O1M6DR992K55/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00S65UJUW#wasThisHelpful","R2O1M6DR992K55","A2K3ZJWLF0V4K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2K3ZJWLF0V4K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Warning: Not so much outright spoilers as hints here so don't read if you haven't seen this season.To put this plainly, this is the season of male writer/showrunners expressing unexplained hatred against women through a once well-loved television program. The bizarre personality swapping of the lead females on this show resulted in a character who, among other things, is the show's only resident rapist becoming one of the team and the beloved of our hero becoming a horrible and violent person, as though good people just become horrible when you add a little power and personal difficulty and rapists just become good when motivated to do so. I get that it's a fantasy program but it is supposed to take place on the same planet we all live on.This once wonderful, well integrated series, has degenerated into yet another ""women just suck"" diatribe against love, trust and marriage with a strong focus on the following basic story-line:  when you give a woman power, she becomes a monster and the only way to deal with her is to stick a gun in her face, threaten her life and see how much angrier it makes her (answer: very and understandably so) but, in the alternate, when you take a woman's power away, she becomes a nicer, more subservient person, obedient even. This new anti-female season-long story arc culminated in the most horrible of all ""spousal abuse is good"" statements when the lead male character turned to his gang of friends and instructed them to kill his ex the next time they see her, as he had failed to do so the last time he'd put a gun in her face. Not surprisingly, every character was on board with this ""how to permanently end a failed relationship"" solution. And the story played out, as it has in so many courtrooms across America, the man no longer loved the woman so, naturally, he had her killed, only this time, the writers of the story cast the murderous man as a hero, making every woman in my circle swear off this show and any future shows written by Greenwalt and his band of misogynists.So, basically, if you are a man, a fan of radio shock jocks that hate women, a fan of Chris D'Elia style, hating everything about women except the actual sex part ""comedy"", then Season Four of Grimm will probably appeal to you as a vicarious experience of allowable violence against women. If you are a woman who loves women, your friends, your family, your co-workers, and you happen to find women wonderful in most ways (as I do), then this will most likely leave you feeling a bit sick and somewhat depressed.As for me, I used to love this series and the Nick and Juliette story was enjoyable to me, in large part, because it echoed reality in a way that fantasy shows often forget to, by showing a relationship between two adults for what it is in reality. This turn of events has left this show feeling completely unreal and, if I can't suspend my disbelief, there is no point in watching.As always, this review is only meant to inform, not to hurt the feelings of any super fans (of which I used to be one) and I ask that you please not take my disgust at the meta-communication of this season personally. Good luck in making your choice to view or not to view this horrid shift toward misogynistic storytelling from a previously woman-friendly program.","1.0 out of 5 stars","May 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZKE0PFX7Q3WN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NJ4TJZ6#wasThisHelpful","RZKE0PFX7Q3WN","A2K3ZJWLF0V4K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2K3ZJWLF0V4K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Firs off, I loved the books and the first series, for what they were. This is not a review of Poldark the story or the other adaptations. This is a review of this series based on one critical error: FALSE ADVERTISING. The advertising on PBS (in the US, not the BBC One commercials, as I am in America), has portrayed this series as something entirely different from what came before, a new take on the story with a clear focus on the romantic elements (which are not the crux of the Ross Poldark section of the books nor the first series). However, that is not what this series is about and represents a clear attempt to manipulate viewers into thinking that this series is something more akin to Outlander and the like and less akin to the endless ""business"" focused series currently airing on Masterpiece. I'm sorry to say that it is this dishonesty that ruined this series for me as I viewed my copy expecting to see something new and different, taking the Poldark books as a jumping off point for a story focusing less on money and more on romance, a modern telling if you will. I figured, if you aren't going crazy with the telling of Poldark the rapist then, of course, you can change other story elements. Unfortunately, this is still a money-centered tale and the romantic element is significantly downplayed, as compared to what is promised in the commercials they are currently running.So, for anyone who doesn't know, as to what Poldark is, originally. Poldark is a sweeping epic encompassing the lives of too many characters to mention and their descendants. Business, finance, plague, love, hatred, competition, and so on, provide the emotional backbone. There is a decent wiki article which covers this so I won't bore you except to say that, if you love complex epics, the books are superb. However, this series is the story of a man's quest for wealth and the similar quests for wealth of many people around him, to put it plainly. There are many characters in this story, from the books of course, but, much like the other ""wealth"" and ""business"" concerned programs on Masterpiece today, including The Paradise and Selfridges, money and business, the trials and tribulations of gaining wealth, keeping a business going, keeping from going under, and the like, are the primary concerns, not romance. Secondary concerns of romance, changing affections and one man's long term obsession with a woman he doesn't get (except by force) are also important but not as important as the money aspect (at least in the unedited version I saw from BBC One). I should note that, thankfully, the hair-pulling, rapist elements of the books have been left out to make way for a more sympathetic lead male and, for the record, I greatly appreciate that, as there can be no romance at all if a man is engaging is such horrific abuse of women. However, these kindnesses do not make up for such a focus on the business element at the expense of the lead relationship, in terms of screen time and development.Now, this is not a bad series, overall. If you like stories that revolve around business, finance, competition, a region and all the businessmen in that region and their competitions over money and women, debt collection, trying to pull each other under, and so on, you will love this, as it has plenty of that going on. However, this was advertised as being DIFFERENT from the original series (1975 and 1977, which was wonderful as an adaptation of a portion of the book series and quite enjoyable, even if you haven't read this fantastic series) but this is NOT DIFFERENT. Is there romance? Of course. You can't have Poldark without the romantic entanglements of the lead men and women. But this was marketed as focusing more on or, rather, playing up the romance between Ross Poldark and Demelza, focusing more on them, in fact almost exclusively, with other story considerations playing out in the background, and comparisons have been made to Outlander (for no reason I can fathom) and this is simply just not the case. The whole landscape of class struggle, economic upheaval, propriety and fitting in with the wealthier crowd come to the forefront, with money and respect for having said money as a primary concern. This sort of ideology fit well in the era of the last series, leading into the 1980s, the decade of rampant greed, but, today, watching a woman work to fit into a group of snobs rather than conquer them with how different and special she is, not surprisingly, rings as false and uncomfortable and, again, anything but romantic.Please don't mistake me, this is a wonderful series. As a well-rounded, filled up, cast heavy, character laden drama series goes, the new Poldark does not disappoint in what looks to be the first of several seasons. But, for those concerned with what was promised them in the endless commercials now playing, this is a terrible series as a romance and, again, given how much is going on in this series and how many characters swirl about through each episode, this cannot be called a romance. Like The Paradise and Downton, there are romantic elements, but, overall, it is another money-centric series. I took the time to watch this, having seen the original, a spectacle that I really didn't need to see remade, specifically because this new version was marketed as being different, as giving me more of the romantic element I wanted to see explored in this version. That is just not what this is and I can't figure out why PBS has been advertising it as such. There is far too much economic concern, dead babies and male competition, not to mention the unfortunate ending, which you can feel free to look up elsewhere if you like to know how depressed you will feel at the end of a series like this, for this to ever be a ""romance"". And so, while this is wonderful for what it is, with high production values and wonderful performances throughout, the money, the death, the depression, the lack of focus on the romance between the two leads in an effort to include nearly every character from the books involved here, it is not up the standard set by, of all things, the commercials for this very series. I almost wish I'd watched only the trailers for this, scenes of which come from only the earliest episodes of only the first season, rather than ruining the experience of the romantic element here, by viewing the entire series. The best I can offer is that, If you are interested in this series, and you well should be if you are not looking for a purer romance, then you can find enjoyment in it if you remember that this is a full series, like Downton Abbey with many plots and subplots and a lot of down time from the main characters. The romance is played out by the end of episode three (and there are eight in this first series/season, alone), and if sometimes it seems Ross Poldark loves another woman or his business more than the woman you want him to be focusing on, it is only because he does as, again, this is not just a romance.Please remember, this is not meant as a critique of the whole Poldark universe, just this series' false claims and failure to live up to what was promised. I don't mean to offend anyone or for anyone to take my criticism personally as this is meant only to inform, not to harm. Thank you for your time and good luck in your viewing. I hope you are able to love this for what it is, as sweeping epics do have a place of honor and appreciation in our entertainment world as well as great value in our lives. And I hope that, if you've read this, you won't find yourself disappointed by a failure to live up to what PBS has promised with an unfortunately deceptive advertising campaign.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RNRBBS6IU0PSQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VC1YFFM#wasThisHelpful","RNRBBS6IU0PSQ","A2K3ZJWLF0V4K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2K3ZJWLF0V4K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"First off, the source material for these films was very low quality and, from what I see here, Scream Factory did a fine job of sharpening the image and correcting for color issues. That having been said, this is not the highest quality Blu-ray you will ever own and you should know what you are getting. Second, Scanners III received an independent release where Scanners II did not. As such, in America, this is your only Blu-ray option for Scanners II. Having said that, this is a quality 50 GB disc with each film taking up a fair share of their respective 25 GB, a size we often see very high quality transfers compressed onto so, in my opinion, the picture was good with minimal compression artifacts and, overall, it was certainly an improvement over what I had before. Third, these films are available on Blu-ray from other countries. So, if you love them, you may wish to research the other editions before you decide which version (with which type of color correction, etc.) you prefer, based on your taste. I find this a charming release and am pleased to have it in my collection.Good luck making your choice.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R27PJ8ZZ6ED1NN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00D97DMBU#wasThisHelpful","R27PJ8ZZ6ED1NN","A2K3ZJWLF0V4K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2K3ZJWLF0V4K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Yes, I'm still poor and, yes, I purchased this. And here's how much I love it: I don't regret that purchase. This is a wonderful, beautifully produced, special Blu-ray edition set from Scream Factory. As you know, the Theatrical and Director's cuts along with extensive special features and goodies are added here, so, I won't bore you with what better reviewers can give you in, well, a better review. What you should know is that there is no end to the production value on this set and, where I would normally say ""Nothing can be worth that price"", I have to admit, this time, this one really is. This rivals Criterion quality and then goes above by adding a second version of the film and so much love in the packaging. I've never seen a set like this and I find myself wishing they'd done this for Lifeforce. I love this. That's all there is. I just love it.

"I bought one in Red and one in Brown, Decaf and Regular, I know it is predictable but I couldn't resist. First off, one arrived broken because it was crushed by something that weighed forty pounds. In other words, it took something that weighed forty pounds slamming into it to crush it and, get this, it was in large pieces. So, I think it is safe to say that this is strong glass. Second, upon replacement, I tested the two units and found that they not only perform as described but are strong enough that when I accidentally slammed one down on the counter (much harder than I would ever do with anything made of glass) it survived unbroken and un-cracked. As such, I am giving this the highest rating. What else can I ask of a product? It does what it promises and it doesn't break easily.

"I ordered multiple units and all arrived damaged or broken. They were packaged well so this was not the issue. The problem here is that these are fragile and no amount of packaging can perfectly protect something this delicate from the beating packages take on their way to our homes. There are plastic alternatives to this and, if you can't find one of these delicate and highly breakable units in a brick and mortar store, you should make sure you have plenty of time to when you need to use this such that you could get replacements in time for use if they arrive broken.

"It is very hard to find a 100mg dose on Sam-e since everyone decided it is such an important supplement. Like with so many others, individual pills of Sam-e are often over-dense. Rather than taking a lower dose two or three times a day for maximum absorption, dosages ranging from 200mg to 800mg (much of which we just excrete without using) have dominated the market.Now Foods has been, in my opinion, generous enough to produce a low cost 100mg option, not only for people like me who want to increase the benefit by spacing out doses, but, also, for people who wish to use this with pets. This pill, whole, can be given to medium and large dogs and, cut into quarters, can be easily given to cats and small dogs, always followed up with water or watered down food in a syringe or spooned into their mouths, of course. I cut this into eighths and place them into size four capsules for administration to my hepatic cat several times a day and his condition is improved (with regard to his liver, not, unfortunately all of his problems as we'd both prefer).This is an excellent product, in line with what you expect from Now Foods but, more importantly, the dosage is what really makes this special. It is suitable for use with pets when cut down and, as it isn't too high a dose to begin with, cutting it down is easier. A cat can have 50mg but will gain greater benefit from 25mg a couple times a day and starting at 100mg makes that much easier to cut down to the right size for use with small dogs and cats.Good luck in finding your product.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R39F5CMBKKANOK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0013OUTA8#wasThisHelpful","R39F5CMBKKANOK","A2K3ZJWLF0V4K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2K3ZJWLF0V4K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is another excellent formula from Thorne Research for pets. The formulation is safe for use, as of this writing, and the pills are just small enough for a cat. That having been said, because the pills are capsules they can be split open and put in food or, as might be necessary for a very small dog or small cat, the pills can be divided between two size 4 capsules either to dose two or four times a day or to make administration easier on you and your pet.The supplements contained herein are specifically beneficial to the liver, including Milk Thistle, which is among the best liver supplements on the market. I combine this with a form of Sam-e that has a lower dose than the average human labeled product (such that the dosage is safe for aiding in feline and canine liver health). Overall, this is one of the best combination products out there and, unlike many human products that are at least half rice-starch, they didn't use too much filler, rather than give us a nutrient dense pill.Please note that Hepagen-Fc is the smaller option (for cats and smallish dogs) from Thorne and, as four of my five babies are small, we use this formula for convenience. The company does offer a larger size for use in large dogs, also nutrient dense instead of filler dense, but in a much larger capsule.Good luck in making your choice.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2NC87RVO1LT34/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CQR6POU#wasThisHelpful","R2NC87RVO1LT34","A2K3ZJWLF0V4K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2K3ZJWLF0V4K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the best formulation I've found for thyroid suppression (via binding) in a cat. L-Carnitine is known to be useful in binding thyroid hormone and, with supervision of a veterinarian and liberal blood testing (the same testing that must be done with use of prescription thyroid suppression methods to monitor the decline of T4 levels), this has been very successful in lowering levels in animals with milder hyperthyroidism. The problem, however, is finding a dose that will work for a small animal. A large dog can take this 250mg capsule whole. But a small dog or, as is usually the case with pets suffering hyperthyroidism, a cat, cannot. This pill has two benefits: it is a capsule you can open to gauge lower doses and deliver them throughout the day and it is a lower dose to begin with (250mg as opposed to 500mg or 1000mg which would be too hard to split accurately). I give my boy about 125mg split throughout the day into smaller doses and add to that a low dose of a pure melatonin capsule at a dose of 1mg per day (split up, of course) and he is back down the four points he needed to get ""normal"" again and not be hyperthyroid. If his levels increase, we already have a plan for slowly increasing the L-Carnitine and Melatonin to match the illness and keep him healthy and, to be clear, that would not be possible without a high quality 250mg capsule of L-Carnitine. I trust this brand, have used it for years not only for myself but for my animals. This L-Carnitine is also perfectly sized for cardiac support in our 70 pound dog and he can swallow it whole.Good luck in making your choice.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2937LSMTZ0SJD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000UWZ9RM#wasThisHelpful","R2937LSMTZ0SJD","A2K3ZJWLF0V4K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2K3ZJWLF0V4K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Warning:  Do Not Use Probiotics In Liver Compromised Animals (or humans for that matter) Without Carefully Selecting Strains.The enzyme formula here is excellent and well balanced and, while I certainly recommend that portion of this product, I cannot recommend the product overall as this formula also contains probiotics. Probiotics are both helpful and dangerous in cases of Liver Disease, certain viral infections that can harm the liver, certain bowel conditions and in cases of portosystemic shunting, even acquired shunting which is less severe. The helpfulness of some strains, specifically some strains of lactobacilli, has been established as actually aiding in reducing the process that results from other strains of gut bacteria (both good and bad strains), up to a point and the effect is dose specific. To be clear, the process by which bacteria, including some probiotics, can harm animals, in opposite of the help certain lactobacilli generally provide, is the production of ammonia as a byproduct of the bacteria's normal functioning. This ammonia exacerbates the illness in the animal, illness that you must confirm is not present before you use this or any other probiotic formula.The production of ammonia is not a side effect you can undo by adding lactobacilli if you are forcing other strains into the animal at the same time, though the inclusion of certain lactobacilli in certain amounts can help keep it from being worse, by offering, essentially, bacterial competition. However, ammonia will continue to build up, unlike in healthy humans and pets where a healthy liver is able to process the ammonia out. In an ill animal, the liver cannot detoxify the body and the animal becomes ill as the ammonia builds up. If cat or dog is young and healthy, this product is wonderful. If they are older and you have them tested regularly and are confirmed to have absolutely perfect liver values (low-normal to mid-normal but never high-end normal), then they will benefit from this formula and it will aid in their digestion. If, however, your baby is like one of my babies, suffering a weakened liver, this product could be harmful to them and you should discontinue use.If you wish to aid them with probiotics, select a limited strain formula of exclusively ""lactobacillus"" strains, knowing that you are still taking a risk as this ""helpful"" bacteria is not always helpful and has not been studied in animals for safe dosage in hepatic pets.As to the enzymes, at this time, I am still looking for a product with enzymes that does not contain any probiotics, save a low dose of specific and isolated strains of lactobacilli to test and see if he gets sick again (as other formulas, including this one, have proven harmful to my little cat.I should state that I am using this product without difficulty in two dogs (young and healthy dogs).My one star rating is for the failure of the manufacturer to warn of the danger to liver compromised animals and, quite frankly, for forcing those who need enzymes to also use probiotics when so many animals just can't have them, even strains beneficial to hepatic humans. In any combination product, the bacteria should come exclusively from forms of lactobacillus bacteria, which they appear to have achieved, however, as too many owners cannot afford to constantly monitor ammonia levels and liver enzymes absent active illness (vomiting and the like), it is not acceptable to force probiotics with no warning (or at all).Good luck in finding a products that meets your needs. I will update this if I find a product that works for my hepatic cat.","1.0 out of 5 stars","April 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R5GQVM0YKMVZH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005OCWAIO#wasThisHelpful","R5GQVM0YKMVZH","A2K3ZJWLF0V4K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2K3ZJWLF0V4K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a fantastic little unit with one caveat:  ""400 pound load capacity"" does not mean ""400 pounds per shelf"" as with many NSF rated units. This unit is actually rated at 135 pounds per shelf. Again, it is a great little trolly style unit and I absolutely love it but I saw 400 pounds, misinterpreted, based on having so many chrome units in the garage, and made the mistake of telling someone the weight rating. This resulted in that someone and another someone piling their behinds onto the top shelf to test it out (on each of two units) and top shelves are now toast. So, just so you know, 135 pound load capacity per shelf and not five pounds more. Other than that one issue, this is the sturdiest cart of this type on the market for the price.

"This is not a review of this sweet little film which I clearly loved enough to shell out money for, though it is a good watch, in case you didn't already know. This is a review of the item sold here, the DVD of Driving By Braille released by Green Apple.When I first ordered this, I received a damaged copy and, initially believed it to be due to the disc coming loose or damage sustained during shipping, because the item was open box and scratched with a cracked case. I did a return and got a replacement, basically, immediately, and it was identical in flaws, something that, truly, never happens.I couldn't conceive of how this could occur and proceeded to order the cheapest used copy I could find and then call the friend who alerted me to the fact that this film had been released on nearly two years ago and, somehow, I hadn't noticed. In consulting with her I was surprised to discover, from her story of her search for this film, that the data side of these discs are very often scratched, from poor production standards and packing issues, that is to say, they are damaged at the source, not during shipping. When she bought hers, she got several loose in package and scratched up, just like the two I received, but also got ones in cracked cases and two of three were open box. She then got one that was not loose and was just scratched up in exactly the same place as the loose ones only so very much more scratched than the loose ones.I remembered, in talking with her, that discs don't just magically appear in a case to be shipped to our homes. DVDs are processed through layers of equipment and then placed in cases by people who don't always check for damage to the data side before placing the disc inside the case as they are looking for print errors on the picture side. As such, a friend received three scratched up discs and I got two, so far, out of five ordered from three different vendors, and they were scratched in the same places from what appears to have been equipment malfunction, not from having been loose in the package, as not all of them were loose.So, it turns out, sadly, that this release seems to be packaged in very cheap, easily cracked/broken cases with very poor quality control in inspecting the discs. This DVD release sometimes comes without shrinkwrap, which makes it appear used when it is, in fact, new and has probably not even been opened to check for damage. And, worst of all, it is often so scratched, all around the innermost centimeter to inch of the DVD data side (readable side), that it won't even play correctly on older equipment. These appear almost as though the discs have been fed through a disc cleaning device from the mid-1990s (that we all know not to use anymore), and there is no clear explanation as to how this happened but it is a manufacturing error you should look out for.To be clear on playback, neither of the discs I received would play because my player is, quite frankly, not that good, but when tested on a Blu-ray player, they would play, one with minimal skipping and one with more skipping. My friend reported to me that her first discs were like that but the last one, according to her, the worst scratched of all, plays perfectly on her DVD player, Blu-ray player and computer so the scratching may not be the source of the playback errors.I wanted to post this so that you would know, if you get this in the mail from any seller, you should test it first before concluding it is a bad copy due to scratching and before deciding to return it due to it appearing damaged, as this DVD release was not prepared as professionally as I think all of us are used to at this point. It is not Amazon or the seller's fault if there are scratches around the center and so, if you are lucky enough to get one that plays well, you should hold onto that copy, and remember how many copies just two of us have encountered with problems due to manufacturing errors. For future readers, she purchased in late 2014 through early 2015. I purchased for the first time in April 2015 and will update this when I find a copy that plays.Again, this is one of those rare times when you should test a so-horribly-scratched-I-don't-even-want-to-look-at-it type of disc, even though it looks terrible and used, before you consider returning it for damage as you may have one of the only playable copies being produced right now.. Amazon has no control over the product this vendor sends out to them so a playable copy, new or used, is a real find on this film, at least right now. Just call it a diamond in the rough, the little DVD that could, and be thankful.UPDATE:I've received my third copy of this and, once again, it is scratched all to you know where. It won't play without freezing on my DVD and Blu-ray players. It played last night on a friend's player though so I just gave this last copy to him and am, of course, returning the first two. Disappointing (due to whatever manufacturing error caused this) but I have now ordered one from that site we all go to, hoping the feds aren't watching. Looking forward to my illegitimate copy which I can watch whenever I want. It is a lovely film.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1RWD4NJOPOM5H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AADAJ44#wasThisHelpful","R1RWD4NJOPOM5H","A2K3ZJWLF0V4K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2K3ZJWLF0V4K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This fan may not last forever but, for the price, it is the best I've found. A nice, simple, easy to control fan, this pulls air in when I want it and draws it out when needed. The company has priced it low enough to be replaced every couple of years or as needed but has also put in the effort to minimize control errors or degradation by using manual switches on these. Errors, like those from digital controls that notoriously break faster than manual controls are why I threw out my last window fan and why I was lucky enough to find this one. We have several and they work well. Vacuuming gently (when off) to remove dust will help these last longer and, of course, pulling them down when it rains or there is heavy condensation. Good luck with making your choice.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1DYLEI8RBHZJE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00008XET9#wasThisHelpful","R1DYLEI8RBHZJE","A2K3ZJWLF0V4K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2K3ZJWLF0V4K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is another I tried at a friend's. I liked it quite a lot for style as compared to my classic style Bodum, however, the classic style, with the straighter handle, seems to fit better in my hand. I should note that she loves the curved handle on this, as compared to the more squared off and straight edged handle on the other model so it is probably an issue of preference you can figure out before buying by testing some coffee mugs in your kitchen. The glass carafe inside was the same thickness as on my Bodum that broke so I'm giving it the same three stars (assuming it will shatter like mine did).

"This is the classic Hario, tried at a friend's house and again at home (after I borrowed it) an excellent little kettle with a couple of drawbacks. Like the Fino, the gooseneck was slightly larger than some I've tried and I felt I had to pay closer attention to what I was doing. Also, even though the handle is nice and far out from the kettle, keeping my hands from getting to warm when I tried it, the contour was kind of annoying against my fingers after a minute.

"I really liked using this little goosneck kettle. I borrowed it from a friend (who also owns the other size of this kettle). It performed well in my efforts at doing pour over in my cramped kitchen. However, where the larger Fino was slightly too cumbersome for me and this smaller unit was more of what I'd call ""my size"", I found that this unit has the same gooseneck attached and, therefore, like the larger kettle, the neck is just slightly bigger or wider in diameter than some I've tried, resulting in my having to pay closer attention to what I was doing. Not at all a bad kettle for pour over and  the handle is far out from the kettle so my hand didn't get too warm.

"I had one of the classic glass-style Bodums and, first, let me say, it did last for nearly two years. That having been stated, it shattered in my hands sending hot coffee and grounds all over the floor and, of course, me. I didn't expect this to happen as I'd never had a French Press explode before and I decided to replace it with this cheap model, the Primula Tempo. Unfortunately, the Primula is a ""get what you pay for"" alternative that is cheaply made and broke in about a month. I then purchased a stainless steal option, thinking ""This will last forever!"" and boy was I wrong. The stainless steel models all suffer from a horrible flaw. Where the plunger contacts the stainless steel interior, as it must, over time, with more and more plungings, the plunger becomes slightly more angled and ends up scraping the side of the interior, harder and harder until stainless steel powder is being scraped from the press every time you make coffee. Essentially, stainless steel models produces a fine metal powder that you end up drinking with your coffee and it only gets worse with time because the interior coating has been stripped and is revealing soft, easily scraped metal with every use. With mine, this scraping actually happened in multiple locations over time until most of the interior diameter, about sixty percent, was being scraped. I thought my coffee was tasting different over time but, being a bit of dummy when it comes to this sort of, ""if it was fine when I bought it, then it must still be fine"" kind of thinking, I didn't check the unit without liquid in it until it had been happening for months. I re-purposed my stainless steel model (the Il Mulino) and am currently using another glass Bodum while testing pour over gear. It isn't perfect but it probably won't kill you. If you are looking for a glass one, check out the Bodum and don't bother with this as the glass is thinner and breaks far too quickly.Good luck with your search and please don't send me hate mail if you own this and disagree with me.

"This is the second of two I actually purchased (and returned) to replace my old Il Mulino that had developed a scraping point and was producing metal powder I was ending up drinking and, unfortunately, I found the same flaw on the two models I purchased, those tested in friend's homes and those tested in store. If the plunger base (where you find your fine mesh filter on all French Presses) comes in contact with the inner wall of the stainless steel unit at any point, which it will, the ring/rim of the mesh portion of the plunger will scrape the side and take tiny flecks of stainless steel with it, a fine powder of metal that you will be drinking with your coffee, as it is so fine as to easily pass through that metal mesh filter. Cancer, liver failure, dementia, take your pick. You'll be poisoning yourself if you use this or any other stainless steel unit that is not glass lined (and glass linings can crack or break).For the record, this Mira along with the Frieling, Bodum, VonShef and all other stainless steel presses I tested produced a fine powder of steel particles when tested and are not safe to use.Note: All of the French Presses I tried were units that had been plunged again and again and, as a result, had at least one point of contact resulting in scraping and the production of the fine, stainless steel powder. The safest version of the metal I found was a chromium and nickel mix, both of which are toxic in higher than very low milligram doses and are not intended to be ingested as metal shavings. If you have a stainless steel French Press, please check it before each use to make sure it has not developed one or more points of contact where the metal inside is being shaved off into the cup. My old Il Mulino press has been retired to non-food use because, as it turns out, it has a point of contact. The worst offenders, with 100% of the surface of the interior being scraped in this fashion by the mesh/plunger assembly, were the Bodums and the Frielings that I tested, possibly because they are the most popular brands.I was asked by a manufacturer to be clearer on the circumstances of my trying of their unit. To be clear, I found that my Il Mulino was shedding this fine steel dust. I asked two friends, both of whom manage local coffee houses to post a sign asking people to bring in their metal French Presses on specific days. A number of people showed up at each house on each day and we tested all of their units and wrote down the names of the units tested at the time. All units had the same flaw, as all had been used enough to develop it. None were reported to be over two years old and nearly all were reported, by the owners to be less than one year old. Reports of use ranged from ""once in a while"" to ""daily"". Not all units had names on them but they were matched based on owner report and pictures on Amazon to the units I have reviewed. I have not reviewed any units that were not seen in person and will not, though I suspect they suffer the same flaw. I will not retract my reviews due to the inconvenience it may cause some manufacturers because this is an issue of the health of the consumer. I only looked at my Il Mulino press because I tested positive for heavy metal poisoning and my doctor specifically asked about sources of Nickel in my home. That press was a source and, very possibly, the source. However, I will reiterate that none of the presses I examined were brand new, all had been used, and all were tested simply by inspecting the carafe, making sure there was no steel dust, pushing and retracting the plunger ten times, then removing it to see if steel dust had been deposited. All units inspected (including many duplicates of two Bodums that I can only review once) had the same steel-dust production problem. I hope this clarifies the issue and puts an end to the not so pleasant messages.As an aside, if you are still reading reviews of stainless steel presses, you may be interested in Kamerod, Hobbie and Anderson's, ""Stainless steel leaches nickel and chromium into foods during cooking"" from The Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry (J Agric Food Chem. 2013 Oct 2;61(39):9495-501. doi: 10.1021/jf402400v.

"First off, wow. I've never had so many people use the unhelpful rating to let me know they disagree with me. You guys really love this thing. I never read reviews of items I already know I love so that is some genuine consumer loyalty. So, from that alone, people reading this, you'll probably love this thing.That having been said, I tried this at a friend's home recently, along with several others in two stores, and found the same flaw on all models. If the plunger base (where you find your fine mesh filter on all French Presses) comes in contact with the inner wall of the stainless steel unit at any point, which it will, the ring/rim of the mesh portion of the plunger will scrape the side and take tiny flecks of stainless steel with it, a fine powder of metal that you will be drinking with your coffee, as it is so fine as to easily pass through that metal mesh filter. Cancer, liver failure, dementia, take your pick. You'll be poisoning yourself if you use this or any other stainless steel unit that is not glass lined (and glass linings can crack or break).For the record, the Sterling Pro, along with Bodum, among other presses, produced a fine powder of steel particles when tested and are not safe to use.Note: All of the French Presses I tried were units that had been plunged again and again and, as a result, had at least one point of contact resulting in scraping and the production of the fine, stainless steel powder. The safest version of the metal I found was a chromium and nickel mix, both of which are toxic in higher than very low milligram doses and are not intended to be ingested as metal shavings. If you have a stainless steel French Press, please check it before each use to make sure it has not developed one or more points of contact where the metal inside is being shaved off into the cup. My old Il Mulino press has been retired to non-food use because, as it turns out, it has a point of contact. The worst offenders, with 100% of the surface of the interior being scraped in this fashion by the mesh/plunger assembly, were the Bodums and the Frielings that I tested, possibly because they are the most popular brands.I was asked by a manufacturer to be clearer on the circumstances of my trying of their unit. While some were tried in home, most were tried in store. To be clear, I found that my Il Mulino was shedding this fine steel dust. I asked two friends, both of whom manage local coffee houses to post a sign asking people to bring in their metal French Presses on specific days. A number of people showed up at each house on each day and we tested all of their units and wrote down the names of the units tested at the time. All units had the same flaw, as all had been used enough to develop it. None were reported to be over two years old and nearly all were reported, by the owners to be less than one year old. Reports of use ranged from ""once in a while"" to ""daily"". Not all units had names on them but they were matched based on owner report and pictures on Amazon to the units I have reviewed. I have not reviewed any units that were not seen in person and will not, though I suspect they suffer the same flaw. I will not retract my reviews due to the inconvenience it may cause some manufacturers because this is an issue of the health of the consumer. I only looked at my Il Mulino press because I tested positive for heavy metal poisoning and my doctor specifically asked about sources of Nickel in my home. That press was a source and, very possibly, the source. However, I will reiterate that none of the presses I examined were brand new, all had been used, and all were tested simply by inspecting the carafe, making sure there was no steel dust, pushing and retracting the plunger ten times, then removing it to see if steel dust had been deposited. All units inspected (including many duplicates of two Bodums that I can only review once) had the same steel-dust production problem.

"First, the owner of this carafe brewer is furious with me for not loving it as much as she does. Second, she can't believe I would dare to say that coffee from it is the same as from any other cone because, ""It is so elegant, using it is an experience"". Well, I'm sorry to say, I don't want an experience. I just want a tasty cup of coffee and, as much as I love you, person who shall not be named in an Amazon review, I found this no better at making a pour over than any other pour over cup. First off, this is a combination of the mug and the cone, whether plastic or porcelain or ceramic or any other kind of pour over cone, that you would use in your standard pour over kit. Second, it is far prettier than any other pour over kit on the market. (There, I admitted it.)In testing this, along with the Melitta plastic ""Joe"" cone, the Bonavita (a friend's immersion cone that I may have to save up for due to increased strength from full immersion) and a Kalita ceramic/porcelain (didn't catch the material) and a Bee cone, I found this made coffee that tasted identical to the other cones, using the same filters, coffee and pour over ""artist"" (scare quotes included because I'm no artist compared to the girl that owns this overpriced carafe cone combo). Setting any of the other cones on top of a mug, prepping the filter with pre-wetting and warming with hot water, blooming the grounds and pouring for the same length of time, this was just identical, with one exception. The Bonavita was stronger coffee, owing to the extended brew time from full immersion.For the specific Chemex review, I found it very attractive, of course, but I was terrified of breaking it, not just because I was testing a friend's new Chemex in her kitchen but because it is so insanely expensive and delicate (glass). My BPA free pour over cone produces identical flavor to my ceramic which produces identical flavor to this and the plastic one costs about $6 to replace (the ceramic about $20 and both of mine are Melitta).If you are rich, this is the unit for you, stylish, looks wonderful sitting on the counter next to your favorite pour over, gooseneck kettle, easy to shell out another $60 to replace when it shatters or cracks. But, if you need your money for things like gas in the car and a night out once in a while or, if you are like me, and just need it for medical care, food and a roof over your head, think about what you are getting before you get this.Good luck with your search and please don't send me hate mail if you own this and disagree with me.

"I tried this in store, where I was actually allowed to put water in it (that was nicer than the standard, walk around with it and see if it feels ""good"" test) and found that the handle, like many others, suffers from a case of form over function. It is pretty, however, the handle is too curved to be comfortable to hold for a two to four minute pour over. Additionally, the handle curves starkly down toward the kettle, keeping your hand closer to the kettle than is desirable when pouring hot water between 175 and 200 degrees. Beyond that, the handle is metal, with no non-slip sheath meaning it conducts heat from the water in the kettle through the wall of the kettle to the handle and to your hand.

"I tried this in a store. The handle is awful. Because it curves downward, toward the kettle itself, it holds your hand closer to the kettle. After a few seconds, your hand will start to heat up, at least mine did, as this one I was allowed to try with hot water (not boiling) and after only a few more seconds, it became uncomfortably warm and I had to set it down. When a pour over takes at least two minutes, usually closer to four, a kettle must be comfortable for a long period of time. While it does have a nice non-slip grip, that heat issue and the little prong for between your first and second fingers, which also became annoying quickly, makes this a no go.Good luck with your search and please don't send me hate mail if you own this and disagree with me.

"Tried this in a store. Please remember that with a pour over kettle, you will be holding it for a minimum of two minutes, while pouring. While this handle has a nice non-slip grip, it was so uncomfortable, due to the shape, that I couldn't stand it after about thirty seconds, with no water in it.

"Whatever strength you choose, this is a high quality product. Jarrow is a well known brand for quality control so, skipping over that, what you need to know is that this is a dry formula. Because of this, it is more shelf stable. You don't have to worry about ordering this from Amazon or even a marketplace vendor because, as long as the item you receive is sealed and far enough away from expiration, if it was stored at a slightly higher temperature, say the temp in an Amazon warehouse, you don't have to worry about rancidity. Unlike a softgel, the oil in which can go rancid in a hot warehouse within a month, this dry formula will not go rancid and, therefore, it will not cause stomach upset or damage to your liver. This is one of the best options out there in a world of oil-mixed Co-enzyme Q10 softgels, a simple dry capsule.Good luck.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R39MJHR1PLT98G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0013OQF74#wasThisHelpful","R39MJHR1PLT98G","A2K3ZJWLF0V4K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2K3ZJWLF0V4K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This Ratchet is as described so I won't bore you repeating all of that.Basically, what you need to know is that this is a high quality, heavy ratchet, of the type your father used, with one clear alteration. Instead of having one end, with one ratcheting fitting, you have four, three of which are your standard, most commonly used sizes, the last of which is the coveted screwdriver attachment. In other words, this will work for pretty much anything you can throw at it.It is heavy duty, thick, heavy, so it won't bend when you are using it in a setting requiring a higher level of torque (my last ratchet was pathetic and actually bent rather than force that bolt in that last sixteenth of an inch so I bought this and it had no problem).It has the screwdriver attachment which allows for use of all your standard bits in tight spaces.Ratchet dials are non-slipping, unlike a cheaper, flimsier or mini ratchet, so you have to hold the bit on the back in place when you switch from right to left. In other words, again, it won't slip off of the setting while you are using the ratchet, resulting in a sudden failure of the unit, requiring a reset.Essentially, this is the best ratchet I've ever owned, going back to my first, which was made in the 1940s and used in a Long Beach factory that churned out airplanes in the war, all the way up to the first I purchased, a Home Depot, ten dollar, thin handled, 3/8"" model, jumping forward again to several minis and another thin handled model from Lowes. This is just miles ahead of those.The only con here is the temptation to over-ratchet, the same as with any quality ratchet. It works so smoothly, you have to pay attention to that slight tightening you get at the end, when you are supposed to stop turning. With a cheap ratchet, it will often stop working before you get to that point, where you might over-tighten. Boo hoo.Good luck.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3CB4W04YINO2Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00B4ZVB8K#wasThisHelpful","R3CB4W04YINO2Q","A2K3ZJWLF0V4K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2K3ZJWLF0V4K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"No need to prick the egg? Try again. All egg steamers on the market either ""require"" (how are they going to force us, stomp into our kitchens and scowl?) or ""suggest"" that we prick each egg with a needle prior to cooking to avoid explosion, all units except for the Chef's Choice Egg Cooker. This unit is marketed with the claim that you should prick or pierce the egg and I decided to test that claim for this and two other machines.I purchased the Chef's Choice Egg Cooker and compared it to the machines of two friends. One bought the Dash-Go (she paid $20) and one has the $60 Cuisinart. Basically, they are all exactly the same, operating on the same principle of filling a base with water and steaming the eggs in order to cook them. Where the difference lies is in the controls and in the ""prettiness"" of the counter-space sapping device. While the Cuisinart could do more eggs at once, it didn't cook them as well when we did more so we found that six or seven was as many as we would do in that machine so we were back to each machine cooking the same number of eggs and, once again, that issue of pricking the eggs was our greatest concern.And so we tested, six eggs in each, several times. We tried a batch of unpricked in each machine and one or two cracked and cooked outside the shell in each unit.for each of two tests. We then pricked the eggs, using a sewing needle (because the little needle cups they send out with some units get lost so easily that they may as well not even send them) and, low and behold, all batches in each machine came out perfect, that is to say, un-cracked and cooked identically.While on the Cuisinart the flaw was evenness when doing more eggs, with the Chef's Choice, the flaw was the control lever. The instructions on the side of the unit, the timing and selection on that control lever, seemed more of a suggestion than actual instruction. The eggs never seem to come out exactly as the label would suggest and, at least on the machine we tested, the unit had to be set higher in order to cook to the lower level. The Dash-Go was simple and easy to use, cheap in appearance and price, and did the job equally as well.I won't tell you not to get the Chef's Choice or the Cuisinart, if you are in love with the visual design of one or the other (as how a thing looks on your counter can often ruin your day, if it is cheap or the wrong color). However, if you are not desperate to have the exact stainless look of the Chef's choice or the tall egg shape of the Cuisinart sitting on your counter, I strongly suggest that you consider other cheap models first, starting with the Dash Go. The stainless is just a waste of money if you are purchasing it for anything other than appearance.As to the one distinguishing characteristic of the Dash Go that makes it the best, in my opinion, the handle on the Chef's Choice unit is only on one side which can (and does) lead to attempts at lifting followed by immediate dropping. The handles, that's right, there are two, on the Cuisinart, are positioned too close to the base of the lid which leads to steaming of your hands as you open the unit. I found this uncomfortable. The handle. and we're back to one, on the Dash Go is a knob on the top of the dome. All you have to do is lift it off and the handle you are using to do that lifting is as far away from the outflow of steam (coming out from around the rim when you open the unit) as it can possibly be on one of these units. You could even tie a string around it if you wanted and lift it off from even farther away, as it is a shaped knob with a thinner portion below a larger, door-knob portion, allowing for a string if a string be what you need. I found that the knob on the top was adequate to protect my hands from the steam, all by itself.Also, as with all units you should use distilled water, as the bases, like a tea kettle, will become covered in calcium within a few months which is very, very, un-pretty.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RFJ33S5JS01PK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005OCZPNG#wasThisHelpful","RFJ33S5JS01PK","A2K3ZJWLF0V4K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2K3ZJWLF0V4K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Eco has transformed into her dragon form and is attacking the city.  Ash seems helpless to stop her, but assistance comes from an unexpected source - Milgauss.  His past is revealed and the reason why he killed his dragon.  But Mordred is having his own issues - Navi is helping Eco resist him and Eco begins her path to her destiny - as well as her partner's.  Can they stop the dark dragon, or will Navi and Eco be absorbed into an ultimate evil.This arc ends, with both Eco and Ash starting their path to their destiny.  The story and well drawn art really flow well in this story.  The bonus chapters are the usual ecchi trope (breast sizing, panties and heart searching), nothing offensive or out of the ordinary.

"Finally, what started in the class trip finally bears fruit.  Sawako and Kazeha first kiss, and a much needed talk about their feelings towards each other.  He finally breaks down and admits he wants her only for himself, and knows she has been working so hard to come out of the shadows everone put her in, and she admits that she is jealous of everyone's attention of him and only wants his smile to herself.  Then its girl talk time and Ayane, Chii, and Sawa sit down and tell each other of the updates of their relationships with their counterpart, the biggest one of course being CHii and Ryu.  Then everyone comes over for a party, which surprises Sawa's dad when he comes home from work and he grills Kazeka to ensure he still cares for his little girl.This was a tear jerker to say the least.  I am glad things are finally moving in the right direction for all the girl (and there are times i wish i could reach into the story and smack Kazyeha on the back of the head).

His parents tell him that they are actually not related by blood, which everyone else in the family knew but him.  But when his sister runs away and they both get into an accident things look bad, but are about to get weird.  Now he is stuck in her body, she is in his body and she announces that she has always loved him and now has the body to make her dreams come true.  And to make matters worse, Youta not only has to deal with different body functions, but also clothes, and a new threat - the girl he has a crush on as a boy actually bats for the other team and has her eyes on Hikaru.  How long will they stay like this, and can he survive with his sanity, manhood, and virginity intact?Overall it is a twist on the Freaky Friday theme, and while an OT rated, very little to no nudity, the only thing some people will complain about is the ""forbidden love"" theme.

However for one young adventurer, Bell, he has only one dream - to find the most elusive of creatures - GIRLS.  And he found the one of his dreams - however she is one of the most powerful warriors of the most powerful guilds, where he is the only child of a just formed guild.  But he has a secret skill, one that if developed properly under the guidance of his goddess can make him a legend among legends, provided he does not get killed first.  But unknown to him, the girl of his dreams is not the only one who has eyes on him and when heavenly minds notice something they will do anything to get what they want.I enjoyed this start, from the building of his stats to the randomness of the dungeon it reminds me of the old school role playing games.  Starting out as a low level newbie, you have to grind to level up gathering money and items to build up gear and items.

"How do new devils gain status - by doing jobs and doing them well.  Well Asia is starting her path to being a new devil, and she has help with Koneko.  From Cosplay fashion shows, to panty thief capturing, to maid cafe servers - can these two devilsih cuties rise up and complete each request.this is just a side story, but it not only fills in a gap that most people would not notice - but it is enjoyable and light hearted.

"Keima just wants to play his games and continue being the God of Conquests - however he and his klutzy sidekick Elsa are called to serve once again.  This time he is not looking for just Lost souls, he is looking for six particular souls known as the Jupiter Sisters.  Long ago these ladies ended the ancient war between Heaven and Hell and brought about the current system, but there are those who wish to bring back the ancient ways.  HIs only clue is they are residing in six of his previous conquests  which will be hard as their memories were erased after the kiss, or are they?  Assassins, hunters and divine kisses are in store for you in this story arc of the WORLD GOD ONLY KNOWS.I watched this on crunchyroll and it is as good as the previous arcs.  While you expect a lot of hijinks and other mishaps to still take place, this one has a more serious tone as the stakes are higher and more intense.  Also you will see a change in Keima this time, as he becomes more of this world than the virtual.  If you enjoyed the last two, you will enjoy this one and hope the final arc comes soon.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2PXNU0U06YUNF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PTUB5I2#wasThisHelpful","R2PXNU0U06YUNF","AOB5695UUUJ0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AOB5695UUUJ0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Takamiya is starting out as an apprentice witch, and with the hottest girl in class as his master.  But things are going to get harder as a very powerful Tower witch appears and gives him something that is supposed to release the ""white stuff"" within him.  Then add his bro-con stalker sister, who also happens to be a witch and an escape from the witch prison of a high level evil witch, can this hot couple stand strong together - or is Takamiya going to have to pull out his wild card and find out what his white stuff can do and find out more of his past with Kagare.I enjoyed this series and the correlation between the light mangas and the anime has been pretty spot on.

"After the fallen angel incident, Rias has a new devil to her lineup - and just in time to.  As Issei and Aisia work to get contracts and become stronger, they notice the president is not acting herself.  Then one night Rias appears with a very unusual (but for Issei desirable) request, but is interupted by the queen of her brother - the devil King himself.  They soon learn that Rias is betrothed to the scion of house Pheonix, and he is even more of a letch than Issei.  The only way to settle it is through the rating game - a contest where devil use their pieces in combat to take each other out.  So not the training begins - can team Grimorie come up with a strategy to defeat the more powerful opponents?The series has been great so far.

"Now I am only a few hours into it, but this game is truly amazing.  I spent an hour deciding on my character and class (qunari fighter) and making her the way i desire.  The fighting system is very easy to use - as one who played the other two I am very familiar, but the new thing is the tatical mode, which comes in handy when you are outnumbered and need to get rid of a few pesky range attackers.  All the characters are well voiced and the usual banter between party members is there (right now its Verric and Cassandra, but i cannot wait to get others - including Morrigan (too bad she is not playable but I will love to see her).  The graphics are crisp on my TV and the free roam is skyrm-esque where you can walk around - find things and kill a few baddies on the way.  I have not yet run a multiplayer - but i hear its like Mass Effect 3 in its content and play modes.Now I do not know how people could not know that this would need memory.  It was announced last year when the new systems came out that the newer games would be larger and would need space to play so a 4gb xb360 would not be able to run it (but i have the 320 HALO system so no problem there), especially on the cloud.

But Ash is also having problems of his own - Rebecca and Jessica are turning up the heat to get close to him, and the Princess is trying to fight her own desires as well.  But when the annual training camp gets close Ash is chosen to go, but the real surprise is a first year named Lucca is also chosen - a young elf girl who is having troubles of her own and her Dragon will not let her near him.  How can Ash help this young, shy girl and her steed be able to fly again before it is to late, as a masked antagonist arrives again to bring about another undead meanace in an attempt to destroy the world.This book was more into seeing Ash develop as well as a first glimpse into Eco's true purpose.  It also has the obligatory Beach episode with cute girls running around in swimsuits.  Now despite what the other review says, the nudity is cranked down a lot as the author went into building the plot arc for Lucca and to finally have Ash step towards his destiny with Eco (as if it is a real surprise).

How is this simple library head supposed to get out of this one, and maybe rescue her brother in the process?Honestly this was an interesting story.

When a friend tells him of a job to enter one of the darkest places of his old haunts to locate a weapon that might be able to put an end to the devils and the demons of the Worldwound, he joins up with a paladin, a Sarenite priest, an old shadowcaller friend, and a few members of the Aspis Consortium (they finally get to have some time in a book).

"I did not enjoy this book at all. It seemed not much effort was put in to making it come alive for serious Scottish Highlander fans. A 21rst century girl swims off the coast of a castle ruin, makes a wish and dolphins pop her up in 15th century Scotland wearing a wet suit. The medieval highlander rescues her and she tells him she is from the future. He accepts it point blank, and says fine good I know now let's take our clothes off, make babies and get married. And that is exactly what happened. There was no romance, suspense, or challenge. Even the enemy of the highlander accepted the time travel future story instantly without question since the girl was his medieval daughter unknown to him, and taken to the future by his mother because she was preemie baby. It was actually a very dull lifeless story. Most of the language was confusing. One minute the medieval guy is using modern slang, the next he acts like he never heard the words.","2.0 out of 5 stars","December 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R56XA12O6OF8P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N1EJV9I#wasThisHelpful","R56XA12O6OF8P","A3MDETK0D5UAIN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3MDETK0D5UAIN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Nasty & Hot. Cinnamon and Nutmeg in chili? No thank you. The description states this is mild and contains no cayenne. It is not true. This ruined a good pot of chili. I had already used 4 cans each of tomatoes and beans and 3lb meat while preparing my chili. Unexpected company and adding another can of beans and tomatoes made me dig for a bit more seasoning. Realizing I was out of my normal recipe packets I remembered this bottle recently arrived from amazon. My mixture was already weak without the extra cans.  So grabbing it up, I thought boy we are gonna have some good chili now. I should have left it alone, weak, and at least consumable. The flavor was nauseating. There was no touch of chili flavor after adding about 3/4 tsp to my huge pot. I don't know what was worse, the cinnamon nutmeg flavor or the heat.

"I was very skeptical about this laundry detergent when first purchased at dollar tree for one buck. But after several uses I realized it is as good or better than all the no brand detergents. It is not tide mind you but it was well worth the dollar. I am a faithful tide user for truly dirty laundry. However, when my local discount dollar stores started carrying this product in other formulas and scents I had to try them. The purple bottle is the best. It leaves your clothes smelling like fresh sunshine and spring. I stocked up on it immediately. One cap for normal loads, and 2 for heavily soiled items. I know it sounds weird, but the purple bottle worked the best. And for 1 dollar you can not loose much. Besides this company makes some exceptional cleaning products.

"I used to love Mr salty pretzels. They were so light and thin and airy with the perfect amount of salt. At times u could easily break them with just your lips. But these pretzels were too big, too hard, and way too dry. They hurt my mouth and teeth. I am aware the box shows large size pretzel sticks. I knew this before ordering a case. But I trusted the Mr salty name along with the quality expected from kraft. I was disappointed by both. There is no resemblance to Mr salty pretzels in either taste or texture. The cheese was runny and oily like the cheap imitation spreads you can get at discount stores. It literally runs off your pretzel. The quality is way below what I expected from this company. At least with the other kraft handisnacks and crackers you can divide your little square of cheese evenly with your red stick and it holds form.

"I wish I had paid closer attention to the picture of this item. I purchased it to replace a metal floor register that for perfectly. This one does not fit that well. It is actually made smaller and slides around. Besides it does not come with any way to secure it. There are no pre drilled holes. Drilling your own weakens the cheap plastic. The air outlet is not angled. There are tiny 1/2 vertical squares. The tiny strips for air control on the bottom are almost 1/2 in wide if that. You need a very small knife blade or similar object to ajust them. There is no room to do this with your fingers. So the air control flaps are useless on the bottom if the outlet is vertical. The air is going to rise straight up no matter what you do.If you close the vents flaps and do not secure this somehow, then it will be blown right out of your hole.

"""A Step Toward Falling"" is Cammie McGovern's second book for YA readers. Once again, she covers a topic about people with disabilities. This is still a topic that a lot of books don't address, so I think she has found her niche.""A Step Toward Falling"" was a relatively fast read. It has characters that are not perfect but I liked them all anyway. Although, out of three main characters, Emily was my least favorite. I didn't like her the way I did other characters. I also really liked that the main focus of this book was not about romance.

"When I first started ""Daughters unto Devils"", I wasn't sure how much I would like it. But as I started to read, the more I started to like it. It's a little confusing at the beginning but the more you read, the more you start to get it.Amy Lukavics has done really well in building a spooky atmosphere. I could picture the cabin with the awful surprise in it. I'm glad that Amy didn't attempt to do one of those books with the obviously fake photographs that a lot of YA horror writers are doing now and letting the readers imagine it for themselves. The scary aspect starts off slow but all of a sudden-it turns really spooky. I read this in my bed at night and by the end, I kind of got the creeps.The book was a super fast read for me-I read it in less than a day. In fact, I stayed up later than I should have so I could finish it. It is perfect reading for stormy nights or a chilly autumn day. If you like spooky stories, you are going to love this book.

It's pretty cool how it lights up, so it makes playing in a darkened setting more fun. It has the light saber sounds that previous light sabers make. My nephew likes to play hard in light saber battles and seems pretty durable so far.I do wish there was a clip at the handle part because my nephew likes to clip light sabers to his pants to be like the real characters but other than that, it's pretty awesome.

"I used to have a Play-Doh set slightly similar to this when I was a kid. When I saw that they have a new version of the barber shop, I knew that my niece and nephews would love to play with it. I was right as it was a hit right from the start.With this kit you get:-One chair (in two separate pieces)-6 mini cans of Play-Doh-3 characters:a man, a woman, and a child-2 hair molds (a woman's hairstyle and a mohawk-play tools (including play scissors and pretend razors)This is a pretty easy set to set up. Just connect the stand with the chair, stick some Play-Doh inside one of the characters, slide the character in place on the chair, and turn the crank to see their hair grow.The kids (and I will admit, me too) had a lot of fun with this. They all liked seeing the hair grow and then cutting it off. Any negative things of the set is that there are a lot of places where the Play-Doh gets stuck. The dough doesn't come out of the person completely, so we had to use toothpicks to get it out. The Play-Doh also tends to get stuck in the chair. But the fun that the kids have outweighs the pain of clean-up.This is a great addition to your Play-Doh collection.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ZQBLTG1X0J6X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TPMDNRQ#wasThisHelpful","R1ZQBLTG1X0J6X","A3U5CZ3PV82JXD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3U5CZ3PV82JXD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""Those Secrets We Keep"" is a pretty good summer read about women's friendships.The women in the story-Sloane, Georgina, and Hilary are typical chick-lit archetypes.

I love reading summer oriented stories in the summer. As a child, I used to visit my grandparent's house on a lake and so I loved the lake setting. The three women all come on their getaway hoping that their lives will get better. Does it happen?

"These potholders are okay but not the best that I've used. I really like the blue color of them. The nautical blue color is dark enough so you can't see a lot of stains if you happen to drip something on them. And if you happen to have a kitchen theme, these would probably fit in with most themes.The potholders look nice but they are definitely thinner than I would like. I used it to carry a hot bowl of green bean casserole from the oven to the dinner table and I could definitely feel the heat by the time I reached the table. That's not such a good thing because you could burn your hands or potentially drop the hot items on the floor and maybe on yourself.

"""Paperweight"" is definitely not a light read. At times I had a hard time picking up the book because it would make me feel a little depressed after reading it. But I stuck with it and it was worth it to reach the end.At the beginning of the book, nothing is right in Stevie's world. Her mother left her, her brother has died, she has a drinking problem, and she has an eating disorder. The book follows Stevie from her first day in the eating disorder rehab that her father made her go to and the journey that she takes while there. Her therapist helps her see that maybe she doesn't need to disappear into nothingness.Like I said at the beginning, this is a heavy read.

"This is a really, really great hair dryer. It comes with a great set of tools to help you as you dry and style your hair:-the hair dryer comes in a cool greenish color.

"I know they probably aren't meant to, but these will not replace good old plain paper towels any time soon. These are paper towels with dried Dawn soap in them. When you either wet the paper towel with water or put the towel on a wet surface, it will activate the soap. Then everything becomes soapy.I suppose these are good for wiping down a counter but it does make it extra soapy, so you may need to re-wipe it down with something that doesn't have soap in it. They are also good for washing a dish or two. I do like them for when rinse raw meat (like pork chops or chicken) in the sink. That way I can use these to clean the sink and not have to worry about all those pesky germs that you get when raw meat touches your sink or counters.But the soap smell is a little strong. You also have to put these somewhere else or buy another holder to put these on and make sure no one gets confused that these are not a plain paper towel.

"Why did I wait so long to read this book? I've debated about reading ""How to Love"" for a long time now but I finally decided to give it a try and I'm so happy that I did.""How to Love"" is all about Reena and Sawyer. The story goes back and forth from After-when Reena has a baby and Sawyer is back in town after a couple years away and Before-which covers the beginnings of their relationship up until Sawyer leaves. While I read the book, I was both in love and equally annoyed with both of the characters. Sawyer is both party swoon-worthy yet you know he's kind of bad for Reena and Reena can be both a great character but so kind of needy when it comes to Sawyer.

"""Life By Committee"" is about a kind of lonely girl who finds an online community where she can tell her secrets to. Tabitha was dumped from her previous friends after her body developed and the guys in school started looking at her differently. She got a reputation around school even though she hasn't done anything and still is that sort of nerdy girl who loves book. She has a flirtation going on with Joe but Joe is currently dating someone. Tabitha finds the Life by Committee, who dare her to do things she wouldn't normally do. But is good for her or will it lead her down a path that she can't come from? You'll have to read the book to find out.Overall, I liked this book. Tabitha is a likable main character, even if she doesn't always do what's right. I felt bad for as she kind of turned into the school punching bag a little bit, all because of rumors that her former best friend spread about her. Tabitha has a passion for books and I always love reading books where the characters are passionate about reading. The Life By Committee concept is interesting and is something that I could see existing in the real world. It shows how easy it is to be anonymous, yet the people behind the computers control our lives a little.The book kept me interested all the way through and was a relatively quick read. I would definitely recommend giving this one a try.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Y7PD2KYHJA4T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062294059#wasThisHelpful","R1Y7PD2KYHJA4T","A3U5CZ3PV82JXD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3U5CZ3PV82JXD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a really excellent set of cooking utensils that are made for grilling but will help in the kitchen, no matter what you're cooking.You get three utensils in this set- a fork, tongs, and a spatula. They have extra long handles, which is great so you don't get too close to the grill's heat. The spatula is very sturdy. It makes picking up and holding foods that are heavier really easy. The tongs are my favorite tool. They can grab onto small stuff but hold thicker food as well. The fork works well too. The grips on each utensil are really nice. Each tool is easy and comfortable to hold.Overall, I'm extremely pleased with this set and I highly recommend using them for your grilling/cooking.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3O88C85SVCYP1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00T06WF6C#wasThisHelpful","R3O88C85SVCYP1","A3U5CZ3PV82JXD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3U5CZ3PV82JXD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was curious about ""Those Girls"" but a little apprehensive because some people haven't been saying the best things about it but I decided to bite the bullet and give it a try. I actually didn't hate it. I didn't love it either but it kept me interested.""Those Girls"" are Alexandra, Mollie, and Veronica, who are the popular girls in an all-girl school. Regina George from the film ""Mean Girls"" is nothing compared to what these girls do, particularly to each other. They are best friends but they have no problem on backstabbing each other. You probably aren't going to love any one character but at times, I could feel sympathy for each girl. Out of all three, I probably liked Alex the best. Veronica and Mollie are a mess. Mollie is the meanest out of the three and Veronica is the ""easy"" girl in the school.The book follows the girls throughout the whole of their junior year. There's lots of partying involved. Yes, there is a lot of swearing, drug use, and sexual situations. But really, it's a very realistic book that shows what some teens do. If you are a teen or even if you aren't now, I'm sure that everyone knows people like ""Those Girls"" and their partying ways.This isn't, by any means, the best book that I've read but it kept my interest in what messed up stuff that the girls did to each other.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3ARWZKM49LAIS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0316403660#wasThisHelpful","R3ARWZKM49LAIS","A3U5CZ3PV82JXD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3U5CZ3PV82JXD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Nowadays, it's absolutely necessary to have a shredder at your home or business. If you're looking for a shredder, this is a great one for you.

"This is a super fun Play-Doh set for any Disney Princess fan.You get four mini Play-Doh colors. Two of these have glitter in them. You get three castle facades-one for Ariel, one for Cinderella, and a Rapunzel one. The Rapunzel one is fun as you can make her ""hair"" grow. The Ariel and Cinderella ones have decorations on it that come from each of their stories.  They also have a skirt mold and you can decorate their Play-Doh skirts in multiple ways.

"Being a fan of Stephen Sondheim's work, especially ""Company"", I immediately got the connection of the title of ""Everybody Rise"" to Mr. Sondheim's song, ""The Ladies Who Lunch"".The book takes place from 2006 up until right before disaster hits in 2008. Evelyn is a daughter of a new money lawyer and a social climbing mother. Right from the first chapter, you see Evelyn's mother pushing her to be better and get into the in-crowd of New York society. Working for People Like Us (A fake Facebook for rich people), Evelyn pushes her way into the group of elite New York. Things escalate as Evelyn tries to fit in with people like Camilla Rutherford, who is considered the top tier in the New York socialite world. But things start to fall apart when Evelyn reaches too high.I really don't know how I feel about ""Everybody Rise"". I had a harder time getting into the book at the beginning and that made it hard to want to pick it up. As the storyline picked up, it was easier to read. But then I also don't know how I feel about Evelyn. She's relatively likable in the beginning but turns slightly heinous in the middle and it's hard to like her after that. At one point she became so unlikable that I couldn't wait for her to get the comeuppance she deserved. She will do anything to stay on the top and almost become better than Camilla. At one point, I thought she should be put in the mental hospital because she is so far gone.The ending of the book is something you would expect but was satisfactory. I didn't hate the book at all. It's just as great as I was hoping it would be.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RGZBAJ10EQ3Q2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250077176#wasThisHelpful","RGZBAJ10EQ3Q2","A3U5CZ3PV82JXD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3U5CZ3PV82JXD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

But alas, I just could not get into this book.I really tried to love it but it just wasn't working for me, so I gave up about half way through. I felt like the relationship of Juliet and Lucas was so strange. I didn't really like either character. Lucas comes off as a stalker in the beginning and Juliet becomes more and more unlikable as the book went on.

"I was a little nervous to start this book because of some of the more negative reviews. But I decided to give it a try and ""The Heiresses"" is really not that bad at all.I won't go into major details about what the story is about but the gist of the story is that the Saybrooks are a major family who is rich from diamonds. Someone murdered a Saybrook cousin, Poppy, and the other cousins try and figure out who killed Poppy. At first I wasn't sure who was who and had to refer to the family tree that's at the beginning of the book, but I caught on pretty quickly and it was pretty easy to tell them apart. Even though none of the heiresses are completely likable, they all do things that are bad, I still kind of liked them. The mystery is pretty well-done. There are a lot of people who could be the culprit and I didn't know who the murderer was until they were revealed.The book was a fast read for me, I read it in about a day and a half.

I think I have a little book crush on him! I loved how a lot of the characters, like Paige and Max, were book enthusiasts. Paige's group of friends routinely hang out a bookstore and they show passion for books. I love reading that in novels.The story is lovely.

Putting it together is so simple and you're ready to go in no time.I do like this cleaner. My sister's dog recently stayed for a week and you would not believe how much that dog sheds. But I used this in my kitchen and it picked up a whole bunch of his hair. It looked like the dog had never been there after I was done. I like the dustpan feature of the cleaner. It's great for keeping the debris in and not floating all around your floor. Emptying is really simple too.

"These are the first headphones that I've tried that are for noise suppression, so I wasn't sure what to expect when I tried them for the first time.

I put the battery in and sounds like the washing machine running and birds chirping all went away. There was a definite hush. While I could still hear someone talking to me, it was muffled. I didn't really hear much in a hissing noise when I was wearing them.I listened to some music with these on and while the sound quality of the music isn't the best I've heard, it's not the worst either. Pretty average for music sound quality. The headphones fit comfortably on my head and ears.

"I had fond memories of the Glitter hair Barbie of the 1990's. She had really long hair where you could comb through Barbie's hair with glitter gel and glittery streaks behind. I was expecting this kit to be similar but alas, it was not.There are plenty of warnings on the box about what you should not do. First of all, they want you to know that the glitter and adhesive sheets are to be used on Barbie only, not on children. Also know that the glitter may stain fabrics and should not come into contact with clothing, carpet, walls, or furniture. That alone makes it a little harder to have play time with this Barbie.The glittering process is relatively easy. But the design that comes off is nothing like what is pictured on the box (but then again, how often do things in real life look like what it does on a box or tv commercial?). The glitter comes of as you move Barbie around, so the design doesn't stick around for very long. It's also messy so neat freaks should stay away from this Barbie.However, Barbie does come in a very pretty pink top with a blue sparkly skirt. She has black platform heels and a silver necklace. Her hair is long and silky and should be great for different hairdos.This sounded like a great idea in theory but just doesn't quite work like it should","2.0 out of 5 stars","July 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RC2VHUL207TPQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00T03UAPS#wasThisHelpful","RC2VHUL207TPQ","A3U5CZ3PV82JXD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3U5CZ3PV82JXD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"It was a dark and stormy night when I started this book. Perfect atmosphere for reading ""The Rules"", a scary thriller of a book. The book is all about a group of high school kids who join together for a scavenger hunt organized by August, a boy with a taste of revenge. Everything starts out fun but soon the group realizes that a killer is after each of them. Is it August or is it someone else with revenge on their mind? You'll have to read the book to find out.I've seen my share of scary/slasher flicks and while I'm not obsessed with them, I do enjoy watching them once in awhile. Reading this book was exactly like watching a scary movie. It's in the vein of the Scream series or ""I Know What You Did Last Summer"". It definitely reminded me of a horror movie from the 90's. There were lots of twists and turns and I had to keep reading to find out what was going to happen next. The authors did a great job with building the tension and with the atmosphere. I could actually picture the location and fog in my head. There are quite a few characters in the book, but it's pretty easy to remember them all. Plus, it's not really a spoiler when I say that they don't all end up alive at the end of the book.""The Rules"" is a fast read, I read it in a little over a day.

The skirt is removable but the top part (the sleeves on her arms, the bodice, and the necklace) are all painted and molded on. So if you wanted to put different outfits on the doll, it does limit you somewhat. That's the reason for my four stars instead of five.  The outfit is pretty, though. There are some sparkles on her bodice and in her pink crown. She comes with removable pink shoes. If you press the necklace, a portion of the song ""For the First Time in Forever"" plays.

Lola is the daughter of a famous filmmaker and a famous actress and you think that she's the typical spoiled celebuspawn brat who gets everything. She goes to rehab pretending to be an alcoholic after her sometimes best friend tells her that the rehab that she's at is practically a trip to the spa.From that description, Lola doesn't sound very likable but I found that she really is likable. She's funny, I found myself cracking a smile or laughing a  little while reading. The romance story is typical and not a surprise to the reader but I still enjoyed reading it.

I have a hard time using the regular oven when I try heating up frozen pizzas as the pizza tends to curl up and burn, so I had high hopes for this pizza oven.I was kind of disappointed, though.

But I have to tell you, my faith in her books was a little shaken when I was disappointed by ""Wedding Night"" and ""Shopaholic to the Stars"" (I'm still a little traumatized by what Becky has become), so I was both excited yet leery to reading ""Finding Audrey"", which is her first foray into YA.

The book skirts around what happened to her but it was bad enough that the girls got expelled from their school. And Audrey suffers from depression and severe anxiety  that prevents her from speaking to anyone who isn't in her immediate family or her therapist. She even wears dark sunglasses because she can't bear to have people look in her in the eye. Audrey has a kooky, crazy family. Her mother is a little nutty and is forever trying to get Audrey's brother, Frank, to stop playing video games. Frank's friend Linus, comes to the house and eventually Audrey starts opening up to him and her world begins to expand a little.I really enjoyed reading this book, so much so that I started it around 1 in the afternoon and finished it by 5 in the evening. It's a really quick and enjoyable read. Audrey is an extremely likable character.  I liked that there were Sophie's patented comic touches all over the book. The scenes between Frank and Audrey's mom were always good to lighten the mood. I almost hope that there might be a sequel down the road because I feel like the story of this family isn't quite done yet. Maybe even a story from Frank's perspective. I sincerely hope that Sophie writes more YA novels, in addition to her adult ones because I would definitely read them.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R21WLT45R9LQU5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0553536516#wasThisHelpful","R21WLT45R9LQU5","A3U5CZ3PV82JXD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3U5CZ3PV82JXD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These are really pretty earrings. For me, they are the perfect size. I really dislike huge earrings that are heavier and these earrings are really light and comfortable to wear. My ears also tend to sensitive where I can't wear lower quality earrings because they tend to irritate my ears. But these haven't bugged my ears at all.I really like the combination of the silver along with the blue and white diamond pieces. The blue and white diamonds are very pretty and should go with a variety of outfit color combinations.And while these are not the most expensive earrings, I think that they could go with either casual or dressed up outfits.I'm happy with these earrings and I think you will be too.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1WIVN8M4CYJKU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JXOY19A#wasThisHelpful","R1WIVN8M4CYJKU","A3U5CZ3PV82JXD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3U5CZ3PV82JXD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is an extremely informative guide for anyone looking at information on multitudes of different careers. I definitely wished something like this was available when I was a teenager taking career classes in high school and not having any idea on what I wanted to do.In the introduction, it asks you to think about things like: What interests do you have, the subjects that you are good at, what are your personal qualities, etc. It then lists just about every career that you can think of. Obviously not every single career option is mentioned. But it should help anyone who knows what field they want to go into. The careers are color-coded for easier access. For example, any career in Health and Medicine is in the Pink section of the book. For each career, the pages list things like: Job description, Expected Salary, Necessary Skills, Related Careers.One thing that I wish the book had was maybe some website links to explore careers further online or even links to Career Path quizzes, if those still exist. But overall, I think this is a great book for pre-teens, teens, and even adults who are looking for information on careers they might want.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3VUUTOZV4EDRR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1465429735#wasThisHelpful","R3VUUTOZV4EDRR","A3U5CZ3PV82JXD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3U5CZ3PV82JXD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've read a few of Debbie Macomber's Christmas books but I haven't really read much of her non-Christmas books. I really enjoyed reading ""Last One Home"".There are lots of other reviews that recount the plot so I won't do another re-hash of the story. But Cassie is one awesome book heroine. I found her story to be completely inspirational. I liked that she was able to go through hardships like an abusive husband, unwelcoming sisters, and being poor and be able to come out the way she did. Even though this book was fiction, I would like to think that it would give hope to any woman that may be going through some of the things that Cassie had to go through. There is a romance but it's definitely not the cliche, roll your eyes type of romance novel.

"""Thirteen Chairs"" is a quick, fun, and slightly spooky book. I had a lot of fun reading this book and enjoyed the slight chills that I got reading it.Jack is a curious boy. He enters this dark house where only one room is lit by 12 candles and inhabited by 12 people at a table. His candle becomes the 13th candle and then the storytelling begins. One by one, each person tells a story that is very much spooky, and even sinister in tone. After each person is done, they blow their candle out and it becomes the next turn. What will Jack discover at the end of the night? You'll have to read the book to find out.The thirteen stories in this book are all pretty great. ""Let Me Sleep"", ""The Girl in the Red Coat"", and ""Unputdownable"" were probably my favorite stories. I'm not really the age the audience is going for but this book really reminded me of the R.L. Stine and other ghost story books that I used to read when I was younger.This would be a great book for reading around a campfire, during a sleepover, or during ""a dark and stormy night"".","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1R282EYJPOVRM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0545816653#wasThisHelpful","R1R282EYJPOVRM","A3U5CZ3PV82JXD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3U5CZ3PV82JXD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've heard a lot about Sarah J. Maas around the YA community, so I decided that ""A Court of Thorns and Roses"" would be my first book by her. This is a fantasy book and while I've only read a few books in the high fantasy genre but I do think that even a newbie to the genre, like me, will enjoy this book.The story is really well done. Like others have pointed it out, it's a twist on the Beauty and the Beast story. Sarah J. Maas did a really great job on this. Her writing is really beautiful and draws a reader in.  Feyre is the main character and I really liked her. She's a strong character and really gets the reader to root for her. Tamlin is the male in this book and I guarantee that every reader will be in love with him at the end of the book. The love story is so good. The world that ""A Court of Thorns and Roses"" is set is built is so unbelievably good. Fantastic world building by Sarah J. Maas.If you've read any of Sarah's other books, you're going to like this one. Fans of high fantasy novels will really like this one too.

"This is a great toaster! I really love the stainless steel look. It doesn't matter what your kitchen looks like, this will look great in any kitchen design.This toaster is really easy to use. For the first use, the directions recommend that you set the dial to the level 4 but after that, you can turn it to whatever is your toasted preference. The levels go from 1 to 7. I actually think level is pretty good for getting done but not black toast. There are buttons for when you either put a bagel or frozen food (like waffles or toasted pastries). There is also a 'cancel' button just in case you need your food out immediately. There is a crumb catcher down in the bottom of the toaster, don't forget to empty that!!I'm really happy with this toaster and I would definitely recommended this Black & Decker one","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RC7WAGV7O99FV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LU2HVAO#wasThisHelpful","RC7WAGV7O99FV","A3U5CZ3PV82JXD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3U5CZ3PV82JXD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is my first Dyson and I absolutely love it. Let me tell you, the price might be a little scary but this Dyson vacuum is totally worthy of all the hype that Dyson products receive.When you open the package, the vacuum will need to be put together. But it's super easy and should take you no more than 10 minutes. The directions are in pictures but I didn't find it hard to understand at all. First I used the Dyson to vacuum out a winters worth of salt and other junk in my car. I used one of the brush attachments and it was so easy to clean. It was easy to get into the corners and hard to reach parts of the car. Then I used the Dyson to vacuum the house and was amazed on what I was able to pick up even though I had vacuumed the week before.This is really easy to carry around. I was able to vacuum the stairs without having to lug around a heavy thing like I used to. To empty the canister is super easy. Just a click of a button to detach it, another click of a button to empty the canister over a trash, and then it's a cinch to click it back into place. So easy.I'm really happy with this Dyson. I'm not really into vacuuming (it's one of my least favorite chores) but with this Dyson, it makes vacuuming a lot easier and maybe a little more fun.

"It's always been a dream of mine to visit Paris and with this guide, if I do go, sight-seeing will be so easy. Lonely Planet has some of the best books on travel and this Paris version is no exception. The pocket size is perfect so you can either put it in your pocket or a purse. It's small size is discreet too, so you won't end up looking really touristy if you have it out on the street.For such a small book, it has a ton of information. It covers the things that all visitors do-like visit places like the Eiffel Tower, Arc de Triomphe, Notre Dame etc. but it also tries to cover places that where more Parisians go instead of tourists. I like this book because it presents little tidbits of history along with other information in talking about certain places. It also has lists like ""Best Drinking"", ""Best for Kids"", ""Best History"", so the lists will help if you're not sure where to go. There is lots more information than just that but it would take forever to go over it all.Overall, this is an awesome guide and I would definitely recommend it if you are considering a trip to Paris.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R314T7VUHYIBFH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1742208908#wasThisHelpful","R314T7VUHYIBFH","A3U5CZ3PV82JXD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3U5CZ3PV82JXD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Over all impression of this platform?  Jack of some trades, master of none... some of its faults are from Pioneer, some from physical shortcomings of using touch while driving, some from the implementation of AppRadio, some from CarPlay, some from Android's shortcomings and in general lack of focus from one entity that should have made its ecosystem work together cohesively.I am chopping my review into  4 sections:1. Using touch screen and multitouch while driving:The Pioneer GUI is not optimized for driving.  Its touch screen buttons are small in comparison and require driver focus for proper operation.  Unlike physical buttons, the small buttons (i.e. volume up/down/ mode) are way too small for driving purposes.  Smallest bumps in the road will make your fingers miss its intended target. I often find that I need to anchor my hand with my other fingers on the dash before completing routine tasks like raising or lowering the volume.2. Pioneer GUI.This unit's GUI is designed by an amateur who is not concerned about driver safety.  The screen is generally cluttered with graphical nonsense at the expense of using small fonts to display important information you need at a glance!  Sometimes there is this vast field of emptiness being underutilized at the expense of functionality! For instance, when you're in AM/FM mode and the screen shows 6 preset station buttons that are about the size of dime with the rest of the screen being wasted on nothing!  The tune buttons are also hysterically small but perhaps the biggest issues are with the way the information is displayed on the screen... For the life of me, I can't fathom why with the big screen, there is such a wide use of small fonts while a big portion of the screen remains unused!While you're not moving this is not an issue, but how about making these buttons bigger for operations while driving... the GUI is filled with an incomplete approach to Graphical user interface.  As a Programmer and a tech heavy person, this unit lacks a fundamental approach to user interface.There are little bugs all over the place:  For instance, if you want to mute this device, you have to press the volume buttons first, then you have to look below the screen to see a small mute button which already has an X on it.  (it should get the x after you press it not before or at least change colors)  You'll never really quite know if the device is muted by just looking at the screen and worse, you can't just un-mute it if you simply pressed the volume up/down buttons automatically!  It stays muted until you press the mute button again a second time!  The system is completely inundated with poor user interaction, once you factor in that most of what you need to do requires your attention while driving, your blood pressure and heart rate goes up!3. CarPlayApple's CarPlay has promise but its frustrating on its own accord.  There are apps that I don't use.. but I can't remove/reorder these apps and I must have these apps on my screen even if I will never use them.  I can't add my own apps, Apple's Maps continues to play catch up to other platforms.  It's GUI is also subject to inconsistencies. For instance, I could be listening to a playlist in iTunes; you might think it would default to the playlist or the last place I was in iTunes when I left the car, but instead it defaults to iTunes Radio proudly emphasizing ""network not available"" because I am not an iTunes Radio subscriber!  Now I ask you, shouldn't Apple be smart enough to eliminate this option from my choices while I am in the car?  So in short, while CarPlay is probably one of the best Car OSes out there, it's simply like asking who is the most kind mass murderer in history!  And yes while you can stomach Siri's refusal to work when you need it most while you are not on the road, there is a whole new level of frustration dealing with siri while youre on the road.... oh and you lose ""hey siri"" so in order for you to use your phone handsfree, first you have to use your hands to press the home button!4. Android:If you are going to buy this for your Android phone and you are going to use it with MirrorPlay... let me just tell you to drop any ambitions of using this with an Android phone using any Android feature unless you're simply going to use the bluetooth basics to answer incoming calls or making outgoing calls....In conclusion: the most frustrating part of this is that it could be so much more but no one has really taken the time to look at this system holistically, it's simply a hodgepodge of functions thrown together from different manufacturers that are barely competent enough to deliver on some of their promises.  Frustration is considered a virtue here!(I purchased my unit at PC Richards because they install for free)","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3SVDG1XQOTY71/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00O8B7CFS#wasThisHelpful","R3SVDG1XQOTY71","A3IC0CD2QI21UE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3IC0CD2QI21UE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Very few people here could actually tell you if the device's radar capability is any good as compared to other devices.  I am not versed enough in all detectors out there to know where this matches up too!  Unless you actually set up a real life testing criteria where you try several detectors against various radar traps, no one can tell you if the premium you're paying for this is actually worth the claim the manufacturer makes.I purchased this 7 months ago. The lighter power adapter shorted about 2 months ago. It actually disabled my car. The battery light came on and I had to pull in to a station, remove the extremely hot adapter from the cigaret lighter, get a jump start to my car and go on my way.  I haven't called Escort to see how well they support their product. As  Waze (phone app)  is proving pretty sufficient for my needs.This product's industrial design is sorely lacking.  If you like the minimalist look, this device fails at basic design.  It doesn't complement the interior of my car at all.  I don't know why units like these can't just be small little black boxes?  Why does this thing have to look like a 1970's movie director's idea of a spaceship? As far as ergonomics go;  forget about using the control buttons without actually removing the device from the suction cup!The GPS is basic.  In that it doesn't recognize where you are,  It simply feeds the GPS coordinates to a database and if there is a match for a camera, it will alert you.  It doesn't take in to count where you were to know if the Camera is on your path or above you in an overpass.  Often it can't distinguish between the service road or the highway, so you get a lot of false camera alerts all the time.I find Apps like Waze do a far more effective job at registering police units on the road.  I was also quiet concerned while this unit was working, there were many-many instances where I passed by police cars and were not alerted at all... as if they didn't have their radar guns aimed at me!  Now I don't know if they were not tracking me by radar or the detector failed!The suction cup mount is worthless!

"I own each tool here, I am going to review this in 3 parts, first I will give my feelings about this bundle, then I will give my feelings about the company and the tools.This Bundle:I am currently looking at the Amazon special for $169 (75% off). At first glance this price is tremendously attractive, however when you purchase these tools separately, they do come with more accessories and tool bits, therefore this is probably not as great of a deal as it appears to be. I think the person who should buy this bundle should be the person who is set to buy the most expensive tool in this bundle (the Saw max), otherwise skip it and move on and buy the tool you need individually. the soft carry case is also useless for this products category. As you know, these tools become useful with attachments and specialized bits. Can you imagine having to store these tiny bits for three different tools in one case? Neither can I! Purchasing these separately gives you the hard-cover-case and each is thoughtfully designed to store bits appropriate for the tool in its own compartment. So in conclusion, there are less attachments and tool bits and there is little value for the carry case. Therefore this makes the price in my opinion as not attractive but deceptive. I am giving this price bundle a 2 out of 5 stars but if you need the SawMax then bump the rating to 3 out of 5 stars (but only if you don't need to buy the non-included bits and pieces)Dremel the Company:Look, every company has to make money to survive, Dremel is no exception so what I am saying below is not a mark against Dremel. You just need to be comfortable with what you get. The company's business is similar to the inkjet printer model where you buy a printer (think these tools) at a reasonable cost but pay dearly for ink (think tool bits). Since most if not all of these tools have non-standardized tool bits, then you're not going to enjoy the benefit of having other manufacturers compete for your tool-bit dollar.The Tools:these tools excel at niche projects, they are not for everything or everyone. they are surprisingly versatile and effective for certain projects. In my opinion people who cut these tools down did not correctly assess these tools for the applied projects and simply made uninformed decision in purchasing these tools.Most of these these tools are great for one-offs.. for example, you can probably use the SawMax's masonry bit to cut a kitchen-flooring tile or replace a broken tile in the bathroom...but if you're gonna cut enough titles to do two bathrooms a kitchen and then need to cut some granite, then don't bother with this tool for tiling purposes... The basic formula for these tools are applications where finesse is more important than brute force, they're simply not continuous-use tools (as in don't go cutting 20 2x4s in one pass) maybe cut 2 or 3, rev-down your saw for a bit and then move on to the next batch...SawMax:If you're doing engineered wood flooring, I highly recommend the SawMax as it traces alongside the wall perfectly and cuts pieces to match the wall's curvature, corners and (most importantly) imperfections without any measurements whatsoever. This is the only single use niche reason I find for the Sawmax to exist on its own and it's a big one in my opinion. Otherwise there are more robust tools out there. (FYI, this is a horrible tool for cutting 2x4s even with the special attachment)... this tool also comes in handy for cutting plywood, counter tops or in general where you would need to use a jig saw in stright lines (think cutting out sink blueprints on laminate counter-tops). What I don't like about it is the smell of a burning electric motor/plastic when it's revving for too long.. especially when you're cutting a few porcelain tiles or granite.... (do buy the vacuum cleaner attachment, it works great....now this is a $4 piece of rubber that you buy for around $15 and it's the only one that fits your tool!.. see what I mean? That's how Dremel makes money)Multi-Max:I think this is probably the least likely case for buying this bundle. If this is what you need, move on to another manufacturer, something more robust and less costly tool bits. I found myself buying another tool after this one and now my multi-max hardly ever gets used. I just think there are better solutions out there, not that this tool is useless.3000-rotary tool.Chances are you already have this tool, if not then buy this tool regardless, it is by far one of the most versatile tools in my arsenal. At around $65 this individual bundle (Dremel 3000-1/24 1 Attachment/24 Accessories Rotary Tool) gives you a much better deal than what you see with this bundle.I hope you found this review useful, generally speaking; ""marketing"" tool bundles like this is rarely as good as a price they make it out to be especially if the business is centered around selling you tool bits.Special Message for Dremel Sales Employees:If you're reading this, in future, please consider bundling your existing kits instead of this kind of bundle.  Your engineers already spent a lot of time thinking about the tool and its uses and create these great cases and include the most useful attachments and bits upfront.  This little advantage was not forwarded to this bundle making its value sub-par. You're a quality name because you sell solutions to problems.  the only thing this bundle solves is your problem at the bank ! :-)","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 28, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R35YZC5PQA1HL7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BLJ3AR4#wasThisHelpful","R35YZC5PQA1HL7","A3IC0CD2QI21UE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3IC0CD2QI21UE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Greetings,I am going to use Apple's ear-buds as a point of reference, the score is as compared to Apple's.I am breaking down my rating in to the following subcategories:* Design: 3 stars (the cable is uber-white, the speakers are tiny and unobtrusive)* Construction: 1 star, you have to turn the earbuds jack in the socket and fish around for a sweet spot to be able to get clear sound.* Sound Quality: 2 stars (sound is flat, terrible is low, Bass is dull and the range is just ordinary)* Quality: 2 stars: unfortunately the quality of the cable is poor and it is prone to getting tangled.* Noise cancelling: 4 stars (I can't believe that at $12-$13 this actually worked)* Fit: 3 stars (this is subjective, but it does come with 3 sets of silicon-cones to fit your ear)I bought these to use on the treadmill at my Gym, when I connect these to my shuffle, they work as intended, but it seems connecting them to something with a little more power produces crackling and sporadic electric shock!  Not sure if that's because I was sweating or the buds themselves, in either case I do not recommend these for anything beyond an MP3 player use.I hope this helped you make a decision, unfortunately the hassle of returning these makes the purchase final for me.  I would not buy these again.  I am looking for something I can run with and I would like to be able to forgive myself for leaving them behind in the gym, so if you know of a pair that would fit my requirement, please chime in with your advice...I know there are some really great ones at $70-$100 but I couldn't forgive myself for leaving them behind in the gym!Thanks","2.0 out of 5 stars","June 21, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1R244QYHAIXS8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007EVGHEG#wasThisHelpful","R1R244QYHAIXS8","A3IC0CD2QI21UE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3IC0CD2QI21UE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The quality of this tool is abysmal. The only thing going for it is the concept.  It is a nice thought but implemented horridly. The tool's storage compartment is worthless, some bits fit the bit-corral in the handle, some fall out and some are in there so tight that you need pliers to pull them out (or reinsert them back in).  The cocking action to raise the corral out of the handle is wobbly and feels like it will break....I do think this is a re-branded Stanley tool, they're just trying to get a premium for the Dewalt name.  Stanley Tools has a bad habit of ruining the reputation of the companies they takeover by producing cheap Chinese made gear and passing it under the pedigree of marquee brands... what a shame!","2.0 out of 5 stars","June 18, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RH2XN3WNUWENE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006TVOX98#wasThisHelpful","RH2XN3WNUWENE","A3IC0CD2QI21UE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3IC0CD2QI21UE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This product is useable, the sound quality is OK, certainly well worth the price at $12.  However, in my opinion and for my use, it is inadequate.  I bought these because my stock Apple Headphone for my shuffle keeps falling out of my ears when I run.  The good news for me is that these fit my ears perfectly, the bad news?  I can't believe an engineer would make a product with such thick cords.  The cables are obscenely thick... as in 1/4"" wide!  (think of wearing extension cords on your body!) and when I run, the weight of the cord flopping around inevitably  yanks the buds out of my ear.I would have never made the purchase if I saw these at a store..  if you're an active person, you should consider something else!","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 11, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RCLXX6WFCR7KP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009NSMS78#wasThisHelpful","RCLXX6WFCR7KP","A3IC0CD2QI21UE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3IC0CD2QI21UE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought these shoes unseen, I never saw it at a retail store before ordering them, it was an impulse buy (Amazon special). Upon arrival, at first I thought the quality was lacking just from touching the material but that is somewhat misleading because the focus is obviously on making this shoe light.  I do find the fit to be somewhat lacking but fit is no reason to discredit the design of any shoe because it is highly subjective.  My feet (although not wide) are having a snugger than normal fit inside the housing.  So if your foot is on the smaller size for your measurement, you should do very well. It has a nice wide platform which distributes the impact shock very nicely to the right spots on your foot.  I took them for a 10 mile run, they performed well.So why did I give it 4 stars?Because for the money, you get a lot of performance.  Of course at this point I am not sure how long the shoes will last.Compared to my Nike Air /Air max 2012/2013 it falls short in comfort and versatility; these aren't necessarily great for cross training so for the days I plan to run in the gym and cross train, I take 2 pairs of shoes with me.The colors are surprisingly stylish (Navy/Silver/Orange) combo works well, the silver is a little too shinny but I can live with that.  I have not used them at night so I dont know how good they reflect headlights.Take a gamble on these, they're good enough. Probably one of the best in the low-price category for running.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 3, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3JG5ATJ6D5KUE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006MQPWM2#wasThisHelpful","R3JG5ATJ6D5KUE","A3IC0CD2QI21UE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3IC0CD2QI21UE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is installed in a Honda CRV; the speaker is in a constant battle with road-noise specially if you're on the highway.  The microphone works well, the problem is that you can't hear the person you're talking to half the time.  I have come to the conclusion that unless the bluetooth device is automatically pairing with your phone when you first get in, it's not worth getting these types of devices because you will forget  to pair your phone 1/2 the time before you start driving. (By that I mean you have to turn on the device which could be while receiving a phone call)  I have other IOGEAR stuff and generally like the build quality and the thoughtfulness behind its designs.

"This little guy gave Hurricane Sandy a licking!  My gas powered saw was on the fritz so I ordered this from Amazon as two trees fell near my house (40' feet high and about 16"" in diameter).  This saw was a godsend.  Within 5 hours, I had both trees and every limb chopped in 3-foot sections.  (Needless to say the cutting was the easy part.)This Saw is stingy with oil; it used the proper amount and matched what the manufacturer had claimed.  The tool-free chain tightening is extremely handy.  I was also impressed with the quality of the chain. Cleaning the unit is very easy and I liked the safety kickback on/off lever.The only complaint I have is the storage-sleeve for the blade when not in use.  I think the quality could have been better, this is the only piece where the cheap feel showed through to match the price.  But honestly, it is not a big deal.  If you're looking for a great alternative to gas-powered saw for quick jobs, this is a great candidate.  It served me well.  I am certainly going to go to this little guy before hassling with my gas powered monster.  Buy it, you wont regret it.I read a few reviews here which I do not agree with so here is my take;1. Someone complained that the chain-rotating gear is plastic.  This is not true, it is a metal piece.2. If you actually bother to read the instructions, the manufacturer explicitly states that this is not a Saw for constant use.  In other words, don't daydream about being a logger.  Some reviewers had expected something more.  So have your expectations match the engineering-intent behind  the tool's tolerance.  Understand that for $60, you're getting a disposable saw, in other words, I don't expect anyone to be able to fix this at a reasonable price after it breaks down.  It's probably cheaper to just go ahead and buy another one.  I will again, in a heartbeat.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 15, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2GWMAN8WCAAOF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003PON3B6#wasThisHelpful","R2GWMAN8WCAAOF","A3IC0CD2QI21UE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3IC0CD2QI21UE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I made this purchase 5 months ago; Awesome buy.  Both units have surpassed my expectations.  The hammerdrill's torque is awesome, great clutch and I can not say enough impressive comments about the battery and the chuck assembly.  The settings are customizable in a logical and productive manner.I think the Impact driver is just beautiful.  It knows when and where to stop forcing the screw in like magic.  Much better than my other XXXXXXX brand Impact driver.Before buying this, my only concern was a comment I saw about the Nano batteries... there was a complaint about how the units stop working once the power is drained instead of just winding down gradually... well it turns out these batteries never go to Empty/Full on any charge/discharge cycle.  That means, the battery decides to stop working once its charge depletes down to a certain mark (I don't know what).  It does this for one reason... Longevity... it turns out this is one reason why these last 2000 charge cycles... while it would have been nice to have an indicator telling you how much charge you have left, I really don't see it as a deal breaker.Great drills, I became a fan in no-time.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 2, 2010","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1DFM5AXOJBZ69/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001UHOUVC#wasThisHelpful","R1DFM5AXOJBZ69","A3IC0CD2QI21UE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3IC0CD2QI21UE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Lead Acid batteries don't last long... on flashlight mode, the juice runs out in 10 minutes... and just in case you don't know this about LA batteries, they're only good for about 300 cycles before the battery's ability to hold full charge goes down.What's worse is that this unit doesn't hold the charge for a long time.  Meaning, if you have a full charge and don't use it for a couple of months, you might not have any juice left to turn it on.This was a pathetic purchase for me.

"This unit's specifications is the reasons why I bought it.  Having had no experience with Gateway/Acer, I decided to take the plunge head-first.The unit arrived with panels not installed properly.. ie when the DVD tray would open, various panels would pop out of its housing... Obviously quality control prior to packaging was lacking to say the least.......And then there was no video!  Nothing at all.... I tried the HDMI and the DVI ports.  The V.card was certainly getting power as the fan on the card was spitting out plenty of hot air.Next I noticed that the USB bus would only power up randomly no matter what port I used.. obviously something was drastically wrong somewhere.. perhaps a faulty motherboard...I was able to overlook all of these as an innocent oversight, however after contacting Gateway's support it became clear that the culture of delivering lousy products didn't end with lousy quality control.For its part, Amazon promptly refunded my money with no hassles and paid for me to ship this junk back.Buyer beware.NEVER AGAIN will I buy anything Acer or Gateway.","1.0 out of 5 stars","September 2, 2010","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2YJX2ESUJY2U1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0031U1J2E#wasThisHelpful","R2YJX2ESUJY2U1","A3IC0CD2QI21UE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3IC0CD2QI21UE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"We have used a gas powered interchangeable system that is a true powerhouse, however, for the ladies of the house that want to go out and do trimming, it's just too heavy and cumbersome for them. The OREGON 40 Volt MAX HT250-E6 Hedge Trimmer Kit is perfect for light trimming and the gals love it. It is quiet, trims decently and is quite light which makes it easy to handle and with a nice long bar, it has a good long reach. The battery powered unit is so easy to start - just a touch of the button and you're off. The pack has indicator lights to show how much power is left.We had some snow damaged junipers that needed a serious trim back. This trimmer did a decent job, but I'm going to disagree with the statement that it can cut up to a 3/4"" branch since a half inch gave it a workout and lugged it right down and gave it some problems. It doesn't cut branches very cleanly, instead it shreds them (see photo). But for light work and quick trimming jobs, you can't beat this trimmer. We just wanted to hack off most of the problems on the junipers and will go back and clean them up by hand.One issue we seem to have with this trimmer is the trimmer doesn't always turn on. You need to push the safety button back then you can turn it on, but when the button is pushed, it doesn't always start. This has been consistent with everyone in the household, so I know it's not just me doing something incorrectly.The gals give it two thumbs up since it made their work much easier!","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R342W3TFLZMRWW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BD02N7O#wasThisHelpful","R342W3TFLZMRWW","A21SESEJ8E52B7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A21SESEJ8E52B7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"First let me state, if you wear glasses, the Jackson Safety 25675 V50 Calico Polycarbonate Anti Fog Safety Eyewear in Smoke won't work for you. These safety glasses were designed for someone who either wears contacts or no corrective eyewear at all. With that said, these glasses are adjustable and will work for both female and male. Our son and daughter as well as each of us tried them on and found they fit everyone - although not all the same way. They are quite comfortable and have padding all around the eyepieces so that nothing can easily fall into the eyes. They are much like wearing goggles in that aspect. They go on easily, pull off easily and do not fog. So far, I've not had any problem with fogging, so the anti-fog seems to work well. As for being impact-resistant, I cannot attest to that first hand.The glasses come with a band that is interchangeable with the arms. The arms have tabs that push in so they can be removed and then the band snaps into their place. The tabs aren't the easiest to push to remove the arms or band. The band can only fit one way - with a definite left/right insertion. This turns the glasses into goggles for the times you really need it.The insert says these are 99% effective against UV rays. There are other listings of telling the type of protection as well as how they meet OSHA's standards.Glasses can only be cleaned with water and a soft cloth. If you need to clean them off with something else or disinfect them, you will need to contact the manufacturer. There is a place listed on the insert to do so.Overall the Jackson Safety 25675 V50 Calico Polycarbonate Anti Fog Safety Eyewear in Smoke are really nice glasses and seem to do the job well. Sadly they don't list they will not go over glasses which won't work for 2 of the 4 members of our family.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3CTT4U647OM9X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EAYXO46#wasThisHelpful","R3CTT4U647OM9X","A21SESEJ8E52B7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A21SESEJ8E52B7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am very pleased with the performance of the Hefty Slider Storage Bags in the Quart size. These bags are strong and quite tough for just being storage bags. The seal seals very well, however I have found that I get a little air leakage around the zipper pull where it meets up with the bag edge. For just storing things like fruit, cookies, sandwiches, etc., I really don't see a problem. They do seal better than the Ziploc bags and the seal is much more dependable, especially when using liquids. We've filled the Hefty and a Ziploc with just air and pressed down on them hard - the Ziploc failed before the Hefty. That's quite impressive. It tells me that when certain hands are digging through the fridge and drop one of these bags, I'm not going to have a huge mess to clean up!Would I recommend the Hefty Slider Storage Bags in the Quart size to family and friends? You bet! In fact, they have found a permanent place on my shelves!","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1F7EM9ZATXOAY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000E0FZQ0#wasThisHelpful","R1F7EM9ZATXOAY","A21SESEJ8E52B7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A21SESEJ8E52B7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When one opens the AllerEase Hot Water Washable Allergy Protection Mattress Pad the first thing that is noticed is the nice feel of the fabric and the weight. This is not one of those cheap covers that claim they protect from allergens. This one is well made, nice fabric topper with a padded/quilted side and does not make the user suffer with night sweats because it doesn't breathe.The pad truly does go from a scalding hot wash to the dryer and doesn't shrink or look like it had just been abused by hot water. It comes out clean and fresh and fits nicely on the bed. I have a 10"" deep mattress and this fits wonderfully on it! It seems to protect both the allergy sufferer as well as the mattress.I'm very impressed with the AllerEase Hot Water Washable Allergy Protection Mattress Pad and would most definitely recommend it to my family and friends.

"The Flatworld Kite - Large Easy Flyer - Series Premium Quality Nylon Stunt Kite is not only eye-catching and beautiful, but it flies nicely. The kite itself is made of brightly colored nylon and comes partially assembled. You have to install the upper and lower spreaders and attach the kite string, but that's it. The kite does not come with any instructions, but a quick search on the net should help the beginner if there are any questions on putting it together or how to fly.The Flatworld Kite - Large Easy Flyer - Series Premium Quality Nylon Stunt Kite comes in a nylon storage bag. This is great for keeping your kite clean and together - no more lost or broken pieces and keeps it ready to go at a moment's notice.

"The Cootree QCY Bluetooth 4.1 Portable Mini Lightweight Wireless Sports Headphone has an interesting design. The black/yellow colorscheme is bright and easy to see (and find if you by chance misplace it).These angled buds tuck into the ear canal and stay in place with soft silicone tips. There is also an ear ring/clip that tucks into the fold of your ear for a more secure placement. There is only one correct way to place these in your ear. If you look carefully on the black earpiece, you will find a very small R and L that is on the inside of the piece at the bottom just above where the earpiece joins to the wire. This will insure a correct and comfortable placement.Bluetooth pairing is quick and easy. I'm pleased with how quickly these paired with my devices. The left earpiece has a very well covered USB charging jack that is well designed to keep water/sweat out. On the right earpiece is the volume control, pairing button and a microphone. The volume control takes a little getting used to, however once you do, it is easy to use.The The Cootree QCY Bluetooth 4.1 Portable Mini Lightweight Wireless Sports Headphone are good sounding phones. They have decent range, fit well in the ear and don't fall out, are comfortable and block out outside noise. I have not had any problem with ear pain or with the buds falling out when doing my morning routines. These are a nice set of wireless earphones that are perfect for workouts as well as just wearing around when you don't want to be attached to anything.Disclosure: This is an HONEST review regarding a sample I received for testing purposes.

"Never in a million years would I have thought I'd own a Selfie Stick - especially at my age. However, when my first child graduated, I discovered how difficult it was to find a place to set a camera, set the timer and get a good group photo. If that's not an option, it also can be difficult finding someone else to take the group photo. It means handing your camera to a stranger or having someone not in the photo. That's when I knew we had to find another option for the next big event.The Cootree KS-01 Extendable Bluetooth Wireless Handheld Selfie Pole has been the answer to that problem for us. This monopole is well constructed with a metal swivel and it extends out without bowing from the weight of the camera at the end being too heavy for the length. The pole has bluetooth so it allows for easy thumb control to take your photos. It also has a wrist strap for easy carrying. The clamp is adjustable and can be used with numerous brands of phones. I have a BLU phone and it works wonderfully with it!The Cootree KS-01 Extendable Bluetooth Wireless Handheld Selfie Pole is definitely a product that I would recommend to my family and friends.

"The Cootree BE318 3.5mm In-ear earphones have a very modern look to them that would appeal to both male and female listeners. The metal looking ear buds are a sharp addition to the black and red ribbon type cord. The jack is a straight connection that has a tapered and reinforced transition from the jack to the cord. Where the cord splits is a metal/plastic reinforcement that will prevent these from pulling/splitting apart easily. The buds are covered with silicone sleeves/tips that are comfortable to wear for long periods of time. They fit into the canal and do a great job blocking out outside noise.So they look great, but what about sound? The Cootree BE318 3.5mm In-ear earphones sound quite amazing. They have a nice wide range with decent highs, a good mid-range and a bumping base that you can feel - even at very low volume levels. I can't wear most buds because they become painful from fit as well as well as the sound. These are really comfortable and they don't cause ear pain since I can listen to the music on very low levels and still not be distracted by outside noise. The cord is flat, so there is no cord sound when you move.Would I recommend the Cootree BE318 3.5mm In-ear earphones to family and friends? YES! These are really nice earphones - especially in the price range they are listed in. They've beaten out some of the more expensive earphones I've purchased in the past.

"The Avery Index Maker Clear Pocket Clear Label Plastic Dividers, 8-Tab Set is perfect for the student as well as anyone who needs pockets to place their additional papers that cannot be punched or for someone who likes to store and file all at once. For me, it's the former. I get many handouts that don't have the margin space to allow me to punch and I don't like using protectors because they stick out from the rest of the papers, so I end up with them all in the back of the binder. This system is perfect for me, as I can just pop them in the pocket of the corresponding tab. Each pocket is supposed to hold up to 70 sheets of standard weight paper, but I didn't get that many in.The labels are easy to create by going to the online template found at Avery's website. Since each printer prints just a bit differently, I would suggest printing out a test sheet before doing the actual printing on the labels. Then it's easy going from there. Just align the labels with the divider tabs (all of them at once) and as easy as a swipe of the finger, they are all adhered!The Avery Index Maker Clear Pocket Clear Label Plastic Dividers, 8-Tab Set is just another fine example of the wonderful office and school products Avery has to offer!","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3PE8TLE3SUCZ8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00O48PZ6S#wasThisHelpful","R3PE8TLE3SUCZ8","A21SESEJ8E52B7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A21SESEJ8E52B7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm always game to try new products, so when I stumbled upon the M&M's White Chocolate Carrot Cake at our local store, I grabbed a package and took them home with high hopes. The candies are a little fatter and larger than regular M&M's and they are in pretty spring colors. The center looks like white chocolate but the flavor is of a very strong cinnamon. I've never had any carrot cake that has come close in flavor to these candies. Instead, they have more of a cinnamon roll taste - and a strong cinnamon roll at that.The M&M's White Chocolate Carrot Cake is interesting, but nothing I'd buy again.

"The attractive real wood design of the Symphonized NRG Premium Genuine Wood In-ear Noise-isolating Headphones with Mic caught my eye right away. From the gorgeous wood earpieces to the bright yellow woven cord covered wires, these look very stylish. But any audiophile knows when it comes to sound, stylish looks don't mean anything - the sound is what matters. With these lovely headphones - sound is not sacrificed for beauty in any way!Much though appears to have been given when these headphones were designed. The wood give a full rich sound and when it comes to deep base, I swear I can feel these move just a bit when those tones are hit. The cording gives extra protection and strength to the wires. Where the wires attach to the plugs, merge into one wire (or split into two) as well as at the jack, there is a rubber reinforcement at these stress points. The jack comes out of your device at a 45 degree angle which is different than any other set of phones that I have. They also come with 6 pair of silicone ear bud covers - 3 clear and 3 brown so you can find the ones that fit your ears as well as the ones that fit your taste. These make the headphones extremely comfortable as well as cancels out the noise for a peaceful listening experience. One thing I'll note though, it appears these are not soundless to others around you. According to family, they can hear a little bleed-through when I'm listening to them.

"Chinese Turkestan: A Photographic Journey Through an Ancient Civilization could have been a remarkable book instead of just good. All photos are in black and white and set a mood that enhances the photographs. Color photos would have been stunning, but the black and white format turned these into something much more amazing. Ryan Pyle is a true artist that can create many emotions through his photos. Sadly, sometimes this was lost because of the way the book was bound. Here is a book that NEEDS to be a coffee table type - one where you can gaze at the clear and well laid out pictures. Unfortunately, this book is much smaller and there was nothing that allowed for the 2 page photographs to be nicely viewed. The photos were ruined by the seams of the book. I would have expected that there be wider margins so that the photo would not be destroyed by a seam. One example is a photo of a livestock trader where the seam runs right through the middle of his face creating a cyclopes looking form instead of being able to see the man's face. This person is the center of attention and we cannot view him easily.Here's a book that I give 5 stars to the gorgeous photography yet only a 1 star for the binding.Disclosure: This is an HONEST review regarding a sample I received for testing purposes.

"The DII 100% Polyester, Machine Washable, Tonal Bordered Fabric Tablecloth, 60 x 84 is a very versatile tablecloth. The color scheme and the fabric can be used formally as well as informally.The linen look weave complete with slubs and uneven thread sizes makes it look much more expensive but is so much easier to clean than linen.All seams were neat and tidy and there were no loose threads. The cream color top is separated from the tan bottom by a decorative weave, giving a nice touch of elegance. The corner squares are a darker tan and would be an elegant place for embroidered initials or other decorative stitches. I have a wood table that shows through the cream some. Personally, I'm not fond of that look, so I usually put a liner of some sort (usually white) underneath to keep the colors true.This cloth washes up nicely. I did notice a small dark spot on the cream straight out of the package. I washed it, but it didn't come out during the first washing. It appears to be a grease stain instead of dirt. It's in an inconspicuous spot, so I'm not overly worried about it, but I'm not thrilled to find something like this straight out of the package.

"I use cheesecloth in both kitchen and herbal applications for years and haven't been completely satisfied with the cloth I've been using. When I was asked if I'd like to test the Unbleached Cheesecloth Fabric Food Grade 90, I jumped at the chance. This cloth is just what I have been wanting. It has a close weave and one doesn't have to use as much as the ""other stuff"" to get a good result.

"Purchased for my pug.  I put a small spoonful of peanut butter in each end and it keeps him entertained for about an hour.  It comes in handy when I need him to settle down when he gets too hyper.  He chews on it some, but mostly works to lick out the peanut butter.  For chewing he prefers his Boss Treat Loadable Chew Stick (small).  I purchased the larger size of this DuraChew (the Souper) for my boxer.  The boxer both licks and chews on his DuraChew.  I think this is just a little too hard and large for the pug, compared to his favorite chew toy.

"This treat loadable rubber chew toy is very hard to find, and it is my pug's absolute favorite toy.  I initially loaded his original Boss Treat Loading Chew Stick's little crevices with hard cat treats, but after he chewed on it a few times, I didn't have to reload it with treats.  He chewed the original one Santa put in his stocking down to a nub.  We finally had to throw it away when it became small enough to be a choking hazard.

"Streaming was more expensive ($6) for this movie than other titles.  I had expected to enjoy the movie, and thought I would want to watch it again sometime, it so I ponied up a few more dollars to buy the title.  Big mistake.  I didn't hate the movie, but I don't think I will ever watch it again.  I feel like my upgrade to purchase over rent was just a charitable donation to the fat wallet movie studios.Despite the wild fantasies and the beautiful cinematography, the movie felt slow.  I have read the short story, and the movie is a complete rework and departure from the original.  The audience at our house consisted of three adults and two preteen girls.  The girls one after the other decided to go to bed rather than finish the movie, and both men fell asleep watching the movie.  I was the only person of the five who watched the whole film, and I was far from dazzled.

"If a warranty or customer support is important to you, purchase your faucet from a different seller.I purchased this faucet from Yodel.  The faucet was fulfilled by Amazon.  Shipping was prompt, and item was well packed.  Faucet is beautiful and works great.My complaint is that the description clearly states lifetime warranty.  No warranty information or manufacturer contact information was enclosed.  A manual for a different faucet with very little information was the only documentation enclosed.  I contacted Amazon, who offered a refund and also the contact information for Yodel at yodelsales@gmail.com.  I wrote to Yodel on March 15.  It has been 40 days, and I have still not received a reply.  I wrote to Amazon again on March 31 letting them know that Yodel was unresponsive.  Amazon has been wonderfully responsive, offering refund or discount.  I had already paid a plumber to install the faucet right after receiving it, so a refund isn't a viable option.  I have accepted that my beautiful faucet will likely be a ""disposable"" faucet should it ever have a problem.If you don't mind having a disposable faucet, I think the faucet is wonderful.  I wish I had bought one like this design years ago.

"This mascara is clumpy, crumbly, and for lack of another word, gummy.  I bought waterproof hoping to avoid raccoon eyes.  No luck here.  It goes on kind of clumpy, possibly because the brush is so over sized -- and I have somewhat large eyes.  After it dries it takes on a kind of gummy texture and crumbles onto your face and into your eyes, and also smudges under the eyes.  I have tried changing my cleansing routine, powdering my eyelashes, not powdering my eyelashes, but all for naught.  I think this is just a bad product.  I like a ""plush"" type brush and am looking for a long lasting mascara.  I really like a washable one if I can find one that doesn't smudge over the course of the day.

"A coworker told me about the Victor BlackBox gopher trap recently when I was complaining that our exterminator had retired and the gophers were starting to move back into our orchard.  Other coworkers chimed in to say they were having gopher problems too.  I ordered traps for myself and 4 friends with my Amazon Prime.On my coworkers' recommendation I purchased two.  He told me gophers often have two exits at angles from their mounds.  He told me to use a long screwdriver or similar to poke around in the hole under the mound.  He said there would be little resistance where the underground tunnels are.  He said set the traps at the openings of both tunnels.  For the mound we had, this held true -- we found two tunnels at about 80 degrees from each other.  He also told me to put a leaf or something similar over the top with dirt to cover the mechanism holes to block all light (he said if I used dirt only, it could fall through the holes).An online video recommended putting peanut butter in the trap.  If you have a dog, I don't recommend this.  My dog evidently smelled the peanut butter from afar and dug out the traps.  We had to clean the traps and keep the dog in or under careful watch to keep him from wanting to check the traps again.  I was worried he might get his tongue caught in the trap (think super strong mousetrap).  We were able to catch the gopher just fine without the peanut butter, so if you have a nosey dog that likes peanut butter, leave it off.My husband has only had to use the traps twice since we bought them, but both times they were effective in just a day or two.  I have heard back from three of the four people that ordered traps with me, and all have reported successfully catching gophers.  One also recently reported finding a skunk in his trap -- fortunately it didn't spray anything. That was certainly unexpected!!","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 26, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RC232TOYX8RLZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000FBMFDO#wasThisHelpful","RC232TOYX8RLZ","A102PS97JPLYGK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A102PS97JPLYGK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have four Scat Mats now.  Two 30 x 16 inch mats that are approximately 10 years old or so -- given to me by my mom after her cat passed, and two more I have since purchased from Amazon, 48 x 20 inch mat and 12 x 60 inch mat.The old mats still work just like new.  They are grey, while my newer ones are clear. My batteries have lasted over a year now, but I don't use the mats 100% of the time, because I move them around and have ""decoys"" (see below) that help stretch their effectiveness.Because I work, I cannot always monitor to make sure the pets aren't doing things they shouldn't.  I use a 30 x 16 mat to keep dogs off of the loveseat, and the 12 x 60 mat to keep them off of the couch.  The other 30 x 16 mat has been useful in preventing the housecat from waiting beside the front door in order to dart outside as people enter.  The mats can discharge static through thin fabric, so I put a pillowcase over the mat by the door.  The cat associates the pillowcase with the sensation, allowing me to use the pillowcase as a ""decoy"" by the door when I want to use that mat to prevent the cat from clawing the carpet at the threshold of a closed off bedroom or jumping on some other surface.  The mat also worked when placed under a relatively thin tablecloth (slightly thicker than a tea towel).  The 48 x 20 inch mat works great to keep cats off of the counter.  I move the mats around on counters and tables so the cats never know when they jump up if they might get a surprise.  This keeps the little mischief makers guessing.The units have a 3 setting lo-med-hi.  I use medium and it is strong enough to get my attention if I forget and touch an activated mat for more than a second.  I would describe it to being similar to dragging your feet on nylon carpet and then touching something grounded like a TV.  It smarts, but isn't life threatening.  The sensation is adequate to keep my headstrong boxer and pug off of the sofas and to keep the cats from miscellaneous mischief.When not in use, I roll the mats up and store them upright in a bin.

I suspect the film came out in theaters with 3D, because much of the action seemed like it was geared for the 3D format.  I wish it would have been one of my free selections on Amazon Prime.  I don't think it was worth the rental $.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 24, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R27EDJ2PZRCFQX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DGMVJAO#wasThisHelpful","R27EDJ2PZRCFQX","A102PS97JPLYGK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A102PS97JPLYGK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When recently using my regular sized bowl #2785 (after discovering I had forgotten it in the back of my cabinets)  I found it didn't seem to chill any better than a regular plastic bowl.  I held it up to strong light and could see that the gel inside appeared to have shrunk and developed dark spots that from what I could see looked like mold.  I wrote to Pampered Chef about the problem.  They replied that it was out of warranty - i.e.:  I was out of luck.  I always hand washed it and it still looks just like new (I even still had the paperwork stored with the bowl).  Pampered Chef  had a good reputation in my opinion, so I was disappointed with their answer.  Considering how pricey this was for what little use I got out of it, I probably won't buy any more of their merchandise.","1.0 out of 5 stars","March 14, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R210PU5NWBZFV7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0009KPJCK#wasThisHelpful","R210PU5NWBZFV7","A102PS97JPLYGK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A102PS97JPLYGK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"These are fine wrenches when used the right way. I saw another reviewer issue a negative review because they were not good for oil changes. I do not know any mechanics (who work on cars every day for a living) that would want to use a wrench this short to change oil. A long double box end wrench is best for oil drain plugs because they are often put on too tight by inexperienced techs at quickie oil change places. You need the extra leverage that a long wrench provides when you perform oil changes every day. As far as the quality of the wrenches themselves: i would rate the quality as roughly comparable to Craftsman tools. No, these are not Snap-On quality wrenches.The wrenches are fine and will perform admirably when used the right way. What is the right way? First of all, don't use these for oil changes if at all possible. You will drive yourself crazy. Most important: do not use the open end to break bolts free or tighten them down. Use the box end for those tasks. Use the open end for ratcheting the bolt in and out of place. Use the box end only for the first and last part of the tightening/loosening process. The open end is subject to expanding under intense pressure and this will damage the wrench and potentially the bolt as well. This is a fine set of budget wrenches which should last forever if used properly.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R84IIDKOHLGXK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009L895JO#wasThisHelpful","R84IIDKOHLGXK","A5KMMY627T3W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A5KMMY627T3W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is not really my cup of tea (pun intended). I am a big fan of floral teas and I am a big fan of green tea, but this mixture does not impress.

"First of all the unit functions as advertised. As I have said before, I have yet to have a Seagate drive fail on me during my 2 decades of PC computing. I was a little surprised at how bulky/heavy the unit was; I was hoping for a lighter and smaller unit. This defeats a little bit of the purpose in my opinion; it is easier for us just to pack one of our tiny USB drives for a trip. At home, we already have a standard size wireless backup drive so this one becomes yet another backup for backups. The setup was fairly straightforward and took around 10-15 minutes. We like this unit but it is just a little too narrow or our purposes. As I said it is now just another redundant backup but most people would find this too expensive for that type of usage.

"This is a fun item and I would probably be more enthusiastic about it if it wasn't something that costs $40-$45. We were surprised how light and thin the package was when it arrived. We both remarked that the company has basically found a way to sell a small refrigerator or washing machine box for $40. The thing is, though, if it was one of those boxes it would be much thicker. This thing is very, very thin and light. It is not going to hold up very well long-term. If this only cost $20 or $25 this would be a much better deal. Or, charge $40 or $45 and actually provide double wall cardboard so it would hold up. This is single thickness cardboard that bends very easily.

"I REALLY hate to write this negative review but this company needs to know that some things are not working.1. The paint quality: The entire item is painted red first and then some of the parts are painted black. This *might* not be an issue except for the fact that the black paint does not bond well with the red paint. This means that the slightest rub up against something causes the black paint to flake off, exposing the red paint below. Initially, we liked this design so much that we ordered 4 more (planning on giving them as gifts) before this first one even arrived. Unfortunately, all of them got here in such a poor condition that we had to return them. Black paint flaked off of the spots, the legs, etc, exposing the red paint below. It looks really bad and we can't give them as gifts anymore. I also can't help but wonder what will become of these when used as feeders if the paint comes off so easily. Animals perching/pecking would surely also make the paint come off, right?2. The box: The problem is that there is none! These items do not come in a box at all! They are just loose with a small paper hang tag for a store rack. Would a $0.10 thin cardboard box or a plastic clamshell really be a big deal for the company? A box or clamshell would help guard against paint loss and also it would make these more attractive to give as gifts.The bottom line is this: these are really cute and really clever design-wise. This is why we initially ordered 4 more on top of this one. It is a crying shame that both issues have rendered them useless to us. I would like the company to please post a response when they have corrected these issues so that we can order them again.","2.0 out of 5 stars","March 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ISJMUGK8HZZC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HRJOV4I#wasThisHelpful","R1ISJMUGK8HZZC","A5KMMY627T3W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A5KMMY627T3W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have many thoughts/observations on this machine so I thought I would group them primarily in the form of a pro/con list:Pros:1. The machine is insanely fast; so fast it doesn't even seem to be breaking a sweat. The fan noise is always at a bare minimum no matter what task is being performed. I would compare the level of fan noise to what I recall  the level of noise being in a MacBook Pro; the fan noise is just barely audible. This laptop is replacing my Acer 17"" 2.3GHz i5 with 8GB of ram (which I will mention for comparison a few more times) which is far, far noisier in comparison. I didn't even realize how noisy the Acer was until I started using this machine; it's a huge difference. File transfer is also super fast with the combination of a SSD and USB 3.0 ports.2. The weight is not as bad as I expected given that this is a ""desktop replacement"" laptop. My old Acer (which I never found heavy) weighed a little over 6 1/2 pounds; this one weighs a little over 7 pounds. So, not a huge difference for me. This is not even in the parking lot of the MacBook Air ballpark so if you need something that light you are looking at the wrong machine.3. There is a 256GB PCIe SSD installed as well as a 1TB mechanical hard drive. The nice thing here is that there is an available empty PCIe bay open so that you can install an additional PCIe drive (or PCIe card of another type perhaps?) if you wish. You could also replace the spinning platter drive with an SSD so you could theoretically have THREE discrete SSD drives in the same machine! Pretty impressive. You are limited to one SSD in every MacBook Pro currently offered.4. The built-in speakers are a quantum leap forward for laptop speaker sound quality. They are far and way the most amazing and powerful laptop speakers I have ever heard.5. The case is built like a tank and is not garish looking in any way. There are several different lighting schemes available so the machine can either look like a normal laptop without any lights or you can let your freak flag fly and allow multicolored lights of your choosing to shine from where you want them to shine from.Now for the cons. I hope you can learn from my mistakes and save yourself a lot of time and heartache. And before you call me an idiot who doesn't know what they are doing, please keep in mind that I am a former certified Apple technician and I used to own my own computer repair business. I have extensive experience with Apple and PC computers. So, the cons:1. The machine arrived with a tiny loose part rattling around inside. I hope that Dell/Alienware reads this so they can improve their quality control process. It's not the end of the world except for the fact that this machine costs $2K. I think the average person spending that much on a machine would hope that there would be no rattling when they opened the box. I wouldn't care myself except for the fact that if it is a small metal part that is loose inside it could set up a possible situation where a circuit board gets shorted out. So, I decided to take off the bottom ram/hard drive cover and see if I could shake it out of the bottom before turning on the machine. Sadly, I never could get the part to shake out of the bottom. The part is somewhere on top of the motherboard and I never could get it to move around to the bottom so I could get it out. I hope that it never becomes an issue in the future. This brings us to point number 2...2. The bottom ram/hard drive cover is insanely difficult to remove. I proceeded very carefully, patiently and gingerly but was still unable to remove the cover without breaking off one of the plastic tabs and slightly warping the cover. After reinstalling the cover it no longer sits perfectly flush with the bottom of the machine. I am just going to have to live with that I guess. In any event, here is the proper procedure for removing the cover: First (obviously) remove the two small Philips head screws. Then carefully snap that section of the cover off/upwards. The next part is where it becomes tricky. There are several remaining tabs, some of which are meant to be snapped upwards and some of which are meant to slide out backwards and not snap out. So, you need to always be attempting to slide the cover backwards as you pull upwards. This is very difficult to perform just right (in fact so difficult that I couldn't do it successfully without breaking something). I really wish that this this design had been rethought before the final production stage.3. The machine does come with a minimum of bloatware, but the software it does come with can be quite frustrating at times. I want to focus on two of them in particular. It comes with a very high-strung and controlling program that is supposed to fine-tune the performance of the wireless and wired networking cards. It is supposed to deliver the fastest internet speeds in a variety of conditions. I found this software to be cumbersome and counter-productive. Example: it will stop you from opening a new web page while a file is downloading. There are many setting you can play with but I opted to remove the software altogether. This is where the trouble started: the software can not be removed without removing all of the drivers for all of the networking cards. So, I learned this the hard way and had to reinstall the programs after I found that the networking cards were rendered driver-less by its removal.4. The second piece of software I had a problem with was the proprietary light scheme software. This is the software that controls the color and the location of the lighting on the laptop. As I alluded to before, the available lighting would make the lighting technician of a Phish or Grateful Dead concert blush. You can choose a wide array of colors and you can shine them from virtually any and every part of the laptop in any kind of combination or array that you wish. This feature is not important to me so I turned all of them off. That would be great except that my punishment for depriving the machine of its desire to put on a light show is a really annoying pop-up that I have to click on EVERY TIME I restart the machine that informs me that I have all of the lights turned off AND reminds me that I can turn them back on any time I want to. I have to click on an ""x"" in order to close this pop-up every time. Is this really necessary? UPDATE: I found a Windows setting that blocks messages from this program so I no longer have to see these.As you can probably tell from my star rating, the pros of this machine FAR outweigh the cons. I list the cons in order to be thorough, not to nitpick. I also hope that Dell/Alienware might learn something from them. So far, i really love this machine and I am sure that I am only just beginning to realize its potential. Given the choice between this machine and a MacBook Pro with a comparable MSRP, I would choose this hands down.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ZVVT1LKD9JPP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SIJGKEA#wasThisHelpful","R1ZVVT1LKD9JPP","A5KMMY627T3W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A5KMMY627T3W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"First of all, the diapers do their primary ""collection"" job well (I will let you guess at what I mean by that). These diapers are also easy to put on and take off. These diapers specifically are engineered to make it easier for the baby to move around in. By this age (presuming your baby is size 4) they are moving around a lot and most are walking. This (the flexibility) is what makes these diapers truly excellent. The price is also relatively competitive vs other brands so I can't say a single negative thing about these diapers.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1QG5ODS52Q3VE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MIQYR12#wasThisHelpful","R1QG5ODS52Q3VE","A5KMMY627T3W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A5KMMY627T3W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I think some of the people who are criticizing this movie may have missed the point. In my opinion anyway, this is not a film about music school or the mechanics of drumming. I have not been to music school and I am not a drummer but I am sure the film gets several things wrong about both. Music school is merely the backdrop--and drumming is merely the conduit--to tell a story about excellence and the pursuit of greatness.The real story of this film is this: what are you willing to do to be--or try to be--great? What are you willing to do in the pursuit of excellence?The film examines what one young man is willing to do in that pursuit, as well as what lengths his teacher is willing to go to in order to drag him there. If you allow this film to grab ahold of you and take you along for the ride (as I did), you might just find (as I did) that the result is an inspirational story that sticks with you for days and weeks after seeing it. The film challenged me to think about excellence and how much I am willing to invest in its pursuit. It also challenged me to think about many of my past and present life choices. Yes, for me this film was that powerful. Not many films are this powerful.And yes, it was also quite entertaining and surprisingly hard to guess where it was going. Additionally, it was relatively clich-free. It is one of the best films I have seen in the past few years.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3KKYCOYHBT2QA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PRX8UBG#wasThisHelpful","R3KKYCOYHBT2QA","A5KMMY627T3W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A5KMMY627T3W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"People regularly tell me that they hate country music. I tell them that there are two types of country music: modern/pop country (not actually country music) and real country. Modern country music is simply pop music with a slide guitar riff or twang added faintly in the distance so as to ""legally"" qualify as country music. This band plays real country. There is a heavy folk influence so it is not exactly ""country and western"" but it is real country nonetheless. Please support real country music by buying this awesome CD or going to see them live.

"This is a cool book, but I do think it is more for expert builders. I don't think the very young or intermediate Lego robotic enthusiasts are going to get a lot out of this book unless they really apply themselves. We own the 2nd edition Lego robot but we will be getting the EV3 this holiday season if Santa sees fit. I look forward to putting the book through its paces more comprehensively at that point (and will return later to update this review) but an initial skimming of the book shows a fairly complicated and technical-heavy experience. The average Lego enthusiast under 13 is going to have a hard time with this book.

"I read this on Kindle and would like to briefly comment on that before the book review.  This book is perfect for the Kindle. There are footnotes but they are references only and come at the end of each short chapter.  Many of the references are to her own books (I think On the Political and Hegemony and Socialist Strategy are mentioned and cited in every chapter) and so do not have to be looked at after the first chapter.  The only reason not to buy this on Kindle would be if you could find a cheaper paperback.The opening chapter of this 2013 book lays out the groundwork of her theories of agonistics, hegemony, the political, etc.. The following chapters discuss the applications of that theoretical framework to international relations, the European Union, the current political situation (which she sees as dominated to the Neoliberalism of Thatcher/Reagan and what she calls post-Fordist capitalism), and how the arts might contribute to the struggle against the current Neoliberal hegemony.  The final chapter of the book is an previously published interview wherein she goes over the basic arguments again and gets to add one or two more insights.I am somewhat swayed by her thinking but I also have lots of qualms about it so I think I will initially just try to give a quick summary of the first chapter, suggest one or two problems I have with it and then someone on Amazonia can further educate me in the comments.I see her thinking as a reaction to the work of Carl Schmitt, Antonio Gramsci and Jacques Derrida. And that, my friends, is a yeasty dough.  Chantal Mouffe (hereafter CM) believes that individual identity is socially formed and is grounded in the passions.  We create our identities as part of an Us that is defined in opposition to a Them.  These identities have some rational component but they are largely affects. As per Schmitt, they all too frequently end up as a Friend/Enemy polarity that results in violence.These identities are maintained by hegemonies that serve particular power relations that are played out in the economic/social forms of our societies.A lot of CM's polemics come out of that basic line of thinking.  Liberals like Rawls have gone wrong because of their focus on the individual instead of the social nature of that individuality.  Rawls and Habermas have both gone wrong because of their rationalism: they believe that our disagreements can be ultimately resolved. CM, like Schmitt, asserts that the affective grouding of our identities renders that hope utopian.  We frequently are dealing with issues that are not resolvable but are true either/or choices.  In the US, abortion remains one of those issues.  We sometimes are faced with issues that seemingly can only be resolved through violence and forcing one side to change.  Again from the US, the antebellum period of our history is a good example.  From the Missouri Compromise until the Civil War, one issue after another became so poisoned by the overarching issue of slavery that the war began to seem inevitable.But this is where CM breaks from Schmitt.  She believes there is a continuum that issues lie on that ranges from the easily resolved to the violently antagonistic.  But toward the middle and there latter end is the region of agonistics- the region where struggle is meaningful, between two hegemonies contending to win out but still constrained by institutional rules and by mutual acknowledgement of each others right to contend.  This is what she calls the political.  Because this is the contention of hegemony and counter-hegemony, this is a passionate and meaningful struggle. Hegemonies are not just ways of thought, they are ways of acting, of creating in the world. I believe in abortion, marriage rights and the right of the public to constrain corporations.  Many of my friends do not.  What we contend about determines what we, our friends and our children will be able to do in their future lives.For CM, the realm of the political is the realm of meaningful (and never-ending) struggle that eschews violence.Her problem with the current world situation is that the Neoliberal hegemony has increasingly limited the political options to the point where it doesn't really matter who is in office.  This results in a indifferent attitude to politics as practiced. Enter our old friend, The Return of the Repressed.  That passionate need for communal identity starts to seek other forms of expression.  CM feels this has resulted in the rise of New Right parties in Europe, in the rise of identification with fundamental religions and with the occasional angry but aimless explosion of violence that England and France saw a few years back.My major qualms with this line of thought are three-fold.  I think that the distinction between agonistics and antagonistic politics is much harder to maintain than she tends to suggest.  Every period of European history (or American) where the choices were that real and that important were periods of violence.My second problem is the idea of the Neoliberal hegemony.  CM is very good in stressing the pluralistic nature of the counter-hegemony.  That would be a sight of contestation as well with many different POVs being stressed and balanced. But so is the Neoliberal hegemony.  It too is a sight of contestation where (in the US) the oil money if contending with the tech companies and the financial markets are messing with them both while defense industries still think the US government needs to give them more of our tax dollars.  The parts of her book where she discusses Neoliberalism and post-Fordism were among the least convincing to me.My final question is a philosophical one-What is the basis for CM's assertion that identity is always ""implies the establishment of a difference""? Why cannot social identities continue to be more and more inclusive without having to be pluralistic?  Is a passionate politics based on the idea of our humanity impossible?But those issues are as much about me as about her thinking.  I learned much from her book.  Not least, she aroused my interest in the contemporary political situation in South America.  She also has some interesting thoughts about Badiou, Negri and Hardt.  All in all, very much worth reading, thinking about and discussing.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R5EDJLOTMHSIB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1781681031#wasThisHelpful","R5EDJLOTMHSIB","A1D4PVZ0QWEAW1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1D4PVZ0QWEAW1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Since I read this on my Kindle, the first part of my review will address briefly reading it in that format.  The second part will review the book itself.This book is well-Kindlelized with an active index and easy transition back and forth to the footnotes. The major issue is the ease of getting back and forth to the references as these are at the end of each chapter.  Overall I found this an easy book to read in this format.This series of books published by Routledge is intriguing in format.  The idea is to present an thinker such as Ranciere, Badiou or Castoriadis and to introduce/comment on their work by having a group of scholars write short essays centered around the concepts/themes of those thinkers.  For an author like Castoriadis who developed not only his own terminology, e.g. magma, teukhein and legein, as well as put his own characteristic spin on more common words, e.g., autonomy and democracy, such an approach proves very useful.The book focuses on Castoriadis major work, The Imaginary Institution of Society (IIS), and could easy be used as an introduction/guide to that demanding read. For the most part it ignores his earlier, more activist writing (with the exception of the entry on Democracy). It is also a useful intro to some of Castoriadis' later writings translated into English as Figures of the Thinkable, World in Fragments and Philosophy, Politics, Autonomy (I can recommend the latter as a good Castoriadis' starter book).Finally, it serves as an intro to some of that community of scholar/activists who have devoted themselves to working out some of the issues of Castoriadis' thought. Suzi Adams, Johann Arnason, Mats Rosengren, Karl Smith, Ingerid Straume all struck me as worth more of their own work.All in all, for anyone interested in ISS or in Castoriadis as a whole, this is a very helpful read.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RL3APX3NRRLQ2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1441102906#wasThisHelpful","RL3APX3NRRLQ2","A1D4PVZ0QWEAW1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1D4PVZ0QWEAW1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The first part of this review will be about the experience of reading the book on the Kindle.  The second part will be about the book itself.I do not recommend the Kindle edition due to several decisions of the publisher and the author.The first problem is the author's decision to not enumerate his footnotes but simply to throw them all in a great lump at the end of the book.To find any one reference, it is necessary to go throw that lump looking for the first and last word of the passage and hope that you see it.Even divided up by chapter, this makes the footnotes tedious in any format but especially so on the Kindle.Secondly, there is the decision by the publisher not to format the index for the Kindle but to suggest instead that you just use the Kindle's search function to look up the ""searchable terms"".  Doesn't really work for phrases like ""disenfranchisement of African-Americans"".The Kindle version is paginated except, for some reason, the conclusion.Finally, this book has some nice illustrations which are hard to see on the paperwhite.Overall, if this is a book you want to learn from and put to scholarly use, by all means buy the paperback.As for the book itself, I found it oddly disappointing.  I am a big fan of Lear's previous book, No Place of Grace, and was looking forward to this one.  I agree with many of his interpretations of the period but I found the book to be repetitive, over-reaching and idiosyncratic.  Careful perusal of the footnotes indicates that much of his interpretation is based on secondary sources instead of original research.  I am okay with that but I think that Lears is capable of really good original research and is good at locating quite useful original sources.For example, toward the end of this book, he discusses a novel of Colonel House's, Phillip Dru, which Lear discusses to good effect. I also find many of his insights (even if drawn from the secondary literature) to be illuminating.  For example, Lear's various discussions of the tensions with the Progressive movement between its local versus it national manifestations or between ""populism vs. expertise, producerism vs. consumerism, statutory vs. administrative regulation"" (p. 309).Lear is also careful to keep before us the various peoples who paid the price for standing between us and our manifest destiny, e.g., the Plains tribes, African-Americans, Cubans, Mexicans and all the 'dark Others' (Lear's phrase) that we climbed over on our way to civilizing the world.I guess my complaint has to do with what I see as Lear's over emphasis on the cultural aspects of the period and an under-development of the economic aspects.Finally, his Bibliographical Note is worth a deep dive for Lear's appreciative discussion of his sources.Overall, a pretty good book but not one that should be read in conjunction with others on the period.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RAP1S3NHUZ4X1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0060747501#wasThisHelpful","RAP1S3NHUZ4X1","A1D4PVZ0QWEAW1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1D4PVZ0QWEAW1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Kindle review:This book has been fairly well kindlized with some important exceptions.  The footnotes work well going back and forth.  The maps are fairly useless unless you look at them on your PC or you have far better eyes than mine.  There are plenty of data tables which are inserted in the text more or less where they need to be.  But there is no clear separation from the text so the transition to and from the tables can be jarring.  This is true also of the 'portraits'- very short biographies of major figures that are interspersed throughout the text and which can be quite interesting.Finally, the book has an index which the publisher has made no attempt to kindlize. Since the publisher also chooses to offer the book without page numbers the index is useless in the Kindle format.  When will publishers appreciate that the more they adapt their publication for electronic formats, the more they will make that format attractive to readers?Overall Kindle (paperwhite) reading experience- 3 stars.The book itself is worth about two to three stars.  I am obviously somewhere in between the two previous reviewers.  I think DiScala does a great job up until WW2 considering the likely audience for the book- college students looking for an entrance to modern Italian history or the lay reader looking for something not too scholarly.And now a personal complaint that may be more about me than DiScala-  There are no footnotes, not even for quotes.  I hate this trend in scholarly works. DiScala provides a very good annotated bibliographic essay that covers every section but there is no way to know who said what unless he (very) occasionally decides to identify the source in the text.  This alone accounts for my downgrading the rating from three stars to two.  If that sort of lazy scholarship is okay for you then consider this a three star review.DiScala does a good job quickly sketching the European context for Italian history throughout the early parts of the book.  He also does a good job talking about the influence of the Catholic church on Italian politics and society.  This part of the book (which takes up five of the six parts or about 5/7ths of the text) can be recommended unless you want to get petty.The last part of the book however is a bit of a mess, at least, to me.Now let me be honest.  As a self-critical reader, I have long noted that when I am reading something that is coming from a POV quite different than my own, that it is far easier to note all the assumptions the author is making and all of the rhetoric they are using than when I am reading something that I agree with fundamentally.I suspect DiScala's politics to be to the right of mine and therefore my hermeneutic when reading this book is more suspicious than generous.  For example, around location 4690, (the first paragraph of Chapter 16) he states that ""excessive liberty and the economic and social effects of the [WW1]"" help explain the rise of fascism.  Whenever I read a phrase like ""excessive liberty"", I want a darn good explanation of what that means.  All DiScala offers is the assertion that ""Italians probably enjoyed more civil liberties than the citizens of most European countries and the United States"". No evidence of any kind is offered in support.Another example from around location 5593 (the chapter entitled WWII and The Resistance):""Journalist Giampaolo Pansa has claimed that the Communists exploited their military superiority and the chaos following the war's end to kill thousands of non-Fascist Resistance fighters in order to eliminate as many rivals as possible for the future political control of the economy.""There is no other reference than just the statement of one journalist, there is no reference to that journalist's writing that contains that assertion, there is nothing at all to back it up.  Even if it were true (and I suspect it is at least partially true) this is not scholarship.  This is not teaching by example how to write history.One more example, this one exemplifying how you can editorialize while pretending to just state facts. This is from Location 6126 and is toward the end of the chapter entitled ""Years of Lead"": [Referring to the PCI, the Italian Communist Party]""Despite declared PCI autonomy from Moscow, many Italians were still unwilling to entrust PCI members with power"".  Always be on your guard when someone asserts, ""Many people believe.."" or ""Some experts think...""  They are almost always euphemisms for ""I think or believe this but I don't want to be bothered with proving the point"".  Again- this is not history.The worst part of all this is that sometimes DIScala has an interesting tale to tell. I found his telling of the scandal of the early 1990s that was perhaps even more impactive than Watergate on American politics to be fascinating.  I have the feeling that DiScala could write a far more coherent history than he has in this book.Overall recommendation: Read it in the paperback if read it you must.  I have a copy of Martin Clark's history of Modern Italy which I will read soon and review.  I can only hope it is stronger. One caveat: If you are more of a centrist in American politics or, may the Dog (Anubis) help you, a Reagan Republican, you may enjoy this book far more than I did.  You will definitely find your politics more in line with the author and that's okay.  The good thing about democracy is that we get to work at least some of this stuff out at the polls.  See you there, my fellow citizens.","2.0 out of 5 stars","August 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R37RRBHS3KDV9G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0097CZ1LU#wasThisHelpful","R37RRBHS3KDV9G","A1D4PVZ0QWEAW1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1D4PVZ0QWEAW1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I agree with the assessment of the other two reviewers but I thought this book deserved a little more of a descriptive review.Razmig Keucheyan (hereafter RK) starts his book with the assertion that contemporary critical theory is a reaction to the defeat of leftist movements in the 1980s. RK's assessment is that the triumph of the Reagan-Thatcher brand of neo-liberalism, the capitalist turn in China, the fall of the Soviet Union and the rise of Islam as a modern political alternative demonstrated the inadequacies of critical theory up until the 1980s.The tasks of a renewed critical theory are three-fold as I read RK.  There is a need for a new theory of the system or the ontology we are critiquing.  The capitalism of classical Marxism has failed to develop as predicted and badly needs to be re-theorized.  What is the nature of capitalism at the current time? Is the nation-state still the locus of political power or are there trans-national entities that are as oppressive?  Can we understand the current international scene as exemplifying a form of imperialism and, if so, what kind?Is it necessary to address the diffusion of power throughout our lives and cultural experience or is political power the necessary focus of change?RK addresses these questions in Chapter 4 on System by looking at thinker like Hardt and Negri, Panitch, Cox, David Harvey, Benedict Anderson, Jurgen Habermas, Etienne Balibar, Giorgio Agamben and many others.The second major theme RK explores is who is to be the revolutionary subject.  One of the predictive failures of classical Marxism has been the development of the working classes.  RK cogently argues that we must re-theorize critical subjectivity and the relationship between the individual/citizen/outsider/indigene and the critical intellectual.  RK examines the work of Ranciere, Badiou, Zizek, Haraway, Butler, Spivak, Linera, Honneth and others to suggest the way that feminism, native indian movements in South America and ideas about equality and conflictual identities all argue for a broadening of the debate about what the left is trying to achieve and with whom.Which leads to RK's third theme- the need for critical intellectuals to actually engage in political movements and to let their theorizing to develop out of that experience. As we are involved in the actual work of political change, as we come to represent the needs of more and more different kinds of people perhaps then we can begin to theorize an overall subject who is both particular and inclusive.  And as we understand more of how various system impact the live of various types of people, perhaps we will then develop a more systematic theory of how power is wielded.One sign of hope for RK is that the intellectuals who are critical theorists are increasingly non-European or North American. The emergence of theorists from South America, Asia and Africa allows for the emergence of new experiences being brought to bear on critical theory and its relevance.  RK talks occasionally about the political history of Bolivia all of which was a revelation to me.Overall this book has many strengths.  There are terse cogent discussions of somewhere between thirty and forty thinker which serve to orient the reader to further reading.  There are also some wonderful thoughtful observations throughout the book. Consider the following:""...the incorporation of Gandhian precepts into a new strategic reason would make it possible to grasp the fact that violence not only always has a human and social cost, but also adversely affect the very identity of those who use it.  This idea, claims Balibar, is foreign to Marxism, who conception of violence was mainly tactical, not ontological"" p. 253.We are what we practice.  The habitual becomes our ontology.  This is a nice insight and essential to keep in mind.RK has some weaknesses as well.  He is a sociologist and so occasionally gets the philosophy or the history wrong.  But these are minor problems that an editor or a good reader should have caught.It is also pretty obvious who he admires and doesn't admire among his discussed theorists.  No one should rely on this book for an introduction to Habermas. But it is hard not to catch his enthusiasm for David Harvey.My major problem with the book is his discussion on feminism.  I am not a fan of Donna Haraway and wished he had used almost any other thinker instead of her.  He apologizes for not being able to further discuss feminism for reasons of space. But if you are going to talk about creating a new critical subjectivity, you had better be willing and able to take a long deep dive into feminist theory.  No other theory goes as deeply into how power and the possibility of violence is expressed in our daily lives.In spite of this flaw, RK's book is successful.  I have great admiration for writers who can some up a thinker in eight to ten well written pages. To do it with this many thinkers is really impressive.  I also believe his overall analysis sets the right course for the further development of critical theory.I would love to hear what others who have read the book think. Please educate me in the comments.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1VDVFZCLU3ZH8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1781685592#wasThisHelpful","R1VDVFZCLU3ZH8","A1D4PVZ0QWEAW1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1D4PVZ0QWEAW1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book is a bit odd.  It manages to mix good historiography with poor.  It has an obvious agenda, to wit, to argue for the world historical importance of Samuel Champlain.  It sometimes borders on an historical novel based on a naive approach to historical sources.  And yet it all seems to work and largely convinces the reader (or at least me) that Champlain was a very unusual and important man.I will leave the charms of the book to the other reviewers and write to three points in what follows: 1. The experience of reading it on a Kindle, 2 some of the issues of the historiography and 3. my assessment of Fischer's viewpoint of Champlain based on his dealings with the American Indians.Do not buy this book for the Paperwhite.  The maps are unreadable and the illustrations are myriad shades of grey.  It might work on the Fire or on you computer but it doesn't work well on the smaller models. It is well-kindelized for the footnotes. The extensive bibliography is hard to get around in the Kindle format.Overall, I do NOT recommend reading this in the Kindle format unless you don't give a hoot about maps, illustrations and bibliographies.  In which case, I don't want to know you anyway.I feel presumptuous making the next claim but it must be said- Fischer makes a lot of claims in this book that are not solidly grounded in the evidence.  Just one example- Fisher relates an incident in The Autobiography of Black Hawk that he claims has to refer to Champlain because ""no one else"" fits the description. I challenge any reader to go to The Autobiography and to read that passage and to come away convinced that Black Hawk can only be talking about Champlain.  This is a sloppy form of historical thinking- What I call the Argument From Wishful Thinking.  The basic idea is that has to be true because it fits my thesis so darn well.I feel there are many such examples throughout the book e.g., as to whether Champlain was an illegitimate son of Henri IV.I leave the judgement on that issue and how important it is to the reader. To me it is an issue and combined with authors tendency to repeat himself almost verbatim time and again throughout the book and you have the reason for my three star rating.I will give Fischer this- he convinces me that Champlain's approach to the Native American nations was far superior to anything that any of the English or Spanish tried.  Champlain actually seemed to respect and like the Indians from the moment he first met them.  He came far closer to treating them as equals than any other explorer of whom I know.  Fischer is careful to point out the limits of Champlain's vision,e.g.,he thought less of them for not having a King.  Champlain was very much of his time in regard to the great chain of being with each animal and man having his or her place in the hierarchy.Overall, I cannot help but recommend this book.  It has it flaws but so do we all.  It serves to introduce us to a lessor known explorer/founder of North America and makes an argument that he should be better known.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2C5U9N0E39Z53/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001FA0HVG#wasThisHelpful","R2C5U9N0E39Z53","A1D4PVZ0QWEAW1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1D4PVZ0QWEAW1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have, over an undeservedly long life, learned to listen to music in a lot of different ways.  One of my favorites is to listen to something as I fall asleep. Sometimes the result is that I fall into an almost-asleep state where the music becomes the sum total of my perceptual datum or field or however you would put that.Certain types of music are perfect for this type of listening.  Music that is spacious and full of unusual sounds can become a dreamscape that can last as long as the music.This CD is perfect for that sort of listening.  There is no real attempt here to make the music sound foreign or jazzy or exotic.  Instead what we have is four contemporary Chinese composers who seem to regard the instrumentation and their blended musical traditions as assets to be used however they are inspired.The results are outstanding and unexpected.  I have probably over a hundred saxophone quartet CDs and none of them really approach the possibilities like this one does.  Several saxophones using multiphonics blend in with the sheng, the popping of the pads are used as drums and long drone tones blend in with the erhu to create eerie bending of notes.Another facet of this music to note is how equally both ensembles and each player is used.  Their is no dominance to the saxophones except for the occasional passage (like toward the end of Fang Man's wonderful Dreams of a Hundred Flowers).  This is not a concerto for the erhu or the pipa but both are played with great skill and feeling.  Individual instruments wander in and out of the soundscape like characters on a stage.We owe this music to not just the composers but to two wonderful ensembles:The Prism Saxophone QuartetTimothy McAllister- soprano saxZachary Shemon- alto saxMatthew Levy- tenor saxTaimur Sullivan- baritone saxandMusic from ChinaWang Guowei- erhuChen Yihan- pipaHelen Yee- yangqinFrank Cassar- percussionalong with Hu Jianbing- sheng.The Prism Quartet has been around for a long time and has somehow escaped my notice.

The last three pieces are stand alone compositions.Several of the pieces are brief interludes for Byron Vannoy or for Phil Sparks to shine.  These interludes are quiet and draw you into listening more closely.  There are others for Mark Taylor or Eric Barber to quickly display their prowess on their horn. They serve to set off and to separate the longer pieces, Main Theme, Seattle Blues, Low Guys, Mali King County and Reprise and Finale. These compositions are just extraordinary.  Seattle Blues sounds as good as early Mingus, equally driven by the soli and by the ensemble section.  Contrapuntal weaving, rich harmonies and swing, swing, swing.  I love this piece.  Mali King County is named, I believe, after the African country and the county that contains Seattle.  It kicks off with Byron on the drums, then Phil on the bass and the horns start to dig in after about a minute with Mr. Varner conversing with the rest of the horns.That last remark gets to something I like about the way Mr. Varner writes- so many of his compositions sound like conversations with the different musicians/sections exchanging ideas and getting excited about what is happening. This is especially evident in Mali King County which has a celebratory quality.As for the final composition, I grace you with Mr. Varner's own description, ""...a Gil Evans-influenced variation on the harmonic structure of a pop Hawaiian Christmas song, made popular by Bing Crosby. A version of the song by Cyril Pahinui on slack key guitar inspired me...""  Seriously, if that doesn't excite your interest, I don't know what to do with you.Finally, let me note that this is the first recording on Tom Varner's own label.  We should always support an artist taking control of their own business. As usual, Tom Varner has my highest recommendation.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2F09683OSNXD9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NUFVHUE#wasThisHelpful","R2F09683OSNXD9","A1D4PVZ0QWEAW1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1D4PVZ0QWEAW1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"MacGregor Knox wants to cut the Gordian Knot that has been the various historian's debates about whether totalitarianism is a useful concept, whether the rise of Nazism could only have happened in Germany and just how militarist was the German culture of the early twentieth century.  His methodological sword is comparative history.  In this book, Knox looks at the pre-WW1 cultures of Prussia and Italy, how WW1 impacted/uprooted both of those cultures and how each culture reacted by eventually turning to a savior/dictator whose ideology celebrated an extreme nationalism/racialism.This volume is the first half of that comparative history.  In fact, the first 250 pages of the book deal with the ""long nineteenth century"" (1800-1914) and WW1.  The purpose of this long opening investigation is two-fold.  Knox wants to claim that the history of both Italy and Germany in the 19th century is a history of the development of late-blooming (for Western Europe) nation states that were internally torn and structurally unprepared for the advent of mass democracy.  WW1 erupted out of those structural tensions and basically destroyed the old regimes of both Italy and Germany.Liberal Italy and Weimar Germany were the governments that came out of the peace process and which tried to control those internal fractures while (at least pretending) to become true mass democracies.  They both failed in their own ways; some of which were unique to each country and some of which they shared.For example, both countries faced strong populist Catholic and Socialist parties which challenged the national elites for governmental control.  To my surprise, during the 1920s, at least, the Italians tended to settle these contestations in the streets with violence much more frequently than did the Germans.Another example of a similarity is that in both cases, the party that rose to power during the `20s did so with a fervently nationalistic ideology.  In Italy, it was the cause of Greater Italy, the vision of a state that controlboth sides of the Adriatic and which had its `fair' share of colonies in Africa and Asia.The German variation had a strong racialist tinge to it.  The Aryan people needed their Lebensraum, their ""living space"" where they could thrive. That space happened to include portions of what is now Belgium, France, Poland and the Czech Republic.  It is easy to see how the Nazi party would find fertile ground in a population already used to these ideas.  The amazing thing was how far back those ideas can be traced in the German culture.One of the more interesting themes of the book for me is Knox's assertion that the universal literacy which Germany had so much right to take pride in also was a great benefit to the Prussian military system.  Knox is a rueful admirer to a degree of that interaction of education and training.  He sees the education system as instilling militaristic values.  My title is based on a quote (somewhere) in the book that expresses those values.  The result was a population well trained in arms, versed in strategy and used to acting independently and ruthlessly if so needed.  It was also an army that had some serious weaknesses (like a tendency to increasingly gamble of the bold throw of the die as the strategic situation got more desperate).In a short review like this, it is difficult to express how nuanced Knox's analysis can be.  His mastery of the historical sources is astounding.  He is as good at regional  history as the national or international, as good with the biographical as he is with the structural.And he makes it all interesting.  And therein lies a problem for me.  I came to the horrific realization while reading this book that one of the pleasures of reading history for me is a sort of intellectual and moral frisson.  Reading the history of the rise of the Fascist and the Nazi parties is the historical equivalent of slowing down to gape at a traffic accident.  There is a sort of intellectual wonder that people could have been so stupid and/or a moral high horse to look down on their follies from.Knox gives in to that now and then.  He does not suffer fools gladly.  Wilson had ""utopian"" principles and delivered an ""infantile"" message (pp242-3).  Other historians are modish (p.169) or victimized by their historiography (see his discussions of the `new social historians' on p.9)On the other hand, the strongest argument for the utility of Knox's comparative history approach is his own book.  As with all authors, read Knox with a combination of the hermeneutics of generosity and of suspicion.  You will learn much from this one, young padawan.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2CP4S5JTD6790/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0521703298#wasThisHelpful","R2CP4S5JTD6790","A1D4PVZ0QWEAW1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1D4PVZ0QWEAW1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"First, a comment or two on the negative reviews.  The negative comments have two point- first, that the book is poorly written and edited and 2. that it is unoriginal in content.As to the first, I can only disagree. I read nothing but scholarly nonfiction and, while Tooze is not a great writer, he is a fine writer of history.I did not find that it could have been a much shorter book either. He is covering a lot of territory and he tries to do it justice.  The only real problem I had with the editing occurs with Figure 3 on page 357. I have no idea what the Y axis represents.  If anyone knows, please leave an explanation in the comments.As for the content, while I am no expert in this period of history, I found the content to be original and fascinating. Americans of a certain age were told that Wilson tried to change what wars were fought for and how the international community would handle conflict in the aftermath of WW1.  Tooze's story is more complicated, nuanced and believable.Tooze's basic theme is the recasting of American power in the aftermath of WW1.  America through its military, economic and cultural strength(by which I mean the appeal of Wilsonianism) was able to provincialize (Tooze's ugly word) Europe.  America was economically able to veto or render impotent many of the governmental policies of Britain, France, Italy, Germany, Japan, China and Russia. The fact that there was real differences of opinion between the Congress and the Presidents (Wilson, Harding, Coolidge, Hoover) which made it difficult for the other powers to know what to expect from the U.S. in terms of consistent policy made it that much harder for any of them to know what to do.I feel that Tooze tells his story with great understanding of the individual politics of each of the above countries.  We read how the Irish conflict and the struggle of Indian independence limited Britain's options, of the different parties contending for power in Japan and of the struggles for control by different factions of Chinese warlords and parties. We also get a good sense on how the business and political communities in each country clashed over policy.As stated above, I am no expert.  If there is a book that tells this story better and more comprehensively, I wish the critics would name it so I can read it.  What I can tell you is that this book has driven me to read some of his sources.  Tooze has awakened my interest in this period of history by exposing my ignorance.  For that, I bow in his direction.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R28VSTJ9MQE7SM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0670024929#wasThisHelpful","R28VSTJ9MQE7SM","A1D4PVZ0QWEAW1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1D4PVZ0QWEAW1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a limited edition release of only 1000 copies so if you are interested I recommend you purchase quickly.Why should you be interested?  For one thing, this 1969 recording is the first recording I know of featuring Arthur Blythe who is one of the outstanding alto saxophonists of his generation and a compelling composer in his own right.  He would not record under his own name until the late 70s. His distinct tone is already apparent on this recording.  He contributes one song to the CD ""For Fats"".The other reason to own this gem is Horace Tapscott who has never gotten close to his just due.  Perhaps this CD release will change that a little. Tapscott chose to most of his career in the Los Angeles area where he formed the Pan Afrikan Peoples Arkestra in the early 60s and which he lead until his death in 1999.  In terms on his impact on a musical community the only person I can really compare him to is Muhal Richard Abrams during the formative years of the AACM.He was a gifted pianist and composer and this CD features three of his compostions;  The Giant in Awakened, The Dark Tree and Niger's Theme.The other musicians on the recording ar Walter Savage, Jr. and David Byrant (both on bass) and Everett Brown, Jr. on drums.The music is rousing, compelling, strongly melodic and exploratory.  Anyone who enjoys the mid-60s sides of Jackie McLean, Andrew Hill, Charles Tolliver or Archie Shepp will find plenty to enjoy on this CD.  And like I noted at the beginning of my review, with such a limited release this CD will not be available long.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3V4XGCMNZOCEL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MVLLSGG#wasThisHelpful","R3V4XGCMNZOCEL","A1D4PVZ0QWEAW1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1D4PVZ0QWEAW1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"People will rent this movie for two reasons- Jonathan Glazer or Scarlett Johansson.  If you are renting becase you like Glazer's movies (and really-can you imagine a stronger debut than Sexy Beast?) then you are in for a treat.If you are renting because of Johansson, particularly because if you have read that she gets naked in the film, than caveat emptor, buyer beware, etc. etc.  Run away, little boy, back to the internet and porn search.In fact (minor reveal, so beware), there is a scene in the movie which is a perfect metaphor for that type of viewer/reviewer.  Men in the film follow Johansson into a pure black field because she is undressing.  You might think they would stop and look around and wonder about where she is leading them but, heh, this is ScarJo and she is taking her clothes off so they will follow into pure shiny black space shedding their clothes.  And then they start to sink into that pure black field.  Still gazing at Johansson.  They sink until they are well over their heads and then they watch her walk away above them. And then they look around and notice other suspended guys and realize they should have paid more attention.Well most of the negative reviewers are like those guys. Slowly sinking into this very unusual film they rented because of ScarJo and suddenly realizing that they are watching this really disturbing and highly stylized film.So much for them.  This movie is very much worth seeing.  ScarJo is playing with her stardom these days bending it to work in all sorts of very good films.  Glazer is on top of his game.  This film is as claustrophobic, as disturbing as Polanski's Repulsion.In any case, ignore the negative reviews if you want to see something truly odd and visionary.  This is a very good film, subtle, disturbing with a brilliant visual style and an actress who is in full control of her art and career.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R15IG4OWAAJLF3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JH49OTS#wasThisHelpful","R15IG4OWAAJLF3","A1D4PVZ0QWEAW1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1D4PVZ0QWEAW1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There are several provisos I should state at the beginning of my review.  I believe my reaction to this book to be as much about myself as it is about the book.  I am well read in the intellectual history of the period in question and I was looking for a good synthesis.  What I got was a idiosyncratic synthesis that ultimately prove to be too boring to bother finishing the last forty pages.Idiosyncratic because this is supposed to be a volume of the Yale Intellectual History of the West.  Apparently Burrow thought that the US contributed little during the period in question because he cuts us out even in his title.  In his preface he states that his work in organized in thematic chapters and that his focus is on what was considered important at the time and not from our point of view.  Fair enough.  But that means by his lights there is little if any discussion of Einstein, Rickert, Mendel, Lenin, Croce among others (his list, p.xiv).  There is also no discussion of Brentano, Frege, Husserl, Russell, Whitehead, Ranke, Boltzmann, Spengler, Maxwell(!) Bernstein, Pierce (O, I forgot-he is American), Moore or Simmel (my list).If you are new to the period and mostly interested in literary history (I am not) this is probably a good place to start.  If you are interested in the history of the natural and the social sciences or in political thought than I cannot recommend it.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3T00GFZQD4WGB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0300097182#wasThisHelpful","R3T00GFZQD4WGB","A1D4PVZ0QWEAW1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1D4PVZ0QWEAW1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The first thing I would like to comment on is the Kindlization (my word) of the book.  It is, in a word, partial.  It is easy to traverse to the notes and back.  The actual pagination from the book is used as well as the Kindle numbers.  The index however is useless- it is not active and does not even include the page numbers! Why? All in all, it is okay to read on Kindle if not ideal.As for the book itself...it is a tough book to review.  For one thing, it is several books in one.  It is a survivors memoir, it is an exploration of the literature on trauma, it speaks to the androcentrism of the legal system and it is a critique of contemporary analytical philosophy.The core of any reaction has to be to Brison's story of her assault.  It is a nightmarish story told plainly and eloquently and it hurts to read it at times.  One of the most impressive (by which I guess I mean intellectually and emotionally courageous)things about it is her refusal to put a bow on it.  This is a book written over about ten years and it shows in her constant rethinking of the assault and its aftermath.  She is careful not to give her story any universal meaning but she insists that we take its particularity in its full impact.I would like to speak to some of the philosophical points she makes because I believe she means them very seriously and because I believe that philosophy needs to focus on issues like sexual violence in order to move past a sort of dead end that it has gotten itself into.  Brison's reflections on her rape shames much of contemporary analytical philosophy by exposing its aridity, its unwillingness to get involved in life, in sex, in politics.One of Brison's points is the weirdness (philosophical zombies, interrupted teletransportation) of the sort of thought experiment that are considered canonical in investigating the sense of self, etc.""Given philosophers' preoccupation with personal identity in extreme, life-threatening, and possible self-annihilating situations, it is odd that they have neglected to consider the accounts of actual trauma victims who report that they are not the same people they were prior to their traumatic transformations."" (p.38)The quote I use as my title expresses the self-annihilation of one rape victim. Brison reports throughout her book of the loss of her sense of self, of her place in the world, of her history, of her social self.  In fact Brison concludes toward the end of her book that she now believes that our selves are fractured and multifarious.  Her rape destroyed the natural, the human and the social glue that held it all together.  One impressive thing about her is that now seems able to have reinvented/reinvested that self while holding those fractures in view.  This woman does not hide from her own insights. I should have such strength.The point I wish to make to my fellow philosophical types is that by following Brison's suggestion we base our investigations on the sort of issues that are really happening to people and the result could be that people we actually find the results of those investigations more interesting and empowering to their lives.  The trick, of course, will be to not reduce these histories to case studies but to continue to insist on the full particularity of its horror.One last point I want to make.  I was pleased to read her discussion of the positive impact that her martial arts study had on her recovery.  I studied the arts for about 14 years and spent about half that time teaching.One of the things that struck me with my female students was something that typically happened about a year in to their study.  They were beginning to get pretty powerful at that point and a lot of women would start having issues with controlling the intensity of their strikes.  My theory was that the example that a lot of men in their lives or that society at large had given them was that 1. powerful fighting movement is associated with anger and 2. women should be neither angry or powerful.  The result is that a lot of women stuff their anger until they started to learn to move powerfully and then a that stuffed anger would come flowing out.  After a few months of pounding on me they would naturally get back into fighting with control.  All in all, it was pretty fun to watch that progress.My point is simply that I would suggest to any woman to find a comfortable and gradient martial arts school in which to train.  At their best, they are empowering communities where the individuals lift the group and the group the individuals.As for Brison, I cannot recommend this book enough.  There are some lines that should never be crossed and yet are crossed all the time.  Brison reminds us how devastating that fact is.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2EB6FLM90A7XV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0691115702#wasThisHelpful","R2EB6FLM90A7XV","A1D4PVZ0QWEAW1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1D4PVZ0QWEAW1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book is the result of a discourse and a friendship of many years.  James Chace and Jack Reynolds live and work on opposite sides of the great divide in contemporary Western philosophy; the so-called Analytic-Continental divide.James Chase is on the analytic side of the fence (researching things like ""epistemic normativity"" and the ""paraconsistent analyses of vagueness"").  Jack Reynolds represents the continental side of the divide. Most of his publications seems to be centered on the different methodologies used by the two sides of the divide and how those methodologies effect their philosophical results.Together they have created a useful and thoughtful guide to the divide that is full of insights and resists easy resolutions of the differences.The organization of the book is key.  Their introductory session is a brief history of the growing divide between the (largely Anglo-American) analytic tradition and the (largely French and German)continental tradition.  They organize this history around a series of philosophical spats that occurred between individual philosophers. Frege versus Husserl, Russell versus Bergson, Adorno versus Popper and Derrida versus Searle are some of the debates discusses.  It is easy to see that early on there was already a great deal of talking past each other.  There is Russell complaining that Bergson doesn't understand or appreciate argumentation because ""assemble premises to deductively back a conclusion"" (p.25) and Derrida chiding Searle because he does not recognize the emotive content and the local particularity of any speech act (p.39).The second section is even better.  It is an exploration of the different methodologies employed by the two traditions.  There is a good chapter on intuition pumps and thought experiments (although I would have been much more critical on the use of thought experiments), on transcendental arguments, on writing style and also on the self-perception of the two traditions.I really enjoyed the insights into the latter subject.  Chase and Reynolds believe that the analytic tradition sees itself almost as a Lakatosian research program (the use of Lakatos is mine not theirs).  They see themselves as slowly amassing results, working and reworking shared data/results (such as the classic thought experiments like Searle's Chinese Room).  Theirs is a communal problematic wherein one's work should smoothly fit in with the work of another analytic philosopher bee.  This has an dampening effect on any sort of individualistic style (p. 147).The continentalist (my word, sorry) sees their work as more individualistic or at least more avant-garde.  They tend to write more monographs than articles and tend more toward ontology than epistemology especially as practiced by the analytical tradition.The continentalist will tend toward more iconoclastic writing frequently experiment with their texts in an attempt to make some of their thought more graspable.The third section explores how these methodological differences play out and effect the thought of the two traditions in a variety of classic philosophy sub-fields, e.g., the problem of other minds, ontology, ethics and political thought.  This is probably the strongest part of the book.  We are introduced to a wide variety of figures and ideas.  Everything is very clearly and very fairly presented.  I mentioned above that they resist an easy resolution of the differences.  Indeed, we are almost always left with the idea it will be hard to breach the divide, say, in the philosophy of mind.  The differences in methods and interests run usually a little too deep.  Their general conclusion is what they call a weak meta-philosophical agnosticism, which concludes that given the state of the evidence that is no good reason for an analytician to turn continentalist nor for a continentalist to turn analytician (p.254).  They do argue that conversation and debate should continue if only to keep each other on our philosophical toes.I would argue that this book is itself a good argument for that conversation and that debate.  These two authors understand each other, they trust each other and they have listened to each other.  They obviously have come to know the otherside of the divide and to value some of the insights and, more importantly, their conversation.  We are lucky they have given us the current state of their debate.The bottom line is that all philosophy undergrads should read this book at some point and most of their profs as well.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2VYO88UU89N2K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0773538089#wasThisHelpful","R2VYO88UU89N2K","A1D4PVZ0QWEAW1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1D4PVZ0QWEAW1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Before I go on to the body of my review, I just want to talk briefly about the Kindle version of this phamplet.Kindle is a great way to go with this particular writing.  There are no footnotes and no obvious typos.  There are also no place indicators whatsoever.  This is a pamphlet of only 46 pages, something that can be easily read in one sitting, so that should notbe much of an issue.Abel Upshur was a lawyer and judge in Virginia in the antebellum period and served as Secretary of the Navy and of State in the Tyler administration where he worked on the annexation of Texas and on the Oregon border dispute.The nullification crisis occurred in 1832 when Andrew Jackson signed a new tariff bill into law.  In November of 1832, a South Carolina convention declared that tariff law and the previous one of 1828 unconstitutional and void/unenforceable within the boundaries of the state starting in February of 1833.  Jackson responded with the Force Bill that same February along with a compromise tariff and the combination was enough for another South Carolina state convention to meet and rescind the nullification.  The crisis was over and both sides declared themselves victors.  Yeah!I believe that the six letters which make up this work were published in early 1834 in The Examiner and are addressed to Thomas Ritchie.  They basically excoriate him for not supporting South Carolina's experiment in nullification.  The great strength of this work is the simplicity and the lucidity with which the idea of nullification is presented and justified.At this point, I have to explain my title.  Southern political thinking during the antebellum period was an explosion of innovation.  Its basic purpose was to allow Southern ""civilization"" to remain a slave based society even when the South was a minority within the country at large.  When reading Calhoun, John Taylor or Upshur one always has to keep this in mind.  No matter how attractive the ideas of nullification, the right to seccession and the idea of concurrent majorities seem, the historical origin taints their reception.  Nor are they necessarily realistic or workable.  But they are worth examining outside of their history.Upshur kind of allows you to do that.  His exposition is based on the 10th amendment and, of course, his understanding of the Virginia Resolution of 1798.  I believe he is correct in his presentation.But the whole effort runs into trouble in Letter VI.  There he admits that the current crisis is a misuse of nullification since the tariff acts ""are yet not so 'palpably' unconstitutional as to call for Nullification"".  Furthermore, some of South Carolina's own enactments for enforcing the ""ordinance are too rigorous, and probably are themselves unconstitutional"". (If I remember correctly, the convention passed a measure requiring all office holders to take an oath to support the Nullification.  This ledto some confusions of local governments).So basically Upshur is excoriating Ritchie for not supporting an overwought and itself unconstitutional ordinance. He does so because what if ""instead of tariff laws, [South Carolina] had nullified a law declaring all her slaves to be free?"" He then goes on to declare the maintenance of slavery as the ""highest of [South Carolina's] rights"".All in all, a very interesting document for a variety of reasons.  It can be usefully read as a fairly contemporaneous and accurate rendering of the Virginia resolutions, as one aspect of the Nullification Crisis and as an exemplar of how the issue of slavery drove Southerners to many extremes during the antebellum period.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3HGXRNKRJANVC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IFVYP7A#wasThisHelpful","R3HGXRNKRJANVC","A1D4PVZ0QWEAW1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1D4PVZ0QWEAW1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"History serves many purposes.  It serves to remember, it chooses to forget, it explains, it justifies and, on occasion, it overthrows.  Very, very often it serves to define the inevitable and thus to forgive or justify the failure to act. This superb volume from Charles Calhoun exemplifies these points both in the telling of his story and in some of the comments that Calhoun himself makes.Before I go on to talk about the book, I want to make my judgement of it clear.  It is magisterial, the end result of endless research and clearly, even elegantly, written.  I cannot recommend it highly enough to any reader of books on the period.The subject seems rather specialized- Calhoun wants to relate the way the leaders of the Republican party thought and acted on Reconstruction issues from 1869 to 1900.  In the letters and party papers of Republican leaders such as Grant, Hayes, Morton, Harrison, Chandler, Garfield and many others, Calhoun traces the struggle of those leaders to impose the Reconstruction amendments upon the South. From the time of the Grant administration, no one really wanted to maintain a military presence in the South.Unfortunately, far too many Southerners were unwilling to accept the fact that they lost and they continued to fight what was a war of terror against black voters and white Republicans. So these Republican leaders had to try to figure out a way to force the South to accept racial equality without imposing a military occupation as they had after the war.They were swimming against several tides.  First, there was the racism of the North. More and more white Americans were unwilling to continue to focus on issues like black voting rights. They had to worry about things like Catholic teachers, the Chinese out west and the gold/silver/paper money issue.The second tide was an ironic one.  Once again, the South was way over-represented in the Congress. The three-fifths rule was gone so that the number of Southern representatives actually went up.  By effectively preventing most blacks or Republicans from voting, Southern Democrats were able to solidify their control of the politics of Southern states and as a bloc in Congress.This was an issue that the Republicans try to use to energize the public over and over again.  The Southern states had disfranchised, in several cases, the majority of the voters in their states.  A Southern congressional district might send its representative to Congress representing a total voting population (that were allowed to vote) of one fifth the size of a Northern congressional district. Again and again, the Republicans made the point that the Southern states were not republics but unconstitutional oligarchies.The Democrats countered in three ways.  First, the raised the issue of states rights. They claimed that the States had the right to determine their own manner of elections, even the ones for Federal office.  They strove to make an alliance with the Democratic machine politics of the big Northern cites who were busily practicing their own brand of election fraud (vote early and often).  Finally they resorted to racist rhetoric and defiance.  It is hard to believe that some of the quotes that Calhoun cites were actually said in our Congress.The Democrats in the end had more lasting power than did the Republicans,  Apparently there are few things more long lasting than hatreds between peoples. The South maintained enough of a reign of terror as to continue to control the voting for the Democrats.  The Democrats in Congress continued to resist an voting laws or Federal oversight.  The same Republican leaders who had fought many years for those voting right began to council patience and ""moral improvement"".  Apparently, if black Americans would just apply to themselves to being chaste, frugal, energetic and righteous than white Americans would just naturally lose their racial prejudices, come to accept them as equals and walk with them arm in arm to the voting booth.  The only remark I will make is that in the course of being chaste, frugal, energetic and righteous that few of us would see the voting booth, white or black.The Republicans began to talk of the inevitability of the failure to make men change.  They began to talk of the need to focus on the larger issues of the country's survival and for black Americans to be patient.And there are several times when Calhoun almost adopts the same rhetoric.  I say ""almost"" because with a book like this it is often difficult to distinguish the author's voice from those who they are discussing.And this finally brings me to the point of my review title.  It is time to drop the cloak of historical inevitability.  It is always used to justify actions that are shameful.  We used to it to justify accepting the original Constitution with its deadly compromises with slavery.  We used it to justify taking land away from Mexico and the American Indians.  The Republicans used it to justify finally accepting Jim Crow.Calhoun's wonderful book tells that story of the slow wearing out of men who wanted to do right and ended up justifying failure.  There is much to learn from this book and from the way Calhoun writes history.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3SG8GAQMQ5P97/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0700614621#wasThisHelpful","R3SG8GAQMQ5P97","A1D4PVZ0QWEAW1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1D4PVZ0QWEAW1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I agree with the praise of the other reviewers and really only want to add some qualifiers.  R. Hal Williams is a good writer if you don't mind some tendency toward repetition.  If he likes a quote from a contemporary source, e.g., he will use it as an epigraph to a chapter and then in the text (sometimes on the same page).This book is not really a scholarly account of the election and its issues- it is more of a well-researched popular account which is fine. But I wanted him to go deeper into some of the issues.  I would really have liked to understand the parties' positions on the currency issue more.I also thought that he should have argued more for or further explained some of his conclusions. For example, on p.168, he asserts that the change from a more military style campaign to an educational style of campaign led to a drop off in party affiliation and voter turnout. He also asserts that the spread of the secret ballot around this time also weakened the parties. In other words, he is making the argument that a somewhat rational and discursive tone to the campaign along with a lessening of  their ability to cheat were major factors in the decline of party affiliation and in voter turnout. He is basing this conclusion on the work of some other scholars but his presentation was inadequate.These are, to be fair, minor complaints and largely amount to me saying that Williams did not write the book I wanted him to write.On the plus side, reading this book is a great way to spend an evening dipping into a remarkable episode in our remarkable history.  Williams also provides his readers with an annotated bibliography which I think should be required in any good work of non-fiction.Finally, I must agree with one of the reviewers comments on the University of Kansas Press.  They have become a preeminent publisher of great books on American history and political thought. Their series on the American Presidents and on American Presidential Elections are outstanding.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 3, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RW1VEDLZWJDQD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0700617213#wasThisHelpful","RW1VEDLZWJDQD","A1D4PVZ0QWEAW1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1D4PVZ0QWEAW1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As always when reviewing something that I read on my beloved Kindle paperwhite, I will review its readability on the Kindle and then the book itself.Let us put aside the issue of the price of the Kindle version. As I understand it, that is a publisher choice not Amazon's and that makes this the wrong venue for a complaint.  On the plus side this is the best Kindlization (my ugly word but I like it) of a scholarly book I have yet come across.  The footnotes are active both ways making skipping to a reference easy.  The index is active which I have never seen before and which makes the Kindle version actually easier to use than the real book which is a first.All in all, if you are making a choice between purchasing the ridiculously priced hard-back and the absurdly priced Kindle-version, I think the Kindle may be your best choice.  Well done to Routledge.  May they continue to improve the status on scholarly books in e-formats and may they issue this soon in a reasonably priced paperback.The book itself is superb in a variety of ways.  The subject is the Pittsburgh School of philosophy which is in reference to the work of Wilfred Sellars, John McDowell and Robert Brandom.  Somehow over the last five decades of the last century, the University of Pittsburgh put together an insanely good philosophy department with the likes of Adolf Grunbaum and Nicholas Rescher as well as the above three. Wilfred Sellers' work largely set the agenda for McDowell and Brandom although they both took that work in their own directions.I want to focus first in terms of who is the intended reader for this book and some of the ways that Maher organizes his writing for that reader.The book seems to be written for the intelligent and the curious omnivorous reader who reads philosophy on occasion but who is not expert in the field.  And Maher uses many delightful little tricks to make things easier for that reader.  His chapters are focused on particular issues (The Given, Following Rules, etc.) that are major themes of the school.  He outlines what he says are the major questions being pursued in those thematic investigations and then goes on the outlines the three philosophers' approaches to the issues.Maher is very good not only in outlining their commonalities but in explicating their differences. Thus we get a sense of their individuality as well as how their thought hangs together as a school.  He loves to point out what he calls the ""big ideas"" of a particular thinker in re a particular issue. For example:""Brandom's big idea is that the meanings of sentences and sub-sentences can be explained in terms of their inferential roles in a norm-goverened 'game of giving and asking for reasons.'""(p.66)Personally, I find this sort of thing useful in the extreme. I also appreciated the effort and the clarity put into his chapter summation and the final, Concluding Suggestions.Finally, Maher serves as a good guide to the primary and secondary literature.  You simply cannot ask for a better and more thorough guide to the complex work of a group of notoriously difficult philosophers.As for the school itself, all I will say is that what largely binds them together is their rejection of what Sellars' labeled, ""the Given"".  The Given is what would serve as the foundation of our knowledge.  In order to avoid infinite regression, it has to be independent of all other knowledge. That means that it can ""be had without having any other knowledge at all"" (p.9).  It would also have to be epistemically efficacious in that ""it can transmit positive epistemic status to other cognitive states of ours"" (p.10, Maher quoting W. DeVries). Again one of the central themes of the Pittsburgh School is that they reject the possibility of the Given and try to work out what it is to have knowledge of spite of that rejection.I hope I have served to spike your interest in this book in spite of the pricing.  There are always libraries, praise be to whatever, if any, Gods you believe in. The Pittsburgh School seems to be enjoying a resurgence of interest in their work and this book will serve as an excellent introduction to further reading.  It has also suggested to me that there are surprising and interesting connections to the work of other schools of contemporary philosophy such as the work of Rainer Frost.  Give Maher a read and see where he takes you.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2N9UFXJEI888G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0094GD2HO#wasThisHelpful","R2N9UFXJEI888G","A1D4PVZ0QWEAW1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1D4PVZ0QWEAW1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"First, as the other reviewer noted, this is a wonderful performance.  Round Midnight has always been my favorite basis for comparison between different horn players.  It is a rich brooding melody that just seems to bring out the best in many players.Jacquet's bassoon version is one of the best I have heard.  The timbre of the horn brings out qualities of the melody I had not heard until now.In somewhat of a response to the other reviewer- I suppose there is not more of a jazz repretoire for bassoon because the double reeds are hard to play.  However, there are a few jazz double reedists of note.  Yusef Lateef, Ken McIntyre, Sonny Simmons and Karen Borca have all played bassoon, english horn or oboe.  I can easily recommend all of their work although their aesthetics are more modern (that is not quite the right word and is no way meant as a disparagement of Jacquet) than Jacquet.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 31, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1E3VTHWTMSAX3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000UBTFR8#wasThisHelpful","R1E3VTHWTMSAX3","A1D4PVZ0QWEAW1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1D4PVZ0QWEAW1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A warning to my fellow Kindle readers-  I read this book in the paperback format.  I suspect that the Kindle version would be unsatisfactory.  There are 29 illustrations or charts and that stuff usually does not traslate well in the Kindle editions.  If someone has read the book on Kindle and disagrees, let me know and I will change this warning.As has been noted by other reviewers, this is a group effort by eleven different authors whose training spans the fields of anthropology, archeology, biology, linguistics, history and geography.The main interest of the authors is to reveal and change the underlying metaphors, frames and rhetoric which structures the research in their fields.  The main target of their proposed changes would be to get rid of the conceptual binary history/prehistory.The two principals throw down the gauntlet early in the book.  They feel that the stories that have been told in the sciences about what defines history as opposed to prehistory have the same structure as creation myths.  At some point in our prehistory, something miraculous happens and everything changes.  We learn how to farm, we discover writing, we start to live in cities (we invent politics) and we step through some sort of threshold into history.  This is basically of scientific version of a creation myth.The authors want to get rid of the divine spark, the miraculous moment and instead explore the concept of a deep history that goes back to the earliest hominids and maybe beyond.History almost inevitably has been organized on a sort of Cartesian plot with the zero point located at the birth of Christ and the time before Christ as an increasingly obscure vista extending back at the most 10000 years or so.[I will now indulge in a side-rant which you should feel free to skip.  The whole BCE and CE (Before Common Era and Common Era)thing is a joke.  The zero point on the plot is still Christ.  Let's just use YA for years ago and have done with it.  It marks no particular cultures grounding event as the starting point.  Indeed, it gets rid of the idea of a starting point at all. We now return to the regular review].One of the side effects of the directional arrow of time is that it generates stories of progress. The authors put forth the use of spirals, fractals, networks (see the list on p. xi) as the frames to be explored in the essays.  The authors then present us with a series of thematic chapters that explore a major component of our physical/cultural evolution that sums up recent work in that area as seen within the suggested metaphorical  foundations.  These topics include such items as Food, Migration, Bodies, Kinship, Scale etc..The whole effort is fascinating, incredibly informative, speculative and very provocative in the best possible way (that of making you want to do further research).  There are moments in the book where the authors suggest the beginnings of the history of containers both as a physical object and as a metaphor (p. 208), the deep history of repeatability (the ability to create identical objects) and it relationship to group membership (p. 236) or how natural selection can lead to the evolution of traits that increase the survival of reproduction of kin (p.170).  I found myself over and over again having to put the book down for a moment to try to absorb some of these suggestions.I have one caveat which I cannot but think the authors would agree with.  There is a tendency in those scholarly fields in the humanities/human science continuum to indulge in what I call the argument from wishful thinking.  This is a movement within a paragraph or a page or two from a may be true to a simple truth.  There is a good example on p.249. The authors suggestthat beads perhaps  reflected a heightened need to communicate with an ever-growing number of people  In the next paragraph, this becomes the support for the following:The social worlds they created did not flow automatically from earlier cognitive, demographic, or social revolutions.  They emerged instead as the innovative reworking of contexts and materials and the unleashing of latent abilities.We have moved from a perhaps to a conclusion and to do so is to hide the speculative nature of that conclusion.  I am not arguing against their idea- I am annoyed by the lack of the nuance.There are moments of weak arguments throughout the book.  There are weak chapters such as the one on Food.  There is also a much greater amount of really informative, well-written and carefully argued chapters like the ones on Migration, Deep Kinship and Scale.  This is a very enjoyable and provocative book.  My highest recommendation.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 31, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1JKHP1DM6MUE8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0520274628#wasThisHelpful","R1JKHP1DM6MUE8","A1D4PVZ0QWEAW1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1D4PVZ0QWEAW1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Szilard Mezei was born in Serbia of Hungarian ancestry.  He is a classically trained violist steeped in jazz and improvised music.  He is also an incredibly prolific composer and band leader who has put out something like 30 CDs in the last ten years.This CD features an octet of musicians many of which have worked with Mezei for years. Besides the leader on viola, there is Gergely Ittzs on various flutes, Bogdan Rankovic on saxs and bass clarinet, Branislav Aksinon on trombone, Albert Markos on violin, Milan Aleksic on piano, Ervin Malina on double bass and Istvan Csk on drums (I apologize for the lack on accents on some of the 'c's. I cannot figure out how to do that on Windows).The music is typically wonderful Mezei- postbop soli, big band lines, eastern european folk themes, classical influences.For this price you can afford to experiment a little.

"As always, I like to begin with a review of the how easy the book is to read on Kindle and then continue to the book itself.  There are only a few charts and they are easy enough to read on my Paperwhite.  There are a lot of photos whose captions occur after a page or two but it is easy enough to figure out what caption belongs to what photos.  The footnotes work easily enough so that to refer to them is not too disruptive to your reading.As for the book itself-please don't let my rating discourage you from reading this book.  It is impressive even path-breaking ethology and a compelling read.I do question many of the authors conclusions.  There are several times where the author attributes long-term goals to the chimpanzees on largely wishful ""it could be true"" kind of thinking.  And it may be true.  It is just that the evidence presented does not support the authors conclusion as anything other than one possibility.I also feel that the author may have suppressed some of the data in the first edition.  He admits in the new afterword that a very shocking incident occurred during his research that he did not include in the first edition ""to avoid ending the book on a dark note"".Trying not to give to much away, let us just say that there is a brutal killing (murder?) that seems to give the lie to much of the structure of chimpanzee politics that de Waal has theorized.  That act cannot be explained by de Waal given his theories and he doesn't really try to explain it.In conclusion, this is a superb read that seems to be well thought of in the field (I learned of it from my reading of Deep History by Shryock and Smail).  For this reader, the author fails to make his case but he does succeed in demonstrating what remarkable cousins(used loosely, people, just relax) we have in the chimps.  That was more than enough to make me enjoy the book.","3.0 out of 5 stars","December 8, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2KL0VSJAI7J8K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004HYFO3S#wasThisHelpful","R2KL0VSJAI7J8K","A1D4PVZ0QWEAW1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1D4PVZ0QWEAW1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A couple of business type points first.  The Limited Edition Mosaic Box series is one of the glories of contemporary music history.  Mosaic typically focuses on one artist during a particularly fruitful period of their work and repackages and releases everything they can get their hands one. There are always great notes and lots of photos from the sessions.I always recommend that you go to their site first. Since their editions are limited they do go out of print and then their prices skyrocket.  This Braxton box was released in a 5000 printed edition.  I bought mine just a few days ago and paid less then half of what the current seller is asking.  Just saying. Caveat Emptor.The other point is that Amazon has it wrong in the product detail listing- there are eight CDs, not six in this box.And what music! Braxton in the 70's is the very definition of a genius at one of his peaks.  This is a man of enormous musical imagination who unleashed that creativity during the seventies.  Consider the CDs:New York, 1974 (quintet,duet and saxophone quartets)Five Pieces 1975 (quartet)Creative Music Orchestra 1976 (legendary big band/orchestra session)Duets 1976 (with Muhal Richard Abrams)For Trio (trios with Henry Threadgill, Douglas Ewart, Roscoe Mitchell and Joseph Jarmen)The Montreux/Berlin Concerts (AB released about five truly great quartet/quintet live recordings during this decade)Alto Saxophone Improvisations 1979 (AB practically invented the solo sax genre with For Alto back in 1969)For Four Orchestras (self-explanatory)For Two Pianos (Frederic Rzewski and Ursula Oppens)Look at that range. Solo sax to four orchestras and most everything in between. Look at the name of his fellow players.  Braxton came out of AACM in Chicago, he was part of the New York Loft scene, he spent time in Europe during this decade working with European players like Derek Bailey and Evan Parker. Part of what I love about creative music is the way the musicians try to be independent of the larger labels and try to support each other in their endeavors.  People like Abrams, Braxton, Parker and Dave Holland (a regular bassist of AB on these recordings) had a lot to do with that.Not all this music is equally successful.  I am more fond of the solo sax work than the four orchestras pieces. There are none of the recordings of the classic AB quartet that knocked us out all through the late 80s and early 90s.But there is so much music of such high quality in this box that it is doubtful that one can claim to know the history of modern jazz/creative improv without knowing the music on these CDs.Much of this music is available on individual CDs although frequently hard to find and expensive by themselves.  If you can find this box at a reasonable price, I recommend it highly. It is all too rare that we are blessed by musical genius.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 27, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3NLF8CLAEB0D0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1592906028#wasThisHelpful","R3NLF8CLAEB0D0","A1D4PVZ0QWEAW1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1D4PVZ0QWEAW1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is that rare scholarly work that successfully challenges a traditional body of learning. With this book, Ober unified a scholarly movement that had been somewhat inchoate and gave it an organized structure.  It is not so much that everyone who works on the history of the Athenian democracy will agree with Ober but the way they discuss the issues, the way they frame the arguments will be structured by Ober's work.As the previous reviewer stated, Ober believes that for several hundred years that the Athenian democracy was a successful and workable government.  He believes that the citizens of Athens were able to transform the ideology of honor that had defined the elite in such a way that the citizens and the elites were able to mostly work together to govern their city.  That ideology evolved and was refined such that the elites were still encouraged to compete against each other but in ways which made the mass of citizens the judges.  The citizens were the ones who awarded the prizes and who gave the honors.Being put into that position, the elite had to modify their attitudes toward the mass of citizens.  The way that Ober argues that this occurred is altogether brilliant.  He discusses how this occurred both in the courts and in the governing councils.  He discusses how the elites learned to display and use their superior education, wealth and status to the advantage of the state and the masses.  He discuss how the mass ideology encouraged the elites to channel their display and their rhetoric of superiority into acceptable form.I cannot state what a revelation this book was to me.  I have read many of the ancient historians and am well read in most of the ancient philosophical schools.  In the follow up to this book, Political Dissent in Democratic Athens, Ober goes on to argue that most of those philosophers and historians created a counter-ideology that confronted and tested the ideology of the masses. Historically, the counter-ideology is the one that won (if only by the accident of the survival of texts- never forget how little of the ancient literature we have or how lucky we are to have what we do).Ober's thesis is that if you go back and look at the records, the speeches, the actions and the results that that counter-ideology needs to be balanced against the fact that the radical Athenian democracy was successful and creatively responded to the needs of the city both domestically and in their foreign policy.I will put it more bluntly than I think Professor Ober would-  At the origins of the Western tradition of political philosophy is a lie.  The radical democracy of Athens is full of lessons for us in our present situation.  I will also statethat anyone who is knowledgeable in the ratification debates of our own Constitution will learn that much of the American political tradition had its origins in Athenian democracy.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 27, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2X79MM3WSW6KZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0691028648#wasThisHelpful","R2X79MM3WSW6KZ","A1D4PVZ0QWEAW1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1D4PVZ0QWEAW1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have long thought that the history of western philosophy could be written as a history of the intellectual fear of the mob, the hoi polloi, the Great Unwashed, the mechanic, the people.  You get the idea.  Note that I am not just saying the history of western political philosophy but of philosophy as a whole.I came to a reading of this book hoping for some insight into my supposition.  What I found was not only that but I found myself in the middle of a much larger and more interesting intellectual project.Political Dissent in Democratic Athens was published in 1998 as the second volume of a trilogy that started with Mass and Elite in Democratic Athens back in 1989 and concluded with Democracy and Knowledge: Innovation and Learning in Classical Athens in 2008.  So what we the readers are presented with is a scholarly project that lasted about thirty years and which seems almost revolutionary in its methodologies and conclusions. For JO wants us to take the mob seriously.Let's talk about the volume under review.  In this volume, JO posits the existence of a tradition of intellectual opposition to the Athenian democracy and its democratic leaders.  He has chosen the works of  eight authors of that tradition to focus on: Ps.-Xenophon's Political Regime of the Athenians, Thucydides' History of the Peloponessian War, Aristophanes' Ecclesianzusae, Plato's Apology, Crito, Gorgias, and The Republic, Isocrates' Antidosis and Areopagiticus, Aristotles' Politics and the Political Regime of the Athenians by Ps.-Aristotle.Obviously, it is better to have read most of these works but JO has the craft of lucid clarity and the gift of conveying his passion for these works.JO is arguing that these writers formed part of a self-conscious tradition.  He wants to demonstrate that these works carried on a debate among themselves vying for a sort of critical supremacy among each other.  These authors not only critiqued the working of the democracy and the worthiness of the people themselves but did so with each other.In the course of doing so, they created the fundamental rhetorical and argumentative tropes that would serve to argue against democracy up until the 19th century.Ober brings to bear a large and varied methodological battery to use the analyze that tradition.  He makes use of J.L. Austin, Sandy Petrey, Quentin Skinner, of economics, sociology, literary theory as well as other approaches.It is a heady brew, one that consistently results in insightful readings of the above classic texts and of their political and historical contexts.One of the most interesting results of his study is his contention that Athenian democracy was more successful in dealing with internal and external issues than it is normally credited as being.  This was a political society that valued free speech by an unusually large (by no means universal) number of its members and in doing so created a form of social epistemology of great power.  It is a fascinating thesis and JO marshals an extraordinary variety of evidence for it.I have only one very small complaint about this book, one that borders on the petty.  JO is a good writer, even an excellent one at times.  However, he has an occasional weakness for what I call the scholastic malaprop- the use of a rare and odd word in the place of a common one with no refinement of meaning.  Instead of ""desired"" we have to read ""desiderated"", etc. Stop it, JO, just stop it.  The mob knows what it is doing with the choice of words as well.But I descend into a rant.All in all, this is an excellent and important work.  One that may well be part of a sea-change in classical studies.  I recommend the trilogy (I think).  The Amazon reviews of the other two works are encouraging.  But this volume stands alone as a work worth reading for any student of philosophy or of the ancient Greeks.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 20, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R39VI4UWFMJXNM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0691089817#wasThisHelpful","R39VI4UWFMJXNM","A1D4PVZ0QWEAW1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1D4PVZ0QWEAW1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Business first- These prices are ridiculous. This is a Splasc(h) recording which makes it hard to get but any adventuring around the internet should find more reasonable prices. Like say, $18.I am going to start off with a somewhat troubling statement and say that it is difficult for me to imagine any American jazz or creative improv artist coming out with this particular set of music.The reason, of course, is source music. American musicians grown up with the blues, with popular song and the entire tradition of jazz composition. And let me just state for the record that any tradition that has names like Ellington, Monk, Mingus, Coleman, Braxton, Hemphill and Threadgill is as mighty as any music tradition ever.The Italians absorb those American traditions through the American musicians they listen to but they also absorb all the folk musics of the Mediterranean and the whole classical tradition.  This last part is important. I really believe that the Italians have done a much better job absorbing classical techniques into their creative improv than have the Americans. There are exceptions of course but in general I believe this to be true.This grouping of Achille Succi features the leader on alto sax, bass clarinet and compositions, Beppe Caruso on trombone, Salvatore Maiore on double bass and cello and Roberto Dani on drums.This instrumentation is capable of somber and odd tonalities. Maiore uses a strong arco technique to good advantage and he sounds great against the graininess of the bass clarinet. Dani's drum work is light and incredibly crisp.Finally, Caruso and Succi are masters of their instruments. It makes me slightly cranky how few Americans know how great some of the Italians are.If you are someone who likes the more adventurous part of the ECM catalog or if you are a fan of someone like Andrew Hill this CD would be an excellent intro to the Italian jazz scene.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 8, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ZBCWF3DY3IUL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000F8DTZ0#wasThisHelpful","R1ZBCWF3DY3IUL","A1D4PVZ0QWEAW1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1D4PVZ0QWEAW1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There are some musicians who simply overwhelm. To watch them play is to watch a storm of energy and passion break over the venue.  There are others who play with an almost offhand mastery that seems relaxed and effortless. To my ears, this quartet is of the latter type of virtuosity.Lucky Thompson-tenor and soprano saxophone and composer of all compositionsCedar Walton- piano and electric pianoSam Jones-bassLouis Hayes-drumsI am not sure what to say about Lucky except that he was an influence on Coltrane and everybody else, he played with both Dizzy and Miles in the 50's and is simply one of the thoughtful and original bop tenor players around. The man was absolutely brilliant.Cedar Walton passed away a few weeks ago. Another piece of our cultural history has passed over and all we can do is listen to his contributions on countless CDs and be grateful. I love his playing on this CD and on other sessions of his own and with other tenor players (e.g., George Coleman and Clifford Jordan were especially simpatico).I am not going to say much about Jones and Hayes. If you don't know them as a jazz fan, then you need to go back and start digging through your collection. You will find them on any number of recordings.  Start listening to those recordings just for their contributions and then come back to this one. And then write me a comment telling me what a great exercise that was.Finally, listen to this recording just for the ballads, like Back Home From Yesterday and Yesterday's Child. Sweet bluesy beauty. Relaxed mastery.This is a great CD people.  Snap it up.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 8, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3M9V8ZHN4P217/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000NO2CWW#wasThisHelpful","R3M9V8ZHN4P217","A1D4PVZ0QWEAW1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1D4PVZ0QWEAW1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The following is a review I first wrote last summer for a previous editon of the Loeb Classical Library's third volume of Polybius' Histories. I have updated it with some info on the new edition which I have since bought and gone through for the changes.First, some explanation about the Loeb Classical Library. The Loebs are diglots, i.e., they provide the text in the original Latin or Greek on the left page and the English translation on the right. They are usually considered the standard edition of many works of Roman and Greeks authors, helping to establish the standard text in the original language as well as providing translations. They usually have a minimum of scholarly apparatus- there are no maps and few notes.The LCL seems to be in the process of reinventing itself. They are in the process of providing new translations of many of their established volumes. Translations that are more modern (sometimes more willing to be obscene), and have somewhat more of an scholarly apparatus. As a case in point, they are releasing a new edition of Polybius' Histories, our earliest extant history of the rise of Rome. The new translation by F.W. Walbank is based on the original by W.R. Paton but includes new Greek text, a more modern English, many more notes and nice bibliographies for further readings (Update on the bibliography-it is only in volume 1. However, the notes in all the subsequent volumes are based on it so it helps to have that volume when reading the later ones). It will undoubtedly remain the only complete English translation. The new translation of this volume has now been released.As for the text of Polybius' work, we have the first five books (of forty) in their complete form, much of the sixth book and fragments from the remaining books to various degrees. Volume III of the Loeb edition contains the whole of book 5 and what remains of books 6-8. There is over fifty pages of new material in this edition some of which is from the notes. The new fragements are largely in Books 7 and 8 although there is some new material in Book 6. Books 7 and 8 remain fragmentary. It is one of the many tragedies of classical learning that we do not have a completeFor Polybius (hereafter simply ""P."") is worth reading for many reasons. As I mentioned, his is the earliest history of Rome that has survived. Livy used P. as one of his major sources for his own history as did many historians that followed. Polybius' Histories influenced thinkers as different as Machiavelli and Madison.One of the main reasons that P. remains essential reading is Book 6. Through out the first five books of his history, P. reiterated that his overarching theme was an exploration of how Rome was able to be the first political entity that was able to overwhelm the whole of the known world. And it had done so in a period of about 60 years. P. had stated that it was due to the excellence of Rome's constitution and it is in Book 6 that he describes that constitution and what made it so excellent.The first thing to note is the use of the word ""constitution"". For the most part prior to the 18th century the word did not refer to a written document but to the combination of political institutional structure and the social norms of a country or city-state. To P. this was the single most important determinant of what the character of a people would be.The second thing to note is that most ancient writers saw the rise and fall of states as a natural phenomena. A city would be born and, if it had a good constitution, would grow into greatness and then suffer through a process of decay. Throughout the whole of his history it is obvious that P. thought that Rome's apogee of greatness was reached during the Wars with Carthage and that afterwords, the city began a slow decline. The rate of growth and decline was largely determined by how rational the leaders of a city was.There are many interwoven threads to the discussion of these themes by P. In what we have left of the book, there is a discussion of Rome's political institutions, the organization of the Roman army camp during a march, and the funeral rites of the Romans all are woven into the discussion. It is also evident after reading this book that P. is exemplifying part of the process in the rest of his history through the life of one man- Phillip V of Macedon.What unfolds first in Book 6 is an excellent presentation of the different types of governmental forms- kingship, aristocracy and democracy and their degenerate forms- tyranny, oligarchy and mob rule. There is a discussion of how states are formed and first develop into kingdoms then degenerate into tyranny from there to revolt into aristocracy then to degenerate into an oligarchy then to revolt into democracy then to mob rule then back to the contests of strong men leading to kings and so on. P. states that only those states that have learned to mix the three basic forms together that provides checks and balances on the one, the few and the many manage to form a perfection of political organization that can last for hundreds of years. P. mentions the political reforms of Lycurgus in Sparta as creating such a state on the basis of the wisdom of one man and he argues that Rome manage to evolve into such a state due to their well reasoned responses by the elite to a series of crisis over time.This discussion was enormously influential. Livy adopted it almost exactly, Machiavelli presents practically a carbon copy of it in the opening to his Discourse on Livy and John Adams praised Polybius as the best of the ancients on mixed government in the book he wrote on it hoping to influence our Constitutional Convention.Then there is also the  remarkable description of the layout of the camp that the Roman Army also used during this period. This layout has been described as almost hyperrationalistic. Every time any Roman army on the march camped it did so in exactly the manner P. described. This brings up a point that no one I have read it in my secondary meanderings through the scholarly literature has mentioned yet. Polybius mentions at one point, that coming into camp, everyone would know where to go and what to do. The camp, in effect, became a city with a known urbanscape no matter where the army was. It is my belief that what P. is doing in this section is really giving us the 'constitution' of the Roman Army and that it was also the excellencies of this constitution that allowed that army to be so successful.Finally there is the discussion of the funeral rites. P. sees these and the whole of Roman religion in any entirely instrumental light. And a very Straussian one at that. The rites serve to inspire the youth to achieve greatness in the service of the state. Religion as a whole is there to keep the unreasoning masses in line.All of these aspects of the Roman constitution are part of that whole which gave that people the ability to withstand the disaster of Cannae and to ruthlessly expand their dominion.The Books on either side of Book 6 in this volume are political histories of the whole of the known world in the late third century B.C. Books 7 and 8 because of their especially fragmentary nature are particularly frustrating.As a whole, however, I cannot recommend this book enough. P. is great company. He is plain-spoken but tells a gripping tale that is based on an enormous amount of personal research and his own amazing experience. He is opinionated and ornery and very discerning. He is, in his own way, as appealing as any of the ancients I have read. Give him a try.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 30, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1KASVJFK9FK4O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0674996585#wasThisHelpful","R1KASVJFK9FK4O","A1D4PVZ0QWEAW1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1D4PVZ0QWEAW1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Jay Sexton's book on the Monroe Doctrine is a focused and discerning look at the evolution of this country's most (in)famous foreign policy from it's declaration to the Roosevelt Corollary.Sexton's diplomatic history is organized around the evolving understanding of the Doctrine both in terms of our internal politics and as a guiding principle of our relations with other nations (especially the British).His ideological history of the Doctrine is organized around the concepts of union, nation and empire. In the beginning of our national history, our main political goals were union and independence. We were in a struggle to define what sort of nation we would be internally and we reacted to what we saw as external threats as well. As any reader of, say, the Federalist Papers will recall, our main fears were around some combination of internal faction and external foe.Frequently, those fears were exaggerated or just plain imagined. Sometimes those fears were manipulated to justify political actions by some of our early statesmen (see Frederick Merk's Fruits of Propaganda during the Tyler Administration for examples). The fear that drove the issuing of Monroe's message was that the Holy Alliance (France, Austria, Russia and Prussia) would use their Troppau Circular of 1820 to justify interferring on the side of Spain to crush the independence movements in South America. Our fear was that we would end up surrounded by some combination of the Holy Alliance, Spain and Britain.This fear along with some other politics led to Monroe's message (n.b., the phrasing- the policy that Monroe announced was not called the Monroe Doctrine for many years and when that happened it heralded a change in its meaning). The original message as crafted by Monroe, J.Q. Adams and Calhoun, warned the European powers that any intervention in Spanish America would be seen as a threat to our own security. It dodged the question of what we would do about it. It also dodged the question of our own expansion of territory. The only thing positive that it did declare we would do is not interfere in European affairs. (pp.60-61 for Sexton's summary of the original message). The message was thus a combination of anti-colonialist support for republicanism hemisphere wide while carefully not limiting our own options.One of the ironies that Sexton points out about this early stage in the history of the Monroe Doctrine is that it initiated an economic competition between ourselves and the British for the markets of Latin America that lasted decades. Early on, the British had the advantages- they had stronger financial resources to offer the developing countries of South American and they had a stronger navy to protect those markets from any disruption.The rest of Sexton's book next takes us through the history of the Monroe Doctrine as it became the Monroe Doctrine during the 1830s and 1840s. One of the fears that drove the internal political use of the Doctrine during that time frame was the fear of International Abolitionism.(By the way, the capitalization is mine. There is a fine book out there waiting to be written on the parallels between Southern fears about the International Abolitionist conspiracy and American fears of the International Communist Conspiracy during the '50s and '60s.) Mexico abolished slavery in 1829, the British passed the Slavery Abolition Act in 1833 and started to emancipate in the Caribbean. The combination of this external movement with several slave rebellions in the southern states was enough to push the use of the Monroe Doctrine toward a pro-slavery interpretation that was used to justify our acquisition of Texas, Oregon and California.I will briefly summarize the rest of Sexton's history. He writes of the use of the Doctrine during the Civil War by the diplomats on both sides of that conflict, and it use in the Gilded Age that eventually resulted in the War of 1898 and the Roosevelt Corollary which announced the the US would act as an international police in the case of repeated and ""flagrant wrongdoing"" in the internal politics of any country in the hemisphere. We would do so because it was ""our duty"". Our duty as defined by our civilization and our white man's burden. (see pp. 229-230). Along the way there are insightful and detailed discussions about the politics of Harrison, Cleveland and Blaine. There is also a continual narrative of the British support/competition. I mentioned earlier the irony of our partial dependence on the British navy for the enforcement of the Monroe Doctrine. After the announcement of the Roosevelt Corollary, the British withdrew some of their major naval units from the Atlantic area (p.238).Sexton then finishes up with a brief discussion of Woodrow Wilson and a summation of his argument.Overall, what Sexton has given us is a nicely detailed look at how one policy initiative effected the growth of this country from a union to a nation to a relatively new type of empire. If you are at all familiar with the history of nineteenth-century America this will be an useful and enlightening read.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 10, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/RLBA77QOYUXMD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0809071916#wasThisHelpful","RLBA77QOYUXMD","A1D4PVZ0QWEAW1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1D4PVZ0QWEAW1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"[A couple of things to note- In part, I am hoping that the Amazon community will educate me in response to this review (see, for an excellent start, the comment by J. Romeo below).So I will update my critique as I learn from that community in order to offer accurate information about the Kindle DX.Also, I seem to have given the impression that I am some sort of scholastic. I am not. I am a mechanic/vibration analyst who reads entirely non-fiction and loves to write reviews simply because it helps to fix what I learn into my increasingly inadequate brain. But I try to write good reviews that give an accurate accounting of the contents of the book in question- being able to cite passages is a part of that.]How you react to ebooks like the Kindle depends entirely on how you read. For me, the DX has been a disappointment albeit one with promise.What do I mean? If you read scholarly books or the classics in literature and philosophy, the Kindle seems like a dream come true. I should no longer need an eight foot by four foot book shelf to hold the classics of Greek and Roman literature and philosophy, the classics in Western philosophy, the writings of the Founders of this country and reference works. They all can go in my Kindle. Nope. Not at the present time at least.There are three major problems.First, and very important are the editions available. Amazon's links to Kindle editions of the classics, e.g., Aristotle's Nichomachean Ethics, are nothing less than deceptive. The Kindle editions are usually not the same as the normal editions and almost always use older translations and contain none of the scholarly apparatus. See for example the listings for various of the Cambridge Texts in the History of Political Thought. The Kindle links may or may not be to a Kindlelized Cambridge version featuring the same quality translations and introductions. Which editions are available for Kindle is not up to Amazon clearly.  But Amazon should clearly and honestly indicate when a link is to a different edition or not link it at all.Secondly, the Kindle does not provide pagination and the Kindle editions rarely provide any reference to traditional scholarly systems of locating the same passage in the many different editions of a text. The Kindle has some stupid unique system at the bottom of the page that is useless either as a citation in your own writings or to look up the citations of others. (However, see the comment below by J. Romeo- the latest edition of the Chicago Style Manual has a Kindle standard for citing. But that doesn't speak to my problems when I want to check a reference that someone else is making. Which I do fairly frequently. This remains an area where Amazon has work to do.  I am of the belief that they should move toward specialty Kindles that contain different software for the needs of different types of readers.)Thirdly, using footnotes on the Kindle is a pain. I was just trying to look up a reference in one of Thomas Schoonover's books and I can't. There is no way to activate the footnote to go to the reference. Some Kindle books enable you to do that and some don't.In conclusion, if all you want to read are popular novels or non-fiction that require little if any interaction with the text, the Kindle may be for you. For now, until Amazon, begins to actually provide the Kindle with more useful features for the more scholarly reader, I will continue to rely on those eight by four bookshelves.p.s. If, by chance, you think my complaints are the result of my ignorance rather than of the Kindle, please, please, please enlighten me in the comment section.","2.0 out of 5 stars","April 9, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3JDCQ3CAP0C2Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002GYWHSQ#wasThisHelpful","R3JDCQ3CAP0C2Q","A1D4PVZ0QWEAW1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1D4PVZ0QWEAW1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The past resists our attempts to simplify it. It is the task of a great historian to complicate things- to point out that many causes were at work, that many influences were felt, that many things were possible. The present is not the result of a logic but of choices made, of actions taken and, yes, of books read.Ralph Ketcham in this insightful and erudite study does all of the above. He complicates our sense of influences on the Founding Generation, especially on the first six presidents. He reveals some hidden influences and makes sense of how someone like Jefferson or Monroe or my boys, Jimmie Madison and J.Q. Adams thought that they could be at one and the same time responsive to the voice of the electorate and a leader able to distill that voice to a sense of the common good.Ketcham's books is divided into three parts. The first is a study of the political thought of Dryden, Pope, Addison, Swift and especially Bolingbroke. The focus is on the ideal of the Patriot King- the rightful leader who will rule for the good of all the people and who is immune to the corruption of faction or self-interest. Not only is the Patriot King immune to corruption but he is a moral and patriotic paragon for the whole nation. He rules in such a way as to maintain the virtue of the people so that they understand his actions as being based on the common good and are supportive of those actions.These writers Ketcham opposes to thinkers like Defoe and Mandeville and to political leaders like Walpole and later, the elder Pitt.This first section is the strongest part of the book for me. It gave me a whole new way to read say, Gulliver's Travels and Robinson Crusoe (as being representatives of opposite sides of political reactions to the Enlightenment). Ketcham also is good at something that few intellectual historians are good at and that is getting you to feel how very shocking some books were in their time. Mandeville's Fable of the Bees was such a book. It message that Private Vices can lead to Public Good overturned thousands of years of moral thinking by people like Aristotle, Polybius and Plutarch.As I said in my first paragraph, Ketcham is good at complicating things. Many of the early American leaders were men influenced by both Swift and Defoe, Bolingbroke and Locke, by Aristotle and the Enlightenment, by the Bible and by Deism. Ketcham's second section is to show how these mixes were creative tensions in the thought and Presidencies of Washington, Adams (the father), Jefferson, Madison, Monroe and Adams (the son). This section could have been expanded. Ketcham devotes only about 10 pages to each. But he has a lot of insight to offer on all of them, particularly Washington, Jefferson and J.Q. Adams. The organizing theme is the reaction of all of these men to the idea of a political party. They all believed parties to be evil, to be the result of the factionalism caused by focus on narrow or particular interest. Yet, especially after the first Adams, parties were also seen as an expedient that could be used to counter factionalism. That expedient would be temporary and would disappear with the defeat of faction and corruption.The gift of Martin Van Buren was to begin to think of parties as something permanent that could weld different factional interests into a more or less coherent national program. The common good was no longer unitary but a guidance of faction. The Patriot King as Power Broker. Bolingbroke would have hated Van Buren.The third section deepens our understanding of the early American reaction to the idea of parties by studies on Franklin and Hamilton. Each of those two approached Ketcham's central tensions differently. And again, anyone who has studied those two men at all will find much to thing about in this part of the book.Finally, Ketcham ponders a little on the relevance of the idea of rising above party and faction in our own time. Here I think he misses the mark a little.To me, there is a great history book waiting out there to be written. It should use the framework of a Pierre Hadot or a Leo Strauss in that there is a central concept in Western political thought that has never received anything like a definition. It is more of a creative tension or a problem complex than an idea. I am referring to the idea of 'the common good'. The only clear definition of this idea that I know of is derived from Machiavelli by Harvey Mansfield. Mansfield says that Machiavelli would define the common good as what you and I can share after taking it from another group of people.Obviously, this is not what Bolingbroke or Jefferson or Lincoln thought. But until we have some idea about how we can ground our political leadership in a vision of the common good that isn't purely personal then we must rely on as rational a discourse as we can generate (not much) as we contest our particular interests in the political arena.In the meantime, Ketcham has given us some ideas about where we can go to do the research for that grounding. He raises the hope that in reflecting on the debates between Bolingbroke and Walpole, Defoe and Swift and on the actions of a Jefferson that we may find our own source of creative tension. It is worth the thinking on it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 30, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/RKGFS9EMMZGT1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=080784179X#wasThisHelpful","RKGFS9EMMZGT1","A1D4PVZ0QWEAW1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1D4PVZ0QWEAW1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As far as I can ascertain from from my brief bit of research this is a somewhat Kindlelized version of Gaillard Hunt's 4 volume collection of Madison's Letters and Writings. My complaints are not against the writings themselves. It is an okay collection, very letter centric.But it is practically useless in this format as a research tool. If you are reading, e.g., Ketcham's biography of Madison and he makes reference to a 1803 letter of Madison to Monroe, good luck finding it quickly. First, you have to find the overall table of contents and link to the right volume, then link to the right year and then page through that year and hope Hunt included it.Slow, tedious and annoying.The Online Library of Liberty has an electronic version of Hunt's 9 volume collection of Madison's papers. Use that instead. Or wait until the publishing world catches up to the fact that while ebooks are cool, they are only as useful as publishers make them to be. At the moment, they haven't caught on to the fact that there is a market for good, well formatted version of the classics in good translations and editions and for American history and political theory in good editions. Until they wake up to that, ebooks like the Kindle will not be a decent research tool nor the basis for a great personal library.","2.0 out of 5 stars","March 20, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3GE8BKRL2UQY4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004NEW20A#wasThisHelpful","R3GE8BKRL2UQY4","A1D4PVZ0QWEAW1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1D4PVZ0QWEAW1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Let's deal with the audio issue first. The sound is at its worst when the horns are playing unison lines (or as close to that as Coleman and Cherry get). Whenever they switch to just the one of them playing, the sound improves noticeably in quality. Even then there are moments when it is noticeable how far someone is from the recording mike. For example, at about the 4:30 mark of Dancing Flower, Coleman gives way to Cherry and Cherry sounds as if he is almost out of mike range. He then must have walked closer to wherever the mike was because the recording slowly improves. It is sad that no one took the opportunity to make an audiophile quality live recording of the reunion of one of the top ten (I would argue for top five) greatest bands in jazz history. What a wasted opportunity.One of the other reviewers noted that this quartet played together on a 1987 release, In All Languages. In 1990, Reggio Emilia, Italy held a three day Portrait of the Artist festival built around Ornette Coleman. (Not to beat a dead horse, but, gosh, wouldn't it be nice if an American city did something like that.) This recording is the complete concert by the quartet at that festival on April 24, 1990. It includes tunes from the original recordings of the quartet and from their In All Languages release as well as Ornette compositions originally recorded by other of his ensembles.The main point I want to make is the same as everyone else's on this page- regardless of your feelings of audio inadequacy there is simply too much great music being played on these CDs to miss out on. My favorite of my present listening is on Magic- Haden has a nice solo and then at about the 6 minute mark Ornette tears in with a fervor with that uniquely yearning tone of his. It is a delight to hear Higgins again in this context. He has always been one of my favorite drummers and what he brings to this grouping is unique.If you are new to Ornette, this is not the place to start. But if you are one of us who grew up and old listening to the music of Coleman, Cherry, Higgins and Haden this is an essential addition to your collection. And, yes, I second the motion for a Prime Time Box.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 19, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2M6L00PPTSTW9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003XKAZT0#wasThisHelpful","R2M6L00PPTSTW9","A1D4PVZ0QWEAW1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1D4PVZ0QWEAW1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have other recordings like this by various violinist and violists, I swear I do. I just cannot find them in the wilderness of my collection. I am referring to the type of CD where a soloist will use a series of baroque or earlier compositions by one composer to frame a series of contemporary compositions by an assortment of composers. Thomas Demenga did a series on ECM of the Bach suites where they are paired with works by contemporary composers such as Elliot Carter.On this particular CD, Matt Haimovitz plays a series of Ricercari by Domenico Gabrielli written in 1689, some 30 years before the Bach Cello Suites. Inbetween the Ricercari are modern solo cello compositions by Berio, Dallapiccola, Sciarrino and Ambrosini. The one ringer (in the sense of not being written by an Italian) is the Capriccio by Brian Cherney. The Berio and the Dallpiccola are both particularly strong. Dallapiccola's piece is typical for how I think of him- half baroque materials and half twelve-tone rows, half tonal and half atonal. I find his work instantly accessible. Berio takes more work. Haimovitz describes the piece as ""ruminations on Sri Lankan drumming techniques"". Now I know less than nothing of Sri Lankan drumming. But the Berio Sequenza is immediately about the cello as percussion possibility not only in terms of strumming and bowing techniques but in using the cello as a drum. It took me a while to get into this piece but I enjoy as much as any now and hear it afresh every time I hear it.But I must say that everytime Haimovitz starts up one of the Gabrielli, their unabashed tonal beauty is like the sun coming out from behind a cloud. They are simply sweet.Part of their beauty is in Haimovitz' playing and in his instrument. He plays the pieces with extraordinary tone and gravity. He plays them on a Matteo Goffriller that was built in 1710, 300 years ago. 300 years of aging, of mellowing into a sound as musically rich as any instrument can produce.So there you have it. Great instrument, great performer, great repertoire. Music that will feed your soul as well as your mind.

"It is my opinion that this book is the beginning of the end for the claim that the predominant cause of the Civil War wasn't slavery. Slavery was the primary single issue and it was the issue that energized most of the other issues that contributed to the war. Having stated that, I intend simply to summarize how she did her research and some of her conclusions.Manning's book is the beginning of the end for other causal explanations because she relies on the testimonies that should bear the most weight, i.e., the wartime letters home of the men in blue and gray who fought at Gettysburg, Vicksburg, the Wilderness, Cold Harbor, Shiloh and all the other horrific battles of the war.Her research is pretty amazing and should first be assessed by looking at her list of Primary Sources in the back of the book which is organized by state. She traveled to every state that was involved in the Civil War and roamed through 45 local libraries and historical societies. She went through larger collections like those of Military History Institute of the U.S. Army and the Library of Congress. She read published collections of Civil War letters and innumerable state documents relating to the War.Her focus was on the enlisted man and on letters actually written during the war rather than memoirs that were written in the postwar years. She gathered biographical data of the various correspondents whose letters she collected and noted their place of origin, their occupation, educational attainments, etc. She then selected 477 Confederate soldiers and 657 Union soldiers to focus on because their collected backgrounds were representative of the armies as a whole.She also uncovered some 100+ regimental papers (largely published by enlisted men) and used them as well. She then organized this body of material by date. Not surprisingly, she found that opinions shifted with the fortunes of the war.Finally, for any one opinion to be considered dominant, it had to be expressed by at least a three to one ratio (p.11). By the way, all this is explained in the first twenty pages, so any reviewer who claims she used a different research strategy or that she can't back up any of her claims with ""facts"" hasn't read the book.Her presentation of what she learned is very well written and easy to follow. She largely organized her presentation around the timeline of the war. She then covers what was being discussed in the letters of the Confederate Army and the Union Army both white and black.I think she has three hermeneutics that she deploys on the material. First is the vast ornate interplay of slavery and racism within American culture at the time. Manning is very clear about the racist attitudes of many of the Union soldiers throughout the war and is clear about the way the black soldiers were mistreated, especially initially, by the higher command of that Army. But she believes that their letters show that during the course of the War, that enlisted white Union soldiers went through several shifts in their attitudes toward slavery and toward black Americans. Those shifts she sees as largely progressive and in advance of the chain of command and Northern public opinion as a whole. The War radicalized the soldiers. Most of them had never seen Southern slave society at work and they didn't much cotton to it. Their own racism took longer to be impacted.  But for many Union soldiers, watching black Americans in battle was a revelation and a catalyst to personal change. There was backsliding during changes in the momentum of the War, there was frustration by the white soldiers at how much they were sacrificing and some of the soldiers left their service as racist as they entered it. But Manning is clear that there was a enormous change in the opinion of the white enlisted man as a whole and in the higher command. At the end of the war, the black Union soldier received equal pay and could become an officer. This was unthinkable four years earlier.Manning's other two hermeneutics are more controversial and are probably the source of most of the resistance to her reading of the evidence. Manning feels that she can discern differences in the patriotism of the Confederate soldier and that of the Union soldier. It is her claim that the average Southerner regarded government as justifiable only to the extent it served his needs and that of his family. To the extent that that government began to impinge on his paternal control of his own life and his family was to the extent that the Southerner rejected government. By the way, she sees a related dynamic in the ways that the North and the South responded to the Second Great Awakening and its aftermath in antebellum America. That religious movement created organized reform movements in the North that focused on societal issues (among others, abolition). In the South, the emphasis was on the personal reform of the individual.When the Southern states succeeded, they created a new national government to which the white Southern man had few if any attachments. As the War went on, the Confederate government had to behave in ways that didn't fit in with Southern ideas on government. To that extent, the Confederate soldier felt less loyalty to that government. The difference with the Northern white soldier should be clear. Billy Yank had a history with his government. He regarded that government as part of his larger society that provided services and to which he owed allegiance.This difference cuts across her third hermeneutic which deals with the nature of Southern versus Northern manhood. Manning feels that for the enlisted white Confederate, slavery created a social structure which gave him the space to express that paternalistic manhood. His service on slave patrols, his ability to discipline slaves who were not respectful and other rights that the poor white non-slaveholding man had compared with a slave gave him a sense of equality with the upper Southern masters. Obviously, this is the most controversial portion of Manning's reading of the Southern men's letters but she uses it to explain a lot.Another aspect of Manning's version of Southern manhood was rooted in fear and violence. The South had been traumatized by actual and possible slave rebellions. In some parts of the South, the slaves outnumbered the whites. Race war seemed a real possibility if the slaves were ever to be successfully armed and encouraged. The War and the Union Army did just that. The Southern soldier believed that he was fighting for the physical safety of his own family and for his own farm. Manning feels he fought to preserve the world he knew and wherein he had his place.This reading is how Manning confronts one of the common arguments against slavery being the main cause of the war. The fact is that the vast majority of Southern white men did not own slaves. Why would all these men choose to fight and die over something they had no stake in? Manning's answer is that the Southern man fought for the world he knew and loved and wanted to leave to his children. The Confederate soldier knew that world was built on slave labor.As I implied earlier, I found Manning's book to be utterly convincing. I would offer one more reason for reading her book. She uses an enormous amount of quotes. I detest the way the way we men talk about violence among ourselves- the fight stories, the ""then I said"" type stories that are told to maintain whatever it is they maintain. But I find the letters that are written home by American soldiers in war to be a unique and compelling literary genre. They are often poorly spelled and grammar is frequently taken to the woodshed but they are frequently funny and have a bedrock humanity which is enormously appealing. Reading some of Manning's quotes will make you wish you knew the men writing and could converse with them. Just another reason to read this very strong contribution to American history.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 12, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2YY8X86H0SC98/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0307277321#wasThisHelpful","R2YY8X86H0SC98","A1D4PVZ0QWEAW1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1D4PVZ0QWEAW1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is another superb member of the Document Chicago series put out by 482 Music. Like many other members of that series the players involved are part of a Chicago scene that tries to be all inclusive in a lot of ways.All-inclusive in the sense that everyone is a composer whose compositions everyone plays. All-inclusive in the sense that everyone plays on each other projects: groupings form and morph and some groups have revolving leadership chairs. All-inclusive in the approach to the whole tradition of jazz. Many of these people seemed to have absorbed Auden's insight that creative work within a tradition can be a whole lot of fun.Consider the present CD. Paul Giallorenzo is the composer and the pianist, Josh Berman plays cornet, Dave Rempis (All bow in his direction)is on alto and baritone sax, Anton Hatwich is on bass, and Frank Rosaly is the drummer.The review notes above cite early Taylor, Monk and Nichols as influences. O yeah, listen to Twisted Lopes and tell me Giallorenzo doesn't know his Monk. I hear a lot of other 60s piano icons as well-e.g., some of his compositions remind some of Andrew Hill as well. But the nice thing is that there is no sense of being derivative. The best of this generation of Chicago musicians, like Rempis, approach the tradition as a vast resource of knowledge, techniques, tools and aesthetics to draw from in exploring their own sensibilities. They get into the tradition to go further out. Thereby renewing and extending it. What the music called jazz is supposed to be about.The compositions are very strong. Consider Porous (for Quintet). The first four minutes or so are all long doleful tones. Rempis' solos is built around them. But then the band drops out except Hatwich who starts walking that bass. Giallorenzo enters back in with a completely different mood- more swinging but still analytical. This is maybe his strongest solo. The composition ends on Berman and Rempis punching out a swinging unison line until the long doleful tones return us to the beginning. All in all, a very nice structure that brings out the best in everybody.This is a strong debut that deserves a listen. If you are not familiar with the current Chicago scene or the Document Chicago series this is a good place to start. Then simply follow the trail of Berman, Rosaly, Hatwich and Rempis. The whole experience will be fun, I promise.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 4, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1BYI2NQ6WSKUC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002AGF87W#wasThisHelpful","R1BYI2NQ6WSKUC","A1D4PVZ0QWEAW1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1D4PVZ0QWEAW1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Once again, I find myself praising the greatness that is Clean Feed Records. Not only does Pedro Costa's company consistently put out great current recordings but they release this 1997 gem of a session. (By the way, if like me, you prefer CDs to the audio horror that is MP3, go to the Clean Feed site where they will be glad to ship you a brand spanking new CD.)Let us deal with the recording details. In June, 1997 in NYC Tim Berne gathered together the following group of musicians:Baikida Carroll- trumpetMichael Formanek- contrabassMarc Ducret- 12 string guitarDominique Pifarely- violinErik Friedlander- celloChris Speed- clarinetJim Black- drumsand himself on alto and mighty mighty baritone sax.This octet was unleashed on two of Berne's compositions. The first one, The Proposal, goes for 36 minutes and the other, oPEN,cOMA clocks in just under 30 minutes.I would really love to know more about how Berne structures these pieces. They have what seem to be obviously composed sections (unless this group of musicians can spontaneously create unison lines) there are plenty of soli sections (Carroll is particularly good on this CD)and what seem to be group improvs. But there is something going on here that is really well done.Perhaps Berne has absorbed his Hegel (quantitative changes eventually become qualitative changes) but these pieces slowly and subtly evolve. One moment you are listening to a group improv then it seemlessly organizes itself into a structured background from which Carroll emerges as soloist then Pifarely or Friedlander enter into dialogue with Carroll and then another group passage asserts itself and then everyone slowly drops out until Black is left to play a percussion piece which then stops. (By the way, does anyone else notice how after listening to a great piece of music, the air seems to vibrate with the decaying harmonics and then how empty the silence is for a bit? No? O, never mind.)Berne does not dominate the music at all, in fact, I would have liked more of him. The string quartet (I include Ducret) use the most extended technique and they all sound great. It is sad that this group doesn't still put out recordings. (Maybe they do. No one is more ignorant than I. If anyone knows of other recordings by this group, please inform me in the comment section.)In the meantime, all hail these musicians and Clean Feed for this hour of listening bliss.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 3, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R14QZQR6SJMBRQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004K35PB2#wasThisHelpful","R14QZQR6SJMBRQ","A1D4PVZ0QWEAW1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1D4PVZ0QWEAW1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Robert Pierce Forbes' book is a masterwork in American history. His book reinterprets the Missouri Compromise as the watershed event in the first eighty or ninety years of this country's history. As I read him, Forbes is asserting that this country was created with a fundamental contradiction that was so deeply ingrained that our political institutions eventually failed in dealing with it. And then the war came. I am talking, of course, about the contradiction between the universal rights enshrined in our founding documents (and thus in our self-image) and the presence of slavery through out much of the land. We believed that we had created the universal republic and what we had really created was a white republic. We were able to live with the contradiction because most people believed that slavery had been imposed on us by Britain and that it would eventually die off. As time went on two paths began to emerge. The northern states moved slowly toward making slavery illegal (which was very different from making their free black inhabitants full citizens) and the southern states moved toward being (in various ways) slave-based economies. In Forbes' reading of the historical record, the debates that erupted around the Missouri compromise exposed just how deep those differences ran.The spark was the Tallmadge amendment which would have prevented any more slaves being brought into Missouri after statehood and would have emancipated any Missouri born slaves at age 25. Forbes' telling of the resulting debates and the behind the scenes maneuvering that led to the two compromises is masterful and insightful. He develops several themes in this discussion. One is that James Monroe was much more effective a President than has been realized. Forbes shows that Monroe was tireless and adroit in his efforts toward the compromises. Perhaps most admirably, Monroe seems to have simply not cared about credit. He simply wanted what he thought was good for the country to occur no matter who got the acclaim.Forbes also notes that the various arguments that were developed during the debates and the language that was used to soften the compromises were harbingers of some of the horrors to come. The language that Clay used to forge a Congressional acceptance of the provocative Missouri Constitution (particularly the clause that outlawed any free blacks from moving into the state) was to prove the foundation for the Dred Scott decision years later. That language framed the national thinking about free blacks in such a way as to deny any possibility of freedmen being citizens of many Northern states.That last sentence speaks to one of the most remarkable things about Forbes' book. He is clear that the North legalized many forms of racism.  He also really tries to make some of the Southern reaction and/or thinking on racism and slavery understandable.For example, up until the British emancipation of their West Indian slaves in the 1830s, there had never been a peaceful emancipation on a societal level by slave owners. Slavery had always ended in rebellion up until that point in time. So prior to that emancipation, it is understandable that most slave owners assumed that emancipation without exportation of the freed blacks would lead to race war. Their most recent example was Haiti and they also had the slave rebellions of Denmark Vecsey and Nat Turner to support their beliefs.This also explains why the British abolition movement was such a provocation to them. The successful emancipation of the West Indies proved that their fears were not completely justified. Most simply could not accept this.Forbes' discussion ranges far beyond Missouri. He talks about the tariff debates, the internal improvement debates, the (complete and total outrage) of the South Carolinian Negro Seaman Act, the Nullification crisis, the annexation of Texas, the Dred Scott decision and Kansas, bloody Kansas. He discusses the enormous variety of Southern intellectual reaction to these various crisis, the unanimity of the Southern political reaction on the national stage and all the various ways that Northern politicians played the doughface. Forbes provides keen insights into the actions of Monroe, Clay, Webster, Calhoun, Van Buren, J.Q. Adams and Jackson. He provides readings of many of the influential writings of the times whether Robert Turnbull's The Crisis or Thomas Cooper's Consolidation or John Taylor of Caroline's New Views on the Constitution or David Walker's Appeal...to the Colored Citizens of the World. His history ends with the Dred Scott decision and with the compromise of 1850 wherein the Missouri Compromise was abrogated.Forbes discussion is well grounded in original sources and with a mastery of the scholarly literature. He has absorbed Thomas Hart Benton's Thirty Years View, J.Q. Adams' Memoirs (one of the essential diaries in American history) and Hermann von Holst's The Constitutional and Political History of the United States as well as the more recent literature. But it is really in his mastery of the Congressional record and in the letters of people like Van Buren and Monroe wherein Forbes has grounded his interpretations.Rarely, usually once or twice a generation, a historical work comes along which changes a field of inquiry, which sets new standards of research for those who labor in that field thereafter. We have seen such works, in my lifetime, from Bailyn, Woods, Foner and maybe McPherson. It is my belief that Forbes' book may be their equal. Time will tell. But why wait for history's judgment? I guarantee you that you will learn from this book, that it will give you much to think about, that it will make sense of much that confused you before and that it will bring you up against those twin issues in our national narrative that have warped so many events in that narrative- slavery and race.

"This is a superb addition to the sax trio tradition. (I am a little unsure of my history here so if I get something wrong feel free to correct me in the comment section below). I believe the beginning of the saxophone trio format was the Way Out West album of Sonny Rollins from 1957. Rollins was a stalwart of the format which is also featured on albums like East Broadway Run Down.It was a format used by many in the free jazz/creative improv tradition. In fact the drummer on Foxy is Barry Altschul who was featured on many a Sam Rivers and Anthony Braxton release during the late sixties and seventies including some in the trio format. Many other saxophonists have delved into the format appreciating the freedom that it gives them whether as the dominant voice or as part of a equal triangle of sound.But few have unleashed a trio recording as powerful as this one. I came to this CD because on my fondness for the group Mostly Other People Do The Killing and for Jon Irabagon's work on sax in that quartet.What we have on this CD is Irabagon on tenor, Altschul absolutely tearing it up on drums and Peter Brendler on the bass. Together they unleash a single masterful 75 minute (more or less) improv that is astonishing and exhausting. It all starts on a fade in and seems to be cut off at the end so it appears to be part of an even longer improv session. I find myself making this observation a few times lately (e.g., in reference to a recent Fred Anderson release) but I have no idea how someone is able to play like this and not just lie down afterwards.Irabagon utilizes the history of the jazz bop and post-bop saxophone as the raw materials for his improv. There is plenty of Rollins quotes to be heard (Note that the goofy cover is a homage to the cover of the Way Out West LP) as well as quotes from others that I would have to hear several times to identify. There is a snatch or two of some Christmas songs or some standards. Irabagon also will land on a phrase or a short figure and rework it as the structure for several minutes of the improv before it leads somewhere else. On one of the tracks (more or less randomly divided into twelve rhymes of Foxy) the result is a three or four note figure that is repeated over and over for five plus minutes while Altschul takes center stage.Altschul is great- thrashing, building up the momentum or tearing it apart to find another pulse. He is the perfect foil for Irabagon.My one lament is that Brendler sounds to my ears to be underrecorded (or poorly mixed). He is as active and creative as the others and never wavers in his ability to match their intensity but he gets a little lost in the mix sometimes.Even with that caveat, Foxy remains just an amazing album. It may not be for everybody, and it won't be for everybody listened to all at once but drop it on the spiral function on your CD player and see if it doesn't blow most of what you match it with away. Or listen to it all on your drive home from work and see if it doesn't clean some of the corporate stain off your soul. Worked for me. But in any case, if you like modern jazz or the saxophone this all too obscure little gem deserves your closest attention.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 15, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R36V581ITA1RLY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00435JIJC#wasThisHelpful","R36V581ITA1RLY","A1D4PVZ0QWEAW1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1D4PVZ0QWEAW1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"(The qualification of my title is based on the fact that I haven't heard Forty Fort yet. That and the fact that I am fond of ambiguity.)Mostly Other People Do The Killing or MOPDTK was formed in 2003 by Moppa Elliott and has featured the same personnel during that time- Elliott as composer and bassist, Peter Evans on trumpet, Jon Irabagon on tenor and sopranino saxophones and Kevin Shea on drums. This particular CD is a live recording from a performance at Coimbra, Portugal that took place in May of 2010.Their music is diverse, very riffy but in what is often described as an off-kilter way. It frequently disintegrates into free jazz of various types and then suddenly riffs back into a bluesy bebop. Very nice. I stole my title from Irabagon's description of the band on his website.The musicianship is a wonder. Listen to the way Shea kicks things off on Drainlick. Irabagon and Evans have different styles which mesh well. Evans is more traditionalist, largely eschewing smears or extended techniques. He is a superb player, incredibly fast and inventive. Irabagon on the other hand, loves extended techniques and mixes it in well with a solid traditional technique. Listen to the samples for his The Observer CD to hear just how traditional he can sound.Elliott compositions are consistently interesting and he seems to be mixing them all up in the performance so that the group starts off in one tune and end up with another composition. I wonder if this is the influence of Braxton's '80s quartet at all? Anyway, it works really well for these guys.One other thing. MOPDTK likes to pay homage/mock classic jazz LP covers. Their previous CDs has cover that paid homage to great Ornette Coleman, Roy Haynes or Art Blakely covers. This one is an obvious mock up of the cover of Keith Jarrett's Koln Concert CD. This one feels a little snarkier than the others largely because of their facial expressions. Take a look at the photos and you decide.Finally, I would be remiss if I did not point out that this is one of Clean Feed's first releases in 2011 and that Clean Feed is clearly The Greatest Musical Label of All Time or, at least, one of the very best of the moment. I have over 30 CDs from that label and there isn't a lemon in the entire crop. If you are not familiar with the label or if you would prefer a CD version of this recording, go to their site and gaze upon the richness. It will be transformative, I promise you.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 6, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R14LEPXQ7N1C7V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004LF8J6C#wasThisHelpful","R14LEPXQ7N1C7V","A1D4PVZ0QWEAW1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1D4PVZ0QWEAW1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It seems that the early part of the 20th century wanted to forget just how much the issue of slavery warped our political life and history from the very moment of this country's birth. This determination to minimize the presence of slavery in the overarching narrative of American history began to break down during the '50s and the '60s with the growth of the civil rights movement.The change (more properly, the remembering of what the 19th century knew)was strengthened by specialized studies like this one by the great Frederick Merk. Slavery and the Annexation of Texas was published when in 1972 when Merk was in his early eighties. It should be read in conjunction with his Fruits of Propaganda in the Tyler Administration as it continues and expands on his discussion of the Texas issue in that book. By the way, the other book is hereafter referred to as FPTA.His basic thesis for both books is fairly simple. The administration of John Tyler was as expansionistic as any this country has had. Tyler and his Junto (Merk's term)focused on solving the Maine boundry issue, the Oregon Territory issue and the question of whether or not to annex Texas. To this end, Tyler's Junto used propaganda to influence public opinion in the direction that they wanted to drive policy. That propaganda was directed to particular sections of the national audience. They would make one sort of argument to the North and another, often contradictory, argument to the Southern audience.For example, Sen. Robert Walker of Mississippi wrote a famous serial letter/pamphlet that argued that the annexation of Texas would lead inevitably to the mass movement of all of the slaves in America to Texas resulting in the inevitable exhausation of the soils of Texas whereupon the slave owners would be face with the choice of bankruptcy or emancipation. They would choose emancipation and the freed slaves would drift south into the tropics of Mexico, Central and South America as if by irresistable magnetic forces. (I kid thee not. One of the great things that Merkdoes is attach about 130 pages of original source material to each book so if you don't believe me go to FPTA and read Walker's Letter.) Anyway, Merk argues that this argument was perfectly suited for the sort of uneasy combination of antislavery/white supremacy that was common in the North at the time. In one fell stroke, America would be rid of both slavery and black Americans. Poof!!One the other hand, different sort of arguments were made in the essays of Southern newspaper or the mouthpiece of the Tyler Administration, The Madisionian. There the argument was that Texas would serve to preserve slavery against the machinations of the British and The International Abolitionist Conspiracy. The argument was also made that the existence of slavery was necessary to the economic health of the North.Of course, these inconsistencies were noted and led to much of the debate in Congress over the issue of annexation.Merk is superb as tracing all the political manuevering that occurred over the issues. He traces the remarkably stumbling path of Duff Green as a sort of envoy/intelligence agent trying to manipulate opinion in Britain and Mexico. Merk closely follows the negotiation of the original treaty to annex Texas, its rejection in Congress, and the impact on the election of 1844. All of this is very well done and backed up by plenty of original documents in the back of the book.Finally, Merk tells the history of how the Tyler administration and its partners in Congress argued for the annexation of Texas as an act of Congress (thus avoiding that whole 2/3 requirement in the Senate) and the constitutional issues that arose as a result (See the lovely spectacle of the High Apostle of Strict Construction and State-Rights, Ladies and Gentlemen, the right Honorable John C. Calhoun arguing from convenience for the broadest possible interpratation of Article IV, Section 3 and for ignoring the treaty requirement designed to protect the rights of states). There is also the nice little spiteful coda of Tyler sending the annexation offer to the authorities of Texas in the last days of his administration. As soon as Polk came in, he cancelled that offer and then resubmitted it in his name. Vanitas, Vanitas.I would like to end on a couple of observations. I have to admit that it is hard for me to like Calhoun. This book does nothing to help that reaction. Calhoun comes across as someone who is willing to ignore inconvenient facts that counter his beliefs. Merk relates how Walker and others like Calhoun completely hashed the already screwed up statistics that were part of the 1840 census to prove that the free blacks of the North suffered very high rates of incidence of insanity, blindness, deafness and criminality. The untrustworthiness of these stats were demonstrated by members of the American Statictical Association. Calhoun ignored this counterevidence and continued to use the stats whenever it was convenient (see pp. 86 and 113 for highlights of this story). Merk also notes that none of Calhoun's biographers up to that point even mentioned this whole sad history. Neither does John Niven in his more recent biography as far as I can find.The second observation I would like to make is on the first review for this book. It is easy to see what he is talking about. Reading this book and FPTA we are exposed to the sight of an administration searching for the right reason to publically justify their policies in order to disguise their true purposes which have appeal to only a section of the public. We are exposed to them illegally funding that effort with money that is earmarked for another purpose (see FPTA for this part of the story). We see one of the first examples of an administration overstepping its powers to declare war when Tyler promises and one of his envoys orders a naval squadron to protect the Texas coast during treaty negotiations without Congressional approval. So file this book under the evidence for, ""The more things change, the more they stay the same"".To sum up, this is a great book and an important one. Not just for the interpretation that it offers up of a great moment in American history but for providing the documents that support that interpretation. If also laid groundwork for many historical works to come such as David Howe's recent addition to the Oxford History of United States.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 6, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/RP6CTV0CBPJTP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0394481046#wasThisHelpful","RP6CTV0CBPJTP","A1D4PVZ0QWEAW1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1D4PVZ0QWEAW1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There are many different types of historical works. There are sweeping synthetic works that attempt to convey an entire era. Some of those are quite good. We have recently been treated to two excellent surveys of the antebellum period by Sean Wilentz and David Howe. I call these works synthetic because the authors rely so much on their own secondary reading.But that is where the fun really begins. Anytime you read a great synthetic work of history, note carefully the work that the author relied on and then go on to your own reading of that. For one thing, it will help you determine just how much you can rely on the original author for accurately presenting the works of others.But the real pleasure is in coming across a book like this one. I have noted before in some of my reviews that the readings of the work of previous generations of historians is full of surprises. There are enormous differences in the foci of research and the way certain aspects of a period are emphasized and interpreted. There are also some historians who are worth reading for more philosophical reasons. Plutarch's Lives may be full of errors but it is still worth several readings over a lifetime.Frederick Merk is a worthy read. He published this little study in his 84th year and credits his wife Lois as a coauthor. It was published a year before Slavery and the Annexation of Texas with which it should be read.Both books talk about the 1840s and specifically, the means used by the Tyler and Polk administrations to sway public opinion on border issues between the U.S. and Canada and the annexation of Texas. The last third of both books are original documents that are hard to find and which the Merks depended on in making their argument.The Merks feel that the Tyler administration employed propaganda in order to convince the people of Maine that they should accept a compromise proposal that was being worked out by Daniel Webster (during his tenure as Secretary of State for Tyler)and Lord Ashburton, the British diplomat.The Merks' research amply proves that the Tyler administration reached into a secret fund (that was earmarked for use in foreign affairs only) in order to pay Francis O.J. Smith (a Maine politician) to conduct a campaign to sway public opinion in advance of the treaty. The people of Maine and their government were veryresistant to any movement away from the way they understood the boundary to have been drawn up during the negotiations that ended the Revolutionary War. Unfortunately, no accurate, annotated and signed maps were appended to that agreement and, naturally, over time both Canadians and Maine men begin to interpret the boundary (especially the valuable forests)to their advantage.Webster and Tyler looked back on forty years or so of Maine intansigence that had gotten nowhere and decided to work out a compromise.Smith prepared the way for that by making the argument for such a compromise in advance in anonymous editorials and essays and by conversation with his fellow Maine politicians. When the compromise treaty was publically announced, some of the Maine papers headlined the event as a day of celebration. It was a good treaty, the people of Maine recognized it as such, accepted it and potential conflict along the border was avoided. There was a brief congressional investigation into the story a year or two later but nothing came out of that.The second seciton of the book deals with the campaign to prepare the American public as a whole for the annexation of Texas. The Merks go into much greater detail about this campaign in the second book, Slavery and the Annexation of Texas (I promise a review when complete) but they do discuss the impact of a letter published both serially in newspapers/periodicals and as a pamphlet by Robert Walker (very much an insider in the Tyler administraton). This extraordinary document is appended to the end of the Merks' book and is worth the price of the book in itself.To sum it up briefly, Walker makes the argument that slave agriculture inevitably wrings the soil useless. The result is that slave based agriculture is always in search of new soil. Texas will drain the slaves out of the slave states and the border states by inexorable economic forces. When the Texan soil is exhausted, the slave owners will then be faced with emancipation or bankruptcy. They will emancipate their slaves who will be drawn to the tropical climes of Mexico, Central and South American. The slave issue, indeed, the race issue, will then disappear from the American republic. And all this would take place with 75 years or so.Walker also makes much of the horrific alternatives that will occur if annexation were not to happen. Race war, mass insanity and public insolvency were inevitable if we listened to those who wanted to not annex Texas.By the by, past experience in Amazon reviews has taught me to declare that the preceeding paragraph does not represent my views nor those of the Merks. It is, however, a fair summation of a pamphlet that was very influential is forming public opinion back in the mid-1840s. Blame the people of that time, not me.This is a superb little book. It cast an intense and focused light on two small moments in the history of American governmental manipulation of public opinion. It also just goes to show that some of older historians really knew what they were doing. And that the Bush administration was following in the footsteps of John Tyler! Sorry, I just had to throw that little provocation into the mix.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 31, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3BG8A3YJ3RHY1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0674326768#wasThisHelpful","R3BG8A3YJ3RHY1","A1D4PVZ0QWEAW1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1D4PVZ0QWEAW1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have just finished this book and am somewhat bewildered by some of the reviews on Amazon. Foolish me. I have read quite a bit about the history of this period; general histories as well as more specialized, histories written in the last ten or twenty years and the works of previous generations.It seems to me that Howe gets many things about the period 1815-1848 just about right. I offer the following quote:""The most bloody conflicts, however, derived from the domination and the exploitation of the North American continent by the white people of the United States and their government. If a primary driving force can be identified in American history for this period, this was it."" (p.852)Please note that ""If""...this quote comes after a careful summing up of other possible causal factors: the growth of the market economy, the ""awakened vigor of the democratically organized Protestant churches"" and the emergence of mass political parties. (849) Howe also spends scores of pages devoted to the transportation and communication revolutions (think canals, trains and telegraphy) that occurred during this period. And he is careful to attribute the impacts on our history of certain transcendent personalities. This period would simply not gone the way it did without the towering figures of Jackson, JQ Adams, Polk, Clay and Calhoun not to mention the lesser lights of Tyler and Wilfred Scott.So anyone who tells you that Howe offers a monocausal account of the period has simply misread the book.But Howe is right to emphasize the issue of race. Since some reviewers have objected to the idea of the 'white supremacy' of the period as being anachronistic, let us just talk about the efforts as being directed toward the creation a white man's republic. As in, '""Ours is the government of the white man,"" protested Calhoun in opposition to taking All Mexico.'(799) There were arguably five or six major and divisive political events of this period: Indian removal, internal improvements, tariffs, national bank, the territorial expansion of slavery and the War with Mexico. Three of those were racial at their core. Now if you want to pretend that the territorial expansion of slavery was largely about states rights, that is up to you. Howe is not the author for you, and to be frank, I am not sure who is. The same with the War with Mexico, the same with Indian removal.Yes, the majority of Americans back then were racist. Yes, all great countries that I know of have had strong racist themes to their history. Yes, those same great countries have become great by simply taking over their neighbors lands. And so why should we concern ourselves about that aspect of our history? Because it is OUR history and we are still playing out some of the consequences of that history.Being a racist, arrogant, intolerant old man doesn't mean that Andrew Jackson didn't have greatness in him. It doesn't mean that he didn't impact our history for the good. He did. But he was also racist, arrogant, intolerant, violent and he didn't really play well with others. Read Remini's great three-volume biography and tell me different.I will say this again and again. American history is a human history. There are angels aplenty to be found in it, heroes by the score and many a devil. Frequently all wrapped up in the same person. All of y'all who think that American history should only emphasize the angels and heroes need to go back and read your Plutarch (beloved by many a Founding Father). There are lessons to be learned from history but only if we look at it honestly and dispassionately and at its full human complexity.Howe is great at that. Throughout his book, Howe returns to the figure of Samuel Morse as an exemplar of the mixed bag that was the antebellum period. The whole book is a testament to the rich, bizarre, exciting, shameful and wonderful history of that period. Howe's volume is a wonderful addition to the Oxford History of the United States.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 25, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1DMXLH6NGEQZF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0195078942#wasThisHelpful","R1DMXLH6NGEQZF","A1D4PVZ0QWEAW1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1D4PVZ0QWEAW1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"From reading Polybius, Livy, Machiavelli and my boy Leo Strauss, the reader learns that the founding of a nation (let alone an empire) is never spotless. In fact, it is frequently the result of one or several criminal acts. For this reason, among others, such beginnings will generate a mythology and a hagiography. You end up with stories about demigods who in epic and heroic action and with the blessings of God (or the gods) founded this or that glorious nation. And so it goes until the next bunch of criminals (or freedom fighters- your choice) come along with better weapons or strategy or a newer and better bunch of gods and they proceed to found their own nation or empire on top of yours.So much for the lessons of Polybius, Livy and Machiavelli. Strauss perceived a necessity to maintain that myth in order for the ruling elites or for the nation to maintain their position. The problem, of course, is the old canard that Truth Will Out.The last twenty years of controversy about how we teach history and what we teach as history to our children in this country are all about the above lessons. The plain fact of the matter is that our country was founded on and our cultural life shaped by a series of invasions, epidemics and the slave trade. Murrin's article sums up the state of the current knowledge (as of 1997) in this area of study and provides an excellent selective bibliography.Before I go over a few of the highlights, I want to address what the history of Murrin's essay. I bought it as a pamphlet of  28 pages published by the American Historical Association as part of this The New American History Series. All of the pamphlets are available in a book edition entitled The New American History. Don't make the same mistake I did and pay the same price for a single pamphlet as I would have paid for the book which Amazon sells quite cheaply.The purpose of the series was to familiarize high school history teachers with summations of the latest research in a variety of subfields of American History. If all the contributions are on the level of Murrin's, the book should be require reading  for all teachers.So what does Murrin provide? The `catastrophe' of his title is actually several-fold. He is pointing out how much the colonists in America benefited from the ""the greatest demographic catastrophe in the history of the world"" (referring to the decimation of the Amerindian nations) and the slave trade. Murrin cites research which estimates that ""the pre-Columbian population of the Americas exceeded 70 million, or about one-seventh of the 500 million then inhabiting the globe"" (both quotes from p.5 of my edition). Disease was the largest contributor to the decimation of the Amerindian nations but the European settlers put in some hard labor on the task as well. Most of us are pretty familiar with this part of the story.What I was not aware of was the sheer size of the slave trade. Murrin cites the fact that before 1820, some 12 million people came to the Americas to settle. Of those, 8 million were slaves. Those figures do not include the millions of Africans who died during the voyage. So the true ratio of slave to free immigrants might be more like 3 to 1.Free settlers would not outnumber imported slaves until sometime between 1820 and 1840. ""For more than three centuries...the slave trade was no unfortunate excess on the periphery of free migration. It was the norm."" (p.3.) I don't seem to recall those facts from when I learned my high school history.Most of the pamphlet deals with the different immigration patterns that developed in different regions of North America and how those differing immigration cultures interacted with the local Amerindians and the slave trade. It is all very well done and introduces the reader to an enormous amount of work and literature to further explore.I hate to do it but I find myself compelled now to buy the book in which this essay was first published. Research of this quality about American History must be absorbed regardless of how we feel about that history. To do otherwise is to knowingly choose to live in a myth. To which all I can say is ""Good luck with that.""","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 30, 2010","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3LWH0NUTE1UG3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0872290867#wasThisHelpful","R3LWH0NUTE1UG3","A1D4PVZ0QWEAW1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1D4PVZ0QWEAW1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Please note- The following is a review that was written for the published edition of this book and should be read along with some of the other reviews on that page,e.g., AntiochAndy's review.As the other reviewer's have noted this is one of the classics of the Western literary and historical tradition. It also should have a special place in the hearts of Americans in that the Founders relied heavily for their historical knowledge of the ancient Roman and Greek republics on Livy, Polybius and Plutarch. Anyone who has read Farrand's The Records of the Federal Convention of 1787 or The Federalist knows how much the debates on the writing and ratification of our constitution were based on a reading of those three authors among others.Furthermore, as Michael Neulander points out, Machiavelli's Discourses is based on his reading of Livy. Leo Strauss' reading of Machiavelli is based on his close reading of both Machiavelli and Livy. My point is simple- Livy speaks to us to this day on issues of moral education, individual striving for excellence and virtue and on ""the war of the orders"" (what we today would call class struggle). Livy is thus one of our oldest resources for political theory.Livy has several purposes. He wants to hold up to the Romans of his own day the glorious virtues of their ancestors. He wants to show how the Romans by sticking to their piety and to their ancestral way of life overcame an unimaginable horde of enemies. When they strayed from their piety and their virtues they met with terrible reverses (see for example, his explanation for the sacking of Rome by the Gauls in The Early History of Rome, the first volume of the Penguin edition of Livy's history). In this volume, read the final section for Book X for Livy's contrast of the bizarre rituals of the Samnites to the auspices of the Romans before the climatic battles of The Third Samnite War (starting around p. 345 of the Penguin, chapter 40 of Book X if you have another edition).So, yes, he writes as a moralist, at times as a hagiographer, at times as a cultural imperialist (or as a patriot, your choice).But one of the really fascinating things about Livy is the way he struggles toward something like a modern historical methodology. The events of this volume go from 389 to 292 B.C. In other words, 250+ years or more seperate Livy from the events of his history. Thus he relied entirely on source material; earlier histories by Fabius Pictor and Polybius, family records, lists of consuls, praetors, the writings of antiquarians, and inscriptions on buildings and monuments. Much of the material was unreliable and Livy knew it as such. Toward the latter books of this volume, it is obvious that he struggled to evaluate different versions of the same events for accuracy. He frequently reports multiple accounts of the same events and states which one he believes.Two final thoughts- one dealing with the differences between Livy and Polybius and one dealing with my reaction to this era in Roman history.Livy had absorbed Polybius. They are telling the same story but with very different purposes. Polybius was a cultured observant Greek looking at the rise of Rome from what he felt was a culturally and, perhaps, morally superior tradition. As a soldier and a politician, he is impressed with what the Romans have done. However Polybius is a little staggered at the human cost.This is not a problem for Livy. He writes as one who is afraid that his contemporary Romans were falling from their place in history. A place that had been purchased in blood. To read both Polybius and Livy is thus to read many of the same events presented with very subtle differences in tone. It is a fascinating education.One of my other main reactions to Livy is a sort of shock. Roman history is bloody; to an extent I had never imagined. To read the first decade of Livy (the first two volumes of the Penguin edition)is to read a story of almost continual warfare. The Greeks might go forty or fifty years inbetween wars. I don't think the Romans (on the basis of Livy and Polybius) went four or five years without being involved in a war. They are presented as continually preparing for war, as defending their territories or marching through and laying waste to their enemies. Their patrician class is also presented as among the first to have mastered the art of distracting the lower classes with foreign wars.Finally, I would be remiss if I did not praise Penguin Classics for this edition. They present the history in full, with maps and annotations and useful introductions. One of the reviewers finds the translation stuffy. He should try the Loeb. He might change his mind. As for me, I find this version a very enjoyable read. I can hardly recommend Livy highly enough whether from a literary or a historical or a political theory point of view. Of how many books, can that be said?","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 19, 2010","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2IV5RAENYIHG9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0049U4LPM#wasThisHelpful","R2IV5RAENYIHG9","A1D4PVZ0QWEAW1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1D4PVZ0QWEAW1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"In my review of the first volume of the Modern Library edition of Plutarch's Lives of the Noble Greeks and Romans, I explained my preference for the Modern Library edition as opposed to the Loeb or the Penguin Travesty Edition. Please refer to that review for some thoughts on which edition to choose to read.What I first want to do in this review is to provide a little background to a reading of Plutarch. Hopefully, this will provide an explanation of why Plutarch remains such a vital author in the Western Canon.Plutarch lived from around 46 to 120 BCE. He therefore lived in the Roman Empire from the reign of Nero to the beginnings of Hadrian's reign. He was contemporaries with Tacitus and Epictetus. He lived for a while in Rome but most of his life was spent in Boetia in Greece. He was a priest of the oracle at Delphi for several decades and a prolific writer on philosophical, scientific and ethical themes.In addition the the Lives, Plutarch wrote many essays and dialogues that have been collected together under the general title of the Moralia. The Loeb Classical Library provides a complete English rendering and there are several good one volume selections. I mention the Moralia because I believe that a reading of some of the essays are essential to understanding the ethical explorations of the Lives.Consider the opening to his essay, ""On Moral Virtue"". Plutarch starts off by distinguishing ""moral"" virtue from ""contemplative"" virtue. The differences lies ""chiefly in that it has as its material the emotions of the soul and as its form reason"" (p.19 of the Loeb Moralia, Vol.6).This gives us a picture of Plutarch as Middle Platonist with an Aristotlean idea of virtue as a mean. The picture we get is of a human world where evil and vice are as real as virtue and reason, where the emotions can work as the energizing element of both virtue and vice and where the achievement of virtue is always the result of education and discipline and is never complete.It is this picture of the world that is then explored so magnificently in the Lives. The Lives focus of the political and military realm of the statesmen and uses the various people discussed as the raw material for the exploration of all the ways that excellent men (and a few excellent women)can succeed or fail at virtuous leadership.One of the themes that I feel Plutarch explores is whether Roman hegemony can be defended on any grounds other than their success at arms. In this, he is writing as a cultured Greek testing the Roman leadership by the standards of a conquered people.He looks at the ways that various personal failings (lack of prudence in a general, an excessive love of drink, uncontrollable lust whether for boys or women or greed or any pretty much any excess) can waylay and overturn a lifetime of achievement.Another favorite theme of Plutarch's is the turning of Fortuna's (or Tyche's)wheel. Plutarch exemplifies the belief that we are laid low or allowed success almost whimsically by this goddess who will surely turn our lives upside down again soon. Just because She can (At least, as far as we know).Against these backgrounds of Roman hegemony, personal failings and the twists and turns of Fate, Plutarch tries to show us the struggle of the individual to serve his city, his Empire or his own petty whims. It is a great theme, one that he writes about with insight and with sympathy for those whose stories he is telling.This gets to my annoyance with the Penguin volumes of the Lives. By separating the paired Greek and Roman lives and by presenting them out of sequence, Penguin is trying to present Plutarch as an historian, a role he explicitly denies for himself. While I think he is a very good historian, he is even more a uniquely great essayist in practical political and personal ethics. This is, I believe, how Montaigne read Plutarch and I think both Jefferson and Madison as well. This is how Plutarch has helped to shape our cultural history. In fact, I am going to make the claim that it is impossible to fully understand the debate around the adoption of the U.S. Constitution unless you have read the whole of both Plutarch and Livy. Anyone who wants to persue that thesis with me, please write a comment.My recommendation is that you get the Modern Library edition and dig in. If you don't like it, wait a year or two and try it again. For Plutarch presents us with the broadest possible experience of the world. You may find, like me, that you have to wait a while for your own experience to grow broad enough in order to really see just what an amazing book this ancient neighbor of ours has given us.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 15, 2010","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3IEH8FW5HOGL2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0375756779#wasThisHelpful","R3IEH8FW5HOGL2","A1D4PVZ0QWEAW1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1D4PVZ0QWEAW1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The hand painted details and articulated jaw are great, right down to the touches of light grey paint on the spines along the back.

When you unzip the volcano, it turns into a fanciful playmat upon which the dinosaurs can act out various scenes from ye olde dino life.  And there's even more room in the volcano hideout once the cardboard interior has been removed. So you can store more dinosaurs from your collection. You and your kids can play Jurassic James Bond vs. Blofeld.

"This Lonely Planet guide to Canada is sort of like the travel book equivalent of Canada's greatest hits.  It contains descriptions and info on those places most likely to be visited by a tourist taking a quick trip to Canada who just wants to see the highlights: Toronto, Nova Scotia, Banff, etc.  If you are looking for information on Baffin Island, in other words, this is not the book for you.

"Herman Koch's Breakout novel was ""The Dinner"", a chilling little novel that relied on an unreliable narrator for its effect.  In ""Summer House With Swimming Pool"", Koch's narrator, Dr. Marc Schlosser, is anything but unreliable.  The not-so-good doctor is completely honest with his readers; in fact, his honesty carries with it a brutality that some readers will find unnerving and repellent. His descriptions of his patients, his opinions of them and what they are doing to themselves, may move some to put this book down and walk away, because at first, spending time in the company of this jaded and cynical man is abhorrent.  He's no Marcus Welby, M.D. and he's not a friendly family doctor, despite the facade he presents.  No, this is a man steeped in an intense contempt for his fellow human beings, and that is a characteristic most of us would rather a doctor didn't have.But to walk away from his novel would be a mistake (though there are some parts I skipped over due to intense squeamishness).  In creating Dr. Schlosser, Herman Koch is giving his readers a magnificent display of the first responsibility of any writer: honesty.  As awful as he is, Marc Schlosser is completely honest with the reader about what he has done (some awful, awful things) and the reasons he has done them.  The psychological insights Herman Koch lays bare for his readers are exceeded only by the excellence of his writing.As brutal as it is, this novel was just fascinating.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2TB9ZHEHEB6II/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0804138818#wasThisHelpful","R2TB9ZHEHEB6II","A18S2A07LBNVNF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A18S2A07LBNVNF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I think I may have noted this before in another review, but someone once said that the essence of a good thriller was to get your protagonist(s) up a tree and then start throwing rocks at them.  Well, The Darkest Hour puts its protagonist, John Rossett, up a tree, and then unleashes a landslide of rocks, Nazis, untrustworthy resistance fighters, and possible collaborators on his head.  But don't feel too much sympathy for him, because Rossett is also a collaborator:  he works for the Nazis in occupied Britain (this is an alternate history novel, ala  Fatherland) rounding up and deporting Jews to death camps.  He's a numbed out guy whose wife and son were killed in a resistance bombing.  He knows what he's doing, but he tells himself he's just doing a job.  He himself is the worst sort of collaborator.  He is the good man who assists evil men in doing their filthy work and he grows ever more sullied and further from redemption with each passing minute.Then, the owner of his childhood candy store places his greatest treasure, his grandson Jacob, in Rossett's hands and begs Rossett to save the boy.  Jacob, as it turns out, is also the key to a fortune in diamonds.  Soon enough, the game is afoot, the hunt is on.  Everybody wants the diamonds, but does anybody also want to save the boy?This is the kind of book that beneath its surface raises important questions, not the least of which is: Will Rossett redeem himself?  Is it even possible for him to redeem himself? You'll have to read it for yourself to find out.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1P613JN18F04Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062339362#wasThisHelpful","R1P613JN18F04Q","A18S2A07LBNVNF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A18S2A07LBNVNF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

They are very well constructed; I have washed them several times and they have stood up well so far.

"Like many people, I hate buying toilet paper, because, well, although it is completely necessary, it represents the flushing of money down the toilet.  So I look for the best bargain I can get, because  the less money I flush, the happier I am.For some folks, single-ply, harsh as sandpaper, 1000 sheet per roll toilet paper seems like the best bargain out there, and that's okay, if you have a hide like a rhinoceros.  But, if like me, you are girl with a more delicate heinie, those bargain brands are not really what they seem to be.  First, because they are abrasive and don't feel good at all, but also because they're thin single-ply, and you end up using great big wads in order to achieve proper levels of absorbency and what I think of as ""hand coverage.""

It's angel wings soft, doesn't abrade the bottom or other bits at all.  Feels downright nice in fact.  Also, it's two-ply, embossed, and holds up well, meaning it doesn't separate in your hands.  It's very absorbent and provides excellent hand coverage.  What does this add up to?You can use less of this toilet paper to get the same job done.  With the same level of cleanliness, but much better softness.

"First thing you should know is that this is a very expensive way to keep your floors clean.  The little bottle of floor cleaner and the pads are quite costly and short of refilling the bottle yourself and making your own pads, there are no cheaper alternatives to the Swiffer brand products.  So although the initial cost of buying the kit seems reasonable, over the long run, it gets quite pricey.That said, if you have many pets and want a simple way to clean up without having to constantly resort to the full on mop and bucket routine, this is a very convenient product.  I found it quite easy to put the mop together and put the solution in the little slot.  I made a rookie mistake, however, in taking the purple printed strips off the pad.  Don't remove those strips, you need them, or the pad won't stick to the mop.  You only get two pads in this starter kit.  Also, you will need 4 double A batteries, which are NOT provided (tsk, tsk).Their customer support is OUTSTANDING.  I had a problem getting the Wetjet to spritz, so I called them up and a very pleasant young lady walked me through a few steps.  Within about two minutes, she had helped me figure out the problem and correct it.  Once it was fixed, the spritzer worked like a champ.  I was spritzing like a maniac and dirt was getting mopped up left, right, and center.  This mop does its job well.  Our wood floors now look much nicer.Thank you, Swiffer people","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1C8ZGGA8MPWIS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004W36BAE#wasThisHelpful","R1C8ZGGA8MPWIS","A18S2A07LBNVNF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A18S2A07LBNVNF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We've  been using Moen products in our home for many years. They've almost always been trouble free and ""just worked"" and their warranty service  for the odd issue has always been very good.We're upgrading our kitchen and this is the perfect faucet for us. It's extremely attractive, easy to use and is a huge improvement from our previous faucet. Installation is very straightforward and something that most homeowners who are moderately handy should be able to do on their own in less than an hour. For me, the hardest part was removing the old faucet since it had welded itself together.Before beginning installation, unpack the box and review the instructions and where you put each piece. Most important is the location of the control box. Moen recommends mounting the box near the base of the faucet, but there's an alternate method that requires an extension kit if you can't use the recommended method. I recommend putting the battery box off to the side and ensure easy access for changing batteries. For those who don't want to mess with changing batteries, an AC adapter is available.Using the faucet is amazing. My wife wasn't expecting the Motionsense feature, but instantly fell in love with it. If you need to fill a large pot, you can use the lever to let the water run for as long as you need. Most of the time, we use Motionsense which greatly reduces splashed water under the faucet handle.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R12M4H9VWY4ENE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VT2S8PW#wasThisHelpful","R12M4H9VWY4ENE","AV8MDYLHHTUOY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AV8MDYLHHTUOY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There are times when I need to lever something into position and my go-to solutions have been a long handled flat-blade screwdriver, crow-bar, or whatever I could find to fit a particular angle. The problem with all of those tools is that they're not made for that particular job and don't provide a good fulcrum and don't always have the correct angle. More often than not, the tool will slip, I'll bust my knuckles  and I've got to start all over againThe GearWrench Indexable Pry Bar is exactly the right tool to use in most of those situations. The shape of the foot is rounded for exerting the most force and the angle can be set for a wide variety of angles.  When you roll the foot back as far as it will go, it's the perfect angle to lift a motor from underneath.Changing angles is pretty simple, you press the index button, select the angle you want and click it into place. The 16-inch model is a good length for almost any job. They do warn you not to use a cheater bar since that will overstress the bar.

"My family has been using OtterBox cases on our phones and tablets for a while now and we've never been let down. My company issued us all iPhone 6 Plus phones and a whimpy little case to keep it 'safe'. Since we're on the hook to keep them healthy and happy, I wanted to add as much protection as possible and chose the OtterBox Defender to do the job.For those that aren't familiar with the OtterBox Defender, it's a large sturdy case with a rubberized bumper surrounding a hard plastic shell with a built-in screen protector and small covers over the ports.Installing my phone was very easy once I managed to peel the rubber bumper from the edge of the case. It latches into the inner shell and can be a bit challenging the first time, but once it's removed things go very smoothly from there. After removing the bumper, you unlatch the clips on either side of the shell and open it up. Once the case is open, double check the phone's screen to ensure it doesn't have any smudges or fingerprints, because once the case is back on, it'll make you nuts until you open it up to clean the screen.Once the phone is safely ensconced inside the case, eassembly is very easy. You press the two halves of the shell together, ensuring that the clips are aligned properly, then work the rubber bumper around the edges until they slide into position. Overall, it's a fairly fast process.The OtterBox isn't a tiny little case and it will add significant bulk to your phone. There's an included clip for attaching the case to your belt, but it doesn't rotate. I prefer to keep the phone in a jacket pocket whenever possible.Bottom line: The OtterBox Defender is probably the ultimate case for those who need to keep their phone safe. Since my family's been using OtterBoxes, no one has damaged any of their devices.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1X0R93X5KUT6M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Z7SX51Q#wasThisHelpful","R1X0R93X5KUT6M","AV8MDYLHHTUOY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AV8MDYLHHTUOY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Corel Painter 2016 is the latest in a series of art-oriented tools for the Mac and PC. My last exposure to Painter was with the X3 version and the newest version has many new features that make Painter even more useful than before.The user interface resembles Adobe Photoshop and is fairly intuitive for those that have used similar products in the past. The default set of tools lets you get to work right away. While Adobe Photoshop is great for modifying photos, it's rather limited for creating art by itself. Painter gives you access to a wide variety of paints, pens, pencils, brushes and media textures with a workflow that allows you to work more or less naturally. I highly recommend using a tablet instead of a mouse, but either will work.For those who aren't familiar with similar programs or need some extra help, there are a large number of tutorials available to help you with almost every aspect of the program.One of my favorite features is the watercolor brushes and paper. Although it's not quite the same as using watercolors, it allows the artist to create art that looks very similar to the real thing. I find it most useful for quick and dirty watercolor renderings of photographs by keeping the original photo down at one layer and ""painting"" over it on another layer. Yes, it's cheating. But it gives a nice result without spending hours of work with physical media. Layers and paths work much as you'd expect.My only issue with the program is the 'lag' I sometimes get when using broad watercolor brushes and move my 'brush' too quickly. Thank goodness for undo.Overall, I think that Painter 2016 is a fine program who want to try their hand at more involved digital art, but the sales price when this review was written is rather steep for a casual investment.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1SGJ22IU8N3QP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0123C648Y#wasThisHelpful","R1SGJ22IU8N3QP","AV8MDYLHHTUOY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AV8MDYLHHTUOY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've been using iHome products for quite some time and have always had good luck. I was happy to find the iHome IX360BC Bluetooth speaker on Amazon and have been having a lot of fun carrying it around with me while doing chores at home.The speaker is slim and very solid feeling. It can be paired using NFC or using the normal bluetooth pairing method on your device. Bluetooth range is good and for those times where bluetooth isn't an option, there's an auxiliary stereo input jack. The speaker comes with a wall-wart type charger which seems to bring it up to a full charge pretty quickly.There are a set of controls that are molded into the top of the speaker and can be used to change volume, turn the unit on and off and  initiate bluetooth pairing. They're a little hard to see, but work as expected. If the unit sits idle for too long, it powers itself down to save the batteries. That's helped a few times when my daughter was using the speaker while washing dishes, and walked off without turning the speaker off.Bottom line: I'm very happy with the iHome IX360BC Rechargable speaker. It's a great way to play and share your music when you're away from home or while doing chores.There's also an iOS application that can make the large ""X"" on the speaker flash a certain color for things like new emails, messages or what have you. It's very configurable and works pretty well.Sound quality is very good, but as expected, doesn't have much in the way of stereo separation.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2M5Y0PK02856D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00X3FOTPG#wasThisHelpful","R2M5Y0PK02856D","AV8MDYLHHTUOY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AV8MDYLHHTUOY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is the fourth Novation keyboard I've owned. No, none of the previous ones have died or had issues. Instead, I find that they're very high-quality, flexible controllers that don't cost a fortune. I have and regularly use the 25 key and 61 key versions of the SL Mk II as well as the 25 key version of the original LaunchKey.I find that the LaunchKey Mk2 controller has the same good build quality as the other keyboards and it integrates very well with my copy of Ableton Live Suite. The lite version this keyboard comes with offers many good features and is a great way to start out with Ableton Live 9.One of the other big improvements is the use of RGB for the pads. My original LaunchKey only had a few colors and was helpful, but the wide variety of colors allow you to quickly switch between tracks which makes workflow much more seamless. I wish that my LaunchPad had the same capability as the Launchkey Mk2 since I find it so useful.Another notable difference between the SL series and the LaunchKey controllers is the keyboard weighting and encoder types. The SL series have full rotary encoders, AutoMap and a Fatar semi-weighted keyboard, while the LaunchKey uses traditional pots, InControl and a synth-weighted keyboard. Doing glisses on the SL is markedly better, but at the price point of the LaunchKey it's still quite acceptable and vastly superior to many other brands of keyboards I've owned in the past. The addition of multiple velocity curves was also very welcome since I hate having to beat on a keyboard to get the attack I want.I was gratified how simple it was to get to work with the LaunchKey MkII. After I updated my copy of Ableton Live, I plugged in the keyboard, launched Ableton and was able to get to work quickly.For the musician on a budget, it's hard to go wrong with the LaunchKey series and it makes a great springboard to their other products later.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3JCYK8W7EU7N3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VVK2A3I#wasThisHelpful","R3JCYK8W7EU7N3","AV8MDYLHHTUOY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AV8MDYLHHTUOY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Magpul MOE handguard for the AK-47 is typical Magpul quality. It comes with a good set of instructions as well as a built-in heat shield.Installation was fairly easy, but I needed to do a bit of filing in order to get the upper portion fully installed. This isn't a fault of Magpul at all. They include a bit of extra material so it will fit better to the sometimes inconsistent dimensions between the endless variants in the AK family.Once installed, the foregrip does a great job.

"The Invicta 21484 watch is a solid, attractive timepiece that comes in a two-tone finish. In addition to the main dial, there are three smaller dials that indicate the day, the date and a second time zone. The watch is quite hefty and comes with an strap with a locking clasp. The locking clasp is an improvement on watches I've owned in the past and would pop open if you looked at them wrong, while the clasp on the Invicta latches firmly into place and feels quite secure.One thing that impressed me is the substantial case that held the watch. It's huge and fairly attractive. I don't know if it's real leather or not, but it smells like it is.  The instructions are fairly basic. They show you how to set the watch and what the various dials and buttons are used for. The rest of the literature covers warranty, the various models and whatnot.Even though I don't have thin wrists, I found that there were quite a few extra links on the band. The extras are for those guys with Popeye arms who shouldn't have any trouble wearing this watch. The extra links the old-fashioned way by using a toothpick or paperclip. Make sure you don't launch a spring-loaded pin across the room. It's easy to do if you're not careful. Getting the band reassembled is fairly easy and it took only a few minutes before I was done.Setting the watch follows the traditional model, you pull out the stem and rotate one way to set the hour and minute and the other direction to set the day. The buttons on either side of the stem are used to advance the date and second time zone (N.B. The second time zone dial is rather small and indicates 24 hours rather than 12. This is because time zones that are distant from your own can be many hours off and you'll need 24 hours to show the difference. One can also use the second time zone dial as a way to show a 24 hour clock in your own time zone.Although I like the Invicta very much, there are a few nits that I find bothersome. The first is the bezel. Since they show the watch as being water resistant to 330 feet and has a bezel that looks like one would use for scuba diving, one would think that the bezel would rotate. It does not.  Related to that is the stem. My Seiko Divers watch has both a rotating bezel and a stem that locks by screwing it down.  It is also limited to 330 feet, but I trust it more to live up to that claim than a watch without a lock-down bezel.Since most of the people who are likely to buy this watch aren't divers, those nits probably don't matter.It has a bezel that appears to be usable for scuba diving,","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R36KSRRWMCB1DH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0146HVM90#wasThisHelpful","R36KSRRWMCB1DH","AV8MDYLHHTUOY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AV8MDYLHHTUOY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have a pretty good collection of SOG knives and tools now and their quality construction never fails to impress me.The PowerLock Traveler Multi-Tool is no exception. It's well made, easy to use and has nearly tool I need for most tasks,  but a knife. Since this is a TSA-approved design (for now, there are no promises when dealing with the TSA), it's likely to stay in my possession if I forget to move my tools to my checked bags.Some people (like those that chew their nails) may have an issue deploying some of the tools hidden in the handle, but it helps if you press the locking button for that side to make the desired tool easier to extract. In a pinch, the flip-up handle covers can be removed and used to lift the tool from inside the handle, but you run a good chance of bending the cover and you should avoid doing so if possible.This tool has a stainless steel finish, but there's an oxide coated finished model available. I usually prefer the oxide coated models since they're a bit less slippery, but the stainless steel model looks very nice.The carrying case clips neatly on your belt. I've tried carrying the Multi-Tool in my pocket without the case, but it's fairly heavy and feels bulky, even in a jeans pocket.Grip strength with the pliers is above average and I've used the wire cutter and crimper on many occasions without issue.Overall, this is a great tool. If you want a version with a blade, check out their other models, but if you travel very often, it's nice to have a tool that won't end up in the pocket of a TSA agent.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2KHAVTJMIBKNT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00T0UR5SG#wasThisHelpful","R2KHAVTJMIBKNT","AV8MDYLHHTUOY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AV8MDYLHHTUOY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The TP-Link AV500 is a set of devices that allow you to use a segment of an in-home electrical circuit to extend an ethernet network using ordinary house wiring. I'm a bit curious how they can advertise a potential maximum speed of 500 Mbps when the device only has 10/100 Mbps network ports (specs taken directly from their web site). Sometimes, marketing people like to impart magical abilities to devices that have specific physical limitations, so I'd take their claim with a very large grain of salt. To me, it borders on dishonesty.I'm using the set to create a wired network between the home office and one of the guest rooms upstairs. Since they're both on the same breaker and has little electrical noise, I'm getting decent overall bandwidth between the two devices. It's not nearly as good as a direct connection to the gigabit network or even my existing Wifi network. The maximum speed I've seen is around 14 mbps when using the two devices on the same circuit and directly connected to the wall. I've also noticed significant and wildly varying when running a ping between two systems on my home network.I've used a similar set of 10 megabit devices in the past and had terrible luck with those, but my experiences with AV500 have been an improvement.The biggest limitation to devices that use in-home wiring to extend networks is electrical noise and power conditioning equipment such as uninterruptible power supplies and power strips with built-in RF filters.As noted above, I got the best speed when I used the devices with receptacles on the same circuit (both on the same circuit breaker). I did some experimenting and tried a variety of configurations throughout the house. I found that using receptacles on two separate circuits (on two different breakers), resulted in lower overall speeds.  I also found that things like dimmer switches and things like fluorescent lights, fans and motors also caused enough noise on the circuit to slow speeds even further. Since all homes and circumstances vary your experience with the AV500 may be different.At no point during my testing did I ever see speeds approaching the maximum rate implied by TP-Link, but I was able to establish a usable connection with nearly every configuration I tried. Electrical noise seems to be the biggest enemy of bandwidth and as long as you set your expectations accordingly, it's a usable way to extend a network to another room when WiFi or a regular ethernet connection isn't an option.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3PKACRBQF4DO9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010Q29KRK#wasThisHelpful","R3PKACRBQF4DO9","AV8MDYLHHTUOY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AV8MDYLHHTUOY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've used quite a few different FRS/GMRS walking talkies over the years and I've always had very good luck with Motorola-branded models.The Talkabout T465 has a lot of improvements over earlier models, especially with the batteries. A feature I especially like is the instant access to weather information. That's been very helpful when we're out on a hike and the weather starts looking iffy.The carrying case does a great job keeping all of the parts together and adequately protected.I've had good luck communicating over moderate distances, but one must keep in mind that the maximum distances listed are in ideal conditions with no obstructions between. We've used GMRS modes at Disney a World in the past and a couple of miles was the max. Using the ""privacy"" modes don't encrypt the data and only work as a way to reduce clutter on the band. Anyone who chooses the same frequency and mode can hear what's being transmitted.Overall, I find this to be a great little set of radios. I'll buy a better set of headphones later since the ones included in the set don't work well in high noise environments.

"I use this with an older non-railed P229 which has a slightly different shaped trigger guard than the P229R and initially noticed that the retention mechanism was a bit difficult to engage. Disengaging was much easier and drawing is no problem whatsoever.The main reason I purchased this particular holster is that it's nearly identical to the IWI-made roto retention holster for my CZ SP-01 Tactical and I prefer that all of my retention holsters operate in the same manner.As with the IWI holster, the cant angle can be adjusted by removing the firearm from the holster and inserting the supplied wrench through hole in the release button, loosening the screw and setting the desired angle.Since this holster is similar in function to the Blackhawk SERPA type holsters, you need to ensure that you keep your finger absolutely straight when pressing the release button and drawing the firearm. If you push the release button with the tip of your finger, your finger may find its way inside the trigger guard before you're ready to shoot.Although it's harder to negligently discharging a double-action pistol than it is with something like a Glock, it's still a very good habit to build since muscle memory is what we fall back on when we're stressed. I typically leave my finger along the frame until the firearm is level and pointed downrange and I'm ready to shoot. If I don't intend to shoot immediately, it stays against the frame. Canting the holster forward a bit can help keep your trigger finger up on the frame when you draw, while canting it back too far can result in your finger ending up too close to the trigger and potentially causing issues.Bottom line: It's a great holster, but requires some adjustment and training to be used properly.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2OUCT8C6V6SSF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00162PR7C#wasThisHelpful","R2OUCT8C6V6SSF","AV8MDYLHHTUOY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AV8MDYLHHTUOY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I frequently find myself needing a light nailer to assemble picture frames and whatnot. I've struggled with brad hammers for years and there are times that you need three hands to accomplish the job.The Arrow PT18G is a great solution for those who need a well-made brad nailer and have an air compressor with decent air flow. (I use a Makita MAC5200 which keeps up nicely with the demands of the nailer).  I normally run the unit at 90psi, but it runs works at 80psi using 1"" brads. The rated maximum pressure is 120psi.The nailer's simple to operate and does a fine job with all of the brad sizes I'm likely to need. It's a very good thing that it's fairly intuitive since I received absolutely no instructions and can find nothing on their web site either. If it's there, it's very well hidden.I put the nailer through its paces and found it easy to load and unload. The nose piece is bare metal which means that you'll need to be careful not to mar the finish of your work. I've not noticed any issues with oil spray on my work, but it's certainly something to keep an eye on as time progresses. One nice touch is the ease of clearing misfeeds using the latch at the working end of the nailer. I've not had any misfeeds yet, but it's always a possibility.Overall, I think it's a great product, but I took away one star for the complete lack of documentation.Update:I contacted Arrow Customer Support and to their credit, they sent me a PDF copy of the PT18G manual.

"While scissors aren't the most exciting things in the world, having a set that doesn't work properly is a pain.The Westcott Recycled 8-inch Straight Scissors do what they're designed to.

Although I'm right-handed, they work well with my left hand (discounting any uncoordination on my part) and were easy to control.Engagement between the scissor halves is good and I was able to make full, clean cuts along the entire length of the blade without any problems. Since these are lightweight scissors, I'd avoid cutting heavy cardboard or fabrics since it puts a great deal of stress on the pivot pin which appears to be plastic on this set.Given the very low cost, one can place a set of these anywhere one might need scissors so a set will always be close at hand.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RNQOL7QY6D8VX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VJ3MXCU#wasThisHelpful","RNQOL7QY6D8VX","AV8MDYLHHTUOY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AV8MDYLHHTUOY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Smartphones and Bluetooth have revolutionized sports-related electronics. However, one of the biggest issues with them is being able to see their displays easily or to interact safely with them when you're in motion. I've come close to disaster a few times when trying to fiddle with my stem-mounted iPhone and once I saw the glasses offered by the ""G"" company, I knew it was only a matter of time before we'd begin seeing similar devices for sports use.The Recon Jet Smart Eyewear are one of the first sports-related devices I've seen on the market and I was anxious to see how they'd improve my cycling experience. Since they pair with my ANT+ sensors and can upload activity data into various fitness apps for tracking, they'll be a good addition to my fitness plan. Since they're very ""high-tech"" looking, you might get funny looks from some people, so I don't see wearing them unless I'm cycling or something.Getting them set up is fairly simple. You're first directed to their website where you create an account, then register the device. When you first attach your glasses to your computer (I used a Mac), the firmware is updated and the device is unlocked. Using their software, you can load maps into the glasses for use on the road as well as other apps.The Recon Jet Smart Eyewear build quality seems to be very good. The glasses are fairly comfortable, but required a lot of fiddling around to place the screen where I could see it clearly. The best position for me is to mount the glasses high on my nose and as close to my face as possible. Perhaps it's the shape of my nose, but the only way the glasses fit is where the bottoms of the nose piece are resting against the bridge of my nose which gets uncomfortable after a while.Image quality is good. In spite of it being so close to my eye and my needing reading glasses, the display is perfectly readable when the glasses are in the correct position. One issue I have is that my right eye has an astigmatism which causes some vertical blurring on the display, but that's not the glasses fault. It would be nice to have a stick-on corrective lense to take care of that issue for people (hint, hint).The controls are minimal. There's a forward and back rocker on the bottom of the right side and a touch sensitive pad for scrolling through options. There's also a small 'joystick' for adjusting display position. As others have mentioned, voice control would be nice as would an earbud jack or built-in earbuds.  It's a bit funny that you can control music with the glasses, but not use them to play it back through the glasses.The user interface takes a bit of getting used to, but the quick access mode helps you get to the most-used options fairly quickly. Since I only plan to use the glasses for cycling, controlling music playback and video capture, the UI is fine. Anything more complex would be dangerous to use while you're in motion.The main problem I've had is with the fit of the glasses and keeping them from moving around. The placement of the device is extremely critical and if the glasses slip, you can no longer see the display clearly. This is a big issue when moving my head around while mounted. I ride both a road and mountain bike and I constantly move my head in a variety of positions. I'd love to see different nose pieces available, perhaps even a do-it-yourself kit that lets you make an nosepiece that conforms perfectly to your nose. As an experiment, I took a new set of orange foam earplugs and created cushions that let the glasses fit more comfortably and when used with a retaining strap, stayed in position perfectly. Since they kind of ruin the whole ""high-tech Robo-Cop"" vibe, I'll replace the orange plugs with something that's not so glaringly different than the glasses. :)A device as complex as this can't be fairly judged within a few days or even a couple of weeks. I plan on updating my review on a regular basis to record the full user experience. Although Recon makes a set of Smart Ski Goggles, I'll take these to the slope when ski season hits and see how they work there.Bottom line: They're very useful for monitoring activity-related stats, but placement and stability on your face is critical. Battery life is good for a couple of hours (it may be possible to keep the unit charged while in use with a microUSB cable and a larger battery pack, I'll test that and report back). The number of third-party apps in encouraging, but I'd like to see integration with a larger number iPhone activity apps.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RV9X2KVVE9NMP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MCJ4CKG#wasThisHelpful","RV9X2KVVE9NMP","AV8MDYLHHTUOY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AV8MDYLHHTUOY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When I'm out on travel or out of touch with civilization, it's hard to keep your devices like GPSs, E-Book readers, phones and tablets charged. I used to take along a ton of batteries that I could charge from, but those are too fussy and a pain to insert and remove. I also find them useful for running a set of LED lights reading lights and a small USB fan. Before heading out, I charge the device fully and if I'm at a campsite, keep the charger topped off with a small solar charger.A few years back, I began purchasing power bricks while they were a big improvement, the early ones cost a lot and didn't hold that much of a charge.The Monoprice 16,000 mAh Portable Charger is one of the newer generation of power bricks that delivers a substantial amount of power for things like topping off tablets, phones. I received the non-retail packaging version which came packed in a recyclable cardboard box that gave it plenty of protection. The Portable Charger has ports for charging two devices concurrently (one 1 A and one 2 A port) and a microUSB port for charging the brick. There's a charging indicator that also shows the amount of charge remaining by pressing a button and a built-in LED flashlight that's activated by pushing the button twice.The device came fully charged, so I drained it by having it charge multiple devices. There was more than enough power to top off my iPhone 6, my daughters phones and my old iPad 3. I let the Monoprice Portable Charger charge overnight and after 9 hours, it was at 100 percent again.The device is very slim and solid feeling. Although it doesn't have all of the bells and whistles you find on other bricks, it's a lot of power for not a whole lot of money. Given how many people there are in our family, it's nice to be able to give everyone their own brick instead of having to share one or two much more expensive ones. I've been aware of Monoprice for a while now and they always seem to deliver good quality for a reasonable price.Overall, I'm very impressed with the unit and I'll update this review as I put it through its paces.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R134BCL1CXDONV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YQM80C8#wasThisHelpful","R134BCL1CXDONV","AV8MDYLHHTUOY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AV8MDYLHHTUOY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I decided to try using a tab after using a glove for years. I'd hoped that it would give a cleaner release, and be easier to use overall. While I did notice an improvement in the feel of the string, the upper portion of the lower tab began falling apart after I'd shot a dozen arrows with my 31# Golden Eagle and the bottom portion of the upper tab began tearing after another dozen arrows.I love the fit and feel of the tab, but I had serious issues with the thin leather portion of both tabs that contact the string. The backing part of the tab was still intact, but that's not what I wanted to use. If I do end going back to a tab, I'll choose a one-layer tab and forego the two layer design.On the positive side, the finger separator seemed to do a good job keeping fingers apart.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RWVRJ6AJTKFN1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0009TNS24#wasThisHelpful","RWVRJ6AJTKFN1","AV8MDYLHHTUOY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AV8MDYLHHTUOY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"RIngs are one of those things you need in order to achieve good accuracy.You can spend thousands on your rifle and scope and if you get cheapie rings, all bets are off, especially if they're of the quick disconnect variety.The Warne Scope Mounts QD rings are  awesome. They're solidly built, easy to install and return within a 1/4 MOA for my Ruger GSR. I'd originally used their low QD rings but the Nikon scope I'd paired it with had an eyepiece that was a bit too large and didn't give enough clearance for the eyepiece cover.  The medium rings are perfect.Besides easy installation, the QD levers are very well thought out. The levers can be tightened and then repositioned to keep them out of the way with a spring loaded mechanism inside each lever handle. Overall, it's a very well thought out design and a very solid set of mounts.I've fired hundreds of rounds of M80 ball through the GSR and the scope stays locked into place with no drift at all.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1YCL07J0RC7OI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0002IOFJ2#wasThisHelpful","R1YCL07J0RC7OI","AV8MDYLHHTUOY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AV8MDYLHHTUOY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I'm an amateur radio operator and love fiddling with Software Defined Radios, especially when it helps me in my hobby. I've had cheaper versions of the RTL-SDR dongles and they tend to be hit or miss when it comes to oscillator stability. That means that a stable narrowband signal will seem to drift when you're viewing it on the waterfall display and when you're trying to catch a satellite pass, that's an unforgivable flaw. One of the first cheapie dongles I purchased would be all over the place, so much so that it was useless for anything but casual poking around the spectrum.The NooElec NESDR Mini+ is significantly more stable. I use it paired with their upconverter (also housed in a zesty, blue aluminum enclosure). To keep them from banging around, I use adhesive-backed Velcro tape to keep them attached which makes cabling much easier.

"From time to time, I need a small vise to hold art projects steady when I'm bending wire or soldering and the Yost COV-3  works very well.It's made of strong cast iron and has two guide rods on either side of the main screw. There's also a bottom clamp that let you easily attach it to a table for temporary use and mounting holes for more permanent installation.Since I use this with a regular table, I added a bit of adhesive moleskin on the part that touches the table so it doesn't mar the table. Felt might also work well, but might slip if you needed to apply much force to the piece you're working on.The vise jaws are textured to keep parts from slipping, but can mar the surface of some items. I use Delrin jaw protectors with mine to keep that from happening.The bottom clamp and vise handle work smoothly and stay in position during use. Another advantage of this model is that it's light enough for my daughters to use for their projects without needing any help. All in all, it's a nice little vise for the money.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1DNI1PW3TBV66/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XWCEI8S#wasThisHelpful","R1DNI1PW3TBV66","AV8MDYLHHTUOY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AV8MDYLHHTUOY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've been using blades and shaving gel for ages and it always seems like you get nicked at the least convenient moment. I used to have some older electric razors, but they only seemed to work on the flat areas and didn't do well at all with knees or ankles. More often than not, I'd end up with razor burn and I finally gave up using them.The Remington WR5100 Women's Rotary Shaver is a big improvement over the old style razors and the flexible shaving head does a fine job following the curves and angles that were always a problem before. While you could use it with just wetted skin, it seems to do best with a bit of gel for lubrication and it leaves everything smooth and clean. Just be sure to hold the razor under some running water to clean out any gel that may be trapped inside.So far, I've not had any problems with irritation and I'm impressed with how long it runs on a single charge. My old electric razor used to die quickly and needed to be kept on the charger constantly or it would run down between uses.The charger is very clever and when folded, helps keep the razor in contact with the charging buttons in the stand. There's a small cover that protects the rotary heads which is handy when you're packing an overnight bag.I'm very impressed with this razor!","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2H85DI3JGLO88/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UF7FE4U#wasThisHelpful","R2H85DI3JGLO88","AV8MDYLHHTUOY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AV8MDYLHHTUOY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"For a very long time, my standard Wifi router was the venerable WRT-54G, but over the years, I moved away from Linksys for a variety of reasons, the biggest being Cisco's acquisition and subsequent diminishing of the Linksys brand. Since Belkin is now the proud owner of Linksys, I have a lot of hope that Linksys will receive more care and attention than it received during the Cisco days.The Linksys EA8500 is a high-end dual-band MIMO router that supports increased bandwidth to devices that support the newer connection models. One of the biggest problems I had with other routers were multiple high-bandwidth connections that throttled things to the point of unusability. One of my recently deprecated routers was especially bad with multiple video streams and has now been replaced with the EA8500 which does a lot better job with multiple devices accessing Netflix and Amazon Prime Video.This model is a huge upgrade from the old WRT days. The router supports MIMO and has greatly improved directional sensitivity. With my previous router, the Wifi signal for the 5Ghz band was extremely direction sensitive and if you weren't sitting in a narrow wedge in the room, you'd lose signal quickly. The EA8500 is significantly better in that regard and I no longer have to cower in one corner of the room while trying to access the Internet.Setup is pretty simple overall and an improvement over the old WRT days. Since I'm dependant on Verizon's terrible wifi router for connection to the Internet, I attach the WAN port of theEA8500 to the 192.168.1.1 inside network of the FIOS router and set the EA8500 network to use 192.168.12.x. It's also a very good idea to fully disable wireless on the FIOS router since all it does is interfere with other Wifi networks. Since the EA8500 is now double-NATed, if you're running any kind of servers inside the house, you'll need to set up port forwards on both routers which can be a little messy. It's also possible to leave the server out on the FIOS inside network and keep everything else inside the EA8500 network for added security.I was happy to see a USB 3.0 as well as ESATA connectivity. This makes it easy to share files/printers and serve media files for the whole household. Another nice feature is a ""guest network"" where you can limit what visitors can see on the network. I usually leave that disabled unless I have actual guests in the house since I prefer to minimize services whenever possible.While there are less expensive routers out there, The Linksys EA8500 holds a lot of promise and so far has been problem-free.I'll update this review as needed.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1M01C4814O6C0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UVN21DK#wasThisHelpful","R1M01C4814O6C0","AV8MDYLHHTUOY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AV8MDYLHHTUOY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I already have the Classic Brands Cool Gel 10 Inch mattress and loved it so much, I purchased one for my daughter as well.When the mattress is delivered, it's hard to believe that the box could contain an entire mattress, but once you unpackage it, it unrolls and grows like crazy. There's a slight solvent smell that dissipates within a few days, so if you're sensitive to those sorts of smells, let air out for a bit before using it.The mattress is very comfortable and conforms to your body as you sleep, which really helps reduce pressure points. I've used pillow top mattresses in the past, but they don't do a good job returning to normal when you move and eventually, you end up with divots in the mattress. One other disadvantage to pillowtops is that during hot weather, I feel like I'm suffocating with all of the trapped heat.The Cool Gel mattress is doing a great job with support and comfort and doesn't make me feel stifled during warm weather.

My previous model was a lot tougher to change batteries and the battery door is significantly better to open and close. The small cord that attaches the door to the headset sometimes gets caught in the opening, but it's a minor nit. Another nice feature is the ""boot up"" sound when the set is powered up. I used to have to listen to make sure it came online, but the beeps make it very obvious.Comfort is also high and it works well when using a rifle or shotgun. Some bulkier headsets I've used in the past made it impossible to get a good cheek weld, but I have no issues with these for a variety of different stock shapes and comb heights.Overall, I'm impressed and recommend these to anyone looking for a set of high-quality electronic hearing protectors.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R75EL558D7BRH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UAM0MFG#wasThisHelpful","R75EL558D7BRH","AV8MDYLHHTUOY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AV8MDYLHHTUOY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Since it had been a while since I'd been camping, lots of equipment has changed for the better. The Klymit Inertia O Zone Air Pad is a big improvement in both weight and space. It consists of two attached sections; a latticed mattress and a four chamber pillow that are inflated separately.You can see the logic behind the latticed mattress portion since it not only saves some weight, but your sleeping bag can expand into the holes in the lattice and possibly give you a bit more warmth. I can't test that idea just yet since it's mid-June, but I'll do so and update this review when I've used it in different conditions.The drawback to the lattice idea is that the Air Pad seems to work best when you're either on your stomach or back. Since I spend a lot of time on my side,  my shoulder doesn't feel much cushioning at all, but the rest of me feels pretty good. The pillow is a bit on the thin side when I'm on my side, but is fine when I'm on my back. I'm 6'4"" and pretty broad shouldered, but the length and width of the pad seem to be ok. I didn't notice any issues with my shoulders feeling unsupported, but that's pretty subjective.Build quality is very good. The fill valves do a fine job of keeping the air inside and are easy to manipulate, even in the dark. As a bonus, it's pretty easy to adjust the pillow's internal pressure while still laying on the mattress portion. Setup and takedown are both very easy and the pad fits nicely into the included pouch which also has a smaller attached pouch for the included repair kit (nice touch).Overall, I'm impressed with the Inertia O Zone Air Pad, especially if you're using it for backpacking. For a less remote camp, I'll probably combine this with a foam pad for some extra comfort.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RL4CHSQK9XY8A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GK4LUXQ#wasThisHelpful","RL4CHSQK9XY8A","AV8MDYLHHTUOY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AV8MDYLHHTUOY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"One thing I really like about the iPhone 6 is that it's slim and fits perfectly in my hand. It's a really great device, but it's fragile as heck and if you drop it, it's toast. I've had other cases for the iPhone 6 that offer different levels of protection but at a cost. They're either too thin and offer nearly no protection, or they're thick and cushiony, but make it hard to remove the phone from my pocket and make it hard to touch the edges of the screen.The Volo Cases Slim Protective Cover offers a good solution that offers good protection while keeping it slim and easy to access the buttons and screen. The outer shell is a hard plastic with a rubbery inner jacket that keeps the phone secure, but accessible. Installation was very simple. It just slipped in and clicked into place. One of my previous cases was significantly harder to insert or remove the phone, but the Volo Cases model is great.The advertising says that it's anti-microbial, but that's not a feature that I find compelling although many parents who let their kids play with their phones might find it an attractive feature. Still, it's a ""nice-to-have"" feature.Another feature that I find essential is the easy access to the headphone and Lightning ports. Some of the cases I've owned were so tight that I had to use a knife to modify the case. I had no issues at all with this case.Bottom line: The case offers good protection for the money while keeping the iPhone's slim appearance and easy handling.

"I've had a variety of handheld VHF and UHF radios over the years and am an active ham radio operator.My current go-to handheld is a Yaesu VX-8DR, but I don't like leaving it in my vehicle where Virginia winters and summers can take their toll on the electronics, so I have a collection of Baofeng radios (a couple of UV-5Rs and a BF-F8HP) that I scatter amongst various vehicles for an emergency backup capability. Since this radio is so inexpensive, but still relatively capable, it would be unfair to expect mainstream radio functionality from a radio at this price point. I'll review it as such.One thing I've noted with all of the Baofeng radios is that they're ""quirky"". Their user interfaces aren't usually well thought out, programming them with the keyboard is painful and they don't seem to have the ability to reach out to remote repeaters like more mainstream handhelds, but it's able to hit the WA4TSC repeater in Bluemont 20 miles as the crow flies from my home in Eastern Loudoun County, VA just fine. Receiver sensitivity is also not quite as good as my Yaesu VX8-DR, but if you keep in mind that this radio costs a great deal less than the Yaesu, I can accept a few faults for a backup radio.This model has a few features that I find useful. It's nice that I can easily get to the FM broadcast bands and there's a handy LED light built into the top of the radio. The included headset works, but is pretty basic and feels like it's going to come off my ear at any moment.One annoying change is that the belt clip is now located on the back of the battery. That means that I'll have to come up with another belt clip if I swap out batteries. If I decide I want to use the battery from this radio in one of my other Baufeng radios, the belt clips will interfere since the other models mount the clip above the battery and this one is ON the battery. Minor point since most people won't have multiples.Programming the radio is best done through software, but I highly recommend at least figuring out the basics of programming through the keyboard. It might be a lifesaver if you're out in the boonies and all you have left is your radio. Cables are available here on Amazon and the ""Chirp"" software is generally well regarded. Once you learn the idiosyncrasies of the radio, it's pretty easy to program, but adding more than a few channels in one session is tiring.I'd originally given the UV-6R three stars, but since it's an improvement in many ways over the UV-5R radios and doesn't directly compete against the more costly mainstream handhelds, I increased it to four stars. For those starting out in ham radio and either can't or don't want to spend more, it's a decent option. Preppers might find it an attractive option since they're so inexpensive, but don't expect the same range you'd find in a higher-end model.Prospective buyers: please keep in mind that this radio will transmit on amateur radio frequencies and unless there's a true, life threatening emergency the FCC  won't be amused.Update:The November 2015 QST magazine has an article on page 74 & 75 that discusses handheld radio spectrum tests performed at the Dayton Hamfest since 2012 and the results are interesting. Of the 264 radios tested at the 2015 Dayton Hamfest, they found that 54% of  the Baofeng radios tested and 14% of Wouxun were not compliant with the FCC standards, while brands like Yaesu, Icom, Kenwood and Connect Systems were found to be 100% compliant. To the best of my knowledge, there are no results for the UV-6R, but given the track record of their other models, it's a factor worth considering when looking for a handheld radio.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RBKYZ6JJWBUYW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WSBZ1IA#wasThisHelpful","RBKYZ6JJWBUYW","AV8MDYLHHTUOY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AV8MDYLHHTUOY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It's amazing how modern fabrics and fasteners have totally changed the camping experience. My first tent was an awful little canvas affair that weighed a ton and leaked like a sieve if you even looked at it funny.The Kelty Salida 2 is a far cry from that experience. It's compact, lightweight, easy to erect and take down and with the fly (and an optional footprint), should keep you dry and comfortable in most conditions.Erecting  it was easy and I suspect I could have done it without reading the instructions the first time. It took me about eight minutes the first time I tried and about five after. Taking it down is also easy, but it takes a bit of effort to get it as small as it comes from the factory. I recommend a compression bag if you plan on taking it on the trail.All of the seams and zippers seemed perfect and I saw no defects in the fabric. The stakes were also a pleasant surprise. With some tents I've owned in the past, they either don't give you any or they're the horrible stamped metal ones that bend the first time you find a rock in the soil.Since I'm pretty tall and broad shouldered, I plan on using it as a solo tent. You can fit two people, but it's ""cozy"". Smaller (normal) people should be more comfortable though.  While the vestibule isn't huge, it's more than enough space to get under cover and be able to remove my boots and store my gear. I'm also happy with the ventilation. There's nothing worse than a tent that feels like a sauna or reeks of mildew.Bottom line: This is a great little tent for backpacking and should work well in all but winter or high wind conditions.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R9OW8J8VTD8ZF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NFCFO0Q#wasThisHelpful","R9OW8J8VTD8ZF","AV8MDYLHHTUOY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AV8MDYLHHTUOY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Since our daughter is taking our original Keurig to college, we got one of these to replace it and it's dreadful. Not only do you have to deal with their silly copy protection system so you MUST buy coffee that's been blessed by Keurig, it has serious issues dealing with ordinary tap water and demands that we clean it all the time. Far more often than our first model. In spite of slavishly following the schedule and instructions, it still complains.We've used our original Keurig since 2008 and while it's pretty basic, it does the job and keeps running with only regular maintenance. We'd had high hopes for the updated model, but so far we're fairly disappointed.I've hear there are ways around the copy protection scheme they use, but I really hate that I'm not allowed to use my old pods and old eco-fill. It's galling and most likely a ploy to further cash in on the K-cup revolution.We're going to drop off this model at the local Goodwill and see if we can find another 1.0 machine to replace it.If it wasn't for the protection scheme and the sensitivity to regular tap water, I'd have given this four or five stars.

"If you're looking for a small-form factor Arduino board with good pin access, this is a decent option. It works as intended and I've had no issues with it at all.The only negative I can think of is that it only comes wrapped in an anti-static bag which puts you at the mercy of whoever is packing the box. It's not a slam on the product itself, but mine was thrown into the shipping box with a heavy item and about half of the pins were bent 15-20 degrees. They straightened right out, but it would be nice if the product packaging was a bit better so the product will survive co-shipment with other items.Bottom line: It's a decent little board for the money and it works fine.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3TAJTCR23A5H3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OHXKILM#wasThisHelpful","R3TAJTCR23A5H3","AV8MDYLHHTUOY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AV8MDYLHHTUOY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Since I use my R-Pi 2 in a variety of places, I need to protect it from stray shorts and static. This case does a pretty nice job keeping tender bits out of harms way and as a bonus, comes with three heat sinks to help keep the main chips running cool.Assembly was pretty easy. The hardest part was peeling the protective film from each piece. Installing the heat sinks was the only bit of trouble I had since it doesn't seem to be possible to attach the third heat sink to the chip on the bottom of the board. If there were an extra layer of case under the R-Pi, it would fit, but then airflow would be an issue. It's weird that they include three heat sinks, but it's only possible to use two of them. Even their product photos show the same issue.On the positive side, it's quite easy to mount heatsinks to the two chips on the top and there's an opening for each to allow heat dissipation and the case unscrews easily to make changes.Things I'd like to see: An opening on the bottom to give room to install the heatsink and to allow proper airflow.

"When I'm away from civilization, it's sometimes hard to keep my devices charged without lugging around a collection of batteries and whatnot. The Goal Zero Switch 10 set is a great way to keep things powered and can take advantage of sunlight to recharge the supplied battery pack or directly charge USB devices.The Goal Zero Switch 10 is a flexible solution that provides the ability to charge many devices using solar energy and comes with a rechargeable 3300mA Lithium-Ion battery pack and a set of useful accessories such as a 110 Lumen LED flashlight, a micro-USB phone charging adapter a couple of mini-carabiners and a cleverly designed hand-held fan with a rubber blade which detaches for easy storage. There's enough room left over in the zippered pocket of the solar panel to store an LED striplight and another battery pack.There's a small locking collar that you can raise and firmly connect the accessories to the battery pack. The solar panel unfolds to expose the solar cells and there is a zippered storage pouch for the accessories on the back and several attachment loops around the perimeter of the panel set so you can attach it to your backpack and charge your devices while you hike.The set is very well designed and slips easily into your backpack when you don't need it. You can also daisy-chain as many as four panels together to allow you devices to charge faster and there are other output options available on the panel. I plan on using this to keep my iPod Nano, iPhone, GPS, Kindle and amateur radio ""walkie-talkie"" fully charged while I'm out camping.The  battery pack allows charging from USB as well as the solar panel so you can pre-charge everything before hitting the trail.Although I hadn't had a lot of exposure to Goal Zero products in the past, I was happy to find that most of their products are compatible with one another and many other similar devices. USB seems to have taken over as the defacto low voltage power and charging  solution. I added a small set of USB and iDevice-converters to the back pouch and pretty much all of my needs are taken care of. After acquiring this set, I've purchased two other battery packs and several LED lights on flexible shafts.There's been a revolution in solar panels in recent years and it's nice to see prices fall and efficiency increase. The Goal Zero seems to produce the rated power in full sunlight, which is significantly better than a panel with almost twice the surface area that I bought a few years ago .Overall I'm very impressed with the the portability and flexibility of the set and I can see a variety of uses beyond hiking and camping.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3LFLZEK9PU16X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OLINB12#wasThisHelpful","R3LFLZEK9PU16X","AV8MDYLHHTUOY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AV8MDYLHHTUOY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Being a dog owner is great, but has its challenges. One of the hardest ones to solve is having a safe way to transport your pups in a variety of vehicles. Since a regular seat is not always a good option, especially if your pet likes to move around, one of the only options we had was to put our dogs in a travel crate which only fit inside our minivan, but not in our second car.The AmazonBasics Waterproof Car Hammock Seat Cover is a great option for those of us who don't always have space for an appropriately sized crate.The Hammock Seat Cover fits in the rear seat of small to mid size cars and attaches securely to the front and rear seat head rests with adjustable straps with quick-disconnect buckles for easy setup and takedown. It took me about 2 minutes to put the hammock in place even without having read the directions. The seat cover is made of a durable fabric with a waterproof backing and has two openings for securing the lower rear portion with a seat belt. There are also two fabric covered pieces that can be pushed between the seat and backrest to additionally secure it in place. There's a zippered section in the front portion of the hammock to allow easy access to the now-enclosed area.Overall, build quality is very good and I expect it will last many years with reasonable care.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2X2M9IYK73MLX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QHC041A#wasThisHelpful","R2X2M9IYK73MLX","AV8MDYLHHTUOY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AV8MDYLHHTUOY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"One of my biggest frustrations with my pedal board is dealing with cables. They're either too long, too short or the 90-degree jacks don't point the right way without twisting the cable and it gets snarled and ugly. Even worse is when they get torn up and I have to buy yet another cable to fix it. It's even worse when one fails when I need it most.The Planet Waves Solderless Custom Cable Kit helps solve a lot of those issues by allowing YOU to make cables that are right for YOUR pedal board. It comes with enough connectors for 5 cables up to two feet long. You can mix and match sizes to get nearly any length you need.Most of my cables are very short and the 90-degree connectors point in opposite directions which suites my needs perfectly.The build quality seems great. The set comes with 10 connectors, 10 feet of cable, a nice little cutter and a screwdriver to do the assembly. The connectors are gold plated which should help with keeping your signal clean (I'm SO sick of steel connectors, they're the bane of my existence).Assembly of a cable is extremely easy.  I usually like to attach one end first, then check the length by placing it on the board using the second connector plugged into the next pedal on the board. You can use any method you like, but I'm really fussy about layout.To begin: Back out the locking screw on the connector with the included screwdriver, insert the cable firmly and keep it pressed in while tightening the locking screw. A VERY tiny bit of thread-lock on the screw will help it stay in place, but too much may interfere with getting a good connection between the screw and the body of the connector. Then insert the completed end into your first pedal and run the cable to the next pedal. Once you know your length, use the included cable cutter to cleanly cut the entire cable and attach the second connector in the orientation you need.One thing I really like about the set is that you don't have to strip back the shielding to get to the center conductor and running the chance of ruining the cable or cutting yourself.  I checked the resistance of a completed cable and it showed 0 ohms. That means that both connections inside the connector were solid and will pass a signal without any loss.I'd avoid trying to use this as an instrument cable unless it's an emergency. The connectors are perfect for a pedal board, but don't have a good enough strain relief for a lot of movement. Plus, it'd make a REALLY pricey instrument cable. :)","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R204MLDDYI2GY2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000BW2D84#wasThisHelpful","R204MLDDYI2GY2","AV8MDYLHHTUOY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AV8MDYLHHTUOY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There are times where I don't want to have to drag a laptop around, but still need to take notes quickly. In the past, I've used a iPad stand and an external bluetooth keyboard, but it all gets very fiddle-y and a pain to setup and take down quickly.The Belkin QODE Ultimate Pro Keyboard Case solves those issues handily by incorporating a keyboard into an iPad Air case that provides good protection to the device and is easy to use in portrait or landscape mode.I've seen and used similar cases in the past, but they've been lacking in one way or another. They're either too bulky, too flimsey or too hard to deploy. The Belkin QODE  uses a set of strong magnets to keep the device securely positioned and can be quickly reconfigured for use in either orientation. If you're just using the tablet to read, you can easily disconnect the keyboard portion to keep weight low, then reattach it when you're ready.Build quality is good, battery life is above average and it's also attractive.

"I've had ADHD (Primary Inattentive) my entire life and while I'm fairly nimble mentally, I've also struggled with maintaining my focus on things I don't find fascinating and as a result, it affected my school work badly. Unfortunately, when I was growing up, ADHD wasn't a ""thing"" and those affected were regarded as being either lazy or stupid. Early attempts to ""fix"" ADHD kids by filling them with tons of pills, but not supplementing that treatment by teaching life skills didn't really help anyone. In many cases, kids were just given pills whether they were ADHD or not. Todays approach seems to be much better tailored to the individual.(NB: My type of ADHD is also known to some as ""ADD"", but I'll refer to it with the usual four letters).Dr Archer's book is an interesting take on the condition and reminds us to focus on the positive aspects instead of focusing solely on the negatives.  I do take the absolute minimum of medication to help remove the negative aspects of ADHD and have worked very hard to develop the skills necessary to be more effective. That journey has taken years and I wish I'd had this book available when I was a kid. I'm thankful that it has positive aspects as well and the book reminds us of that.I was very happy to see that the author validates my own life experiences and we're taking his advice to heart and using this book as a tool to help our daughter who is now developing the skills and attitude she'll need to succeed.This book is a valuable resource for anyone whose lives have been touched by ADHD and I recommend it highly.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2VX2KUXMTD43C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1594633517#wasThisHelpful","R2VX2KUXMTD43C","AV8MDYLHHTUOY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AV8MDYLHHTUOY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I've been using conventional mattress/box spring beds since I first graduated from a crib. I had an opportunity to try a memory foam mattress and knew I had to get one for myself.The Classic Brands Cool Gel mattress comes rolled tightly in a box, and when you remove the plastic wrapping, it immediately puffs up to its full thickness. One word of warning: it's REALLY bulky and a bit heavy. It's best if you can get a bit of help getting it into position. They use a huge amount of plastic film to keep the mattress tightly sealed and it's a good idea to plan the unrolling carefully so it doesn't end up in a awkward position.After giving it a couple of hours to settle, we made up the bed and tried it out for the night. We both noticed that it gave a lot of support and didn't feel as hot as our VERY expensive pillow top mattress. I've been sleeping much better overall. The new mattress also did a very good job reducing, if not eliminating points of  pressure that I'd feel on my shoulder, hip or elbow which helps me be more comfortable overall.Given the reasonable cost and the degree of comfort, it's well worth the price.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1RP3WNE959CN9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UVAJUBO#wasThisHelpful","R1RP3WNE959CN9","AV8MDYLHHTUOY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AV8MDYLHHTUOY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I usually rely on several brands of holsters for EDC. My favorites have been Safariland, Galco, DeSantis and a couple of custom holsters from local makers. DeSantis is a brand I've used in the past for other firearms and when I decided to begin carrying my laser-equipped LCP IWB, the DeSantis Pro Stealth look like a good option.One of the first things I noticed was how difficult it was to put in place. The body of the holster is made from a synthetic fiber and has two places to attach the belt clip, one for LH carry and the default position is for RH carry. The clip is so strong that it significantly distorts the side of the holster which makes it very hard to slide the holster over the belt or even just over my jeans.Since the last thing I want to do is to wrestle the holster into place with a loaded firearm in place, I tried placing it with only the empty holster. That was even worse. Once the holster was in place, I found that reholstering my LCP took two hands and a lot of praying that I wouldn't fumble things and hit the trigger.  That makes practicing at the range something that's going to cause me, the RSO and other shooters there some anxiety.I would have liked to see a stiffener in place to make reholstering easier and safer.Other issues I've found are that the unused belt clip attachment point has sharp edges and presses against your body which gets very uncomfortable after a while and that the synthetic fiber is so slippery that the pistol wants to pop out when I'm driving or bent over to pick something up.If I decide to keep the holster, I'll remove the unused belt clip attachment point and find some way to stiffen the inside of the holster to make it simpler and safer to reholster. The retention issue will be a harder nut to crack and I'm beginning to believe that returning the holster is a better option overall.Conclusions:Holster is difficult to attach IWB (potential safety issue)Retention is not assured (potential safety issue)Firearm is difficult to reholster  (potential safety issue)Leather would be better than synthetic fiberUnused belt clip attachment point presses against body and is very annoying.","2.0 out of 5 stars","May 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R21JSXJDY96XK1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0041N0ZCA#wasThisHelpful","R21JSXJDY96XK1","AV8MDYLHHTUOY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AV8MDYLHHTUOY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My daughters are getting to the age where we're getting ready for college and in addition to a laptop computer, a inexpensive printer/scanner is essential. The Epson Expression Home XP-320 fits that bill very nicely. It allows both wireless and connected printing and can be used to print through 'the cloud' or by inserting an SD card from a camera.Setup is exceedingly easy. After powering up the unit, one is prompted to insert the four cartridges, then wait a short time while the printer initialized. Since I like the flexibility of wireless printing, I prefer to join the printer to the local network so we can access it from iOS devices as well as our Macintosh computers.Once the printer is joined to the network, adding it to your Mac is dirt simple. Just open the preferences panel, select printer/scanner and press ""+"" to add a new printer. The system detects the printer on the network and loads the appropriate drives. From that point on, you just use it to print or scan. The XP-320 allows a variety of scanning resolutions and does a great job for pretty much anything we tried.Print quality is adequate for day-to-day use and having separate ink cartridges means you don't waste ink if you run out of one color before another.Photo quality is not quite as good as my high end photo printer, but it's pretty close overall.For the person wanting a compact home office printer, this is a great option.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R18YT7Q7U4OYM2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SX0R3A4#wasThisHelpful","R18YT7Q7U4OYM2","AV8MDYLHHTUOY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AV8MDYLHHTUOY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I used to buy cheap scopes, then complain about optics, etc. After mounting a 4x-16x M-223 on my varmint rifle, I became spoiled.When it came time to find a scope for a scout rifle, I looked at this scope, a Bushnell, a Leupold and a Burris scope. The Leupold didn't have quite enough eye relief for a proper scout rifle (I'm tall and tend to have a longer pull on my rifles), the Burris seemed great, but was considerably more expensive. GIven my positive experience with Nikon and their BDC scopes, I purchased this model and couldn't be happier. While 2.8X is a bit too much for a scout rifle, I'm still able to get on target easily. I'd love to see this scope with 1X, 1.5X or 2X as the low end of the zoom.The scope is very high quality. There's more than enough eye relief and there's an adjustment to tweak it to your exact needs. It zooms easily and keeps its zero very well. Since it's made to withstand the recoil of magnum pistols, .308 Win in a scout rifle isn't a challenge at all.The BDC reticle is very helpful at longer ranges and when coupled with Nikon's Spot-On smart phone app, you'll be hitting your target at a wide variety of ranges. I've been using it for with my 4X - 16X M-223 as well and it works flawlessly.The FOV at 100 yards is very good and I'm able to quickly engage targets at closer ranges very easily. I prefer to keep the scope at lower magnification levels, but having the option of 8X is nice. Once I get some more handloads assembled, I'm looking forward to seeing how well my rifle performs.Couple this scope with some QD rings from Warne and you'll have a winning solution. If you have a Ruger GSR, get the medium height Warne QD rings. There's not much clearance between the eyepiece and the top of the rail and I had to trim the bottom of the lens cover to fit.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2720RU4H47OFX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0062OSZIM#wasThisHelpful","R2720RU4H47OFX","AV8MDYLHHTUOY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AV8MDYLHHTUOY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Even though I usually have a big mug of drip coffee in the morning, I frequently want some espresso in the afternoon, but don't have time (or the inclination) to go to Starbucks.The Handpresso is very easy to use, doesn't take up a lot of room in my desk or suitcase and I can fling a handful of pods into my bag when I travel. Finding hot water on the road isn't usually too difficult, but finding coffee you like at some hole-in-the-wall is sometimes nearly impossible.Making espresso is a breeze. I usually use the pods, but have used freshly ground coffee as well. I've found it best to pump the Handpresso first, then preheat the water chamber and cup with hot water from the tap while I'm heating the rest of the water in the microwave. Once it's up to temperature, I pour out the water I preheated with, fill the chamber, insert the pod, lock on the top and dispense the espresso. I'm impressed that I can get actual creama this way. I've never been able to make anything even close with an Aeropress.I prefer fresh ground to pods, but either works well in the Handpresso. I've seen some complaints about clogging, but I usually avoid those issues by soaking the portafilter part in some cleaning solution and blasting the holes clean with an old waterpik filled with coffee cleaning solution (there's usually a lot of TSP in them but they do a great job).I've seen a lot of people gushing about the Aeropress, but I vastly prefer the Handpresso","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2B4BQ2HZOZT83/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00H2BQATK#wasThisHelpful","R2B4BQ2HZOZT83","AV8MDYLHHTUOY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AV8MDYLHHTUOY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"One big issue I've had in the past with on-the-ear headphones is that they usually use cheap foam rubber which deteriorates quickly and doesn't do a good job of sound isolation.The Monster NTune On-Ear Headphones have cushions that do a good job conforming to your ears and keep most outside sounds out while keeping most of the music you're playing in. That means I don't disturb my wife with my music (she basically hates almost all of it).In addition to good sound isolation, the headphones are comfortable to wear and even fit on my big noggin quite well. Many times, the headphones won't extend far enough, or squeezes your head like a... lemon (no, I wasn't going to say the 'z' word).Another feature I like quite well is the cord. It's made of good quality material, flexes well, has a small control to start, stop and skip tracks (if your device supports it).  If damaged, it can easily be replaced since it plugs into the bottom of one ear piece. There's an additional jack on the other ear piece so you can share your music with a friend. The headphones come with a storage bag that have enough room for extra cables and whatnot.While I like the headphones a lot,  one area that I find lacking is that they're not ""acoustically flat"". There is a strong emphasis toward bass and trebles while the midrange is rather flabby. I can equalize that with my devices, but the strong bass and crystal highs are annoying for some kinds of music (jazz, classical, blues) unless you compensate with an equalizer. That said, They sound outstanding for dubstep, electronica, trip-hop and the like. I've also found the strong bass useful when I play my six-string bass guitar through a practice amp into headphones. Most other headphones break up when playing at the low end of the instrument and the Monster NTunes sounded fantastic.On the positive side, I didn't detect any distortion or breakup when pushing the volume upwards nearly to the point of pain. The bass remained strong and clear and the treble side of things was also very good. They actually performed better on those frequency ranges than many headsets I've used in the past.Given the marketing info shown on Amazon's product page, it's clear that they're catering to a younger market (most seem to be clones of my daughter and her friends). That explains the bright colors and the music sharing jack on the other ear piece.Overall, I think they're great headphones for modern music with strong bass. If you listen only to Vivaldi or Bach, consider other products.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3JK86AIGL775W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JJVG08W#wasThisHelpful","R3JK86AIGL775W","AV8MDYLHHTUOY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AV8MDYLHHTUOY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""Fiddle for Dummies"" follows their tradition of high quality self-teaching books.As someone who's taught themselves to play mandolin, guitar and bass guitar, it's nice to find a book that shows you the fundamentals of the instrument in an easy to understand format and the supplemental material will be helpful to nearly everyone who has an Internet connection. I would have preferred to see a CD or DVD included, but those are more fragile and usually require that you have a computer or CD player close at hand.The lessons are laid out logically and the student is taken through the fundamentals of playing the fiddle. Although it's possible to learn entirely from the book, I still recommend lessons when you first begin. When I taught myself mandolin and guitar, I had developed some bad habits that could have been avoided if I'd used an instructor at the beginning. If you decide to take lessons in addition to the book, I recommend mentioning that you're using this book as learning material and the instructor will probably use it as instructional supplement.If you've not purchased a fiddle yet, the book will offer advice on purchasing one.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2FY5UTWQ8FVAC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1118930223#wasThisHelpful","R2FY5UTWQ8FVAC","AV8MDYLHHTUOY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AV8MDYLHHTUOY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When I decided to remove the Series 80 junk from my Kimber 1911, I needed to push the rear sights off to one side enough to remove the firing pin block and spring.

"I am really pleased with these headphones, especially considering the price.  I have a pair that sells for more than twice the cost of these and I would say the sound is equally good.First, I like that these can fold up to fit into a sturdy case for travel.  I sometimes work at home and sometimes work at the office so appreciate being able to just toss the case into my bag as I'm hurrying out the door.  They fit well, maybe a bit on the large side.  They cover your whole ear, so while they aren't noise canceling, they do keep out most surrounding noise when in use.  They're comfortable and don't give me a headache when I've been wearing them for a long time.The sound quality is really great.  I listen to everything from the music I grew up with to what's on the radio today as well as musicals.  All of it sounds very clear with the Sentey headphones.  Whether I'm listening to a thumping base line or a hair band wail or a witch attempting to defy gravity, it all sounds very good.  If you want a solid listening experience without the hefty price tag, these headphones will do the trick.Keep in mind, the controls on the cord only fully work with Apple products.  The volume control doesn't work for me at all because I use these with my Dell laptop or Samsung phone.  My daughter has an iPhone and can use the volume control.  It's no big deal because I can, of course, adjust the volume on whatever device I'm using.

"When first looking at this book, I didn't see an age recommendation in the description.  It's about Minecraft though, so I figured my ten year old Minecraft fan would enjoy it and learn some new tricks.When The Advanced Strategy Guide to Minecraft arrived and I started flipping through the pages, I realized it wasn't written with kids in mind.  The text is quite technical and I didn't understand much of it.  However, I did see some things that looked really neat (like how to set up automated farming) and I figured my son (who is an advanced reader) would be able to figure it out.My son was perfectly able to understand this book because he already knows how to accomplish all of the advanced techniques described here.  He's been playing the game on the PC and the XBox for quite some time and just seems to have a knack for it.  It was disappointing that he didn't find anything here that was new to him.It's also important to note that the last several chapters describe how to do things that aren't available with basic Minecraft game play.  In order to use those particular techniques, you need to download and install Mods.  My son doesn't use any Mods.  He keeps telling me we need a better laptop -- apparently the one he is allowed to use for Minecraft has too much lag.On the plus side, there are plenty of screen shots to demonstrate how to craft different things.  The book starts with some tips for setting up your initial account and other useful tidbits.I'd say this might be a good book for an older kid or adult to learn about Minecraft, but an already experienced player might not find anything here to get excited about.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ZJDJ306UGQX5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0789755734#wasThisHelpful","R2ZJDJ306UGQX5","A14E7LZASLSX36","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A14E7LZASLSX36?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"One of the things no one ever told me about getting older was that I'd start to have an issue with facial hair. Around the time I turned 40, I noticed I'd developed a fuzzy little mustache.  Even though the hairs weren't dark, I definitely did not appreciate their presence.  Initially I had my upper lip waxed to keep the fuzz in check, but my skin is very sensitive and no matter how careful they were at the salon or which salon I went to, I'd end up with a bumpy rash along my upper lip.  It was worse than the hair, and by the time it went away, the hair would begin to show.I decided to try Completely Bare's facial hair removal cream at the suggestion of a friend.  I was convinced it would make my skin break out but tried it anyway.  The first time I used it, I wiped the cream off a little too soon and had to touch up the area with tweezers.  After that, however, I figured out that 8 minutes is the exact amount of time needed to easily remove all of the hair above my lip.  I've used Completely Bare's cream several times now and have never had any irritation, rash, acne -- just smooth skin.The applicator tip of this product is easy to use.  After applying the cream and waiting the right amount of time (5 to 8 or so minutes), you simply wipe it and the hair away with a damp cloth.  I usually apply my regular moisturizer after.  This cream has a bit of an odor to it, but nothing that is overwhelming or unpleasant to me. Because it doesn't irritate my skin, I can literally use this product right before going out to dinner and have no worries about my skin.  The effects last several days, at which point I can see some of the hairs growing back in.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2IYOZMXF8RS1S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VM0ZFNE#wasThisHelpful","R2IYOZMXF8RS1S","A14E7LZASLSX36","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A14E7LZASLSX36?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I ordered these risers to give our sofa and love seat a lift in order to make it easier for our robot vacuum to clean under them.  We had no trouble installing them, but did need to use a drill to make holes for the screws.  Both pieces of furniture have solid wood legs that are too hard for just a screwdriver to handle.  After predrilling a hole, attaching the risers to the bottom of the furniture feet was a snap.Once the risers were installed, I could see that the robot wouldn't get stuck again. The risers aren't very noticeable though, which is nice.  They also keep the furniture from sliding around on the wood floor.  Every week or so I'd notice the furniture had been scooted a few inches to one side as people get up and down, but that's no longer happening.

"My husband and I have had a lot of fun with this game when we've had friends over.  The premise is, you are given a phrase and an accent and have to attempt to use that accent when saying the phrase.  Accents range from ""redneck"" to ""drag queen"" and pretty much anything else you can possibly think of.  The phrases can be considered politically incorrect at best.With the right people, this is a hilarious game.  Would I want to play this with my in laws or my grandma?  No way!  Would I want my kids around to hear this stuff?  No way!  But with most of our friends and a few beers, this is good fun.  We often end up in tears from laughing so hard.  There are a couple of regulars in our group of friends who wouldn't appreciate this game.  While it isn't exactly like Cards Against Humanity, it is the same sort of humor.  So, judge wisely in choosing who you invite for game night if this is your chosen game.One thing I like about this game is that you can play it with a large group.

While most of what we do is scheduled on a calendar, there are tasks that pop up from time to time that we have to add in to our daily routine.

"My dog has been having so much fun with this toy!  She loves to play fetch, but we always use a tennis ball. She had no trouble switching to this arrow/dart shaped toy.You use the slingshot handle to propel the dart across the yard for the dog to chase.  There's a small, soft hook on the dart that you use to draw back the elastic pull on the handle before letting go to launch the toy.  It took me a few tries to really get the hang of it, but once I figured it out, I was able to fling the dart a fair distance.  The trick is to give the handle a bit of a flick with your wrist as you release the dart with your other hand.  You can get quite a bit more distance than just pulling and releasing.My kids had a harder time getting the hang of it.  My son snapped himself with the elastic a couple of times.  The dog doesn't actually care if the dart goes super far or not.  She just goes berserk when she sees one of us getting ready to let the dart fly.  We really wore her out this afternoon, to the point where she'd chase the dart, bring it back, then flop down into the grass on her side.  It was comical, and we all always have fun playing fetch with her using the ChuckIt Ultra Sling.There are a couple of things to keep in mind.  The hook on the dart is soft so it won't hurt your dog.  This means it doesn't seem very strong.  I'm also not sure how long the elastic band will last.  The rest of the toy seems more durable and well made, so only time will tell.  You don't want to let your dog use this as a chew toy -- if she chews the hook off, the sling shot is useless.  We put the toy away after playing so our dog doesn't damage it.  You may also have a hard time keeping this toy in working order if you have to fight your dog to get the dart back.  I'm not sure it would survive many games of tug without the hook being damaged.  Our dog is pretty good about returning what she's fetched, so for us this isn't an issue but it's something others may want to consider.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ZF8C9O1UDPF7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WZ972YQ#wasThisHelpful","R2ZF8C9O1UDPF7","A14E7LZASLSX36","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A14E7LZASLSX36?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"These chalkboard labels work exactly as described and look great.  What you get is 6 sheets of 8 labels and one liquid chalk marker.  They are meant to be extremely easy to reuse, with the liquid chalk writing removable with a damp cloth.  The labels themselves can also be reused -- just peel off and restick.I have to say, I was pleasantly surprised at how easy it is to reuse the labels.  They easily wipe completely clean without any scrubbing or effort.  The labels stick very well but peel off without leaving behind any residue or hint of stickiness.  The labels come in a few different shapes and are a good size, a bit large for a jelly jar and more suited for larger jars or containers.  They would be great for crafts or gift labels as well as organizing.  I used them on large glass containers for sugar, rice, popcorn, etc.  I like knowing that the labels can be removed when I want to wash the jars and won't become worn and faded or turn into a gooey mess.One thing to keep in mind, the liquid chalk pen doesn't dry instantly.  Once it does dry, however, you can handle the labels without any smearing or smudging.I received this product at no cost in exchange for a review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1LVIZK6TFS787/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015J5ISGS#wasThisHelpful","R1LVIZK6TFS787","A14E7LZASLSX36","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A14E7LZASLSX36?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"From the very first page, The Killing Lessons is dark, brutal, and utterly gripping.  I'll admit it, I spent a good part of the weekend ignoring my kids and putting off household chores because I could not stop reading this book.In The Killing Lessons, San Francisco homicide detective Valerie Hart is trying to track down a pair of serial killers who operate across several states, abducting and torturing women before killing them, mutilating the bodies, and disposing of them.  Valerie is a deeply flawed character, clearly suffering from PTSD.  She drinks too much and is obsessed with the case.  Her personal problems begin to bleed into her professional life just as the case begins to break open.  As Valerie works to track down the killers, they are on the move after killing a woman and her son.  A little girl manages to escape, the killers abduct their next victim, someone is out to ruin Valerie's career (as if she isn't doing that to herself already), and the story basically rockets to a climax without giving you much time to catch your breath.The Killing Lessons is very dark.  The writing is fantastically descriptive and the characters are fascinating, but the author spares us of none of the horrifying details of each murder.  The full scope of what the killers do to their victims is revealed gradually, but turns out to be even worse than I imagined while reading.  This book is not for the sensitive reader -- the violence will pound you over the head.My only criticism of The Killing Lessons is that it unfortunately falls in to the old story of the cop going rogue just in time to save the day.  There was also a big coincidence in a break in the case -- Valerie just happened to see just the right little clue that popped up in an unrelated case on another cop's computer.  It is the one thing that finally sets her on the trail of the killer's identity.  Maybe I'm too much of a stickler, but I do feel like an author cheats a bit when resorting to such a tactic.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2A0CPF5BYZB2I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250057345#wasThisHelpful","R2A0CPF5BYZB2I","A14E7LZASLSX36","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A14E7LZASLSX36?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A Blossom of Bright Light is a decent mystery/crime novel, not particularly memorable.  I haven't read the previous Jimmy Vega mystery by Suzanne Chazin, but that didn't detract from this book.  The author references some events that probably took place in the first book, but they have no bearing on the plot of this one.Detective Jimmy Vega ignores a call from a local drunk claiming he saw the Virgin Mary in the woods with a baby -- this particular drunk makes these claims wild claims often.  This time, however, there really is a baby whose body is discovered the next day.  Over the course of the novel, Vega tracks down the identity of the baby, the mother, and the people responsible for the baby's death.  In the meantime, he deals with his strained relationship with his girlfriend and daughter and must navigate the close knit, distrustful Hispanic community.  Issues such as illegal immigration, deportation, and the cultural taboo against reporting abuse weave their way through the story.Early on, it's pretty clear who the bad guys will turn out to be and who the next victim will turn out to be.  I thought there were a couple of unlikely coincidences  -- what are the odds Vega's own daughter, out of all the people in the town, will have a tie to the case?  What are the odds Vega's girlfriend will also have a tie to the case?  What are the odd's Vega's ex-wife's housekeeper will have a tie to the case?  Their favorite shopkeeper?  Yep, her too.Plot shortcomings aside, the writing is good with a decent pace.  The immigration issues are timely and tug at the heartstrings.  If you're looking for a rather light read (in spite of the nature of the crime, I wouldn't call this book dark as we are spared the details and the crimes themselves aren't described in any detail) or something to keep you occupied on a lazy afternoon or during a long flight, this might be the book for you.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R22OT0EPQKWS55/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=161773635X#wasThisHelpful","R22OT0EPQKWS55","A14E7LZASLSX36","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A14E7LZASLSX36?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Solid Gold is a good quality dog food.  I like that it doesn't have wheat, soy, or corn and appears to avoid fillers.  There aren't any artificial colors, and the protein source is mainly chicken, chicken meal, and pollock meal.  The ingredients do include plant sources of protein (peas, pea fiber, lentils), which may be less valuable to your dog than meat based protein.  As far as quality goes, this is something I feel pretty good about giving to my dog.The kibble has uniform pieces, not too small or too large.  My dog seems to like the taste of Solid Gold food -- she certainly doesn't leave any behind.  I mix in some good quality wet food for her morning meal and add a little coconut oil to the kibble when she has dinner.  Her energy level is great, her coat looks soft and shiny, and she hasn't had any digestive upsets while on this food.While I do think this is an above average dog food, I believe there are comparable foods available at a better price.  I would definitely compare ingredients and prices and shop around a bit.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R22GL3KOHUTJWS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WUIGK2C#wasThisHelpful","R22GL3KOHUTJWS","A14E7LZASLSX36","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A14E7LZASLSX36?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I haven't played with a race track set since I was a kid, and even though it was fun back then, the Real FX Racing set is leaps and bounds beyond those old slot racing tracks.In this box, you get two cars, two controllers, and enough track to build a good size race area.  The cars and track are larger than I expected.  You will need a decent amount of floor space to set this up.  The set up is very easy.  The track sections are flat and connect using simple tabs.  There are several possible track configurations.  The cars sync to the handsets automatically.  As someone who isn't very good at driving anything other than a real car, I really appreciate the AI feature -- the cars sense the track and will even stay on the track without you steering if you don't drive them too fast.  It helps to keep the cars from flying off at the turns while you get the hang of the controls.The controls are fairly simple and intuitive.  You can use the cars in practice mode, championship mode, and RC mode.  In RC mode, the cars don't even need to be on the track.  My 10 year old is by far the best at controlling the cars, probably because he spends a lot of time enjoying them just in RC mode without even setting up the track.The real fun, of course, is in racing an opponent.  Not having your car confined to one lane makes racing so much more enjoyable.  There's nothing like bumping the other car off the track to liven up the race, not to mention the surprise of spinning out because of an oil spill or blown tire.  The handsets make the sound effects and keep you updated on which lap you're on and who's in first place.  In practice mode, the handset gives you the time for each lap and tells you when you've beaten your best time.  Racing with this set is fun and addictive; you always want just one more race!  It really is like the ideal combination between old school racing sets and racing video games.On a side note, when we first received this set we had a problem with one of the cars not working properly.  Wow! Stuff was very quick to respond to my emails and went above and beyond to fix the issue -- great customer service.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3QFBD4DLMWDGA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IGNT3KQ#wasThisHelpful","R3QFBD4DLMWDGA","A14E7LZASLSX36","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A14E7LZASLSX36?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Sometimes I feel like the only person who still uses a planner rather than some app on my phone to keep track of appointments, activities, and events.  I work at home and use a planner to keep track of the tasks I need to do for each client on a daily basis.This planner works well for me.  Each month is spread across two pages with enough room on each individual date to add more than one notation. The advantage to this is being able to see the entire month at once, a feature that helps me prioritize my work.  The size of the spaces allows me to write in personal appointments, kids' practices and game, and other reminders. Tabs along the side let you quickly turn to a specific month as needed.Additional features such as a 3 year reference, future planning pages, space to list contacts, room for notes, space to list events by month, and a list of dates when holidays fall through 2019.  The planner is quite thin in spite of these additions to the calendar.  An elastic band holds the planner closed.  The cover has a nice feel to it, very smooth and a little soft.  While it doesn't have the sturdiest construction, it does seem able to hold up to one year of use just fine.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2OYDH55OAYW0T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WWVYDJ4#wasThisHelpful","R2OYDH55OAYW0T","A14E7LZASLSX36","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A14E7LZASLSX36?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Medieval Lego is a fantastic book on two levels.First, it is visually very impressive.  The large, full color photos of Lego scenes are so much fun to look at.  It's really impressive how creative the author is in recreating each story in Lego form.  Each time I look at this book, I see something new.  My 10 year old is a huge Lego fan and is a very talented builder himself.  Even though there aren't instructions for building these scenes, my son has a knack for figuring out how to recreate elements that appeal to him.  I love that we can all enjoy the Lego scenes in this book while my little Lego fan is able to take an even deeper appreciation of it. You can see the wheels turning when he looks through Medieval Lego and know he is planning his next build.Second, the stories here are really interesting and appeal to a wide age range.  They are all well written (by a variety of historical experts) and accessible for all of us, kids and adults.  My 16 year old enjoys history and is familiar with more historical details than you'd expect, but she still found a lot of new things in this book.  We've had a really good time reading the stories, which cover quite a large time period but are only a couple of pages each.Whether you appreciate history or Lego or both, Medieval Lego is a delight.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2WXNDI15MEXZO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1593276508#wasThisHelpful","R2WXNDI15MEXZO","A14E7LZASLSX36","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A14E7LZASLSX36?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Until trying this product, I'd never had ginger tea.  Kazu Ginger Root Tea is 100% ginger root, finely diced and inside a basic tea bag.  It's prepared like other teas, by pouring boiling water over the tea bag and letting it steep for a few minutes.As you'd expect from ginger, the tea has a spicy bite to it.  It is very warming.  I've found that using a bit of honey in the tea takes the edge off the spice.  I've had a head cold the last couple of days and find the ginger tea to be very soothing.  The internet has plenty of articles listing the benefits of ginger tea, from fighting cancer and alzheimer's to reducing nausea and relieving pain from inflammation.Each tea bag is individually sealed for freshness.

"We've never had an air purifier, so I was interested to see if this Rowenta model would make a noticeable difference in our home.  This review is for the larger model.Setting up the purifier is a quick and easy job.  The manual is clear and easy to follow.  You really only have to unwrap and install the filters before plugging the unit in.  At first, I mistook the description to mean the purifier comes with 4 replacement filters, but quickly saw that the purifier uses 4 different filters to purify the air.  The filters are:1.  Prefilter:  This filter captures dust and hair and is washable.  Every few weeks, you should vacuum or wash this filter.  You won't need to buy a new prefilter.2.  Carbon filter:  This filter removes odors and, according to the manual, should be replaced once a year with average use.3.  HEPA filter:  This removes pollen, pet dander, mold, bacteria, and other very small particles from the air.  The HEPA filter should last 3 years with average use.4.  NanoCapture filter:  This filter captures and destroys formaldehyde, a common household air pollutant and carcinogen.  The manual doesn't indicate how often this filter typically lasts.  Instead, you rely on a color coded guide to visually check the filter to see when it needs to be replaced.At this time, I can't find the carbon or HEPA filters for sale in order to check their prices. The NanoCaptur filter sells for $59.99 at Home Depot.  At that price, I hope it lasts quite a while.  Average use is considered 8 hours at a day at speed 2; if you run the purifier longer or at a higher setting, your filters may need to be replaced sooner.Other features of the purifier that are very useful include settings to control the air speed, a night setting for running more quietly and with dimmed lighting, a timer, and a delayed start.  You can change the sensitivity of the pollution sensors as well.  The display shows the current air quality.  I prefer to keep the purifier set to auto; it runs at a lower speed until it detects pollutants in their air -- then, it kicks up the speed until it sense the air quality is again excellent.As I've been using the purifier, I've been surprised at the difference it makes.  When walking into the living room (where the purifier is currently set up), the air is noticeably fresher.  The purifier is very quiet and I usually don't notice it.  When I'm cooking, the purifier senses the additional odors and other things in the air and automatically goes into a higher speed.  I'm not sure what that says about my cooking style, but it does show that the purifier senses the change in the air and responds to it.My youngest son has some pretty severe seasonal allergies during spring and summer.  I plan to move the purifier into his bedroom during allergy season to see if turning it on before he goes to bed and letting it run all night helps his allergy symptoms and lets him sleep more comfortably.The only challenge I've had with this unit is deciding where to place it.  The purifier isn't supposed to be under a window or surrounded by furniture.  The layout of the living room makes this difficult; I really had nowhere to put it other than under a window.  Because of the cool weather, the window is staying closed, but if I wanted to open that window I think I'd need to move the purifier.I am torn between giving this 4 and 5 stars; I want to price out all of the filters and see how it works during allergy season before I fully make up my mind.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ES189BS55RFR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014SYDF0K#wasThisHelpful","R1ES189BS55RFR","A14E7LZASLSX36","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A14E7LZASLSX36?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I've tried a few different products to help my hair air dry into a wavy look, and this is one that I am pretty happy with.  I have long hair, and a lot of it, although it's pretty fine and very soft.  If I let it air dry, it tends to look frizzy, but it the summer it's just too hot to use a hair dryer.With the TRESemme Shaping Gel Cream, I get soft waves without the frizz.

"I have long hair with some natural wave to it, but when I let it just air dry it ends up looking frizzy.  I've tried various curling gels and creams, which help give my hair a wavy look without the frizz, but some products feel too stiff or sticky.TRE Semme's UnDone Gelee didn't really perform well for what I wanted with my hair.  The directions on the bottle don't really indicate whether or not you should use the product on wet or dry hair, but after trying it out on wet hair, followed by an air dry, I've decided this Gelee is probably meant to be used to hold already-curled or waved hair.  I went to the TRESemme website and watched the videos in the UnDone series, but this product wasn't featured.  In fact, I am not sure why they call the look UnDone when it seemed to take a lot of time and effort to get some waves.When I applied this to wet hair and let my hair dry, it didn't really help with the waves or reduce any frizz.  I tried using a bit more product, but was left with my hair looking weighed down and feeling crunchy.

My boys are now starting to experiment with creating their own machines and I love seeing how busy and engaged they are.I would highly recommend this set for kids who enjoy building and designing.

"This is a cute, great starter Power Wheels toy for toddlers.  When my own kids were little, their grandparents spoiled them with multiple Power Wheels over the years and my kids never tired of them.  I got this for my niece and nephew to play with when they visit, and they love it.When this small quad arrives, you first need to charge the battery for 18 hours.  I started the battery charging and assembled the vehicle, which was a quick and easy process.  You will need both a flathead and philips screwdriver.  I didn't have any trouble putting the vehicle together and even managed not to mess up the decorative stickers.  The only problem I had involved the way the tracks were packaged.  They are in their own box inside the larger box.  When I pulled the box of tracks out of the larger box, it came open on one side and the tracks fell onto my bare foot -- very painful, and by the next day I had some colorful bruises.  So, be careful and don't trust the smaller box to hold together.Once charged, I set up the track in the back yard and first let my little nephew take a turn.  He really loved rolling around the track.  The quad works fine in our yard, but of course very small children take a while to learn the concept of steering.  You definitely have to supervise until your toddler is able to steer.  I don't have enough floor space indoors to use the track inside, but if you have an open area in your home you can certainly use this for some rainy day fun.  It really is a fun toy for kids and the kind of thing they never seem to get tired of.  It encourages imaginative play and hand/eye coordination.  The quad moves slowly enough to prevent runaway toddlers or dramatic crash scenes.The only drawback to this quad is that it is quite small and will be outgrown within a year or two.  I also wish it had some sort of simple on-board storage.  Little kids love to put things inside other things and take them out again.  A little cubby for storing small treasures would make this quad perfect.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RM2UA8FIZTR8A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WO6P364#wasThisHelpful","RM2UA8FIZTR8A","A14E7LZASLSX36","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A14E7LZASLSX36?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This little bathmat is ok for small bathroom or as an additional mat in a larger bathroom.  We use this mat in front of the toilet and a larger mat that covers the area in front of the shower and sink.  On it's own, it doesn't cover much area so make sure you have a realistic idea of the size of this rug as compared to the area you want to cover.The neutral color is nice and I like the nubby texture.  However, the edges seem like they aren't very tightly woven.  After one washing, they look a little ragged.  Both of our bathrooms get a lot of use, so the rugs in them have to be able to stand up to frequent traffic and routine washing.  I am not confident this rug will look nice for very long.  It would be better suited for a spare bath that only sees infrequent use.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1GU81AK0U2L6Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00K3FFDNG#wasThisHelpful","R1GU81AK0U2L6Y","A14E7LZASLSX36","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A14E7LZASLSX36?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The cuffs are not sewn into a turned up position (like in the photo), so you can wear them without the fleece showing if you prefer.My husband's normal approach to facing the cold, such as when he has to shovel the driveway or when we take the kids sledding, is to wear his fleece or flannel pajama pants under his jeans.  It keeps him warm, but isn't very comfortable.  These fleece lined Wranglers will give him the added warmth he likes when outside on a very cold day.

However, when I first lathered it up in the shower on my shower pouf, it had a stronger, perfumed scent that brought to mind my high school typing teacher (not a good association).  However, after rinsing off and dressing, I thought the scent had greatly toned down and was actually very pleasant.  Several hours after showering, my skin still smells clean with just a hint of the scent of this cleanser.The shower oil itself is rather thick.  It doesn't create a lot of lather, but lather is something we all think makes us cleaner when, in fact, it's just for show.  This product lathers enough and rinses away well enough so that I don't feel like I any kind of residue on my skin.  My skin also doesn't feel dry or tight after showering, but during winter that may change.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R29J22E4ZYZLHN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00W5Z5GFM#wasThisHelpful","R29J22E4ZYZLHN","A14E7LZASLSX36","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A14E7LZASLSX36?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Girl Waits with Gun is a departure from Amy Stewart's previous works of nonfiction.  If you've had the pleasure of reading Wicked Bugs or Wicked Plants, you'll already be familiar with Stewart's engaging brand of humor and knack for presenting the most fascinating of facts in a way that is both memorable and entertaining.  Girl Waits with Gun blurs the lines between fact and fiction, taking real life events surrounding the Kopp sisters and their nemesis Henry Kaufman and fleshing them out with an impressive mix of investigative details and creativity.When Henry Kaufman crashes his automobile into the Kopp sisters' buggy, a series of events is unleashed that tests the sisters' resolve to live in privacy with their independence intact.  Kaufman turns out to be a despicable man surrounded by unsavory characters.  When Constance Kopp attempts to make Henry pay for the damages, he responds with threats that escalate into very real danger.  Constance is challenged to protect her family, but can't stand by and allow Kaufman to get away with his terrible behavior.  I really enjoyed both the story and Stewart's wry, understated humor.  The Kopp sisters are great characters, and I love how they are the undisputed center of the story.  The men in the book don't come to their rescue or bail them out, but tend to turn up after the fact, shaking their heads as they offer all the wrong kinds of advice (move in with family, stay home and locked away, and my favorite, avoid hotels at all costs!).  As the Kopp sisters try to stay alive long enough to see Henry Kaufman brought to justice, they must face their dwindling finances, the shadow of their deceased overprotective mother, the uncertain future, and the kind of family secret that can ruin them.  The sisters are really memorable and appealing characters.  I wish we could be neighbors.I also enjoyed the added section at the end of the book where Stewart lists exactly which parts of the story are known as fact and which she added herself.  She lists sources for the newspaper articles throughout the book, most of which were reprinted as they originally appeared during the events in the story.  I completely enjoyed Girl Waits with Gun and would highly recommend it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R20HD9C1JST8BL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0544409914#wasThisHelpful","R20HD9C1JST8BL","A14E7LZASLSX36","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A14E7LZASLSX36?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This Panasonic camera is fun to use and takes great photos and videos.  I have had a Canon Rebel for years and for some time had been wishing it could record video.  The Panasonic is lighter and smaller than I expected but performs very well.Initially, there is more of a learning curve with this camera than I expected.  From a layman point of view, the buttons and controls take some time and practice to figure out beyond the basic, automatic settings.  I really like the touch screen aspect and the many features, such as choosing a still frame photo from a video.  If you aren't an experienced photographer, you will need to take your time getting to know this camera.  Right out of the box (once the battery is charged), you can take photos on the automatic setting.  Anything more sophisticated will require time spent studying the manual.One feature I was excited to try was the wireless photo sharing.  While this is definitely a good feature, it has some limitations.  I can connect the camera wirelessly to my cell phone (or a tablet), using a free app.  With the app, you can transfer photos from the camera to your phone, control the camera, and share photos through social media.  The down side is that when your phone is connected to the camera, you can't be connected to WiFi.  You also can't connect wirelessly to a laptop, which would have been a fantastic feature.  The included software for saving and editing photos is OK, but I do prefer to use the editing software that came with my Canon.Overall, I like the convenient size of this camera and the wide range of settings.  While I am still learning to use this camera to its potential, I am quite happy with it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1LESTCA6IE0WB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00X409PQS#wasThisHelpful","R1LESTCA6IE0WB","A14E7LZASLSX36","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A14E7LZASLSX36?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I got these pants for my son, who will be 12 next week.  He is tall for his age and has been wearing a size 14 for some time.  Lately he's been saying some of his size 14 pants are feeling too small, but he's not tall enough yet to wear a 16.  I thought maybe a 14 Husky would be a good compromise, although my son is not ""husky.""Wrangler clothing does seem to be a bit roomier than other clothing brands.  It turns out that a 14 Regular in this brand fits my son best.  He can wear the husky in a 14, but only because these pants have an adjustable waist.  As a parent with fast-growing kids, I always look for pants with the adjustable waist, and in this case it literally makes the pants wearable.  They are a good length and look great, even after washing.  They look nice enough for school but so far seem durable enough to stand up to playtime as well.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R5DFOWLE1W94L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XKUXG9Y#wasThisHelpful","R5DFOWLE1W94L","A14E7LZASLSX36","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A14E7LZASLSX36?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have a 40 pound 9 month old mixed breed (maybe shepherd, beagle, hound?) who loves to chew on soft toys but can't have them because she literally eats them.  I haven't let her have anything other than hard chew toys (like Kong and Nylabone) after seeing her throw up a pile of string and stuffing.This Tuffy dog toy caught my eye with its promises of durability.  I saw it in a pet store and the toughness rating of 9 fooled me into thinking it would stand up to my puppy's love of chewing. Within a few hours, she had unraveled one corner of this toy and in about a week made a hole large enough to reach the stuffing.  Since she doesn't just tear toys apart but actually swallows them, I had to take it away from her.  Unfortunately, I bought this at a boutique pet store and paid $16 for it.You'd probably be OK with this as a toy for fetch or tug, but not as something for your dog to chew on consistently.","2.0 out of 5 stars","August 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2DPHBHPHG9UPL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0006VB3YA#wasThisHelpful","R2DPHBHPHG9UPL","A14E7LZASLSX36","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A14E7LZASLSX36?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I originally chose this book for my 16 year old, but ended up reading it myself.  The premise sounded really interesting -- teens affected by a virus that gives them powers along the lines of X Men or Heroes, some of whom are terrorists and some of whom are otherwise ordinary kids.  The  terrorists use their powers to throw the US into chaos by destroying a wide range of targets.  Blackout is the story of two sets of teens, terrorists and not, whose stories converge.Blackout was a fun, if light, read.  If you're wondering how a book about terrorists devastating the country can be light, it's because the story focuses so closely on the characters and their immediate circumstances that we don't get to see much of the bigger picture.  Sure, Chicago doesn't exist anymore, but none of the action happens in Chicago so it doesn't seem very real.  That being said, Blackout is the kind of easy page turner perfect for a beach day or a road trip.  There's enough happening to keep you interested and waiting to see what happens next.Without their powers, the characters are rather bland, which is one of the weak points of this book.  Additionally, we know very little about the terrorists.  Who set them in motion, and where did they come from?  What is their ultimate goal, and why?  In fact, after reading the book, the big question I was left with was, ""Why?""  The ending does lead me to hope for more from the sequel (Dead Zone), which I may pick up from the library.Stronger points of the the book include the action and a couple of interesting twists.  I like the various powers given to the kids affected by the virus as well as the overall idea of the story.  Yes, it could be meatier and answer a few more questions, but it is entertaining.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R390JMNKBYQ505/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062026127#wasThisHelpful","R390JMNKBYQ505","A14E7LZASLSX36","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A14E7LZASLSX36?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Honest Kitchen's line of pricey, yet high quality, dog food is an exceptional food if you can afford it.  Made with a short list of human-grade ingredients, this dog food has nothing in it you wouldn't want your dog to eat.  No by-products, nothing artificial, and no grains.  Dog Food Advisor gives this food its highest rating of 5 stars, calling it ""superior.""Because this food is dehydrated, it doesn't look like dog food.  It has a flaky, powdery texture with some larger chunks.  You measure out the amount of food based on your dog's weight, add the suggested amount of warm water, and let it sit for a few minutes to rehydrate.  I prefer to mix a few days' worth at once and store the extra in the fridge.  Even after mixing, it doesn't really look or smell like your typical wet dog food.My dog loves this food.  Granted, she loves everything and has been known to eat chicken poop, so her palette probably can't be trusted.  She is very energetic and her coat looks fantastic.  She rarely has issues with gas, her breath isn't bad (as long as she avoids chicken poo), and she even smells good when she hasn't had a bath for a few weeks.  The vet said she's ""the picture of health,"" and I am convinced a high quality diet has a lot to do with that.  When we first got her, she had dry, flaky skin, terrible breath, and an unpleasant doggy odor just a day or two after getting a bath (she was from a shelter in the South).  I really believe changing her to a top quality kibble and supplementing that with high quality wet food has led to an overall improvement in her health and appearance.This 4 lb box of food makes 16 lb of rehydrated food -- still expensive, especially if you have a large dog.  However, I think a top notch dog food pays for itself over the course of your dog's life in good health and reduced vet bills.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RY9KD4RQ7AJPN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZBI9DYU#wasThisHelpful","RY9KD4RQ7AJPN","A14E7LZASLSX36","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A14E7LZASLSX36?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The first time I used the SteamFast 3-in-1 steam mop, I instantly became a big fan of it.  I had a steam mop several years ago that only cleaned floors, and while I liked how it cleaned, it stopped working after only a few months.  I wanted to try the SteamFast because it not only cleans floors, but can be used as a handheld steam cleaner and a clothes steamer.Setting up the SteamFast is simple, no tools required.  Just fill the water tank, attach the handle (if mopping), attach the appropriate cleaning tool, plug it in, and turn it on.  It heats up very quickly and begins to produce a constant flow of steam.  You can adjust the level of steam according to the job/surface type.  The SteamFast is light and easy to maneuver and has a very long cord.For floors, it works very well.  I have been trying to cut back on the various cleaning chemicals I use around the house and really appreciate that this mop works so well with just water.  With three kids and a dog, our kitchen floor becomes a grimy mess faster than you'd believe.  As with any mop, you have to sweep or vacuum first.  The SteamFast quickly and easily cleaned up the kinds of sticky spots I'd normally scrub at with my regular mop or Swiffer.  It glides easily across the floor and one tank of water was enough to clean my eat-in kitchen, L shaped living room/dining room area, and both (small) bathrooms.  You get two washable microfiber pads to use with the mop.  They wash and dry well and I like that they can be reused.  The mop handle can be adjusted for length, which is a very nice feature.  It also has hooks for wrapping the cord; for easier storage, you can adjust the handle to the shortest position and wrap the cord around the hooks.When steaming wrinkles out of clothes, you detach the handle and use the clothes steaming attachment.  Until trying this steamer, I had never steamed clothes -- but it was simple and surprisingly effective.Using the steam nozzle attachments makes other cleaning jobs a breeze.  I was super impressed with how the SteamFast cleaned those nooks and crannies in the bathroom that I normally struggle to reach.  I have two young boys, and while I love them dearly, they are disgusting creatures.  What boys to do toilets is unspeakable.  The SteamFast was able to completely clean even the crevices in the toilet seat hinges so thoroughly and quickly you'd never know I live with boys who have terrible aim.  It also worked very well to clean the narrow spot behind the faucet in the master bath and made short work of the grimy places where the counter meets the wall.  In the bathroom, I found it effective to first use the steam cleaner to remove dirt from hard to reach places, then wipe it up with a cloth.  I love how much cleaner the bathroom looks without all the effort of using a little brush to scrub away at those awkward spots.  The nozzle alone is great for blasting steam into small places, while the brush attachments let you steam and scrub at the same time.In addition to the clothes steamer, mop, nozzle, and nozzle brushes, you get a squeegee attachment for cleaning mirrors and glass.  It works ok, some dripping, but is a decent alternative to using glass cleaner and paper towels.  Really, with the SteamFast and some cleaning cloths, you can do a lot of cleaning without using chemicals or paper towels.There are two things I did notice that are drawbacks to the SteamFast.  First, when steaming clothes the steamer drips a lot.  The clothes had no wrinkles, but did get quite damp from the dripping water.  The things I steamed were not going to be worn immediately, so this was no big deal, but it's something to keep in mind.  Also, the metal button that holds the handle in place seems to be a bit flimsy.  You have to be careful when putting the handle on or removing it; the button can become stuck at an angle and not lock into place.  My concern is that over time, it may break.Finally, it would be nice if this steamer had some sort of on-board storage for all of the attachments.  In order to (hopefully) avoid losing them, I put them all in a gallon ziplock bag, with the pads, then used a hanger with clips to hang the bag in the hall closet where I store the vacuum and steam mop.  This keeps everything in one place and easy to find.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3GST9B233KL6E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0106ANJAG#wasThisHelpful","R3GST9B233KL6E","A14E7LZASLSX36","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A14E7LZASLSX36?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have yet to encounter a dog food my dog won't devour with enthusiasm, and Purina Beyond Natural is no exception.  She certainly enjoys the taste, and I enjoy the short ingredient list.  Each flavor of this dog food contains only a few human grade ingredients and no meat byproducts, corn, wheat, or soy.  This food looks and smells like baby food.  It is easy to mix in with dry kibble and lives up to the description of coating the food without soaking it.The label says to use 1/2 pouch per 20 pounds of your dogs weight.  It doesn't actually say to reduce the amount of kibble to reflect the addition of this food, but I am assuming that's what you'd do to avoid weight gain.  My 40 pound dog gets 1 cup of kibble plus about 1/3 to 1/2 cup of wet food in the morning (and only dry food in the evening), so I use one full pouch with her kibble.The only thing I am not crazy about is the packaging.  The pouches aren't very easy to open.  It takes more force than I expected to be able to twist the top off and I can see that anyone with joint problems in their hands may not be able to manage these.  A simple tear open pouch would have made more sense and used far less plastic.  It seems like Purina is trying to make the pouches look like the squeezable fruit pouches made for toddlers, but in this case the plastic spout isn't needed.  You can always use a pair of scissors to cut the pouch open rather than deal with the difficult cap.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2Q9XT0XKKGRQP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XKLCRAM#wasThisHelpful","R2Q9XT0XKKGRQP","A14E7LZASLSX36","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A14E7LZASLSX36?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There are a lot of benefits to adding hemp protein to your diet.  This is a complete protein, meaning it contains all of the amino acids, including the ones your body can't produce and can only obtain through diet.  Because it is organic, you know it is grown without pesticides.  In general, hemp is an easy plant to cultivate without genetic modification or heavy use of chemicals.I've been adding hemp protein powder to my breakfast smoothies.  It definitely makes the smoothies more filling.  I do find that a full serving of 4 tbsp of powder in a smoothie creates a somewhat gritty texture that takes getting used to, so if this bothers you, simply use less.  The flavor of the hemp powder is a bit nutty -- when used in a smoothie with cocoa powder, I feel like I am having a chocolate malt for breakfast.  I like that the hemp powder doesn't alter the taste of the smoothie in a way that makes me want to add some kind of sweetener.

"If you can handle the cost of The Honest Kitchen line of dog food, it is a high quality food.  The ingredient list is quite short and features human grade food products.  I like the concept of this food and my dog definitely likes the taste.  Rather than feed her only this rehydrated food, I mix some in with her kibble once a day.  She spends quite a bit of time licking the bowl clean long after the last visible speck of food is gone.  Fish and coconut seems like a strange combination, but it must appeal to canine taste buds!The appearance of Honest Kitchen dog food is not what you'd expect.

If you want to add this to your dog's diet but the price tag is intimidating, consider using it as an addition to kibble.

He didn't notice the adjustable waist at first and put a belt on, but said he likes the shorts and doesn't mind wearing them with a belt.As for appearance, these shorts look great.

"This is the second type of Nutro canned food I've given my dog.  She is enthusiastic about eating it and hasn't had any difficulties digesting it.  I mostly feed her kibble, but mix 1/3 can of wet food into the kibble once a day.  This food isn't so much chunks in gravy as it is chunks in congealed goo, but I'm not one to judge dog food by its appearance.  My dog doesn't care what it looks like, just how it tastes.  I don't care what it looks like, just how good it is for her.Tender Chicken and Rice recipe is actually a mix of chicken, chicken liver, turkey, and beef liver.  Most of the ingredients seem higher in quality than many other brands of dog food.  There are two things that stood out to me, however.  I would prefer a food with brown rice rather than white; white is more refined and less nutritious.  This food also contains wheat gluten.  While high in protein, wheat gluten isn't as biologically valuable as meat as a protein source.  As a dog food ingredient, it boosts the protein total but is less expensive than meat.  Finally, there aren't any probiotics in this food.  I'm not sure I'd feed this to my dog on its own, but I think it is a good additive to her high quality kibble.  Dog Food Adviser gives Nutro Large Breed Canned Food four stars, making it an above average dog food.I am glad I discovered Nutro wet food and will continue to supplement my dog's kibble with it.

"as student bibles go, I hate them. I detest them because they tend to dumb down the student.First, this is the CEB. I don't care much for the CEB, simply because I don't. It is an able translation and one ready to be used by modern English speakers, but not my favorite translation. For me, this is not a review about the CEB, but about the additional material found in the Student Bible.And that material is pretty solid. Based on actual scholarship, it presents scholarly discussions about such things as authorship and redaction. This is great because this is how we teach students to understand arguments against Scripture. Further, it takes various parts of Scripture as a way to launch into a discussion of, basically, what does this mean today? How does St. Paul's argument at Areopagus mean for us when combatting moral and religious relativism? What does it mean that the early Church held all property in common?Overall, the material is presented in a solid, easy to read format going beyond traditional student bibles. If you are a Christian ed director, if you have high school and college students, or if you have a young Christian who needs to know something more about Scripture and how it is seen by others, get this","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1EC8WFN12G1YS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1609261798#wasThisHelpful","R1EC8WFN12G1YS","A1O2QIQK2OR5TC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1O2QIQK2OR5TC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Have you ever noticed that when you need a meter, the space is usually small? Thankfully, Amprobe makes this meter to fit pretty small spaces. Not only that, but it's made to be held. That's right, you can actually hold this. It is lightweight but I had no issue holding it do the rubber fit. The sounds and backlights are great for actually hearing and seeing the readouts. The buttons are rather easy to operate, with no difficulty doing so in most tight spots and with minimal hand movement.

"This is our second (and maybe last?) auto-cleaning kitty litter box. This is our first from Arm and Hammer. The reason we are interested in these are selfish. We have 2 cats. We have 3 children. They take our time and frankly, cleaning out a litter box is the last thing I need to do after discussing the necessity of homework with my 11 year old for the 1123rd time.The set up is easy. I have found that it gives my cats enough time to use the litter box without running them away. I do have two cats, but they have worked out space issues long before we got this one. They get in there and go. Other uses are noting that the rake comes really fast, sometimes with the cat still in there. I have not yet experienced that. There is a timer, so you can just let it rake hourly. And yes, there is a manual rake. This is a improvement over the other brand.The smell is gone, as expected. Clean up is easy as well.What is really nice is that the motor is detachable. With the other brand, it is not  meaning I have purchased a box twice because the motor got fouled up. This one allows me to clean it, in case it does ever get attacked with wayward kitty litter.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ER94QWFX5NO6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012DSMRDE#wasThisHelpful","R1ER94QWFX5NO6","A1O2QIQK2OR5TC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1O2QIQK2OR5TC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I think most of us are getting tired of the space a two knob and spout faucet takes up. My bathroom is pretty small and I am always looking for ways to save space, even if that space is in sight only. So, something the Delta 564-MPU-DST fits the bill easily enough. Plus, the length of the spout is just right to fit into the middle of a small sink. The design meets ADA, by the way.The handle is easy to lift and doesn't require a lot of movement to get the water to flow.It is relatively easy to install. It really depends on your sink configuration, but if it is the normal bathroom sink, you should have no problem installing this one, even if removing the old one makes you say bad words. There is the Diamond Seal technology that should keep it sealed (which was one of the reasons driving the exchange  the old seal had simply ceased to exist).

"I am left to wonder, because of the proposed premise of this book, if we aren't left with a more hidden Jesus than before. The second half of the book makes the book worthwhile. It examines the Jesuses of different religions, including the Gnostic, Muslim and American (yes, I did call ""American"" a religion). In this, the authors (while presenting an evangelical outlook) tackle what Christianity would be if, say, the Mormon Jesus of Joseph Smith, was the dominant Jesus. This ""Jesus Outside the Bible"" should be expanded more, giving special attention to various other Jesus projects (including the Quest for the Historical Jesus and this book) and how such a Jesus may actually differ from the biblical accounts. In the end, however, this second half of the book is where the premise fulfills itself. If Rediscovering Jesus was only this second half, this book would merit five stars.But it isn't.Rather, the first half of the book leaves me troubled given their often over-Southern Baptist and too-simplistic outlook. The authors, David B. Capes, Rodney Reeves, and E. Randolph Richards, make it clear that they understand the New Testament presents a Jesus of many layers and that ""others reinterpret Jesus""  but they fail to see how they do so. For instance, they seem to think that had we only the Pauline Jesus (74-88) we would be missing Christian ethics and so on. I am left to wonder what sort of Marconite sheol this is, given that St. Paul (and Jesus before him) pulled directly from the Old Testament to form Christian ethics. Yes, the point must be made that the Jesus of Christian Tradition is in fact one built by the entire canon of the New Testament (and the Old), but it seems they have gone far  removing the role Tradition has played in not only laying the cake that is Jesus, but in providing the icing.The book is well written, suitable for small group study, with plenty of asides to further the conversation. However, it lacks in its ultimate premise. What biblical introduction to this? Scripture was never meant to be one book, which is why we have Mark spawning Matthew, and so on. The claim that Apostolic Succession would have been lost without Mark is a sad one, given that Apostolic Succession is one of the tools shaping the Canon. But Mark drew from Paul and required that the readers knew of Paul's writings. Is this really biblical, given that examination of a New Testament book is examined not with a critical eye, but a confessing (and an evangelical one at that?) eye? Is it really religious, when the only other comparative religious examination is between the Baptist seminary's view of the Christian Jesus and Gnosticism, Mormon, and Islamic? Why not the historical critical scholar's view of Jesus, the Catholic's view of Jesus, and the Unitarian?This book isn't a complete failure, but my initial excitement quickly faded. I hope that readers do not take the Jesus presented in the first half and suppose that this Jesus is the only layered Jesus for Christians.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1HJ6C0CVL28P9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0830824723#wasThisHelpful","R1HJ6C0CVL28P9","A1O2QIQK2OR5TC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1O2QIQK2OR5TC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Unfortunately, the BLU Studio C will not work with Verizon or Sprint (different system) but does work with AT&T and other services. Check and see if they require CDMA compatibility.

Unless you are a professional photographer, you may not need any more. I didn't. These resolutions produce great looking pictures. The editing software is great, although the aperture isn't what I'd like.The phone is pretty light, but not as thin as the iPhone 6. That means you can hold it without the fear of it slipping through your hands.The learning curve is easy. It is an Android and meant to be used right out of the box. I had no issue connecting it to the Google Play store and downloading my first few apps. The storage is expandable  unlike some of the higher end phones (cough iPhone cough).The one downside is that you cannot remove the battery.

It is a two piece, giving it an added way to distribute the force of dropping the phone, and forcing the silicon (the rubber bit) to stay securely on the phone.

"This is an entry-level oscilloscope. The cost should be a giveaway here. One of the better features I like about this one (over an older one I have) is the USB ports, allowing me to connect to my computer for data storage.

The learning curve is better than most so much so that I was able to let my son (11) figure out some easy measurements.It is a bit slower than some of your more pricey models, but not too terrible. Comparable to the higher priced models, unless you are looking for better interfaces (do you really need them) then this has all the bells and whistles you'll need.If you use an oscilloscope, then you know what they are for and what you are looking for.

"Where do our most pernicious myths begin? Is it something within us, or maybe within our time and place, giving birth to these evil narratives?Where did the Holocaust actually begin? Perhaps we can honestly say it began in late 12th century Norwich, England with the publication of an unfastidious genesis of the blood libel. After all, E.M. Rose, the author of The Murder of William of Norwich, notes that rather than having the blood libel (see her note on terminology, 24142) as a centuries old account only coming to life with a poorly sourced tale, the stories did not begin to take hold until the Early Modern period. And, as she recounts, in a 60-plus year time frame ending in 1935 (p11), there were more charges of blood libel than all the centuries before. Perhaps, then, we see the power of myth  the deep, dark power of words chosen only to inflict harm to a people  and the damage it has done. Rather than a history of the blood libel and damage it has caused, the story Rose so eloquently tells us is about the first audience, the first myth givers, and the cult of William of Norwich.Rose eloquently challenges long-held notions of the roles of Jews in Europe  and how Christians in England and on the continent treated them. Simply put, her historical narrative reveals a world quite unlike Brother Thomas Life and Passion (the first and only surviving account about the trial of William of Norwich) but one of  harmony usually accompanying Jews and Christians. So, how did we end up with a story permeating and fueling anti-Semitic tropes for the past 1000 years? How did we go from a well-knitted social fabric of allowing Jews and Christians to work together to the expulsion of Jews from England and the continued use of this horrendous myth to further subjugate the Jews, almost to the point of extension? As with all stories, there is no beginning ex nihilio .In the first several chapters (constituting Part 1), Rose slowly introduces us to the world of William of Norwich, the cult that sprang up after his death, and the larger world full of failed crusades and rampaging knights intent on eking out a sense of victory, even at the expense of whole peoples. We meet the genesis of the blood libel not as some historical fact  although there are plenty of historical myths and stories giving birth to this horror  but as a genius of a judicial strategy to save a knight from embarrassment, a king his allies, and England her financial due.Rather than having any real basis, the blood libel began as a way to end a trial, becoming quickly a tool to preserve the martyrdom of William (and the financial windfalls of a reliquary), the all but forgotten murdered boy at the center of the story in our mythmaking. Once the charge was made a charge never proved true and never properly investigated  it became alive, with new stories and tales popping up to build upon the case. Rose makes it clear that Brother Thomas, the first transporter of the tale, had no actual first hand information, but relies on, at best, a third-hand recounting. Simply put, the only real thing about the libel is the harm it has caused Jews and Jewish-Christian relationships in the intervening years. The presentation of the small, almost forgettable judicial strategy, makes one believe it was entirely possible to have never encountered the blood libel as a myth. It is, simply, a haphazard point of history, a minuscule argument  a statement so preposterous that we are left to wonder about the legal dullards who bought it. Surely, we moderns say, no one in a country that treated the Jews as well as England did, would believe such a thing.The Murder of William of Norwich reveals nothing tangible about the murder of said lad, but turns us upon ourselves, to reveal our history and fascination with convenient fiction.  Once the die had been cast, the cult of William exploded in Norwich, at the expense of the Jews. The same expense cast relics as prized positions  after all, the local dead boy had done well. He has suffered a violent and tragic death at a time when heroes were needed. His death saved a knight  a knight who was guilty of a murder of a Jew  and promoted Norwich as a seat of mystical miracles. Two deaths  William and Deulesalt  brought riches to Norwich, but at the expense of a thousand-year charge against the Jews of the blood libel. What was most likely a suicide (as Rose notes) became a martyr and what was a martyr became a cause. However, to Romes credit, William was never formally canonized. At least, I think, we can thank our God for that.The book is divided into 2 parts, 4 chapters between them. Part I ends with the elevation of the cult of William of Norwich in East Anglia. Part II takes us through the continuation of the cult by continental kings. There, the blood libel tale was expanded and applied to other youths, creating a mythos taking root in Europe that is still not completely burned out. As Rose points out, the great tragedy is that the death of a Christian individual was applied to the whole of the Jewish people rather than any individual person (237). While a relatively short book (240 pages), the breadth of scholarship is expansive. This is seen in the in-depth endnotes (nearly 100 pages) which includes more than citations. Rather, the endnotes must be read in part with the narrative of the book. They exist as something more than the usual academic footnotes, but more like an annotated bibliography. The storytelling by this first-time author is quite voluble, with the pen of a master narrator. The text is never boring, picking up new lines just when the old ones had run their course. A brilliant entry by this author, leaving us wanting a next book soon.E.M. Roses The Murder of William of Norwich: The Origins of the Blood Libel in Medieval Europe arrives at a time when we see the rise of anti-Semitism in Europe, labeling of whole people in the United States, and an uncertain world seeking someone or something to blame for the chaotic state of world affairs. Everything spoken seems to have a hyperbolic quality. We have forgotten the power of words and stories and how carefully we must choose to employ them for our defense. When the Bishop Turbe stepped into history to defend the depraved knight, he chose to play on the stereotypes of a people. I doubt Turbe believed it would go as far as it did, nor did he have a malicious intent. However, the road to hell, and such as that. Roses work reminds us that things dont just happen. Her intricate weaving of the social context around the death of William, the role of the initial charge, and the elevation of the cult, shows us that sometimes societies are ripe for evil.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R102H7N1ZQWCV1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0190219629#wasThisHelpful","R102H7N1ZQWCV1","A1O2QIQK2OR5TC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1O2QIQK2OR5TC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Rather than cutting the Scriptures up, in the mold of Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Katharine Bushnell stayed well within the principles of Christian hermeneutical tradition and developed a solid theological feminism. Her work deserves to be reread, something Kristen Kobes Du Mez makes not only possible but desirable.Kristin Kobes Du Mezs story of Katharine Bushnell work, Gods Word to Women, is part biography, part literary commentary, and part social commentary  and, completely, a challenge to men and women alike to discover what shapefreedom might take for the twenty-first century. What A New Gospel for Women (NGW) entails, however, is not a mere recounting of an often overlooked person from history, but a significant portion of the life of American feminism encapsulating corresponding stories of the Methodist people, foreign missions, womens suffrage, and what it is like to see fulfillment postponed. Indeed, for an account of events beginning in the 19th century, it reads like current events.I am not a student of feminism, although I have benefited from it. I do know the story of those considered the great pioneers, such as Elizabeth Cady Stanton  but likewise, I know the sad tale of how Christian theology was dispensed with, Scripture was brought low, and the movement suffered because of it. But, through these pages before me I am introduced to a woman who is a scholar, exegete, and theologian rivaling those of the great Antiochian and Alexandrian philosophers long before her. To be sure, by todays standards she is often a mixed bag. At first, Bushnell was an opponent of traditional Christianity (her own version was that of the holiness tradition), only to then become welcomed by even the most conservative interpreters. She was a feminist, but by todays standards  with her important take on birth control and abortion  I doubt she could maintain such a reputation. She was not a mere novel of history, a fortunate accident, but as Du Mez presents her, a truly quintessential prophet lobbying against entrenched power  both patriarchal and even imperial  and for the oppressed. Her life is the absolute fulfillment of Matthew 10.18.The first four chapters are biographical. We are given a well drawn out, never boring, and often times too short account of the life of Katharine Bushnell  and like any good disciplinary attendant, Du Mez gives us the surrounding picture as well. She crafts the narrative about Bushnell by giving us what is going on in the world around her. Bushnell only comes into focus, then, when we see the town of Evanston, the mission to China, the American society, the colleges for womens education, and the birthing of feminism in the late 19th century Victorian age. Du Mez, in these chapters, assemble the puzzle pieces that is Katharine Bushnell and presents a picture of a woman who very much deserves to be better known by people today  not as a historical figure, but as an ever-present reminder of the deep connection between Christianity and feminism, and, more importantly, what a deep exegetical review of our Holy Text may accomplish for those normally considered second-class.Du Mezs fifth and sixth chapters explore that exegetical review. In these chapters we are taken behind Gods Word to Women to see the processes that went into developing the exegesis  which includes something beyond understanding the context of the original page, but so too the context Bushnell lived in. She could see beyond the publication and understand the need of her would-be reviewers and readers to carefully craft, before they could issue their objections, the answers to the objections. In that, she does better than any theologians today. I am impressed with Du Mezs presentation here. Bushnell is presented as a calm and assured exegete of Christian scripture  one who upholds the conservative and orthodox position of Scripture, even to the point of inerrancy, while pushing interpretation into a progressive arena. My heart is quickened to think that this has been done and can be done in such a way as to give American Protestants space to appreciate the work (even if they disagree) and perhaps even accept the work. I am amazed at her craftsmanship, at her skill, at her passion. Bushnell, via Du Mez, holds together the tension of a high view of Scripture, the need to correct Tradition, and the refrain of holiness. I cannot comment on Bushnells work  that is not the point of the review  except to say that in many ways, her work precedes trends in historical criticism prevalent today. Indeed, in scanning my library I see several references to her work as a noted scholar.Du Mezs final two chapters bookend the book, bring Bushnells life to a close, setting it into a rather sad juxtaposition. On one hand, we have a woman who brought justice to both China and India via her tireless crusade against the regulation of vice, the production of a rather important work (Gods Word to Women), and the end of the Victorian Age. On the other, we have the beginning of the divide in American Protestantism, the beginning of World War I, and the emerging New Feminism. What falls through the cracks is an important step in Christian feminism, biblical exegesis, and a huge moment for American Protestantism. Bushnell could have shown us that we did not have to pick and choose between conservative and liberal, fundamentalism and relevancy, but could very well have endured with our faith in tact and an ear to science (and historical criticism). And what a world it may have been  had both sides not retreated away from the feminism Bushnell promised. This retreating is covered unbiased by Du Mez. Neither side wins  as both, conservatives and liberal, create their own repressive anti-feminist movements.As a white male United Methodist, a historical critic of Scripture, and a sometimes-theologian who presses others to examine Scripture in light of the context (both then and now)  and as one who cannot seem to fit into any specific category  Du Mezs A New Gospel for Women is a pinnacle of acceptance and understanding. I sit in awe of what Bushnell accomplished  beginning with the Methodist Episcopal Church  and mourn for what it could have been. Perhaps, as Du Mez points out, the resurgence we see in Christian feminism will again turn to Bushnell and her long overdue reward, as prophet, will finally be given. I cannot help but to recommend this book to every American Christian, especially those in the Wesleyan tradition, and those with a hope that through a high view of Scripture we can dismantle oppressive structures and rather than dispensing with everything around us, construct from the ashes a better system befitting our Christian Tradition.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R39FTAT6C49XWV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0190205644#wasThisHelpful","R39FTAT6C49XWV","A1O2QIQK2OR5TC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1O2QIQK2OR5TC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I don't know if it's just my household (family of 5, 3 of which are kiddos) but we can't keep up with a hand held manual pencil sharpener to save our lives. Every time we get one that works for more than 3 sharps it disappears. I'm pretty sure there's a black hole under my childrens' beds that these sorts of things go to die. However, this Bostitch QuietSharp Vertical Executive Pencil Sharpener saves us the after school mad dash to find the pencil sharpener for homework. It sits right on the desk near where the other after school supplies are and the kids can easily use it right there. It's mobile, but not mobile enough for them to lose it like the tiny handheld sharpeners!The little box holds a good amount of shavings before you have to empty it. I would lean toward saying it's better for home use rather than classroom use just because it would need to be emptied fairly often. It is in fact very quiet and it stops sharpening when your pencil is sharp rather than chewing the whole thing down to the eraser while your kid stares off into space. You know your kid does that too!Overall, I think this is a great electric sharpener for homework or small office needs.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3JKFQZJV37C03/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004FY6VSC#wasThisHelpful","R3JKFQZJV37C03","A1O2QIQK2OR5TC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1O2QIQK2OR5TC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Christopher W. Skinners latest work, Reading John, stands out as a bridge to a wider world of Johannine scholarship.At the beginning of my dissertation process, I had in mind the goal of rendering Gospel of John to a reduction of quotes, citations, allusions, and echoes of Deuteronomy. In doing my due diligence, I discovered the grandness of the Gospel of John cannot be measured by literary sources predating it or completely captured by later Christian theology. Rather, the Gospel of John still has many caveats for those adventurous spelunkers willing to risk calmness in reading and seek to better understand our Fourth Gospel.Christopher W. Skinnners recent contribution is not a grand commentary on the text, or a theological diatribe meant to sway one into reading John as if it contains fully developed Christian theology, but it is meant to be something a quite bit more substantial than an small group study book. Rather, Reading John is aimed at the student, new and old, capturing the current scholarship around the nascent Text that relies neither on Christian theology or the rest of the New Testament canon, but insists that it be understood on its own terms and merits. This doesnt mean Reading John is absent Christian theology or contributions from the study of the Synoptics, only that Reading John examines the Gospel of John as an independent work.Reading John is divided between 8 chapters, with chapters 1 and 8 serving as bookends to the intervening chapters that are focused on the Text itself. It is not a straightforward reading, as in chapter 7, Skinner returns to GJohns third chapter to finally explain the summation of the entire book  Skinner doesnt end John at chapter 21, but in John 3Open in Logos Bible Software (if available). In the meantime, Skinner examines the various theories of the composition of John, including the hypothesis of the two-level drama (chapter 3). Likewise, he explores the possibilities of an identity crisis in John  Jewish or anti-Jewish?  in chapter 4. (Skinner maintains hoi Ioudaioi  is used against the Jewish leaders rather than Jews.) In chapter 5, we read about the uniqueness of language of both Jesus and the narrator (such as the literary aside  Id like to have seen Skinner deal with John 12.33Open in Logos Bible Software (if available), a universally important aside) while in chapter 6, Skinner invites us to explore the rhetoric of GJohn and why people simply do not understand. Along the way, he includes small details that are often left out of books this size  such as literary connections in John and those hidden clues that the narrator is actually writing for the audience to understand (such as the connection between Peter and Judas). Through it all, we are given our own asides via space-saving charts and sidebars, that insure we get our authors point in minute detail. Accompanying each chapter is a plethora of bibliographical notes and sources, containing a wide-ranging view on Johannine scholarship. Skinner does not simply stick to one school of thought, but is quick to bring in various (sometimes countering) viewpoints to give a fuller picture.Skinner does not leave the theology behind, but does not insist that it is the same as later Christian theology. Rather, what you see is the beginning (and I believe a natural trajectory) of a theological strain that leads to current Christian theology; however, that may be my reading of it rather than Skinners intent. Regardless, what is everpresent is sound scholarship, an easy reasoning, and a needed approach to the Gospel of John informing the reader of current academic approaches without a complete deconstruction of the readers cognitive environment.I am always concerned with a book this size (a mere 145 pages)  that a reader will simply not get enough information for it to matter. I am happy to have had my concerns alleviated. While only 145 pages, Reading John is efficacious in dealing with the material at hand, without straying down rabbit-holes or leaving us wondering if there may be more.  Skinner writes with a scholars pen, and a classical pedagogues finesse, delivering to his students (that would be us) a well-lit door into the study of the Gospel of John.Dr. Christopher W. Skinner blogs here, where you will find his engagement with scholars and the wider-world.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2VM0OSHXAVM4Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=161097803X#wasThisHelpful","R2VM0OSHXAVM4Z","A1O2QIQK2OR5TC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1O2QIQK2OR5TC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It lights up fine. Except...There is no real switch. If you turn it over, it comes on/goes off. This means if the child is using it at night, and somehow it shifts, it may come one in the middle of the night or go off. The light turns off automatically, but that doesn't mean that a move during the middle of the night will not turn it back on.Overall, very happy with the brightness (bright enough to keep the monsters away, dim enough to allow sleep) and the durability.

"This 3M Privacy Screen protector works fabulously for providing privacy while you are on your iPhone 6. It reduces glare and keeps your nosy co-workers from catching a peek of what you're doing when they're sitting next to you. The screen protector prevents scratches and smudges. It's super easy to apply and comes with easy to understand instructions. The protector doesn't interfere with phone cases and is easily replaceable if the need arises. The only cons to this product are 1. the protector isn't slick to begin with so your finger doesn't swipe as easily as it could. Not a huge deal in my opinion. and 2. Fingerprints do show up easily but that's just the nature of phone screens.

It lifts them up a bit so they aren't flailing about screaming and they can actually enjoy their first tummy times with glowing lights and music. He loves looking in the little mirror and the linkable toys are so fun, and you can move them around and add more favorites if need be. The soft overhead arches are great for baby to practice reaching for items and exploring. Plus, they make for super easy portability.

"yes, this is a vine product but my wife and I were looking at getting my son (soon to be 6th grade) a phone for school. Yet, he is my son. He breaks things on accident. I do not want to get him an expensive phone. Plus, I don't want to pay a contract yet for a phone he'll only use in emergencies.This phone does that and more. It is UNLOCKED. I have used it with my carrier and it was easy set-up. It is Android and so I've connected with the Google Play store and with Amazon.

The screen is bright, with a solid resolution. He has watched a few things on it already. No complaints there.It looks, at least from a distance, like the iPhone 6, which makes it an easy sell to image conscious kids. I'm okay with that, for now.This is one the best bets on the market.

"This La Cuisine Cast Iron Casserole dish is such a nice cookware item. Let's start with how it looks. It's a deep red/black on the outside and the inside is cream. It's made of heavy cast iron and will last for many, many years with the proper care. It really is a beautiful casserole! Aside from looks, it cleans up nicely after it's used and cooks evenly, even on my electric glass cooktop! We made layered Enchilada Casserole by first sauteing vegetables, then beef. It all cooked beautifully without sticking. Then we strained that out and added all of the layers, lots of cheese, then popped it in the oven for 30 minutes. Very little of the cheese stuck to the pot, and the the little that did came off easily with a soft sponge and mild dish detergent.This cast iron casserole is certainly pricey.

I had rather hoped watertight was a given with this, but it is not. I guess, on the other hand, it is better to be secure in knowing it is was watertight at least once.3. the sound quality is greatly diminished. It feels like someone is talking from inside a tin can. It vibrates on the back. the speaker phone has a reverb in it.The pros:1. it is watertight. I go to the beach at least once a summer as well as to my local lake.

I feel pretty good about it.2. the case is smaller than the otterbox and a better fit for the hand.

"This Honeywell 50-Pint Portable Dehumidifier is an excellent product! It plugs into an outlet right out of the box and is ready to go. The directions for operation are simple and direct. All you do is remove some paper/foam and press power. There are two settings, high or low. You can change the percentage of humidity you want your space to have and it tells you the temperature of your space. There is also a triangle button that lights up one the dehumidifier is full and needs to be emptied. The fill drawer pops out super easily and has a handle for ease of carrying and emptying the water. Another feature I really like is that there is a timer to set for power on and off. This is great for energy efficiency! If the bucket gets full the light flashes and the dehumidifier shuts off. Perfect!This machine works great in our 1,750 square foot house. Our downstairs space would get super damp, especially with rain in the Spring but not anymore. This dehumidifier runs fairly quietly. I would say it's slighter louder than a dishwasher running but quieter than a 110 window air conditioning unit.

"I'm an iOS guy, I canna lie. I like big screens. You android uses cannot deny, that when I bring my ipad in with its not so-itty-bitty screen you get a bit jealous.But, with that said, Android does have its benefits and I think the BLU touchbook captures most if not all of them. At this point, the first thing one should look for is durability. No one wants to spend even $160 on something that is likely to bend or break easily. This device is durable, sturdy, and of a good weight so that it will not go flying out of your hand. It is rigid, a good size for the hand, and with the proper case should last at least $160 worth of time.It is unlocked, which means you can put it on different networks. I have Sprint, but I allowed someone who knows what they are doing to use it on a different network by simply placing in their SIM card. It picked up the 'net and away we went. Granted, I also have a wifi network so we used that for our downloads. The reception is pretty good as well. I'd say at least as good as your normal android cell phone.The memory is expandable to 64gb via a card. If you are  regular Android user, you know you can store your apps there instead of on the device. (I'm look at you iOS). I found no problems with the card or card reader or moving the apps back and forth. You'd better. Original space is pretty small without the card.The camera is not the best. I'm not sure really why cameras are needed on these lower-end tablets anyway, but I guess if you are out in the woods and a UFO stops to ask directions, you may want to quickly snap a picture. It'll work, but if you want high quality shots of Spock's nose, you will need to use a better digital camera.The screen resolution is really good for this sort of tablet. I've watched Netflix and an HD movie without no real problems. The sound is a bit low, but that could just be me. The apps play nicely, with panning on both smooth.Android is versatile. I have no need to review that.But, if you are looking for a high quality, low cost tablet for the Android, this will do what you want and give you a sense of heavy duty quality","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1923N9AHL20L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SZEFDPU#wasThisHelpful","R1923N9AHL20L","A1O2QIQK2OR5TC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1O2QIQK2OR5TC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Snow and sun, rain and snow, snow and snow and snow and why did I move from Louisiana? And I like to cook out.

I can feel safe that I can leave it out to brave the stupid weather conditions without destroying my grill.The material seems solid and weather resistant. Not proof, but resistant.

"This LAX iPhone6 Slim and Protective case is better than I expected it to be. The lip that goes over the front of the phone to protect it from getting scratched or cracked works well without being super bulky. This case is average in protection, I'm not super comfortable with the idea of being able to drop my phone while in this case and it still not get cracked. But, if you don't have 3 kids and crazy pets, and a clumsy gene, this phone case would probably be enough protection for you. I chose the gold design and it is really classy, I love the look of it. The rubber sides of the case allow you to have a better grip on the phone, which prevents accidents from happening. When you put the phone in your pocket it is a litter harder to pull out because of the rubber grips, but I prefer that. Overall, a great case for average phone protection with a very low price.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R7JRLU6LJSFKX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RH0IXDC#wasThisHelpful","R7JRLU6LJSFKX","A1O2QIQK2OR5TC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1O2QIQK2OR5TC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've had a laser printer for a while, which I love for most of my printing needs. I have wanted a new ink jet printer for a while for good photo printing at home (from both my computer and my phone). I also like the wireless option because I can put it anywhere in the house and not be tied down to a location.I had the opportunity to try out both this one the MG7720 and the MG6820. Of the 2, the MG7720 was my preferred printer, but only for a few small things that are worth the extra money to me.The out-of-the-box experience is pretty simple. Setup is easy--just take out a few of the packing materials (tape, fillers, etc.), turn it on, and put in the ink cartridges. I started out setting it up sans computer and only used my phone (Android). It was a simple process (the only real work was downloading the app to my phone). I setup the wireless manually and had no initial issues. I was able to easily print from the app to the printer and the photos came out a nice quality.Canon claims you can easily print from Facebook or Instagram, but I could not figure it out for the life of me. There is no mention of how to do it in the manual and there is no way for me to print from either of the apps on my phone. The Canon app does not have any link to print from the apps, either. Thinking maybe it was an Android issue, I tried it on my husband's phone, but still had no luck.As far as the wi-fi connection goes, I had some issues. For some reason when I tried to set it up to google print, the wi-fi would not work. I would keep re-entering the password and it would say connected, but it would not connect to google (I also did a firmware update and had the same issue). I finally had to hardwire it in with the Ethernet cable to get it to stay connected to the network. Not ideal by any means.It also defaults to turn off after 240 minutes (eco saving), so if you go to print something when it hasn't been on in a while, you have to manually turn it back on. I tend to print from other rooms and then go pick up my print out. I did change the settings for this, but it was annoying to not know this was the default setting.I did finally set up the printer and software on my computer. I find the ""My Image Garden"" software to be a memory hog and hard to navigate a bit. I tried out printing on a CD and then when I finished the window would not close. I do not foresee myself using this software much in the future.What I like about the MG7720 over the MG6820 is that it has dedicated paper trays for both plain paper and photo paper. No switching back and forth between papers. While I probably won't use the NFC option very often, it is nice to be able to just hold my phone up next to the printer and have it print. The output tray automatically opens when you print, so no worries about needing to open the tray to print or it jamming up because it is closed (the MG6820 does not do this).Overall, it has a nice print quality, but I was frustrated getting it to setup wirelessly on my network. It also does not seem to be able to print so easily from all the phone apps like it claims it will do.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZNVP3KZTD49A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013C0ZY3C#wasThisHelpful","RZNVP3KZTD49A","A2KFWHHUFVKFXZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KFWHHUFVKFXZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have 3 kids all under the recommended age of 6 for this toy. My oldest is 4 and has played with one of these spinner toys before. The 2 littler ones (almost 3) got to try this one out with plenty of supervision. All 3 love playing with this and creating art. We had no mess, but I helped them out quite a bit. We all did get pain on our hands that didn't come off with one (or some even 2) hand washing. We did not use the glitter because when my son used it in the past, it made a huge mess.What I don't like about this is that the ""splatter screen"" is just a piece of plastic that looks like packaging. It even has to have a sticker on it that says ""splatter screen do not throw away."" If it has to have a sticker to keep you from tossing it out, then it is cheap. It also only has spots for 3 paints, but it comes with 5, so two are left sitting out all the time.While this is a whole lot of fun for the kids, I think that it lacks in a couple of areas that would make a huge improvement.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R16705LQNAWF6M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RHGG1IK#wasThisHelpful","R16705LQNAWF6M","A2KFWHHUFVKFXZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KFWHHUFVKFXZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a nice mattress that is nice and thick and a little firm. I got it for a bunk bed, so no box springs are needed. I opened it and it expanded quickly with little to no odor. I let it sit for about 48 hours before putting it on the bed to make sure that it was fully expanded. Make sure to put it on a flat surface, because I did notice that it curved a bit in the direction of the packing fold after 24 hours (I had it on top of some pillows that were laying around).I have bought a couple other mattresses that ship this same way. I find it pretty cool how much spring mattresses can actually be shrunk down for shipping. The others Signature Sleep  Contour 8 Inch Twin Mattress and Signature Sleep Contour 8-Inch Mattress, Queen both had a slight smell to them during the airing out/expanding process, but they are both a little better mattresses. The Furinno only has padding on one side, so if you flip it over, then the coils are really rough and easily felt unless you have a pad on top of the mattress.Overall, this is a good mattress, not my favorite, but a good one that is comfortable for my kids.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RAXFRX90MZLKJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NI1O4JQ#wasThisHelpful","RAXFRX90MZLKJ","A2KFWHHUFVKFXZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KFWHHUFVKFXZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have 3 preschool aged kids and have tried lots of different water bottles. This one has a very cute print on it (my boys love Bob the Builder), but that is about the only good thing about this thing. The core has a cheap plastic cover to keep the liquid in, but when I got the bottle the liquid had drained all out and filled the bottom of the cup. The pinhole opening could be filled with water and frozen, but it would be a pain to fill. It also doesn't easily fit into the bottle. Seriously, you would be better off to fill it with ice water to keep the water cold for a while. The cap screws on and off and can easily be lost by kids (especially ones the right age to be Bob fans). The little blue caps for the strap fell off on arrival as well. The water dribbles out, which may be good so the kids don't spill the water, but it frustrates mine who want it faster.This is a cute cup, but is not worth purchasing.

"I have quite a few z-wave items in my home and got this and another brand dimmer at the same time (2gig WD500Z-1 Z-Wave Wall Dimmer (White)). Both installed pretty much to same with no issues. I had no problems connecing them up to my system (Nexia bridge) although I couldn't seem to find the instructions on the Leviton on how to connect it to the z-wave system (I might have just missed it, but I did figure it out on my own). They were both installed on switches with LED light fixtures.I actually prefer the other dimmer to this one. I don't really care for the dimmer buttons on the top of this one. I had a regular non-z-wave dimmer in before that had the buttons down the side which was preferable. I find the buttons across the top to be difficult to press and uncomfortable on my fingers. The only good things is that I put this in my daughter's room and it is difficult for her to change the settings (she likes to sleep with the light on full bright and I am trying to drop it down to be more like a night light). This one basically has 1 on/off button and the dimmer. The other has 2 buttons (top and bottom) and dims or brightens when you hold down one of the buttons.Oh, and the cost on this one is quite a bit more than the other.Overall, I think the switch works well and is a good addition to a z-wave system.

"I picked this printer mainly to print directly from my phone. I take quite a few pictures with my phone and I like to print some of them to give to the grandparents. I don't usually want the big prints and if I do, I just get those from Costco or another local printer.Getting the printer started up was simple and straightforward. If you want to plug it into your computer or camera or connect an SD card, then you are good to go. I thought it would be simple to print from your phone, but I found it to be a little more complicated. The quick start guide sends you to the user manual, which basically tells you a couple of steps to get the printer to print instructions for what to do next (it gives you an activation code that is good for 60 min). Make sure you have some plain paper on hand (I just folded a sheet in half to get it to fit) because you will need to print a couple of sheets out. You will need to go online to activate the printer and it will set up an email address for the printer for you to send pictures to easy to print and I had no problems. You do need to connect the printer up to the wi-fi to be able to set all this up. There is an option to direct print if you are on the go where you can connect your phone directly to the wi-fi of the printer. You will still need the app to print anything, though. (Note: I have an Android phone.)The pictures are typical Epson quality--beautiful and vibrant. It prints quickly and you can choose to have a border or go borderless. For the most part, I don't find this to be quite cost effective if you are printing lots of pictures. I will still order them from places like Costco or shutterfly (who gives away 100 free prints quite often) for large quantities. For an immediate need to print out photos, I really like this option. This is great for giving out photos on-the-spot.

"We use humidifiers a lot in our house. We live in the high desert and it is dry here almost year round (we should have wet winters, but we haven't in recent years). With 3 kids in preschool, we also have lots of colds that run through the house. We have most the ultrasonic (no filter) humidifiers that put out a fine mist into the air. Anything right around the humidifier is usually pretty wet overnight.Even though I am not a huge fan of filters in humidifiers because of the mold issue, I have to say that I really like this one. The filter doesn't just sit in the water reservoir--only a small amount of the water gets to the filter and then the water evaporates into the air. There is no mist, so nothing around it gets wet.I used this in my daughter's room and it last for 2 full nights on one tank of water--one night on high and one on low. I also used the menthol scent pad with it. The smell was strong at first, but after a night was less noticeable, but still there.This is a very nice humidifier that works well in our house. I'm not a fan of the need to upkeep with new filters (around $10 each) and if you want the scent pads they can get a little expensive (I think they want you to replace them daily, but the scent does last longer). I do like that it doesn't get things soaking wet around it, but does increase humidity in the room.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2OI5UIGL0L91L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01410YUH8#wasThisHelpful","R2OI5UIGL0L91L","A2KFWHHUFVKFXZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KFWHHUFVKFXZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We love LeapFrog items in our house. I have 3 preschool aged children and they all love technology. I'm not a fan of giving them an iPad--not only are they rough on them, but they also always end up in the ""in app purchase"" of each game they have which frustrates them (and me). They each have LeapPads (LP1, LP3, LPPlatinum) and I love that all the games are age appropriate and there are no extra purchases for them. My biggest problem with them was the lack of ability to play outside videos or games. I have a lot of videos for the kids, but there was no way to play those on the LP and I would have had to purchase them from the LF store to get videos for them. So, I ended up purchasing cheapo tablets for the kids to play on and watch videos for long trips (and yes, one already has a screen that is partially broken).Enter the LeapFrog Epic! It is the best of both worlds! It has a number of the same LeapFrog games we already purchased that work on it (not all of them do) and I can download other apps from the Amazon app store including apps to play their videos we already own. Now, getting the Amazon app store on the tablet was not difficult, but finding the instructions were not easy. I had to hunt them down on the LF Epic help pages. You go through the parental controls, device info, app store, other, and install the Amazon app store. Then you can download any apps you may have already purchased through them or purchase more. I already had our kids' favorite Monkey Preschool, so that got installed and my son was very happy.I do not have any other kid-specific tablets to compare this to, so I can only do the comparison with the LeapPads. I'm overjoyed with the marriage of the LeapPad with a tablet so far. My kids have already dropped this thing a couple of times and it has no issues. I love the LeapFrog durability. I love that everything can be kid appropriate and that parents have lots of control over what apps they can and cannot use (each app can be designated to all or some of the users). No more cartridges, which we rarely use anyway since we use the games on all of the LPs we own.I will be looking at getting a couple more of these for my younger kids at a little later date since we already have the LeapPads. I foresee this lasting longer than the LeapPads since more outside content can be added.As for purchases LF apps and their cost--I always recommend purchasing gift cards discounted (Amazon has them LeapFrog Digital Download Card and they area almost always discounted at about 30-40%) and then waiting for sales on the apps. They can all be purchased for pretty reasonable prices then.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1W4LLN0FHKJTQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010NMTJA6#wasThisHelpful","R1W4LLN0FHKJTQ","A2KFWHHUFVKFXZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KFWHHUFVKFXZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've read a few of Kristan Higgins books and really enjoyed them because they are witty and fun with happy endings. If you have read her other books, this is NOTHING like them. This is women's fiction and not so witty and fun. It is a deeper look into relationships and more specifically, failed  or failing relationships. Things are not always as they seem on the outside.I picked the exact wrong time to read this book. My husband was sick on hospice when I began reading it and I finished it after he had died and the memorial was over and done and I was on my own. The feelings of sadness and heartache throughout the book were hard for me to read. I struggled to finish it because I was (am) hurting too much over the loss of my husband. Reading about heartbreak was not easy--even if it is did not fit into the mold of my own life. I am so glad that I did finish the book, though. It leads the reader through the path of life and leaves you with hope.A very good crossover for Kristan Higgins from romance to women's fiction. Not my favorite genre, but one I do read occasionally for something like this one.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3E3E123OE37RJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=037378497X#wasThisHelpful","R3E3E123OE37RJ","A2KFWHHUFVKFXZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KFWHHUFVKFXZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

It is really cute and a nice size. It fits all 3 of my kids (average sized 4-year-old and 2.5-year-old twins) sitting in it and climbing in and out.I would give this 3.5 stars if I could, but I am rounding it up to 4 stars because it is cute and fun. It gets deductions because the 50 balls that it comes with are not even close to enough. It doesn't even come close to covering the bottom of the train. I added 200 more balls and that would good. Then the problem because the huge hole in the back of the train. The kids kick the balls around and they all go flying out the back.

"I have a 4-year-old and 2.5-year-old twins. They all like trains and superheros and my oldest loves Batman, so this is right up their alley. Unfortunately, I was disappointed. There really isn't much track--it is just a small oval (my oldest said that he wished it were longer). The trains are nice a big, but the trains and cars don't link together and stay together--they are just ""open hooks"" and if the kids pick them up, then they come apart. My 2.5-year-old boy was screaming at me over and over to put them back together because he likes playing with them away from the track. It was a huge frustration to me.The kids like carrying the trains around and playing with them around the house, but the track is too small and they don't really like it.

"My kids love cars and the 4-year-old has really gotten crazy about Hot Wheels lately. When I opened the box with this in it, he was so excited that it was Hot Wheels (he can't quite read, but he knows his logos). I have 3 kids, so it is perfect that this comes with 3 monster trucks...each kid was able to get their own without any fighting.Putting it together is fairly easy, but I find that the dragon is difficult to keep in place. The tail and head both come off way to easily. But, to get the truck to fly up the ramp and through the dragon's mouth, it takes a lot of force. I had a really hard time getting it moving enough to get it caught in the mouth. My 4-year-old was really slamming on the thing and had a hard time. So, the execution of the toy isn't perfect.Overall, my kids had a lot of fun with it. My almost 3-year-old twins had a hard time with it and were bugging my 4-year-old who did really well with it. I wouldn't recommend this for younger kids unless they are good about not tearing things apart (mine love to take things apart and figure out how they work).

It appears to be much larger than its capacity because it is thickly lined and well insulated. I did a quick test on it with hot water and not only was it leakproof, but it stayed hot even though I opened it every so often to check on it. So, after 3-4 hours it was still hot even after being opened at least 3 times.This is going to be perfect for going to potlucks since my food always seems to be cold when I get there.

"My nearly 13-year-old pug has a thing about peeing on the carpet. We moved into our house a year ago and he picked a spot a marks it every day no matter what we do to clean it up. We've cleaned up multiple times and practically before the carpet is dry he has peed on it again. Our house smells like a zoo when you walk in because he happened to pick a spot in the entryway.I've had a lot of people in and out of the house recently and I have been so frustrated with the smell, so I decided to give this a try. We cleaned up the carpet and first, it doesn't smell bad or too strong at all. Second, it did a great job getting out the dog stains. The house smelled so much better right away. And most important, more than 24 hours later and the dog hasn't peed on the floor again! My house doesn't smell like a zoo.So far I am totally sold on this carpet cleaner.

"I'm not a big diet soda drinker because I'm not a fan of the aftertaste and I don't like artificial sweeteners. I do try the less sugar versions (like Coke Zero) and am interested in finding a better alternative. I do really like Ginger Ale mostly because I like the strong ""bite"" that it gives you. I grew up on Vernors (I went to high school in the same city as the plant) and have never found anything better.I thought I would give this a try since it is more ""natural"" and I like ginger ale. It really didn't do much for me. It doesn't have any bite and more or less tastes like a lemon-lime soda. Ginger is not even listed as an ingredient (there are ""natural flavors,"" but I would think ginger would be listed if it were actually in it).

"My daughter was in need of a new chest of drawers, so this will be a nice addition to her room.It arrived packed very compactly in a heavy box that I just used our dolly to move into the house because it was too heavy for me to lift alone to move even just the 4-5 feet into the house.My mom and I did the assembly as a team. I tried to get started on my own and was able to get through some things without help, but it is necessary to have someone hold a few of the pieces to be able to screw them in more easily. It took us a little over an hour to put it together and I did get out the drill to get the drawers together because hand screwing in the screws was not working for me. Putting the sides and the back of the drawers together was the most difficult part for me because the holes didn't quite line up. I also didn't use the nails provided to nail down the drawer bottoms because the nails were too large and I couldn't get them straight enough so they went through the sides of the particle board. We always have plenty of small finishing nails on hand, so I found smaller ones that worked just fine.Once finished, this is a very nice looking chest of drawers. The simple hardware is pretty and classy looking. The quality is decent, though not high end since it is particle board. It feels very sturdy and is pretty darn heavy. Good quality for a reasonable price.

"This Bose machine has a beautiful design and the sound quality is excellent just as expected from Bose. I like that there are no visible buttons and just a tap to the top of the machine will turn it on. It was simple to set up the time and has nice reception for the radio.This is ""old school"" style. No bluetooth, no wi-fi, no USB. You can play the radio or a CD. There is an AUX connection, so it is possible to hook up your phone using an aux cable. No bluetooth does tie you down to the machine, though. You have a couple of different options. You can either upgrade to the next model for an extra $100 Bose Wave SoundTouch music system IV - Platinum Silver and it includes both bluetooth and wi-fi. Or you can purchase a bluetooth receiver to attach to the aux port. I opted to purchase a bluetooth receiver (Mpow Streambot 2-In-1 Wireless Bluetooth Audio Music Streaming Switchable Transmitter and Receiver With 3.5mm Stereo Output - Connect Your PC, iPhone, iPod, iPad, Tablets Or MP3 Player To Speakers And Entertainment Systems, Home Or Car) that works great. I can stream my Amazon Prime music and it sounds excellent.

"My father-in-law is a former garage door opener installer, so I asked his professional opinion of the Ultra-quiet operation before selecting this model (he doesn't care about the wi-fi option, but I'm automating most of the house operations). He loves how quiet and smooth these work, so I was excited to get this one. Our older model garage door opener is a chain model and loud thus wakes the kids from their naps. I enlisted my father-in-law's help (okay, he did it all) to install the opener and he said it was an average installation that didn't take more than an hour. I did the wi-fi installation and it took me about 3 minutes to get it all set up (you need to push buttons on the opener, so don't put your ladder away before finishing setting up the wi-fi).I love, love, love how quiet this thing is!!!  I can open or close the garage door and not even hear it when in the house just one room away. If I am upstairs directly above the garage, I can hear a hum, but it is not loud at all--the old one practically shook the upstairs. I went into my son's bedroom and could barely hear anything, so the garage door isn't going to wake him anymore! Woo-hoo! The app tells me how long the garage has been open or closed, so no more worrying about if the door is left open or not.One big thing to note that is on the box, but not on the description page...if your garage door is more than 7ft, you will need the extension kit. Chamberlain 8808CB 8-Feet Belt Drive Extension Kit.

"I don't like to be hot. I also have central air in my house, but the thermostat is in a ""cool"" spot and it doesn't reflect the room temperature in my bedroom. I wanted a way to keep my bedroom cool without running the a/c for the whole house when my room is the only one that ""needs"" it. We also have a large playroom for the kids that tends to be warmer than the other rooms because it gets all the afternoon sun and heats up easily. I wanted the ability to cool off either my bedroom or the playroom without running the a/c on the whole house and over cooling some of the other rooms. And we arrive at the portable a/c...First thing, this unit is fairly large and heavy. Getting it out of the box is pretty easy, though, since the top of the box lifts off the bottom and leaves you with the unit sitting on strong piece of heavyweight cardboard. Once you get it moved to the floor you want it on (we moved it upstairs), then it is a breeze to move around because of the wheels on the bottom. Even being heavy, it moves easily.Next up, installation. The instructions say that it takes 5 minutes. Well, not so for me. We have side opening windows, so it seems like it should be easy. The problem is that our windows are longer than the provided insert with one extension. Adding the second extension piece put the vent up higher and makes it difficult to get to. Even with it installed completely, there is a small gap between the insert and the window (because the extension goes inside the main piece making it so it is not the same width, so a little extra insulation is necessary for a seal. I ended up using one extension and filling in the extra space on the top with a temporary fix of cardboard. This makes moving the unit from room to room a bit more difficult since the included window blocker cannot be moved if I need to add insulation to seal the window closed.So, does it work? Yes, yes it does. My room can be kept at a comfortable 68 when the rest of the house is 10 warmer. I can't say that the temp sensor on the unit is perfect because my room temp sensor is off by a degree or two, but it is close enough that it is still comfortable. It is loud even on the lowest fan speed, which is normal for an a/c unit. From my use, the fan cannot be turned off if you want the a/c to run. So, it is always loud. Overall, I am happy with the unit. It won't be as easy to move around as I would like, but it does keep me a lot more comfortable in the heat (and it worked great as the day after I got it installed the temps went into the 90s). If you can't use a window a/c unit or want to be able to put one away when not needed, this is a great unit.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1S4QBHGI8NUQE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0085SKGEO#wasThisHelpful","R1S4QBHGI8NUQE","A2KFWHHUFVKFXZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KFWHHUFVKFXZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I've had upright vacuums for a while since I like them a bit better most of the time and I had a single story house, so I didn't need to worry about vacuuming stairs or getting a vacuum up and down stairs. Well, a year ago I moved into a 2-story house with carpeted stairs. Needless to say, the stairs have been neglected quite a bit and gotten a bit dirty. I've been trying to find either a good handheld vac or a canister vac to get the stairs better.The Jetforce canister works wonderfully! It is light and easy to maneuver around and it has a strong suction. I was able to vacuum the stairs easily and they were finally clean after a year of 3 kids going up and down dropping all kinds of crumbs. The canister will hold a lot of dirt and dog fuzz (we have a fuzzy pug that sheds a lot). It is easy to empty out as well.My mom is a bit of a vacuum expert (okay, just a housewife that vacuums on a daily basis and has for nearly 50 years) and loves canister vacuums.

He put it together downstairs and when he was done took it upstairs to the playroom after removing the long race track, so it can be moved around pretty easy (as long as it isn't filled with cars).This is a great gift for any kid who loves cars. Perfect for Christmas morning.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R28PSSJMIF54CP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00T03TR1Q#wasThisHelpful","R28PSSJMIF54CP","A2KFWHHUFVKFXZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KFWHHUFVKFXZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"While I have had Brenda Novak books on my TBR list for a while, I've never actually read one until now. The book description was just enough to pique my interest and get me to read the book. A well written description is important and this one did its job. It was also backed by a very good book.Maisey returns home to Fairham Island to help her brother and his messed up life as well as try to heal her broken life. In her path she meets Rafe who finds a way to reach her soul. Maisey also needs to work through her strained relationship with her mother while trying to figure out how to help her brother. Maisey is a very well developed character that grows throughout the book.The story moves along at a nice and steady pace that was enough to keep me interested and reading every chance I had. While I cannot say the end was a shock, it wasn't totally expected either. There was just enough mystery that developed well.I look forward to reading more Brenda Novak books in the future.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2FS11VGUA2HG1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0778317803#wasThisHelpful","R2FS11VGUA2HG1","A2KFWHHUFVKFXZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KFWHHUFVKFXZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am an Android girl. I have had Android phones for 3 years and nearly switched to an iPhone last year, but couldn't bring myself to do it. I am so glad that I didn't switch. I have an iPad (bought for me as a gift--an original mini) and it frustrates me to no end because it doesn't have enough memory with each iOS update. I have never been able to justify buying one for myself since they are so expensive and have no expandability. I've wanted an Android tablet, but didn't know which one to get, but when I was given the opportunity to review this one, I jumped at it. I have had ASUS products in the past (I had a netbook years ago) and liked the quality.What I use my tablet for most of the time: surfing the web, email, and watching videos on Netflix, Plex, Tablo, or Amazon. I also want to watch videos on-the-go so I need plenty of storage space. I will also stream music through my phone or tablet to Bluetooth speakers.I've been using this tablet for over a week and am very happy with it so far. It is thin, light, has a bright screen, is fast, and sets up just like my phone. I downloaded all my apps--like Netflix, Amazon photos, Amazon music, Tablo, and more. It runs fast and has a beautiful screen. Videos look great as the screen is clear and bright. I was disappointed at first because Netflix kept hanging and splitting the screen...I wondered if it was the app or the tablet. Turns out it was the tablet because the split screen continued outside of the app (once I was able to get out of it which didn't happen every time Netflix failed). I had to do a system update which fixed the issue. I haven't had any issues with Netflix or any of the other apps.My one complaint about the tablet is the battery life. It just doesn't seem to hold up as well as I expected. It isn't terrible, but it does seem to drain quicker than my iPad. I need to charge it on a daily basis with any use where the iPad can go at least 2-3 days without charging.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1RMY3B8TFU8J6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012UEUQM0#wasThisHelpful","R1RMY3B8TFU8J6","A2KFWHHUFVKFXZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KFWHHUFVKFXZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"With the introduction of the LeapPad Platinum, LeapFrog also introduced new games with Imagicards. The player needs to take pictures of the cards during the game to continue. I got this game for my 4-year-old who loves Ninja Turtles. He loves the game and had a lot of fun playing it. He did need a little help figuring out how to get a picture of the card, but played independently for the most part. Taking pictures of the cards is fairly easy as all you need to do is get the card fully in the screen and the game will recognize the card. We even had pretty low light and it worked.My only problem with the Imagicard games (not even this one in particular) is that it is difficult to take them on the go. You need a surface to put the cards on to be able to get a good shot of the card. Also, I am concerned about losing a card and then not being able to play the game properly.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R30R7B8E61XM13/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WJ1P4TA#wasThisHelpful","R30R7B8E61XM13","A2KFWHHUFVKFXZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KFWHHUFVKFXZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"We have been using the older version of this bottle (the Striker) that was good, but could be frustrating with the straw mostly (it would come loose or it detached and would go missing). The Gizmo is a big upgrade from the older bottle. The inside straw is plastic and a solid piece (you can disconnect it to wash) that is on a angle so that when my son tips the bottle toward him he will still get the last drops of water. The opening is wider than the older ones as well. They are shorter, wider, and the handle is lower profile and more rubberized so it moves a little easier and is less likely to break.I bought a set from Costco like this (it also included an insulated one that does not have a straw) and use them with my 2-yr-old and 4-yr-old. I love these so much more than the old ones and the kids love them, too. They use them every day for preschool (as do many of the other kids).","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RXY8IFL7Y6331/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01186WA70#wasThisHelpful","RXY8IFL7Y6331","A2KFWHHUFVKFXZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KFWHHUFVKFXZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I admit that I have gotten on the reusable bag train. I hate throwing away so many plastic bags and would rather just reuse bags for my kids lunches than keep buying more toss away bags. I have a few of the planetwise bags which are really cute and work fairly well, but aren't nearly as thick and sturdy as these BlueAvocado bags. These are the highest quality reusable bags that I have tried. They have 2 layers of seals making them leak-proof plus the top closure works very well.These are a bit high priced making me think twice about getting more, but I will probably get some more of the smaller snack sized ones for my kids' lunches. I don't need to wash them out on a daily basis for most stuff for them (maybe just a wipe or rinse if needed).The bags are also strong enough to be used for lots of other items that are not food and may be heavier. These will be great for travel items or anything that could leak in a bag. I know a few moms use these in their diaper bags for some of the diapering necessities.Very high quality. A little pricey.

"I'm not a hunter, but I do have quite a few wild animals in my backyard. I'm trying to figure out where all the pesky rabbits are coming from, so this is very helpful in catching them in motion.

They can easily strap it into their tree to get a good view of the person chopping their tree without the camera being noticeable.It does not come with an SD card, but an 8GB card will get you plenty of pictures or video and they are pretty cheap these days.

"A first look at these sponges look like they aren't going to work very well, but they surprised me and actually do a decent job. The ""scrubby"" side is much softer than the older style (I usually use the blue ones) and doesn't get the grease stuck in it so easily.

"This is a nice size grill that will easily cook plenty of food for a family of four all at one time.It arrives packed very well in the box. It was so well packed that I had a difficult time getting the darn thing out. I swear I can practically hear the people packing it up laughing at those of us trying to open the box. Once I was able to get it out of the box, it was easy to assemble. It requires a screwdriver, but only to screw on the handle to the the lid. Everything else just snaps into place. The grill itself is nice and sturdy, but the stand wobbles a little bit. Not enough that it is going to fall over, but enough to make you wonder.I used the grill to make up some chicken skewers and zucchini. I did use a little bit of oil sprayed on the grill to make it easier to clean up. Chicken notoriously sticks to the grill, so I felt it was a good idea. Cleanup was easy as I just took a wet rag and wiped it down when the grill was still hot. I had no problem wiping any of the residue and the grill looks good as new.This really is a great alternative for people who live in places that don't allow charcoal or gas grills (specifically apartments). I like it because it doesn't require that we have enough gas to fire it up and it is easy cleanup, but we still get the benefit of being able to cook outside. We live in a hot climate in the summer, so there are many days when I don't want to cook into the house and heat it up and this will be a great way to easily cook outside without a lot of prep work. Our gas grill also just recently was eradicated of a mouse family, so I'm still a little leery of using it before I give it a good clean.It is quite large, so I really have no idea where I am going to store it. It is a little too large for me to store in the house in my kitchen. I'll probably keep it outside for the summer, but it snows here in the winter, so I would rather keep it in the house and I will need to find a place to store it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R27PA763G3272P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TQIUUXO#wasThisHelpful","R27PA763G3272P","A2KFWHHUFVKFXZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KFWHHUFVKFXZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I don't wear headphones too often as a stay at home mom, but there are times when I just need to block the world out and go to my own place. From the moment I put the headphones on, the world starts to calm down and turn inward. They aren't noise canceling, but they do quiet the sounds of 3 preschoolers yelling at each other. And once the music starts playing, I don't hear anything else. Ahhh....bliss.The headphones are very comfortable. I wore them for a couple of hours with no discomfort and could have worn them longer, but I can't shut out the world forever.The sounds were amazing. I have listened to a few songs many many times and never heard some of the small quiet sounds in them. I had no idea! I am no audiophile, but I do love listening to music and really hearing all the nuances.Great headphones that are a little pricey, but worth it if you wear headphones for long periods of time and want to block out other noises around you.

I plugged the one end in the wall socket in the room with the router and the other end a couple of rooms away into the wall socket by the TV setup.

"I have another aromatherapy diffuser - Greenair Spa Vapor + Advanced Wellness Instant Healthful Mist Therapy - that is comparable to this one. As far as them working, they both diffuse essential oils, have soothing colors, and work for a few hours (length of time depends on minerals in your tap water). I would pick the GreenAir as the better option, though.The PureGuardian diffuser has a slightly higher price point than the GreenAir. It does come with a separate filling cup (not really necessary since you can just use any cup to fill it up). Both come with a bottle of essential oil (this one was lavendar and I think the same came with the GreenAir, but I cannot remember).The PureGuardian has fewer pieces than the GreenAir. It has a ""funnel"" top over the base and then the green cover.  The GreenAir does have a few small parts including a top that can rotate to change the direction of the mist. The PureGuardian needs the entire unit to be turned to change misting direction.The green cover is pretty, but it does make the colors different and makes it more difficult to see if the diffuser is working. The white cover on the GreenAir means that I can see the water level without removing the top.Overall I would say they are fairly equal, but I prefer the lower price of the GreenAir and I like that it has a white cover that blends in a little better than the Green.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ZAD7R8SHO818/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00O9OO60S#wasThisHelpful","R1ZAD7R8SHO818","A2KFWHHUFVKFXZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KFWHHUFVKFXZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"We have a few of the Disney Cars & Planes Track sets already, so this fits right in. This one frustrated me the most, though. It was a pain to put together--I put the stickers on wrong (the fire ones go on the outside curves, the water on the inside) and once you put them on, they are impossible to get off. I needs to stay put together most of the time unlike other ones that are easy to take apart and put back together (similar to train tracks). It is fairly bulky, so I'm not a fan of not being able to put it away when not in use. I also am not a big fan of the fact that you really need to buy more sets to make this more fun.As for the kids, they love it. My 3 kids are all love Dusty, so this is new and fun. What is nice is that you can buy another small set to add to it to make it ""new"" again. The kids love cars and driving them over whatever they can so I like being able to keep it all in one set.As a parent, this is not a favorite, but I still really like these sets. I'm disappointed that only Dusty is included when they picture lots of other vehicles on the set. It would have been nice to have at least one of the RVs included since they are a big part of this scene in the movie.So, while I like these sets, I would recommend checking out some of the other ones first.

"2.5 stars rounded up to 3I have a FitBit Charge that I have been using for about 3 months. Here is my take on the comparison with the UP3 by Jawbone. The short of it: FitBit wins hands down. Unfortunately the UP3 is lacking in a few important ways.1. The FitBit has a display so you can always see where you are in your daily steps, calories, stairs, and more. The UP3 has no display and only has little lights to let you know if it is in active mode or sleep mode. To view any of your current stats you need to check your app-- it does not even work on your computer, so if you don't have a smartphone or tablet, you are out of luck (my father-in-law does not use either, so it would be difficult for him and he LOVES his FitBit).2. The UP3 only tracks your steps in active mode. No flights of stairs, no calories, nothing. It does not track steps well, either. I had both my FitBit and UP3 on for 2 days and the UP3 was consistently THOUSANDS of steps behind. One day the UP3 tracked just over 6000 steps and the FitBit had almost 10,000. That is a huge difference. I trust the FitBit more as I have watched it as I was walking and it was calculating the steps correctly.3. The benefit to having a tracker like this is the social aspect. Challenge friends and get your steps up. I have about 25 friends with FitBits. I have ZERO friends with a Jawbone. So the only person I can challenge is myself. I have no social interaction at all with the UP3.4. While the app is okay, it completely drains the battery on my phone. The UP3 syncs through the phone, so the app is always on and connecting to the UP3. I did not have this kind of trouble with the FitBit and it can also be synced using the computer so I don't need to have my phone.5. I was interested in the heartrate monitoring on the UP3. Well, it only checks your resting heartrate when you take it out of sleep mode in the morning.6. The FitBit is less expensive than the UP3 and it has a lot more features.While the UP3 is lacking, it still does have positives.1. I like the coaching tips. The app will give you tips each day that are helpful.2. The sleep tracking is excellent. It far exceeds the FitBit's sleep tracking. While I am not keen on the awake time of the UP3, I love the sleep mode tracking.3. It is smaller and lighter on the wrist. It is comfortable to wear, but the slider doesn't seem to stay put all the time.So, overall I would recommend the FitBit over the UP3. A few fixes would make the UP3 a huge improvement. I think it has the possibility to be as good as the FitBit.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RIB21WEI6L3L4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N9E6DUK#wasThisHelpful","RIB21WEI6L3L4","A2KFWHHUFVKFXZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KFWHHUFVKFXZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"We love the Contigo brand water bottles in our house. Our kids (2.5 twins and 4-yr-old) all have the straw style Contigo cups right now. I'm trying to move them away from the straws a bit because they tend to chew on the straws and tear them up (the 4-year-old is the worst with this). I first gave this to my 2.5-yr-old girl and she had a little trouble with it. She is trying to learn to push the button while drinking, but not quite getting there. I have a feeling she will figure it out in a couple of weeks, though.  My 4-yr-old took to it right away and had no trouble.I love that there aren't a lot of parts to it and it is easy to clean. The kids can carry it easily and once they are able to master pushing the button and drinking, it is perfect!

"I have been using reusable bags for a few years now. A year ago I moved from a city that had banned plastic bags so I had to have my reusable bags or be forced to pay for a paper bag.

I like the ones that fold up really small, but they aren't always super sturdy.I really like these bags! The purple colors are very pretty.

"I have tried out quite a few different wi-fi cameras (including motorola, d-link, and foscam).

I set this up to keep an eye on my front door and entryway. It has a large wide-angle view, so even though it does not pan it covers the entire area that I wanted plus a bit more. The picture is clear and bright (better than my foscam cameras).While it is nice that the camera can be used for other purposes (a ""go-pro"" type camera on a helmet or such, a dash-board camera, etc), once I put this up as a security camera and set up ""zones,"" I do not intend to move it around and use it for other things.My only disappointment is that there isn't a way to access the camera on my computer at this time.

"I've been sewing for most of my life. I sew nearly every day and sell some of my creations.

It is simple without any extra bells and whistles like so many of the machines out there. You don't choose the tension or the stitch length or anything. Just pick your stitch and go.I love how compact and light the machine is. It is at least 3-4 inches smaller than my Kenmore machine that I have been using for 10 years. It is very light to carry, which makes it very portable. I do ""crafternoons"" with friends where we all gather to do our individual crafts (sewing, knitting, scrapbooking, needlework, etc.) and this is the perfect machine for those activities.Directions were easy to figure out how to get it set up with the bobbin and top thread to get things started.

I also like this size for me because it fits better in either the diaper bag or my purse without weighing the bag down too much.

They both keep water cold for a long time (I put ice in it and it was still solid after a few hours).This one is similar to the non-insulated Jackson water bottle with the large opening in the middle.

"I bought this in Oct 2012, and wanted to leave a review for other 2012 Nissan Frontier truck owners. The things you are probably concerned about are:- works with Utili-Track System / even the truck extender- keeps rain out (i live in CA, but i have gone through the car wash once or twice a month with no leaking)- Leather still looks great 2 years later.- Very easy to use / very convenient- Straight forward to install (if you watched the video on youtube)So why no 5 stars?The downside to living in California is the brutally hot summers. I park my car out in the open during the days and the internal temps can get to around 115-120 (maybe higher, that's just what i see on the temp display in the cabin). So one day i opened the back of the truck, and i can see that glue holding the the felt liner that is on the undersides of the tonneau must have softened/melted in the heat and caused the felt liner to separate from the metal portion of the cover. Ever since that day, the felt just hasn't been the same, it's out of place, and most times loose. This is still just a slight problem, as the cover still functions.The 2nd problem is probably similar to the first. The rubber seal that you stick to the truck bed shifted due to the glue melting. so there wasn't a tight seal anymore causing a whistling noise that i eventually figured out. (it didn't make noise when the tonneau was rolled up, only when it was down. So i removed the tonneau and i saw the rubber seal drooping slightly into the truck. I just went to home depot, and replaced it with a 1 inch peel & stick insulation foam and put the tonneau back on, and haven't had a problem since.As for keeping the tonneau looking shiny and new, i used Armor all the first couple months,  but switched to using  303 Aerospcae Protectant instead after reading many reviews. This has less shine, but really does seem to be magic on leather and plastic.http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004YJQE0SI also wrote up a more wordy review when i first bought the product, and posted it on my blog @ survialpaladin dot comIf i ever need to buy a replacement cover i will most likely buy another roll-x from BAK industries, this simply has been the best cover i've ever used and the convenience it offers is well worth it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2L924KAZCSWUS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006VRSKL2#wasThisHelpful","R2L924KAZCSWUS","AXJWP32O6WRJN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AXJWP32O6WRJN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"If you expect this to be a straight up gasoline replacement in winter, you might be in trouble when you need it. There are definitely things you need to know about this product in order to count on it. So lets say you run out of gas in your car/boat/lawnmower.. the way it works is when you fill up the tank with this solution, the theory is, that your car(or other device) is warmed up, and there is enough residual gasoline in your lines to ""spark"" the rest of the solution, thereby allowing you to run on this fuel until you can reach a gas station and refill. This product has a 105F degree minimum flash point that it needs to achieve before it can take a spark and run off of. So if you run out of gas in the winter.. and you wait too long.. your car might get too cold for this to be effective. Also, trying to run it direct without any other type of fuel might not work either unless you have a way of preheating the solution over it's flash point. As for it being safe to store on hot days, this is a quote from the FAQ of the manufacturer:""extraFuel develops less pressure than a container of orange juice when exposed to high temperatures. The vapors are not explosive. The only way it would catch fire, would be when raised to a temperature above its flash point and if the fuel were exposed to a spark or a flame. However, ExtraFuel is packaged in a bottle where the mouth of the container is heat sealed with foil seal, protected by a child safety cap. That makes it difficult for a spark or flame to get near the liquid. This product is not flammable. ""also, don't throw away the cardboard paper thing that comes attached to the extrafuel, that is actually a funnel that you can use when you need to pour it into your gas tank. I almost threw it away thinking it was just some advertising tag.here's a link to the rest of the FAQ:[...]","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 27, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1O5I8WX6BCY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008BLFSWA#wasThisHelpful","R1O5I8WX6BCY","AXJWP32O6WRJN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AXJWP32O6WRJN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I don't have the gps/dvd upgrade in my truck for the audio system, so i didn't want to go out and buy an expensive head unit with android support and a lcd screen only to integrate my phone. I listen to a lot of pandora and audio book mp3's, and really needed a way to hook up my phone to the truck. Originally i was thinking about using some kind of bluetooth method but this turned out to be the best option. I have the phone mounted in the top center of the dash, and i kept the cable tightly wrapped, so the cable is neat, and runs straight down the side of the center dash to the EXT input and cigarette lighter. I also have the extre large sized battery and case on my phone, and this thing works great. I'm not going to lie.. the battery+case do make it a tad snug to fit into it, but you just have to squeeze it down and it''ll fit.  If you drive over rough roads, it could jolt it out a little, you'll just need to squeeze the phone back down into place, and everything will be fine.

"i don't have my computer connected to these, or use it for anything other than playing on the xbox 360. But i have to say these are absolutely great, with only a few downsides. The one major downside for me, is i have a big head, and these things are like head-vices after hours of playing. they're just tight on my head. Being wireless you should also be aware that they are going to weigh about twice as much as other wired headsets. The earpieces are ok.. but i wish they had went with a better type of padding on the earpieces , maybe something similar to their 720's (i have a pair of them as well) instead of the foam & leather type material that they use. Overall though, these were just what i was looking for... wireless... great sound.. great integration with halo 4 and the batteries last a long time and even when they die, it's super easy to swap out batteries and keep playing. I would totally recommend these.

"I'm 6'3"" and 350lbs and the 4xt fits perfectly. The only downsides are what others have commented, in that the sleeves are slightly long, which in my opinion isn't a bad thing since the sleeves have elastic to keep them tight to your wrists. The colors are slightly off from the interior of the hoodie compared to the exterior so you'll get a two-toned look if you have the hoodie opened. Also as others have stated the hood does seem large, but i wear a baseball hat most of the time, so this doesn't bother me so much. It is warm, without being suffocating.

Also, some people have stated that they can't find this in stores, but i have found it here @ whole foods, and Mothers market here in southern california, for about the same price though.","2.0 out of 5 stars","April 27, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R25BSNHCLE2HHF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00064VQNU#wasThisHelpful","R25BSNHCLE2HHF","AXJWP32O6WRJN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AXJWP32O6WRJN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I really love these mesh shirts. They have 3 buttons which i love. Most big guys shirts have 2 buttons, which is dumb, and makes me feel like i have tons of neck space open.. I suppose it's good if you wear alot of neck jewelry, but i do not.Also note that this is a great shirt to keep you dry. The polyester micromesh wicks away sweat and keeps you feeling dry(er) than normal all day long.I normally buy underarmor shirts for sports or hiking, but now i use these shirts instead and they're cheaper and feel thicker and more durable. The underamor shirts tend to feel really thin, while these have a more substantial feel to them.I also like that they're plenty long enough already in the normal sizes. So unless you really are super tall don't buy the ""Tall"" versions, otherwise they'll be too long.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 15, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R13J5CDM2F0O96/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000RZ1J2G#wasThisHelpful","R13J5CDM2F0O96","AXJWP32O6WRJN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AXJWP32O6WRJN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Before i bought this i already knew that it used the micro hdmi connector. It's kinda silly since it has plenty of space for a standard hdmi plug next to the 3 standard usb plugs and audio connector. My review isn't about the description, but it's about the actual product.I am upgrading from an old Droid original, and this dock is lighter than the original droid dock, but i haven't had an issue with it. I bought the  Motorola Standard HDMI Cable for Motorola DROID X, ATRIX 4G, and XOOM and it works perfectly. I hooked up my keyboard and mouse and audio to this, and it displays out to the tv just fine.Be warned though, that there is limited resolution support, so if you have a high resolution monitor, you might not be happy with the lack of upscaling. The display will look stretched and blurry on a widescreen high res monitor. But on tv's, it works really well and looks great.Also note that i bought the TPU-Cases Matte Back Black Flexible TPU Case for Motorola Droid Bionic 4G (Verizon) ~TPU-Cases Retail Packaging~ and it fits great in this dock. The dock allows you to remove an insert and it creates more room for the phone + case.I really like that they now have the audio output on the dock instead of having to connect it to the phone like the original droid.Overall i'm really happy with this dock, but was well aware of it's shortcomings before buying.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 15, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R28WGLRFF7L8PF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005C31EKA#wasThisHelpful","R28WGLRFF7L8PF","AXJWP32O6WRJN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AXJWP32O6WRJN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"There are already many great reviews about this case on this page, i just wanted to let people know that thisalso fits very nicely into the droid HD dock. You can remove the insert on the dock and it fits perfectly.It doesn't even add that much thickness, and yet i know this case is going to last the life of the phone.

"I originally was going to say this was a great light for the price, but really, this flashlight is THE BEST in it's class. I spent a lot of time comparing many other AAA flashlights, and they all fall short compared to this model. Im a huge fan of Fenix flashlights and was going to get a Fenix E05 R2 Flashlight, but it only provides 1 mode (27 lumens). Then i looked at the Fenix E01 Compact LED Flashlight, while cheaper, that too only has one mode (10 lumens). Then you look at the Fenix LD01 Flashlightand that has 3 modes, and up to 80 lumens, but it's 2x the price. So why not save money and buy 2 of these and get the same performance.  The only other flashlight you might consider would be the 4Sevens Preon 1, R5, Flashlight; Black; 70 OTF lumens; 1xAAA which has 6 modes, and 70 lumens, but the bonus is, if you buy the body separately from 4sevens you can change it to the longer 2-AAA size whenever you need. But this too is more money than just getting 2x ITP A3 EOS's. I originally bought the stainless steel version for my EDC, and it has lasted me 5 years and i still use it to this day. Over the years i keep returning to this flashlight and i have bought about 7-8 (black version) of these lights, and give them to relatives, and everyone loves them. Having the multiple light modes comes in handy, as i usually use the brightest for checking in computer cases, behind desks, under my car, and i use the lowest for just walking at night. It's totally the best flashlight, and using AAA's is great. I have several other flashlights that use the cr123's and other mini flashlights, but this is the one that is my go-to flashlight, and my edc (every-day-carry) flashlight. In the past year, the flashlights that i bought have come from either ""LightJunction"" or ""Longhorn Tactical"" and it usually takes about 2 weeks to arrive from either. Also please note that if you do buy this, it is possible to use the head on this flashlight in conjunction with the 4Sevens body and endcap, so you can still get the benefits of the preon 1/2 without the additional cost of the head unit.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 1, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R25ZYNPZXK2MG9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003BM5GQ2#wasThisHelpful","R25ZYNPZXK2MG9","AXJWP32O6WRJN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AXJWP32O6WRJN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have a leatherman Surge, and i hated the big bulky case that it comes with. I also ordered the leatherman surge sheath (#934890) but it too is just slightly taller and wider than this Ti/Xti sheath.

"I bought this cooler on May 11, 2011, and didn't receive if until 5 weeks later. ""Tool Hardware Shop"" was fast to respond to my emails, but did nothing to resolve the issue, and offered no apologies or sorry's for a package lost in shipping. When i finally did receive it, it did not have the waterguard which was originally stated in the description as having. Anyway, now that i've been using the product for a few months, i can tell you that this thing is SUPER LOUD.. like a monkey banging on some garbage can lids. My old water cooler had a refrigerated part, but not a hot part. So i thought this would be a nice replacement, and it's one of the few that had both hot/cold and stainless design. Unfortunately this product is just terrible. It's so loud, period. The good looks and function of this product are totally ruined by the clunker noises coming from this thing. This things engine is like the jalopy of water dispensers. My cats get spooked every time it kicks in to starts cooling, the knocking is so loud from this thing, it's like we're getting raided by the FBI every time the motor starts up. Also, there is tons of condensation on the inside of the bottle. Bottom line is.. if you are deaf, then this is an alright product for you. But if you have any kind of hearing left, this product is way too loud. I can hear it from upstairs in my room with the door closed. The hot water is ok, and so is the cold water. The other drawback is that the ports are kinda short, so my ice trays have a hard time getting under it. I guess my old water cooler was better designed. I just really hate getting a white one, but it seems like i'm going to be stuck doing so. Stay away from this product, and this company.Update - July 12th 2011: Seller contacted me, and offered a refund for the cost of shipping. It could be possible that my experience was a ""one-off"" and you will have better luck. I still cannot leave a positive feedback for this water cooler though.","1.0 out of 5 stars","July 10, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2HFOI0CMQHIK7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004LDF1LA#wasThisHelpful","R2HFOI0CMQHIK7","AXJWP32O6WRJN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AXJWP32O6WRJN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Let me start off by saying that i have a big noggin. My head is size 25 1/2 inch around which equates to an 8 hat size. This is typically a size 2xl hat. This balaclava is not even tight on my head (good for me, probably bad for most people). Also, the wool is a fine type material and not super heavy, which is just what i was looking for. I bought this specifically for camping and would wear a heavier 100% wool watch cap on top (DLA 835-2672-9201 , RN 93084). My suggestion is, if you have a large heard, and need a good balaclava, this will do.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 5, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Z0A9D3O7EH2C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000R7F3MQ#wasThisHelpful","R1Z0A9D3O7EH2C","AXJWP32O6WRJN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AXJWP32O6WRJN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I've gone through some weight fluctuations, and this belt is really nice for adjusting. I love it so much, i'm coming back and buying a couple more, and in different colors. I used to wear a solid leather belt before, but the notches never seemed to be in the right place. I would pierce my own hole, but then it kinda of ruins the belt. This belt doesn't have that problem, since anywhere along the belt is a possible location.

"This cord lock light is pretty nice, it's not as bright as a mini flashlight but it is a nice clean and bright light good enough to use to find what you are looking for in the dark. The best part is that you can just slap this thing on any of your current backpacks, or jackets and you've got yourself a nifty little safety light. The best part is, if you're running or biking and it's dark, you can throw this on your jacket and just set it on strobe.

"I have been using these headphones for over a week now, and these are some really nice 'BASIC' headphones that are very different in regards to the included ""Neckband"" that makes these standard Bluetooth headphones, headphones ware around your neck just like those more expensive 'Magnet' ones that everyone is buying and wearing now days.I really like the concept, however the design could use a little more work, as the part that these headphones secure into is not very comfortable, and the headphones themselves are not very comfortable, and really I was only able to wear them for 2 hours max before I needed to remove them from my ears for a break.I also wish that the volume/charging apparatus was lighter as it does have some weight that causes the headphones to fall out at times, and they tend to apply a slight pressure on the ear from them hanging down.The magnet which is located in the headphones themselves allows for them to be secured when not is use, and the magnet is very good, and works well at keeping the headphones mounted and secured when moving.Overall this is a good set of Bluetooth headphones, that can be used for basic use. The audio is basic, and does not sound 'Full' and 'Rich' at times, and the bass is minimal at best.Please note that this review was done using the product supplied by Stoon for review.

"This is hands down one of the best screen protector I have ever used. It installed so simply. I cleaned my phone screen with the included wet wipe, removed all the dust and moisture with the included soft cloth.I followed the easy instructions and the screen protector simply went right on. Hardly any bubbles, and those that were there came right out. I can't even tell there's anything on the screen. I had a Zagg screen protector on my 6 and it was nice for protection, but it felt odd and it kind of caused some minor distortion.This screen protector feels and looks like the original glass screen of the phone. It fits nicely, though you can see that it's there. It does not interfere with the case I purchased, and it has absolutely no scratches or imperfections at all. I've only used it for a weekend, but so far, I want one of these for every phone and iPod in my house.It does show fingerprints to some extent, but they wipe away perfectly. I assume the glass on the phone would show fingerprints too if it didn't have a protector on it. I mean, smudgy fingers leave prints.I just can't get over the feel of this thing.

"When I ordered this, I thought to myself, ""This is probably going to be a disappointment."" When I opened it I was amazed. It comes with a nice leather travel case. When you open the case you discover a weighty and well made razor with a lot of chrome to ensure it will not rust. When you break it down into three pieces, even the interior parts are heavily chromed. This razor has a perfect feel in your hand, as well.As this is my first Safety Razor, I looked up on YouTube how to shave with this, (Recommend a video search of Safety Razor, and watching Executive Shaving)Shaving with this was a dream. The angle is just right. The razor is neither too aggressive nor too mild. It shaved me so perfectly on the first pass that I almost didn't need to make a second. The shave was much quicker than my older disposable razor and just as close.Included in the set was a nice Chrome Stand and a brush.

I can tell it will be used a lot, and it is a nice and light alternative to bringing a briefcase. I will use it for work, interviews, and meetings. Can bring just this to work and leave the briefcase at home unless I am preparing a case. I will update after a couple of months to update after this honeymoon period to see how it holds up to wear and tear, but so far, there are only positives, especially the price for this.Pros:PriceQuality leatherMultiple pocketsIncludes notepadQuality materialsBuilt in CalculatorCons:Card holder is a little tight, but a few days of holding cards will help break itOverall this a a great pad-folio that looks and feels very professional at a great price. I recommend this to anyone looking for a pad-folio.I received this product in exchange for an honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R36QZZ8CKVQROH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UV6C97U#wasThisHelpful","R36QZZ8CKVQROH","A26MGY7PAEKZPN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A26MGY7PAEKZPN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is hands down one of the best screen protector I have ever used. It installed so simply. I cleaned my phone screen with the included wet wipe, removed all the dust and moisture with the included soft cloth.I followed the easy instructions and the screen protector simply went right on. Hardly any bubbles, and those that were there came right out. I can't even tell there's anything on the screen. I had a Zagg screen protector on my 6 and it was nice for protection, but it felt odd and it kind of caused some minor distortion.This screen protector feels and looks like the original glass screen of the phone. It fits nicely, though you can see that it's there. It does not interfere with the case I purchased, and it has absolutely no scratches or imperfections at all. I've only used it for a weekend, but so far, I want one of these for every phone and iPod in my house.It does show fingerprints to some extent, but they wipe away perfectly. I assume the glass on the phone would show fingerprints too if it didn't have a protector on it. I mean, smudgy fingers leave prints.I just can't get over the feel of this thing. So smooth and it's essentially invisible.Please note that this review was done using the product supplied by Aukey for review.

"This light works great - I have it set on the ""dim most of the time but bright if somebody walks under it"" and both options (dim and bright) are perfect settings.It is not too bright when it is on dim, but very bright on bright. The design makes it so that it catches the sun but the light shines where you want it.Everything works exactly as described - the motion detector, the battery, the settings - and it is a nice addition to our porch. The plastic does not feel like it is super heavy duty, but so far, that has not been an issue.

"Let me start by saying thanks to BesTrix for sending over a review unit for me to test out.While I have been using thie product for almost a weeks now I must say that I can not say anything negative about this wireless charger. I tested this out on the Samsung Galaxy Note 5, which doesn't require any Wireless Charger Receiver Tag to allow for this to work, and works with the 'Rapid' Charging that is a not supported on this device.The best thing about this is that you can place the device on either 'Landscape' or 'Portrait' mode, as you can see in the photo's provided.The lights, both Red and Blue, are not to bright, and does not disturb the room if you are charging it at night.The biggest reason for the 4 star rating, is that they provided a 12 inch USB cable that is WAY to short to use even for a countertop charger.  I would almost ask they do not send one at all as I have been able to use my existing USB cables, however as it was included in the product, it is affected by the rating.Overall it's a solid Qi charging pad, and works just the way it should. Only wish it supported the Quick Charge that the new Samsung devices support, and that they include a longer, standard USB cable.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1NAZSDKT0CLGV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0156GKWD2#wasThisHelpful","R1NAZSDKT0CLGV","A26MGY7PAEKZPN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A26MGY7PAEKZPN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This solar powered spot light is great.It's so easy to assemble. Take the screw and bolt to secure the light and solar panel together at the angle you want. No tools needed. You can hold the bolt with your finger while twisting to screw it down to secure.There is a stake included to put into the ground, or you can choose to mount it on the wall with the anchors and screws.Power on with the button at the bottom of the solar panel. (Hi, Low, and off)The LED is pretty bright, even on low.

"Quality leather in a nice design that optimizes the number of credit cards, ID's, that will fit in this amount of space.It will fit in a front or rear pocket of jeans or men's dress pants. The holder only has slots for 8 Cards, however the 1st and 2nd of both sides sit even, and for that reason I am giving it 4 out of 5 stars.

"This is a fairly small bag. When it is zipped up, it is really tiny, and wouldn't hold much, and when it is extended it is shorter than I expected and still not huge.The model in the photo must be like 5' and have skinny little legs. As I am 5'8"", I nearly have to stoop to roll it behind me. Also I found the wheels rather difficult to pop back into place to store, but I feel like that'll get easier with time.I'm glad to have the bag, as I like to walk flea markets, and craft fairs, I often find myself purchasing heavier things, but I'll still probably need to bring a second bag to carry light stuff home.I received this product in exchange for an honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RVI6T08W3U0OM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0111B8TRC#wasThisHelpful","RVI6T08W3U0OM","A26MGY7PAEKZPN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A26MGY7PAEKZPN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm terrible at estimating meat temperature, and tend to have bloody steaks or hockey pucks as a result. Figuring a thermometer might help me with my end product, I gave this one a try. I've never used a meat thermometer like this before, so I have nothing to compare it with, but it worked well for me. My burgers came out medium for once!I agree with other reviewers that mentioned the small off switch and the fact that there's no auto off here. It's a battery drainer. There is no override to set a manual temperature (I personally don't care, but it's something to be aware of).

All the winter blankets that aren't being used right now. The spare pillows that had taking up the bottom 3 shelves are all now neatly stored on the top shelf. It has also made storage a lot easier too. Especially when we are packing for a long trip I can squish the stuff we might or might not need but take just in case the weather is bad.

"These are great sunglasses! Fit very well, and are super comfortable for long periods of time while walking, or jogging.The case and extra lenses that come with it are pretty fantastic, though it is not the easiest thing in the world to change the lenses out. Takes some working on but it isn't too bad once you get the hang of it.Included in the box you get:1 x Sunglasses Frame5 x Lenses (1 Black Polarized; 1 Clear; 1 Yellow; 1 Yellow/Blue Color; 1 Light Blue Len)1 x Hard Protection Box1 x Elastic Sport Belt1 x Lens Pouch1 x Cleaning Cloth1 x Polarized Testing CardI really like the Polarized lenses, and wish the other ones were as well, but it's not a deal breaker. More than anything the lens replacement is a little confusing, so take your time, once you get the hang of it. it's a piece of cake I promise!Overall love these glasses, and really love the protection they provide, along with the different lens that you can use, and this really is a 'Everything Your Need' kit. I have used this over the weekend at the shooting range, and changed the lens from the Polarized to the yellow, and they were very comfortable.Please note that this review was done using the product supplied by Ponosoon for review.

"I was skeptical about the collar working on my Mastiff/Rot mix, but it has been a miracle.We only put it on him when he's going in the backyard, and when our little son is sleeping as to not wake him up. He tends to bark non-stop at our neighbor's dogs when he's in the backyard which can be very irritating to us and our neighbors, and he always seems to be more alert when our son is sleeping to those outside near our house, and tends to bark ALL THE TIME, and it wakes him up.Yes, dogs have a tendency of being protective, and we do not do this to hurt him on purpose, that is why for us, just using the vibration mode only for this review.I've tried the collars that just beep, but the sounds doesn't bother him at all, and tend to make it worse sometimes. Now with this collar, he receives vibration when he barks, and this is perfect as it stops him from doing it, and does not shock him which my wife and I do not want.I think he's only been buzzed once and as you can see in the picture, he doesn't like it at all. Now he knows not to bark when the collar is on. The only problem is he's smart enough to know that he can bark whenever the collar is off.So he still barks in the house since we do not put the collar on him 24/7, but at least he isn't getting on my neighbors nerves, and our little baby is not waking up from 10 minute naps!Please note that this review was done using the product supplied by Ortz for review.

"This may not be anything like Bose/Beats that is 10 times the price. However, at this price what you get is much more valuable than those.What you do get is a great sounding pair of Bluetooth headphone from MPOW. These sound great and provide good, (Not Great, it is Bluetooth) call-back quality. While my test calls were completed using these, callers did notice a little differences in talking on these and talking directly into the phone.Pros: Good, comfortable ear pads. Sound quality is very good. Build quality is very good. Quick connect/reconnect with Android and iPhone/iOS tested. Able to pick from 3 different ear pads, and ear tips.Cons: Distance from source is 10 meters only without any obstructions. May not work thru Brick walls or steel frames. Two/three walls/doors in office like setting maybe okay. The control buttons are small, so getting used to takes little while. No announcements about remaining talk/play times, however I do like the voice prompt provided with these as it does not sound like the lady is trying to seduce me when talking to me.These earphones are very comfortable even though I have small ears and the sound is good. I wear them while at the gym and while out and about. The bluetooth connectivity is a snap and the battery lasts a long time on just one charge (8 Hours). The bass is really good for ear buds and being that my main listening enjoyment comes from drum and bass music, well, bass is pretty important to me, lol.Please note that this review was done using the product supplied by MPOW for review.

"I have used this router for traveling when only wired internet access is available. Plug the router in, plug in the ethernet cable into the router and it creates a wireless hotspot. This is what I use this router for the most, as some big name Hotels offer free wired internet, and makes you pay for Wireless connectivity. This keeps you from not getting spoofed to connect to a wireless network that you shouldn't so using this is perfect for anyone on the road!Not only do you get the ability to recharge cell phones and other USB-rechargeable devices but it also has a USB port for inserting a thumb drive and an SD card slot. It is recharged via the included USB cable and that can be can also be used for connecting the device directly to a computer to access files from the SD card reader. My favorite feature is the built-in WiFi functionality. It can stream photos, videos, music, etc. to smartphones or other devices connected to it via the RavPower app. This is an awesome multi-purpose tech tool and it's very light and small to travel with.I really love this device, and I have been using it for 2 weeks, and find it always with me so if I need to share USB information, or recharge my Galaxy Note 5, this is a on-stop shop device that is so user friendly, set up only takes 5/7 minutes total!Please note that this review was done using the product supplied by HooToo for review.

"So this camera is a great idea, however not executed perfectly. I remember those old Polaroid camera that printed following each picture, and this brings that idea back, with some 2010 tech behind it!For starters, this camera not only prints each picture, but also saves a digital copy of the picture so that you are able to share it online, or share via email. Included in this box, you get:1 - Polaroid Snap Camera1 - USB Cable1 - Magnet Lens Cover1 - StrapThis 'Snap' takes special printer paper, which was not included in this order, however after contacting the company they are aware of this, and stated that they would be including paper in the packages going forward. I would suggest if you do not have paper just notify the seller, (Polaroid).The paper is small (2 x 3), and was very easy to place into the camera, and does not require any special ink, and only needs to replace the paper when you run out.Overall the camera is kind of like the old Polaroid, or even disposable camera, as you do not have any way of reviewing the images after they are taken, and as you can see in the photo's posted, the camera doesn't take great images when a toddler is moving around, and also even when I believe I am holding it still, it still did show some signs of blur, when using indoors.This would be a great camera for Teen's or even younger kids that would want to print images out as soon as they take them.I received this product in exchange for an honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1NJVA3ZVUY4C2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015JIAD7C#wasThisHelpful","R1NJVA3ZVUY4C2","A26MGY7PAEKZPN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A26MGY7PAEKZPN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Do you have toys and all kinds of kids stuff all over your car? Does it drive you insane that you cannot keep it organized?Well then this product will be a lifesaver for you! This has tons of mesh pockets and places to hold items so you can use it for toys and bottles or for all your stuff - it will hold cans and pens, flashlights and much more.This is a very nice large and long organizer that will fit right over the back of the seat and your kids will have easy access to it and when you get them out of the car you can just stuff everything back into the pockets and your car is clean again!My son loves to get kids meals with the toys but they always end up under the seats or stuffed into the seats. But with this it helped a lot because I could just tell him to put them in the pockets and he does! I can keep his favorite things in the organizer and he can grab what he wants when he wants.Really enjoyed the 2 extra items, the Trash Can, and Washing Mitt, makes sure that you can keep your car nice and clean and organized.No more bottles or sippy cups turning over and spilling - this has a place to hold them.

"My favorite part of this case is that the keyboard feels like a keyboard. Sure, it's slightly smaller due to size limitations, but it feels and types like a real keyboard. I bought my iPad and this case for mobile writing (journals were getting clunky). Key response is fantastic and quick; very little noticeable lag. It's a great keyboard for the price and a good keyboard regardless of the price.The case offers minimal to moderate levels of protection. If you're looking for something heavy duty to handle drops and toddlers, this probably isn't the case for you. If you'll be the only one using it and you plan to carry it inside of a laptop bag or something similar; this case is all you need.My favorite feature is that the keyboard and iPad can be detached unlike others this allow you to have the keyboard separated when you do not need it.As for battery life; I charged it to full per the instructions upon receipt and have not charged it again or directly turned it off in the week plus that I've had it and the battery is still going strong.

"I got this bike mount at a discounted rate in exchange for an honest and unbiased review. With that said... This is absolutely the best bike mounted phone holder!Inside the box you get the plastic phone mount, and two different colored web style retainer bands (which are very durable), along with the Bike Mount.I take my bike out on on/off road trail rides, and it has had no problems keeping my phone in place while i ride. Which I'm truly happy about because now i don't have to worry about dropping my phone while I'm out. I'm truly impressed. I also like that it has a 360 rotational degree so you can position it any way you want it. Even though I got this product at a discounted rate, I have already placed another order for my wife's bike as she wanted one only after she saw mine.Please note that this review was done using the product supplied by TaoTronics for review.

"I used my juicer for the first time today. Since my hand strength is rather poor, I quartered the lemon I was going to juice.This made it much easier for me to squeeze every last drop of juice from that lemon. I discovered that all the juice did NOT come out through the holes in the bottom of the juicer. It needed to be turned sideways to get the larger amount of juice out.The whole experience was very satisfactory and I was quite pleased with the performance of my new Lemon Squeezer.Please note that this review was done using the product supplied by IIyever for review.

"My wife wanted to add some extra protection to her Galaxy Note 5, and not have to worry to much about those protector's that do not cover the full glass. This is one of those screen protector kits. Unlike most other screen protectors, this covers THE WHOLE glass including the top bezel that tends to always be left exposed, or you have to line up PERFECT to ensure that your selfie lens does not get covered.With that said I will complain about that part. It is really had to line the holes up PERFECT and ensure that button/lenses/LED's are not covered that could cause the screen to not function properly. With that said, I will not ding the product, as you can not only see the layout, but it's common sense that it will not be a 2 second install, and that you need to take your time when installing to ensure that it is not damages, or covering anything it shouldn't.For me, it took 5 to 7 minutes to install properly, and 2 attempts to line up the holes just right for the light sensor, LED indicators, and camera to all work without problems. It was easy to reapply and I was as able to install without any major issues.The screen lands pretty flat on the Note 5, to the point that it is almost invincible from Edge to Edge, Top and Bottom. We have yet to see it affect her screen sensitivity, clarity, or performance in any way. Stylus pen also works without any issues, and she was still able to user her phone case that she loves so much.Please note that this review was done using the product supplied by Pvendor for review.

"Great price for several Micro USB cables. They fit nice and snug into my phone and I have not notices any performance issues while using these over OEM once. The length is really great for plugging in behind a bed, or sofa, and I can use my phone now while it is on the charger.Another thing that I love is the Nylon cover.

"I bought these not only to protect myself from credit card fraud and identity theft, but to protect the cards from wear and for my own personal safety. I'm not sure if everyone pays attention to detail but here is my advice.When you open your wallet at the market, store, and other public places, people notice what you have in your wallet. Whenever anybody opens their wallet at the supermarket I always notice how many credit cards and department store cards they have. Now if I pay attention how much attention do you think criminals pay to your wallet.The RFID chips in credit cards and ID cards, holds all of your sensitive info such as card numbers, expiration dates, names, addresses, etc. I did a little research and you can buy RFID readers and writers for $25 from china, I'm not a credit card genius but with all these department stores getting hacked. I think the credit card is a little outdated as far as security.Included is:10 Credit Card Sized Sleeves2 Larger/Passport SleevesIt's reasonably priced and a no brainer for anyone traveling or looking for added security. I tested these out by placing my Citibank card, (RFID Enabled Card) inside the sleeve, and when I tried to use it at a RFID enabled card terminal, (Drug Store) it was unable to read the card inside the sleeve, however when I removed it, It was able to read the chip and process that payment as usual.Sleeves seem to work as designed, and would recommend them to anyone with any RFID cards/licenses/passports to protect yourself.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1W6IE48G2B1TM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WNCQ1GK#wasThisHelpful","R1W6IE48G2B1TM","A26MGY7PAEKZPN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A26MGY7PAEKZPN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"So far so good. They have been through the delicate cycle 5-6 times already and have held up just fine.The smaller sizes are perfect for little socks, and small items. I've been using the largest one for my wife's bras that do not need to be dried, so it allows them to be easily removed and  keep them from hanging on those other clothes. I like the little elastic portion that keeps the zipper head in place as I have had problems in the past with lingerie bags opening in the wash.It's also been handy for bras with hooks or keeping anything with velcro from ruining other fabrics.Please note that this review was done using the product supplied by Yiwu for review.

"These are great sunglasses! Fit very well, and are super comfortable for long periods of time while walking, or jogging.The case and extra lenses that come with it are pretty fantastic, though it is not the easiest thing in the world to change the lenses out.

More than anything the lens replacement is a little confusing, so take your time, once you get the hang of it. it's a piece of cake I promise!Overall love these glasses, and really love the protection they provide, along with the different lens that you can use, and this really is a 'Everything Your Need' kit. I have used this over the weekend at the shooting range, and changed the lens from the Polarized to the yellow, and they were very comfortable.Please note that this review was done using the product supplied by Pvendor for review.

"If you want a stylish case while protecting your tablet this is a good option.I like it because the black/brown colors, as they are very professional looking in design. I like the rubber case that covers the entire tablet and all the port holes line up perfectly. The outer cover is protective and sturdy to protect your screen. I do wish that it stands up landscape, it would be nice if it turned or rotated, but this does not take away from the overall product and quality.The additional perk is that it is a slim case and not bulky and doesn't add ""extra"" weight to your tablet.

"I gave this case 5 stars because I really like the material better than the silicone ones that tend to get loose on say Otter boxes. This material feels premium and I can tell that it will last longer than plastic or silicone cases.

"These headphones are one of the best on the market right now. I simply cannot work out without them.They are extremely comfortable because they fit perfectly in your ear, and hardly ever fall off. The fact that they are short makes lifting weights easier, and I never have trouble with the wires interfering with the dumbbells like from past experiences with other headphones.The color is absolutely incredible. Truly gives it a distinctive look from any other headphones on the market. Everywhere I go I get asked where I got them, and get complimented on how good they look.Another reason these headphones are worth getting is the sound. I can completely blast the music without bothering anyone near me. Awesome sound canceling headphones.The battery life is really impressive for such small pieces of hardware these last me much longer about 5 hours.I highly recommend these Bluetooth headphones because of there size and audio quality. They feel great, and are lightweight which is great for Bluetooth headphones. The call quality was good, not perfect, as my test caller could tell that I was on a headset, but said that it wasn't horrible, and sounded okay.Please note that this review was done using the product supplied by Vastar for review.

"I have been using this Battery case for almost a month now, and I have to say it is a must have accessory for your iPhone 6!This case has a great fit and a nice sturdy feel to it. It fits nice and snug and there is not wiggling or squeaking noises that come from it. The bumper is raised so the screen has some protection!Overall the case is definitely not flimsy, it's made of a nice thick plastic, but doesn't add a bunch of bulk to my phone. It adds enough to make me feel like my phone has a decent level of protection, but without making it impossibly bulky.Installation was really easy, you basically just slide your phone in and bring the corners aroundIt has all the appropriate cut outs necessary for camera and flash usage. The buttons all work well and easily.

"I have used this router for traveling when only wired internet access is available. Plug the router in, plug in the ethernet cable into the router and it creates a wireless hotspot. This is what I use this router for the most, as some big name Hotels offer free wired internet, and makes you pay for Wireless connectivity. This keeps you from not getting spoofed to connect to a wireless network that you shouldn't so using this is perfect for anyone on the road!Not only do you get the ability to recharge cell phones and other USB-rechargeable devices but it also has a USB port for inserting a thumb drive and an SD card slot. It is recharged via the included USB cable and that can be can also be used for connecting the device directly to a computer to access files from the SD card reader. My favorite feature is the built-in WiFi functionality. It can stream photos, videos, music, etc. to smartphones or other devices connected to it via the RavPower app. This is an awesome multi-purpose tech tool and it's very light and small to travel with.I really love this device, and I have been using it for 2 weeks, and find it always with me so if I need to share USB information, or recharge my Galaxy Note 5, this is a on-stop shop device that is so user friendly, set up only takes 5/7 minutes total!Please note that this review was done using the product supplied by HooToo for review.

"I like this cover for many reasons. I like that it is low profile, covers the entire front and back of the iPad Mini for full protection, and allows the beauty of the front side of the iPad to show through when the front cover is pulled back. I have a white iPad and my prior case covered most of the white area, so you couldn't tell what color it was. Also, because this cover doesn't cover the white ""frame"" of the front, you have easy access to 100% of the screen. I had issues with not being able to access my entire screen with my prior case.The magnetic feature works well and turns the iPad on and off easily. The folding cover works well, and folds into a triangular shape to allow the iPad to sit at a low or a high angle for 2 viewing options.Love this case, and I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a nice, affordable case for your iPad Mini 4.If this review helped you , please click on the Yes below, so i know i am hitting the things you need to know and that my reviews are helping.I received this product at a discount in exchange for my fair and honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3RT2QZZIWMQ55/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015A4ZRAS#wasThisHelpful","R3RT2QZZIWMQ55","A26MGY7PAEKZPN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A26MGY7PAEKZPN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Before I got this my dog was out of control and I had to get up every 5 seconds to stop him from chewing something up or going into rooms he's not allowed in, now I don't have to even get up I just tell him no and push a button! This has made my life so much easier!! I'm so pleased and I would recommend this to anyone with a puppy problem!!My wife does not like the 'Shocking' feature so with this collar, it has Four modes:Static Shock - Perfect for training if any Extreme Aggressive actions are observed.Vibration - Great for general attention, and works 99% of the time!Beep/Audible Tone - For distraction trainingLight - I use this for night tracking outdoors, or on a walk/run.I haven't even had to use shock so far I've only had to use vibrate and its been incredible!I received this product at a discount in exchange for my fair and honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3PTIBICRIWXSA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0158DJQEE#wasThisHelpful","R3PTIBICRIWXSA","A26MGY7PAEKZPN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A26MGY7PAEKZPN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These work great! Just take it out of the package slip it on the door where the fold is, and it stops kiddos from getting in. As simple as that. I would suggest buying two, because it only comes two to a pack. These are also great to have when your out and about.

"I can't think of any reason not to love this little case. My wife has been looking at a lot of cases before deciding on this one, and so far she loves it! She originally had a slim little case that did a good job of protecting the sides and back of my brand new Galaxy Note 5, but provided no protection at all for the screen against a tiny piece of gravel on the sidewalk, and she wanted a case that would fit her debit/credit cards and ID so that she doesn't have to carry around a large bag.This little case took care of that and some. The case opens easily and closes securely. The magnet closure works so conveniently. The slots easily hold credit cards, identification, drivers license, etc. I haven't had any trouble using the phone with the case. When her phone rings, she opens up the case, and removes the phone so she doesn't have a huge bag up to her ears when talking on the phone. It also makes it super easy to be able to take photo's by just removing the phone from the magnet pouch, when in use.So far she loves this case, and highly recommends it to anyone looking for way to care your cards, cash, ID, and phone all in one!I received this product at a discount in exchange for my fair and honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3VAN4QQ9TO4MZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014177V4U#wasThisHelpful","R3VAN4QQ9TO4MZ","A26MGY7PAEKZPN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A26MGY7PAEKZPN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These collapsible bowls are something that I have never thought of having but are so useful! I often go to the park to walk and run and one of my dogs loves to be on the go with me and loves to run as well. There are times that it's been very hot outside and I haven't taken him due to not being able to have water for him. With the collapsible bowls now I can easily fit one or more into my tote bag or just keep in the car. Along with a bottle of water, he now has the ability to stay hydrated along with me on our summer excursions to the park or anywhere. I received three bowls in blue, orange and red, and each one is a good size for what I need and they are made from BPA free food grade silicone which is awesome because that means they are safe and durable. That also means that they are easy to clean with just soap and water or in the dishwasher.They are so cute and unique that my son loves to keep them for themselves as well!Please note that this review was done using the product supplied by IIyever for review.

"I have been using and testing this charger for a week now, and as you can see in the photo's this new Fast Chargers is FAST! I really enjoy just placing my phone on the pod, and it charging with my phone inside it's case I have not had any issues just setting it on the pad. I really love the automatic dimming of the light when it's charging so it's not a bright light shining in the room when we are trying to sleep.When you turn off the lights, the LED indicators dim off, so the room is dark when you need it, not glowing Blue/Green when it's placed on the charger. This alone is the greatest thing ever as the Samsung charger glows all night even when it's fully charged, you will see a 'soft glow' but the ChoeTech doesn't have that problem.Included in the box you get:1 x ChoeTech QI Fast Charger1 x Standard USB CableUser ManualI was able to use the 'Quick Charger' adapter from my Note 5 phone, however if not you may want to purchase the product that includes this.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RL0SGCQZU8W74/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015351VC2#wasThisHelpful","RL0SGCQZU8W74","A26MGY7PAEKZPN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A26MGY7PAEKZPN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was nervous about some of the negative reviews, but had to try it......I'm absolutely pleased so far.1 - It fits perfect. I'm wondering if different ears require a special fit, thus some of the negative fit reviews. I can literally work out and jump around and this thing will not fall out and is surprisingly comfortable.2 - Sound was Great! I was nervous I couldn't hear anything....my purpose for this device doesn't include using it to talk with, but for listening only.3 - Pairing was as easy as any other device I'd ever paired in the past; held the button until the red/blue flashed (about 4-5 seconds), it showed up on my phone, hit paired, done in less than a minute. I have a Samsung Galaxy Note 5 and iPhone 6 / 6 Plus used for testing. While I was not able to pair 2 devices at the same time, I was able to easily switch the out by turning on/off the bluetooth device and it automatically pairing, with that device.4 - There isn't a volume control, but thought that was a silly review since you can control the volume from the phone itself, but I suppose having it available on the piece itself, especially while driving, would be helpful....5 - One reason I purchased this was because it was the only ear piece that didn't protrude out of my ear preventing me from wearing a head band, beanie, or leaving it in while I slept for my alarm.6 - Call talk quality was okay, I was able to easily hear the caller, however they can tell I was talking on a bluetooth device, saying that i sounded 'Far Away', but all test calls reported that they can still hear me talking at a normal tone of voice.This is my initial review from just opening, pairing and testing it out.....and don't mind posting later as my concern would be durability and how long it would last. I wish there were more STEALTHY (as one review mentioned) options out there, but I could not find any.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2GCKPSULE67I5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012Z1UXE4#wasThisHelpful","R2GCKPSULE67I5","A26MGY7PAEKZPN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A26MGY7PAEKZPN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When you first get this, it does look extremely daunting when you look at it laid out flat. However it is very simple to put together. I didn't even look at the instructions, I just put the corrected numbered tabs into the correct holes. Everything came together nice and smooth! I scanned the QR Code and downloaded a few of the games. After playing around with it on and off for a few minutes at a time I started to get a headache, and a little nauseous, however my niece and nephew  LOVED it.

"This lamp was furninshed by Brightech in exchange for this unbiased critique, that said, it's a well designed lamp. The lamp comes  approximately half-assembled and only requires a #2 Phillips head screwdriver and 5 to 10 minutes to complete the assembly. The first thing I noticed is how solid it felt, call me old fashioned but ""heavy"" indicates a certain level of quality to me ...lol. The light itself is has an excellent bright-to-soft ratio, casts a wide beam and shines evenly  rather than a bright spot in the center and drastically dimmer around the perimeter as is case withe some led lamps and flashlights. The lamp's adjustable head lends versatility and convenience. Now, those factors plus it's almost clinical asthetic, leans this toward perhaps belonging in a doctor's office or crime lab imho. All in all, it ""feels"" like a lamp tha'll last for years to come and may be fine for some to use in their bed or living room but this is going in my workshop where it'll be most useful.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RFPIH6M091JWO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VJ4SFQW#wasThisHelpful","RFPIH6M091JWO","A3TDRVCWRM5GD7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3TDRVCWRM5GD7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is an interesting product, one I'd never tried before so when I offered a sample for review I accepted with curiosity. I've been using this on my beard and mustache for about two weeks now and really love this stuff. Aside from keeping my beard & 'stache looking healthy and smooth, it also has a very pleasant aroma. My facial hair isn't very long so some of this balm stays on the skin, I was concerned about a reaction as I sometimes get w/ ""safe"" products but neery a pimple developed so that concern is no more!

"I recieved a sample of this showerhead for review and I really enjoyed it. The shower head's low profile makes it very sleek & stylish. I installed it using an extended standard showerhead pipe which leaves the wide showerhesd leaning slightly.

"Bought at my local HD a few months ago for professional use and they've held up to moderate use. I liked the fact that this set  included the short chisel and bull point.

"I received a sample of this flashlight in exchange for a fair review. I don't just hand out 5 star reviews, I really like this flashlight. I was surprised at the solid feel and weight of this mid-sized flashlight. The main beam comes from a high intensity type LED bulb while the secondary/lamp side is a collection of the soft type bulbs. The flashing red light is visible from a relatively good distance at night, really important in a situation like it's intended for, a roadside emergency at night. The magnet is strong that it holds the the flashlight complete horizontally. I've been using this as my ""main"" flashlight at work for a month now to really gauge it for this review and it's performed extremely well having proven useful in every situation, from working under a sink to the crawl spaces under the properties.

"I own a larger JuicyPack 16,000+ miliamp device charger and love that battery but I prefer using this one. The main reason is the stand function, even at less than 1/2 the power reserve as my other Life Charge device it powers my tablet through hours of movies while simultaneously powering/charging one of my small Bluetooth speakers making it a mini, portable entertainment hub. The single LED may seem like a gimmick but has come in handy for finding and orienting those usb cables. All of these features make this battery, (which I received in exchange for review), very impressive AND convenient which is why I gave it 5 stars, (not something I do unless a product really impresses me).

"I needed this for professional use and was shopped around for a while looking at many small rotary hammers. Considering that I only needed one for masonry drilling tasks too big for my cordless 1/2"" hammer drill and occasional tile demolition anything larger than 1-1/8"" was overkill for me. Over 90% of my tools are Milwaukee and looked hard at their 5262 model but decided to go with this one over the Milwaukee because that one is rated 7/8"" and 1.8 lbs impact energy vs this one's 1"" and 2.5 lbs impact energy. I also liked the fact that this model has vibration dampening modules on the handle. I clocked this DeWalt, w/ a moderately used Hilti 1/2"" x 6"" TE-CX bit, at 13 seconds to drill a 4"" deep hole. I've had it for a few weeks now and demo'ed 2 small bathroom floors easily. It's performed as well of not better than I expected. The case is just ""OK"", as are all of DeWalt's plastic cases but it DOES have room for alot of bits and acrutements like gloves & goggles. For $200, ($50 more than the 25222k and $20 more than the smaller Milwaukee), it's a solid buy for professional and diy'er alike.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1DTODA5Y1MZ36/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003J5W4ZC#wasThisHelpful","R1DTODA5Y1MZ36","A3TDRVCWRM5GD7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3TDRVCWRM5GD7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I've owned, used and worn out, literally, dozens of backpacks over the years including more than a few canvas ones. This one has been among my favorites, it's deceptively roomy for it's size and the layout, design, asthetic and materials are excellent. The larger pockets make it ideal for a laptop, books or clothing with the 3 smaller pockets balancing that out. Due to a recent blizzard forcast I decided to pack in orer to spend the night at work. I'm fastidiously bent on being efficient and ""ready for anything"" so I tend to over prepare. The amount of clothing, toiletries and other odds & ends like cologne, device chargers, flashlight, umbrella, snacks etc, that fit into this smaller canvas bag was pretty amazing. Granted, EVERYTHING was neatly folded, tucked and packed, (as spacial reasoning dictated). Needless to say it was heavy  to the point I worried I'd bust a zipper or strap but nope, the thing held together and, despite it's now swollen appearance, the magnetic clasps on the flap kept it closed (!?), that impresed me. I own another brown canvas/leather backpack the I used for YEARS, and am still very fond of, and this bag is right there with that one in terms of how utalitarian and stylish it is. I paid $50 for my other brown canvas bag which I'd rate 6 stars if I could, I received THIS bag as a complimentary sample for review and at $35 it's a great buy for anyone looking for a solid compact backpack.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2AF3QQ2SEYB9J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OVA8V4W#wasThisHelpful","R2AF3QQ2SEYB9J","A3TDRVCWRM5GD7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3TDRVCWRM5GD7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

So far so good, the drivers are light weight and the shanks feel sturdy enough to handle moderate punishment. The handles don't feel so tough but hey for the price and household use I can't knock their ""diy'er grade"" handles. I like that the flathead is fluted, allowing for better hold on those flathead screws. The clip that comes w/ these is great as it keeps them in place and has mounting holes.

"I'm a professional handyman and electrician's assistant/mechanic I'm also predominantly a Milwaukee tools user but always preferred Bosch or Hilti accessories for masonry. I can tell you however that these bits have performed just as well as the afore mentioned names over and over again. My first set lasted over a year seeing mild-to-moderate weekly use, (w/ occasional careful conditioning on a bench grinder). The size selection includes the most common diameters and is ideal for use on cordless 1/2"" hammer drills. I also owned a Vermont American set  that's nowhere near the quality of these bits, which by the way are ""Made In Germany"". The ""3 flat secure grip"" design of the bigger bits is nice touch as they're prone to slipping in the chuck. Along with the other sizes we get two 1/4"" bits as this is the most commonly needed diameter for many smaller masonry fastener applications.

"These are ""just ok"" as is but with a little modification they're ultra comfortable. I cut out some pieces of foam I had lying around, (the same kind of generic white foam that's in these), and inserted it into the knee pads adding a second layer of padding. I don't need knee pads every day and so didn't want to spend $30 or $40 on premium pads and went with this >$10 pair. After using this type of knee pad on rough surfaces like concrete or rocky dirt the hard plastic develops gouges that can scratch some floors so be mindful of the plastic's condition. Aside from that the plastic does provide great protection. I've used them sparingly since getting them and can't complain, they stay on, don't slip much and feel good enough to wear for hours w/o much discomfort.

I own 3 cordless reciprocating saws, (M12 Hackzall, V18 Hatchet Sawzall & Bosch 18v Lithium), but I needed corded power and this saw, at 10amp and a 1-1/8"" stroke length, delivers the power and aggressive cutting speed I require on all my demanding demo and cutting applications. With a good metal cutting blade, ie: Diablo or MIlwaukee, 3"" steel pipe is cake, pretty much everything I've put this tool to has been a breeze to cut. The vertical and horizontal blade interface isn't a gimmick as some have noted because turning the saw to get a horizontal cut isn't always easy nor feasible. The ""cage"" around the blade catch collects a ton of debris but is an excellent safety feature and can be easily opened one one side by loosening a single flat head set screw. About 2 months ago the blade catch seized on me disallowing blade insertion but  a quick spritz of Liquid Wrench, (which won't damage the plastic and rubber parts like WD-40 because it's silicone), literally 5 seconds later it loosened right up. I've known a few guys that have thrown out Sawzalls and other reciprocating saws because of that, not knowing they could've just hit them with a little WD-40 or Liquid Wrench. I've put this saw through moderate rigors over the last 6 months and maintained it well but will upgrade to 5 stars after some really heavy use.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1LEV1J4MNHXN8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0002AJNQ0#wasThisHelpful","R1LEV1J4MNHXN8","A3TDRVCWRM5GD7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3TDRVCWRM5GD7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was shopping for a stubby driver set for professional, daily use and chose this becuse of the ratcheting feature and price point. Stanley is a great name in tools but I always viewed it as ""homeowner"" grade like Black & Decker, (the Stanley Proto line is a whole other beast however). I put a 2"" extension on it and have used it as my tool belt, go-to screwdriver over the last few weeks and it's held up so far. They cap holds 7 bits and grips the extra bits tightly which is great because other ""pro-level""/""premium"" multi bit drivers I own can't hold the bits in place and the  rattling bits inside the handles are just annoying. So far I like this driver and even if I destroy it next month it's inexpensive enough that it wouldn't mattrr much.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3EE275QANCSY8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003HGH3YK#wasThisHelpful","R3EE275QANCSY8","A3TDRVCWRM5GD7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3TDRVCWRM5GD7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The lovely (but PICKY) wife needed new Winter boots and I picked these to surprise her. I've bought her several shoes boots and sneakers in the past here on Amazon and I'm either lucky or gifted at knowing exactly what she'll love. These boots were another score, she opened the box and said ""ooh!, wow they're sexy"". They fit her loose at first as her foot kind of ""swam"" inside the boot but I put an extra insole in them and are now not only do they fit snugly around her foot but they're more comfortable with the extra cushioning. She's now worn these through 2 snow storms, a few 20 degree days and a recent cold rainy day and NO complaints.

"Full disclosure, I recieved this as a complimentary sample for review. That said, I've been using it daily to test it out for this review and I like it alot. It's really easy to use, small enough to throw into a pocket and take everywhere. Most of us have smart phones that feature a voice recorder and mp3 player, so why get this right?...because the phone has to be taken out, the app opened, started and the phone held to record something. I've been using this to record reminders, take notes and remember little things I notice or are funny that I'd otgerwise forget. The mp3 player works well and sounds decent and w/ 8gbs it holds plenty of files. The kit is packed w/ useful accesories like a small microphone, land line jack, 4/3 pin charger and headphones. The menus and functions are almost self explanitory. Understandably the screen is on the small side since this is a compact unit and the backlit display helps out with this. I'll raise it to 5 stars once I've had it for a while longer and fill the memory alot more to see how long it lasts and performs. Overall this little recorder is now one of those things I automatically take everywhere with me, like my keys, wallet, phone, Swisstool, Zippo and now, the recorder too.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R32DXCYGP38WZ8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00P9SI8IE#wasThisHelpful","R32DXCYGP38WZ8","A3TDRVCWRM5GD7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3TDRVCWRM5GD7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

THIS is one of such purchases, the last pair of sneakers I'd bought my youngest I got in his actual size at the time. The problem is that was only in September for ""back to school"" and already they were tight...lol. Back to THESE, he loved the look, mommy loved the strap and I loved the price. We've bought our kids many Skechers in the past so we know they're more than decent shoes.

Quality-wise I'd place it between the Greenlee and Knipex names. As for performance this thing has stood up to everything I've thrown AT it and everthing I've thrown IT at. The weight of this tool, plus the reaming head, make this plier (and the 12"") an ideal impromtu hammering device.

"I want to first say that I received a complimentary sample of this speaker in exchange for an honest review. If anyone looks at my review history they'll see that I rate at 5 stars only when a product EXCEEDS my expectations and this speaker does just that. Keep in mind that not only am I describing this objectively and on it's own but SUBjectively and in comparison to 1 other Bluetooth mini-speaker and 1 non-Bluetooth mini-speaker I own. This is touted as a 'shower/bath-time' Bluetooth speaker, which it IS, but it's also an all around ""take anywhere"" device. The sound is crisp and loud for this size speaker, part of the reason is that the speaker portion is around the perimeter the bottom where the sound actually bounces off whatever surface we place it on, keeping in mind, that acoustically, tile and other materials like it provide a kind of ""amplifiying"" affect. Battery life isn't bad at all, as I've gone through entire 20 song playlists w/o having to recharge it but I haven't clocked the time per say. The suction cup is pretty cool as it allows me to pop this speaker to many surfaces as opposed to sitting it on a horizontal surface like my other mini-speakers. The reason I view this as a ""take anywhere"" device as I said earlier, are the call buttons, because of these I take this in my car and to job sites. Overall a reeeally speaker at a reasonable price.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1T6F7YZGM9FVS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N69MYU6#wasThisHelpful","R1T6F7YZGM9FVS","A3TDRVCWRM5GD7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3TDRVCWRM5GD7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Full disclosure: I received a complimentary red press in exchange for this review. On to the actual review. I'm by no means a coffee aficionado or snob, I am however, a coffee lover and and addict. That said, I'm also an ""efficiency"" or speed freak and this press delivers on all fronts. I've used an Aero Press for the last couple of years and loved it because the speed and ease of use. The downsides I've found to the Aero Press are that it doesn't have the capacity to make more than a cup at a time and the filter hasto be replaced every time, (essentially a 1 cup/1 filter ratio). Something the Aero Press possesses over this is that I can make espresso with it BUT that's the ONLY advantage. All of that said, this  press has replaced the latter. I love this thing, I zap my water for 45 seconds in the microwave during which time I'll put the grounds in this, get my light brown sugar and cream and fave mug out. Pour my hot water in, stir & wait about 20 seconds, (allowing the water to really grab the oils & flavor), plunge and pour.Another advantage of this is clean up, I just toss the grounds, (flush them down the toilet actually =-O), pour dish soap and hot water back into it and let it sit until I return from work then it's a quick rinse and done, (occasionally I do dismantle and thoroughly clean every part though).

It's lasted me this long only because I've been wearing Lacoste, Leu Di Issey and Domain in between but this one IS my scent. This time around I went w/ the combination shower gel package simply because of the price here. The shower gel smells as good as the cologne and the bouquet lasts surprisingly long.

Some of my other favorites include Leau d'Issey, Dolce & Gabbana (dark blue), Carolina Herrera & Chanel Egoiste Platinum. The compliments I've received on this particular scent have been several and from both men and women. Compliments and inquiries I  receive regarding other scents I wear aren't rare but THIS fragrance seems to have an intangible effect on the females that wander into it's range because I've never had so many woman say how ""awesome"" I smell.

"I bought this at a local retailer last year and happened to come across it here on Amazon prompting me to review it. This detector has worked exactly the way it was designed to work each and every one of the thousand times I've used it. Prior to this voltage detector I used a Milwaukee 2202-20 which was excellent. When it came time to replace it I went w/ this one instead only because of the sensitivity dial feature. Both tools have their pros & cons: the 2202-20 can be turned on and left on a live wire while I went to an unlabeled box and it would stop beeping once I'd found the right switch which saved time, something that can't be done with this tool b/c it's only ON when the button is held so I've to walk back & forth to test whether the right breaker wss tripped. On the other hand the sensitivity dial has helped alot in that it detects voltage through denser materials than the Milwaukee when set to high. This tool actually has 2 buttons, the first is near the tip which is for setting the dial and using over & over, while the actual dial can ALSO be pressed allowing for adjustments without going back & forth from dial to button. Overall I'm happy with this tool and the price is reasonable here.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RUQYFAPP3P2G5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000GLAC5G#wasThisHelpful","RUQYFAPP3P2G5","A3TDRVCWRM5GD7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3TDRVCWRM5GD7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In order to satisfy my moderate tool addiction I purchased 3 Circuit Alert tools last year on impulse and have used them only sparingly b/c I predominantly use my Knipex and Greenlee electrical tools on the job. That said, these have work well when I HAVE used them. One can tell immediately that the materials aren't the same degree of quality as say ""Klein"" or ""Knipex"" but rather in line w/ a name like Stanley (which are more than decent tools). I say this not to knock Stanley or Black & Decker type tools but because they're simply not for professional use day in & day out. This Gardener Bender line is unique in that it possesses a built in voltage detector which is a ""useful novelty"". The tool can be flipped, the button held down and the non-contact detector will flash and beep if there's power. Additionally the detector can be removed and used as a simple, stand alone voltage sensor. I was surprised to find out that this line is also insulated (1000v rated) which makes it, not only, all the more versatile but a tremendous value compared to other insulated electrical tools. The stripping end of this has cut well for me, no worse than my Greenlee stripper, and the spring adds ease-of-use to the equation.

"I want to start by stating that I'm in no way a mountaineer, climber or even a Winter sports enthusiast, what I am is an outdoors guy that cares about quality and asthetic. These boots possess all of the qualities I look for in a cold weather/Winter boot, they're waterproof, warm, lightweight, superior traction and look great. I can't stress enough how comfortable these boots have become after a few weeks of wear. My prior experience w/ the Adidas Terrex line is that, in order to hug the foot, they run a bit small/tight so I purchased these a 1/2 size bigger and even then are snug. I'm flat footed mind you and certain shoes are a bit narrow for me but nevertheless the extra 1/2 size is perfect. Aside from all the stated pluses, I've been complimented by a half dozen strangers as well as friends & aquaintances. The ONLY reason I didn't go all ""5-Star"" on these YET, is that I've only had them for a few weeks and want to really gauge them over this entire Northeastern New Jersey Winter first, snow, Ice muck and salt, everything this little boy loves ;-). All in all the $200+ I paid might seem steep for some but, like my Fast X GTX, these will last for years.*Update:After 2 recent snowfalls and 9-20 temperatures these boot performed and achieved 5-star status. Walking and standing for 8 hours a day over the course of the 3 days I wore them to work to really gauge them my feet stayed warm, sweaty warm.

For the price I'm ok with them and may get them again for dressier shoes but for boots I'll keep looking for thicker ones.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RT3A5LP4FUUOA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009211M3M#wasThisHelpful","RT3A5LP4FUUOA","A3TDRVCWRM5GD7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3TDRVCWRM5GD7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"After using, (and really digging), the Milwaukee folding saw for a while I found that it wasn't solid enough to replace a good jab saw so i bought this. Most jab saws  cut through drywall like a hot knife through butter when they're new and this one's no different. The differences I notice here is that the blade is an inch longer and stiffer (insert falic joke here_____ lmao) than my old Klein. The grip sits in my hand almost as if it were designed around my palm, maybe not the same for everyone but it's still really ergonomic. I still use the folding saw occasionally but not so much for drywall anymore. Nothing can replace a quality, traditional jab saw, especially one built like this.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1DNHYLK9HX38D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003I85GTQ#wasThisHelpful","R1DNHYLK9HX38D","A3TDRVCWRM5GD7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3TDRVCWRM5GD7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"First off, full disclosure: I received a complimentary bottle in exchage for this review. That said, I've been taking Omega-3 fish oil for years, from several different manufacturers and had settled on one recently, a brand sold in large quantities at Walgreens & Duane Reade among other places that has a catalog of over 200 supplements, HOWEVER, I like these better. First of all for their price, this bottle of 180 double strength capsules costs about what a 100 capsule bottle of the 'concentrated pearl capsules' I've been buying and contain 99% the stated amount of Omega-3 in those pearl capsules. These capsules ARE larger than the average fish oil capsule but I really don't mind that even though I take them 3 or 4 times a week, 2 or 3 at a time. I expected a fishy taste after a while of taking these but it never came. Over the last 2 weeks I've gone through a considerable number of these but don't mind as they're priced reasonably enough that I'll definitely order more in the near future.

"I couldn't be more satisfied w/ these headphones. First off the sound is excellent, loud AND clear. They literally sound WAYYY better than a $70 pair of Apple iPod headphones I own. The obvious convenience here being that these are wireless/Bluetooth, but, unlike other Bluetooth headphones available, these are self-contained to the earpieces as opposed to the 'neck bar' that many of those others have. The battery life here is great so far, lasting for hours & hours, at moderate volume, before needing a charge. I was skeptical about then staying in my ear as I rode my bike or worked out but they stay IN, thanks to the soft rubber supports and the in-swept design. The kit brings a usb-to-mini usb charging cable, spare buds and supports, very nice stuff. The ONLY down side with this is proximity, mine lose contact after about 10 feet but not a big deal b/c they're for my workouts so my phone's always on me. The only reason I didn't go 5-Star is that with my phone IN pocket, there's an occasional, completely random, unintended disconnect that has only  occurred a couple of times but is annoying enough to juuust keep it out of the 5-Star arena imho.

"Prior to buying this set I owned a Harbor Freight 50 piece set that imho was borderline garbage for any kind of professional use. This set is 10 times more solid. The 3/8"" ratchet itself is apparently built to last and uses an easy-to-reach lever to switch direction rather than the standard twist switch on the the back of the tool head. Another feature of the ratchet is the push button release. The variety of sizes included is not bad as it's covered every nut and bolt I've encountered. One accessory that sold me on.this set is the 1/4"" square-to-hex adapter for driving bits, an accessory that I've had before from other brands but non as solid as the one included here.

"In my experience Hitachi makes good tools but they make 3 particular tools VERY well. Those are rotary hammers & breakers, miter saws and reciprocating saws. This recipro confirms that notion.

The 2 afore mentioned tools have a 1/2"" & 3/4"" stoke respectively which covers most of my cutting needs but the 1-1/8"" stroke on the Hitachi makes it a great demo saw. The power is there, I recently chopped a 10' theater sized couch into 3 pieces using this w/ a 10"" Milwaukee demo blade and this guy didn't bog down, jam or otherwise fail.

"I'm a longtime Milwaukee tool user but decided on Hitachi for my business to avoid leaving my more expensive Milwaukee tools in the handa of less experienced and sometimes less careful workers. I needed less expensive tools that performed and I found that in Hitachi. I considered Ryobi for my purposes but those tools just don't cut it, (or fasten it...;-) ), in a professional, day after day environment. The tools are ergonomic and have performed very well thusfar. The yellowish task light on the drill and impact driver is just 'ok' and the fact they're turned on/off independently makes it a novelty but may come in handy some day. The circular saw has cut alot of wood and just as well as a DeWalt saw I had for years and Hitachi makes excellent reciprocating saws and the one included in the kit is no different. Another factor in choosing Hitachi is the 10-year tool warranty. As a whole, this kit and the grinder kit I bought separately were solid investments.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RB6Y4HG8F4XEL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003CLL2UQ#wasThisHelpful","RB6Y4HG8F4XEL","A3TDRVCWRM5GD7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3TDRVCWRM5GD7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Owning a 10 amp. 4-1/2"" Milwaukee grinder I needed something lighter and more portable so I decided on this Hitachi. So far so good, I've used it on lighter applications like removing concrete sealant from between coping stones and wire wheel applications. It's perfomed really well on those jobs, providing good power and battery life. I'm not a huge fan of locking switches on ANY power tool, much less a grinder, but the solution is simple, I don't use the lock. The guard is a screw down type-1 which is 'ok' to me but that's because I'm accustomed to a spring lock guard so no biggy there either.

"I bought this not only to use at home but to put to professional use. I have it attached to an 18v Ryobi drill that I bought to  use exclusively w/ this, as a safety precaution I taped the chuck shut over the interface on this after unknowingly loosening it then lowering it and dropping the drum onto my foot (OUCH!). the locking tip is a little bit of a hassle to loosen and tighten after inserting each span of auger at first but after a little practice one gets the hang of it. The drum has a 'piggy bank' type plug on the side that serves to spray Liquid Wrench or WD40 onto the auger. Currently using a 25' 1/4"" drop point auger in this. I also purchased the larger General Pipe Super Vee but at $450, more powerful and being corded I seldom use it as this smaller unit clears 90% of the drains I've used it in.

"I'll never forget Frederick Forsyth's first three books: The Day of the Jackal, The Odessa File and The Dogs of War. More than anything else Forsyth has written, these books combine his skills as a novelist with those of an experienced journalist. I've read these books at least twice and enjoyed them again, each time.Frederick Forsyth's The Outsider describes how these books came to be written (although some of the details regarding the Dogs of War may have been left out - I'll get to that later). The Outsider is an autobiographical sketch. Reading the Outsider I was reminded once again what a good writer Forsyth can be.Autobiography is, by its nature, at least partially fictional. Only a rare person has real insight into their own life. We are always heroes of our own story. This makes autobiography a challenge to write. If we're lucky there are long stretches of our lives that would be boring to relate, although they are pleasant to live.By Forsyth's account he is a restless soul and always has been. From a young age he wanted to see fly (for the Royal Air Force) and to see foreign countries. He succeeded in both of these. He managed to hustle his way into the RAF, without a university degree or any social connections.From there, with equal hustle, he managed to secure a position at the Reuters News Bureau, first in Paris and then in East Germany. Forsyth's success at Reuters was aided by his language skills:  He became fluent in French, German, Spanish and picked up some Russian.After his tour in East Germany, Forsyth joined the BBC and got assigned to Africa, where he covered the civil war between Nigeria and Biafra (a breakaway region of Nigeria). As a war correspondent, Forsyth was in danger on a number of occasions. He also developed a deep respect of the Biafran leader Odumegwu Emeka Ojukwu.About a third of the book is on the Biafra war and this was probably the seminal event in Forsyth's life. At the time the BBC was following the official line of the British government, which was backing Nigeria. Forsyth refused to report the ""party line"" and this resulted in him being forced out of the BBC.After leaving the BBC Forsyth became a freelance journalist, in Biafra and other places. He managed, at one point, to get an interview with the retired Israeli Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion.During the Israeli struggle for independence there were a number of factions. The most violent were known as the Stern Gang and the Irgun. Ben-Gurion despised the violent factions, since he believed that they hurt Israel's cause.  Menachem Began, who was also Prime Minister of Israel, was  part of the Irgun which blew up the King David hotel in Jerusalem.  There were civilian casualties and this terrorist act gave the Israeli independence movement a black eye.  The Irgun later claimed that they warned the British to evacuate the hotel.According to Forsyth he was drinking in a bar in Israel with members of the Israel military. A man, outside the group he was with pulled him aside and asked him if he was British. The man allegedly then told Forsyth that he had something to confess: he drove the explosives into the parking garage under the hotel. It was he who called to warn the British to warn them. But the low ranking military person who answered the phone refused to believe him.Autobiography is fiction and this event seems more fictional than real. Strange things to happen, but this event is outlandish in its improbability.After being forced out of the BBC, Forsyth needed to make some money. While staying at a woman friend's apartment he decided to write a novel, which he says in retrospect was a crazy idea. The novel he wrote was The Day of the Jackal and it became a bestseller, launching Forsyth's career as a writer. The Day of the Jackal was followed by The Odessa File, which was also a great success.According to some accounts, Forsyth's description of the genesis of his third novel, The Dogs of War, may leave out some details.The Dogs of War is a wonderfully detailed account of a coup to overthrow a vicious African dictator. Forsyth carefully researched how arms can be purchased on the black market and how a small band of experienced, heavily armed mercenaries could overthrow a dictator who is kept in power only by a small, corrupt and poorly trained guards.The question with The Dogs of War is whether the research was for a novel or something more. In The Outsider Forsyth writes that The Dogs of War was so carefully researched that it could serve as a manual for such a coup.  And indeed it may have been exactly that.  In his book The Wonga Coup, Adrian Roberts writes:""Forsyth  who adopted the name Mr. Van Cleef  hoped to replace Macias with his close friend, the regional Biafran leader, Odumegwu Emeka Ojukwu. That made sense as Equatorial Guinea, in 1973, was still home to thousands of Nigerian Igbo people from Biafra, skilled laborers who worked in the coca plantations. They would have backed Ojkwu as the new President.Interviewed in April 2006, Forsyth now admits there was a stillborn attempt at a coup. Asked whether he helped plot it, he says his memory is vague: I dont know whether I thought of it, or someone else. As for the relationship between the coup attempt and his novel, he is not sure which came first: It was a chicken and egg situation. Im not sure if the authors of the plot listened to me, or I listened to them We were sitting around in pubs discussing it . people with a lot of beer in them.""""He also knew [Alexander Ramsay] Gay  a level-headed Scot  from Biafra, and conceded that the two had co-operated. Yes, we were talking, meeting in pubs, over Fernando Po, he says. He admits, too, giving the police a character reference regarding Gay, after a bag with guns was traced to the Scot. And, finally, he admits passing money to the coup plotters: Yes, payments where made, always cash. Though he suggests this was for information only. Asked bluntly if he plotted a coup in Equatorial Guinea he laughed and suggested you put in the book what you have found.Alexander Gay, his colleagues and their ship loaded with arms was intercepted in Spain. The arms were confiscated and Gay and company were deported back to their home countries (in Gay's case, the UK).  Adrian Roberts writes that the unfortunate result of the failed coup was that the vicious dictatorship in Equatorial Guinea continued for another seven years.Writing is a quiet, solitary, pursuit and Forsyth's life settled down to that of a novelist, not a war correspondent. The last quarter of the book recounts this part of his life. Perhaps respecting the privacy of his wives (he has been married twice and is still married to his second wife), they are mentioned only briefly.As the end of the book nears, Forsyth seems to struggle for material (after all, life is good). He is divorced (he doesn't go into any detail about this) and falls victim to a fraudulent investment fund. He goes sailing with his sons and recounts a scene with a bird that has flown from Africa only to die in Florida. He goes on a trip to Africa where his son shoots a gazelle (which, Forsyth notes, are overpopulating in the area they are hunting).Forsyth recounts a few other adventures to relieve his restlessness.  Forsyth writes that he was asked by the British secret service to exchange documents with a spy for the British in East Germany (during the Soviet period). If this account is true, then the British service is remarkably unprofessional. It would be surprising if the British would put an untrained civilian at risk in this way. In addition to the danger to Forsyth there would be the career ending embarrassment of a prominent writer being arrested for espionage.Forsyth also goes sky diving and at one point travels to the African country Guinea-Bissau. While he is visiting, there is a coup (which he had nothing to do with). In The Outsider Forsyth writes:""The tiny republic was sealed off.""""In London, my wife, Sandy, knowing nothing of this, e-mailed a girlfriend to set up a lunch date. Part of her text read: ""I'm free this week 'cos Freddie is in Guinea-Bissau"".""Someone in Fort Meade, maryland, or maybe Langley, Virginia, intercepted this and her screen went berserk. Her message disappeared. Things flashed up with the insignia of the Great Seal of the United States warning her not to use her laptop under any circumstances.""This account is even more unlikely than the account of the Irgun member confessing to the bombing of the King David hotel in a bar in Israel. Autobiography may be fiction but in this case, the fiction is not even plausible.Forsyth's final hurrah involves research for his novel The Kill List. He hires a security specialist who goes by the name of Dom and goes to Mogadishu, in Somalia (the scene of ""Black Hawk Down"" and the death of US Army Rangers.) Forsyth spends a few hair raising days there, risking death and, perhaps worse, kidnapping.As with most people who are older, Forsyth can see his sun moving toward the horizon in the East. The Outsider provides some insight into the life of a wonderful novelist, who has written some classic works. Memory betrays us all as we get older. What is true and what is imagination can blur. But with Forsyth's writing, it is usually a pleasure to read.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1LXM73OH7ZKR3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0399176071#wasThisHelpful","R1LXM73OH7ZKR3","A2RELU94NM7RWI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RELU94NM7RWI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

He is one of those writers who is so good that I reread his books several times (I want to go back and read Terminal Cafe again).Luna is the first novel that Ian McDonald has written after his Everness young adult trilogy (Planesrunner, Be My Enemy and Empress of the Sun). Planesrunner was a good, but not great book. The series ran down from there. Empress of the Sun was a largely forgettable work. These books did not come close to showcasing McDonald's prodigious talents. Luna does.Luna is McDonald at has best and one of the best books in his long career of writing. The world that McDonald has created is rich and complex. The characters are deeply drawn, with complex motivations and personalities.As with most of McDonald's books, he takes ideas and expands on them. One of these is the extreme libertarian society of the moon, where all things are governed by contract and there is not law outside of contract. This is a world that repels some of the characters in the novel and gives others a chance to create a dynasty.The weekend before I wrote this review I saw the movie The Martian based on Andy Wier's book (which I read when it first came out).Ian McDonald's book Luna made me realize that the fascination with Mars is a romantic one. If humans are to settle space, the Moon is a much better place to start. Sending humans, as opposed to robots, to Mars is madness.Because the Moon is closer to the Sun, there is more solar energy available. The Moon is also partially in the shadow of the Earth, so there is more protection from radiation. And the Moon is much closer.  If an orbital elevator were constructed, the cost of moving material from Earth might be low enough that building settlements would be possible. The cost of sending anything to Mars is much higher.I could write much more about the fascinating complexities of McDonald's Luna. But really, what's the point? Buy the book and read it.So who might not like the book?  There is some violence. The book contains some graphic sex of various flavors. If reading about sex bothers you, then you're not going to like the book. It is not, by the way, erotica, which is designed to titillate. The sex naturally grows out of the plot. Although I admit that one of the sex scenes was hot.The story is complicated and some people don't enjoy complicated plots. There is a dramatis personae at the start of the book and I had to use it as a reference in a few cases. But this is not Bulgakov's Master and Margarita - the plot of Luna is clear, although convoluted in some cases.Oh, and one other thing... The story doesn't end with this book. In fact, the book ends with a cliffhanger. McDonald has planned a sequel.  But this is a feature, not a bug, since it provides the motivation to reread this fantastic book when the sequel comes out.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2IKCXMDYLQIH5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00V34YJE0#wasThisHelpful","R2IKCXMDYLQIH5","A2RELU94NM7RWI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RELU94NM7RWI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This product first emerged in the consciousness of the Internet with a YouTube video ad that went viral. The ad tapped into anxieties that are usually feminine: do you worry about that first weekend with your new boyfriend where you poop at his house? Poo-Pourri is there to eradicate this anxiety.Amazing stuff, does exactly what it says it does.  Lasts a long time, since you only use a few sprays.  Great for close quarters like an office bathroom,  hotel or cruise ship cabin bathroom.  We've tried several of the various fragrances offered, they all have a predominantly citrus scent.

"The Roman Empire rimmed the entire Mediterranean basin, including modern Spain, France, Italy, parts of Germany, Turkey, Greece and the Middle East. For a time the Empire included Britain as well. When the fastest method of travel and communication was the horse, this is remarkable.As a unified entity the Roman Empire collapsed around 400 AD. Commentators constantly discuss the factors that caused the collapse of the Empire. This collapse is ascribe to immorality, the rise of Christianity (Gibbon) or the lead pipes that carried the water for the city of Rome.The fact that it took almost 400 years for the empire to fall apart is surprising.The Empire was expanded by Julius Caesar and his heir, August Caesar, who also sowed the seeds of its demise. By seizing dictatorial power, Julius Caesar overthrew the Senatorial oligarchy that had ruled Rome for hundreds of years. Caesar's assumption dictatorial power and his subsequent murder laid the foundation for Augustus' rule, which started to subvert the rule of the Roman oligarchy. By the time Nero assumed power dictatorial power had degenerated into insanity and bloodshed. The fact that an Empire with this foundation survived as long as it did suggests that the wrong question is being asked. Rather than asking why Rome fell, we should instead ask what factors allowed it to survive for 400 years.Tom Holland's book Dynasty: the rise and fall of the house of Caesar is a rambling account of the Julian and Claudian dynasty. The time span is approximately 130 years, from Julius Caesar's assumption of autocratic power to the death of Nero at the hands of the Roman praetorian guard. Holland's Dynasty covers the reins of Augustus, Tiberius, Caligula, Claudius and Nero, whose death ended the dynasty.This is a huge historical period. There is a vast literature on Julius Caesar, including Adrian Goldsworthy's excellent Caesar: Life of a Colossus. There are also excellent books on August, including Anthony Everett's Augustus: the Life of the Rome's Emperor.  There are fewer books on Caligula, Claudius and Nero. Necessarily, Holland can only provide an overview of events and the players in those events.The result is a rambling history of the Julian Claudian dynasty. The classical world and the outlook of people in that world was dramatically different than ours. At various points Holland branches off into digressions on slavery and other features of Roman society. Some of these digressions are interesting. Holland provides a brief sketch of the poet Ovid, who was a notorious rake in his time (and eventually exiled by Augustus for immorality). Holland leaves out Virgil who was a friend of Augustus. In the section that covers Nero's reign, Holland also provides some of the history of the Stoic philosopher Seneca, who was Nero's tutor and adviser.Holland has written a number of histories and novels. He can be an excellent and engaging writer. In this book, however, his skills as a writer don't shine here, perhaps because of the huge span of history that he attempts to cover. This rambling history becomes tedious as the actors move in and out of the story. Reading the book cover to cover started to become a slog that finally ended in the bloodshed of Nero.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1HRE00TZ1D85P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385537840#wasThisHelpful","R1HRE00TZ1D85P","A2RELU94NM7RWI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RELU94NM7RWI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I recently spent a week scuba diving. I bought a laptop computer, an iPad, a cell phone that supported international roaming, a dive computer, an underwater camera and an underwater light. Plus chargers and cables for all of these devices and a plug adapter to provide extra outlets.When I went on this trip I didn't have this backpack.  Everything was piled into a couple of compartments in the backpack.The Thule backpack is the backpack for the world of pervasive computing. It has lots of padded compartments and pockets. The rear compartment will fit a full size laptop. A pocket in front will fit an iPad. There are other pockets for all of the chargers and cables that go along with our devices. Plus additional space for books, pens and notebooks (of the paper variety).The construction of the backpack is very good. It looks like it will survive the stress of being shoved under an airplane seat.The straps are padded and come with a clip that holds the straps together, so it is comfortable to wear the backpack.

"I have been resentfully buying HP printer cartridges for years. The package of red, blue, yellow and black cartridges at CostCo cost about $60. I've tried to have CostCo refill my empty cartridges, but a refilled cartridge will not work in my HP Photosmart printer.I am happy to say that my days of buying HP printer cartridges are over. The Epson ET-2550 printer is a great printer/scanner/copier and it takes inexpensive liquid ink. According to the box, the ink lasts two years. If I had to replaced the ink today, it would only cost me $28 (including shipping). The savings in HP ink would pay for the printer in a few years.I have tested all of the printer functions: printing documents, printing photographs on photo paper, scanning and copying. The quality in all cases is good as my HP Photosmart 309a printer.An important issue to understand with this printer is that it does not come with a wired network (Ethernet) port. It has a USB type B port that allows it to be connected directly to a computer or it can be connected to the home network as a network printer via WiFi. You can also use the TP-LINK Printer server (or a similar product) to support wired network printing via the USB port (see below).All devices on your WiFi network should be able to talk to the Epson printer. I was able to print from two of our Windows computers that have WiFi connections. You do have to install the drivers from the CD that comes with the printer since this is a new printer and doesn't seem to be in the Windows printer driver repository. The CD also has Mac drivers as well.My network has a TP-LINK wired firewall/router that connects to the Ethernet cable that comes out of my Comcat Cable modem. I support WiFi via a LinkSys WiFi router that is plugged into a Netgear Ethernet switch on the TP-LINK network. The Epson printer connects via WiFi to the LinkSys router.All computers on the WiFi network can connect to the Epson printer and these devices can also see my HP Photosmart printer that is on the wired network. However, the computers on the wired network cannot ""see"" the Epson printer. There may be a way to route the printer from the WiFi network to the wired network, but I have not figured out how to do this yet. So that all of my computers could use the Epson printer from the wired network, I installed a TP-LINK printer server (see below).When you unpack the printer the first step is to add the ink the ink reservoirs. For some reason this takes about 20 minutes. You really want to pay attention when you fill the ink reservoirs so that you add the right color to the right reservoir. If you make a mistake here I suspect that it will not be good.There are two ways that the WiFi for the printer can be setup. You can plug a computer into the printer via a USB Type B to USB Type A cable or you can set it up from the front panel. I used the front panel setup.The printer comes with a small LCD display, a cancel and select button and an OK button surrounded by four quadrant arrow buttons. To setup the WiFi you select WiFi network in the ""WiFi wizard"" setting. It will then display the WiFi networks that it sees. You can select yours and then enter your WiFi password. I found this awkward and it took me a couple of tries to get it right. It took me some experimentation to discover how to enter the characters properly. Once the WiFi password is entered, the printer is ready to print.This is a great printer. There are some things that are missing, however. The printer does not have a feed for copying or scanning multi-page documents. As I noted above, it is also missing a wired network port.I was able to get the printer to work as a wired network printer using a TP-LINK TL-PS110U Single USB2.0 port fast ethernet Print Server (about $31 on Amazon). This plugs into the USB port and provides a smart interface to the wired Ethernet network, allowing the printer to act like a wired network printer.To get the TP-LINK printer server to work:- Make sure that you have installed the TP 2550 drivers from the disk that comes with the printer.- Disable the WiFi (if it has been enabled).- If your computer has been using the printer over WiFi you will have to remove the printer and re-add it. I was able to get this ET 2550 to work with both Windows 7 and Fedora Linux. There don't seem to be Linux drivers available for the ET 2550, but I was able to use the settings for the Epson WorkForce 1100.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1LVVQOPITYNQG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01122JE56#wasThisHelpful","R1LVVQOPITYNQG","A2RELU94NM7RWI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RELU94NM7RWI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The pulp fiction cover of the e-book should have warned me that what lay inside was a mediocre book, full of clichd characters. The plot structure and characters reminded me of a television movie from the 1970s, with more sex thrown into the mix. The writing style is not much better than the character construction.The core of the story is the teenage fantasy of sex with a hot teacher. The horror elements of the story involve the abuse that result from relationships with such asymmetric power and experience. The author, Eric Red, does not have the stylistic skill of Nabokov or the narrative intensity of Alissa Nutting in her novel Tampa.The characters, including the ""hot teacher"" Lynda Hayden are nothing more than cardboard cutouts. Character depth is attempted by describing events their past (the father of the main character, Matt, died when he was eight). The teenagers are fall into clichd categories: good girls, ""sluts"" who sleep around, jocks, nerds and outcasts. If it were not for the sexual content, I would have guessed that this was an attempt at a young adult novel.The sex in this novel is there as an element of obsession and, ultimately, horror. But by modern standards it is not particularly explicit, since there are no carefully drawn scenes.I would pass on this book. A better example of the ""hot teacher"" genre is Alissa Nutting's searing novel Tampa.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RDGZNVQBHKJNF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008H46X3E#wasThisHelpful","RDGZNVQBHKJNF","A2RELU94NM7RWI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RELU94NM7RWI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I suspect that few people who are not already fans of Gore Vidal's books are going to read this biography. Which is a good thing, since those who are not fans of Vidal's books will probably not enjoy this book.In this age of ""tell all"" slasher biographies Jay Parini has written an excellent and balanced biography of Gore Vidal. Parini was a long time friend of Vidal and this biography reflects both his admiration for Vidal as a writer and his recognition of Vidal's faults as a human. Perhaps chief among these faults was Vidal's towering egotism and its mirror, insecurity.Vidal's grandfather was a US Senator. Vidal was also related to the Kennedy clan and had many friends and acquaintances in the US elite. This gives the impression that Gore Vidal was descended from the US elite himself. An impression that Vidal cultivated.What this biography reminded me of is that the US doesn't really much in the way of an elite, in the way that Britain and France do. Gore Vidal's grandfather was from a working class background. He studied law and become involved in populist politics. As the political winds changed with the election of Franklin D. Roosevelt, he was left in the political sidelines.Vidal's Grandfather become blind and Vidal would read to him, both when he was in the Senate and later. Reading the works of classical Roman history in his Grandfather's library laid the foundation for one of my favorite books by Vidal, Julian.Vidal was gay at a time when homosexual acts were illegal. His novel The City and the Pillar was one of the first US novels to include a homosexual relationship. The novel received generally good reviews, but did not sell well at the time.Vidal's sexuality necessarily colored not only his fiction but also his life. He was attracted to politics and ran for Congress in 1960 and lost by a significant margin. The era when a politician like Barney Frank could be gay and ""out"" was decades in the future.Jay Parini knew Vidal for many years and he interlaces the biography with accounts of the Gore Vidal he knew over the years. At times this is fascinating, but moving between time periods can be annoying since it gives the timeline of the biography a somewhat fractured structure.I did not find this biography that compelling. This is not a book that you pick up and can't put down, even if you love Vidal's books. Part of the problem is that Vidal was in the orbit of people like President John F. Kennedy, who took part in great events. But Vidal generally didn't take part directly in these events. What we get instead are some literary feuds with Norman Mailer and Truman Capote and intellectual feuds with William F. Buckley. For me, none of this adds up to a fascinating read and by the end of the book I found it a slog.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RTVY7Z72QM3AW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385537565#wasThisHelpful","RTVY7Z72QM3AW","A2RELU94NM7RWI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RELU94NM7RWI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought this light to go with my SeaLife camera. I used it for a week, where I took photographs and videos on every dive.As with all lights, it takes some practice to get illumination in the photograph right. The light easily detaches from the mount by pressing a button and then easily snaps back in place. I experimented both with the light mounted on the camera (via the bracket) and held to the side of the photo. The light can be rotated and angled to adjust the illumination.The light quickly charges, which is great since I would come back from a dive around 11:00 and then dive again at 2:00. It has a double o-ring design that seems very secure and I had not leakage.I did miss the fact that there was no flash feature (I don't think that the SeaLife camera supports a flash). I tried to take pictures of tube worms, which I probably could have done with a flash. However, with the light the tube worms retract when the light illuminates them.The light lasts a long time. I left it on most of the time through a number of dives that were almost 60 minutes. The light never dimmed. It is also easy to turn off and it turns on very fast.All in all a great camera light, that I'm very happy with.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3M91T24PQJJQS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GH2VFHW#wasThisHelpful","R3M91T24PQJJQS","A2RELU94NM7RWI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RELU94NM7RWI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I find Joe Abercrombie a compelling writer. I usually only have time to read about half an hour each night, but I found myself staying up later than I should reading The Last Argument of Kings (as with the previous three books).Abercrombie does a good job of building character. His characters are multifaceted individuals. Whether they are good or bad depends on the situation and the perspective. This can make his stories profound, since they force the reader to think about the nature of good and evil and how they are sometimes mixed.Abercrombie is also good at building suspense and driving the plot forward (the reason his books keep me up late).The downside of this trilogy is that looking back on it, the whole story seems rather futile. But perhaps Abercrombie is making a point here as well.  Some of us feel that life doesn't have an overriding theme or purpose either. The mission and quests that tend to consume fantasy stories exist only in fantasy.There is also a strong element of Deus ex machina in the story, which I found annoying. In fact it is this element of God like manipulation of the story that prompted me to give the book four starts rather than five.I am definitely a fan of Abercrombie and I am going to read his books that I have not read yet. He is an always enjoyable writer who has his flaws.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1CQP6Y3N1J5FB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00H6T36QI#wasThisHelpful","R1CQP6Y3N1J5FB","A2RELU94NM7RWI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RELU94NM7RWI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Karin Slaughter is a good writer who has written a book with scenes of graphic and disturbing violence. Or to be more exact: torture. In the hands of such a good writer, this ultraviolence is so disturbing that I skipped a couple of the worst pages.The violent scenes are interleaved through a convoluted plot that is not believable.I don't want to give away the plot for those who are Karin Slaughter fans, so examples are difficult. A minor example is the husband of the central character, Claire. Claire's husband, Paul, is an architect who is vastly rich: Wall Street rich. There have been a number of architects in my family and I grew up around architects. While very successful architects can do well, few architects have fortunes in the tens of millions of dollars (perhaps Frank Gehry). This suggests an author who doesn't do much research before writing her books.The rest of the plot is similarly without thought. The characters don't act in a way that makes sense and they are inconsistent. This gives the impression that Karin Slaughter had an idea and hacked it into a novel without working to create believable characters or a credible plot.The core theme of the book is that men are predators and women are their prey. Sadly there is some obvious truth to this view. Attractive young women have the common experience of being harassed and sometimes menaced by men. Brushing off an unwanted male advance can ignite violence. But the violence in this book goes beyond the threat of rape into the the violence of Argentine torturers. In the book this ultraviolence lurks in the hearts of men all around the women in the novel. By the end of the book the scale of the atrocity is just too large to be believable. Even in Tijuana and Juarez they found the bodies.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2F7OTTAHTE4J4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062429051#wasThisHelpful","R2F7OTTAHTE4J4","A2RELU94NM7RWI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RELU94NM7RWI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Objective Troy is an overly long exploration into how President Obama, a constitutional scholar and critic of the policies of President George W. Bush, came to order the death of Anwar al-Awlaki, a United States citizen, via a drone strike.The author, Scott Shane, is a New York Times reporter based in Washington DC who specializes in national security. The ethical tension between President Obama and the threat presented by Anwar al-Awlaki would naturally draw someone with Mr. Shane's background. Unfortunately Mr. Shane did not explore this topic in a New Yorker article, but in this overly long book.A United States where a US President has the power to order the death, without trial or review, of a US citizen is a horrifying prospect. It raises the spectre of a President assuming totalitarian power and ordering the deaths of dissidents or political opponents.Most Americans would believe that an America where the President orders the death of US citizens is not a United States that they recognize. Yet most people would not be shocked when a kidnapper is shot by a Police sniper as he threatens the lives of hostages. Here the death of the kidnapper also takes place without prior judicial review. Only a senior Police official provides the authority. We accept the killing of the kidnapper because they are threatening the lives of the hostages and there is no other way to protect the hostages.The analogy to a hostage taker is directly applicable to the case of Anwar al-Awlaki. In Objective Troy the reader learns that Anwar al-Awlaki was a threat to US citizens and other than a drone strike there were few good alternatives to bring him to justice.Objective Troy proves a detailed and often repetitive history of al-Awlaki from his childhood in the United States to his emergence as a proponent of violent jihad and eventually a terrorist plotter. Anwar al-Awlaki started out as a moderate and initially condemned the 9/11 terrorists and Al-Qaeda's violent version of Jihad. Al-Awlaki became a Islamic preacher who was always attracted to a conservative version of Islam.Sometimes those who preach against the sins of the flesh are the very people who secretly indulge in the behavior they condemn. This was true of al-Awlaki, who for years purchased the services of female prostitutes. We know of this history because al-Awlaki's emerging connections to the conservative Salifist Islam that inspires violent jihad brought him to the attention of the FBI which carefully documented his adventures with sex workers.Although the FBI officially denies it, Scott Shane suggests that at some point the FBI met with al-Awlaki and told him what they knew about his extramarital activities with prostitutes. If this information became public it would have destroyed al-Awlaki's career as a cleric. What was actually discussed in the meeting with the FBI is not clear, but soon after the meeting al-Awlaki left the United States, first for England and, eventually for Yemen.Another principle of the United States is that a US citizen cannot be jailed or censored by the government for speech alone. For example, the late Fred Phelps who was the pastor of the Westboro Baptist Church called for the death of gay people (among others). As long as speech does not cross the line into a real plot to harm people, it is protected.Once al-Awlaki left the US he started to preach violent jihad. However preaching about the death of gay people or violent jihad is not illegal. What is illegal is when preaching crosses over into active planning.In Yemen al-Awlaki became an active member of Al-Qaeda. Objective Troy makes clear that Anwar al-Awlaki had moved from being a cleric preaching against the United States to someone who was plotting the death of US citizens.As an active member of Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, al-Awlaki was directly involved in planning and organizing a terrorist attempt by Umar Farouk Abdulmutallah, who became known as ""the underwear bomber"". It was Anwar al-Awlaki who sent Abdulmutallah to Ibrahim al-Asiri, an experienced Al Qaeda bomb maker (whose bomb, fortunately, failed to explode on an airplane).There were few options for the capture of al-Awlaki. In theory, if he had been located a special forces team could have been sent in to capture him. As with any military operation, a special forces operation always carries the risk of death or injury of US service people. In this case it would also have been a direct and undeniable incursion into Yemeni sovereignty. A drone strike avoided all of these problems.On September 30, 2011 Anwar al-Awlaki was killed in a drone strike. The only reason that I know that this was the date of al-Awlaki's death is that I looked it up in Wikipedia. In Objective Trojan we learn what Admiral Mike Mullen's announcement of al-Awlaki's death, but not the date. This is emblematic of a book that is overly long without a clear narrative.Two weeks later, on October 14, 2011, Anwar al-Awlaki's sixteen year old son, Abdulrahman al-Awlaki was killed in a drone strike that the US government says was targeted at Ibrahim al-Banna, a senior member of Al-Qaeda.According to Scott Shane's account, the details of the October 14, 2011 drone strike remain classified. Shane states that the US government provided no details about the strike, nor did they apologize for killing Abdulrahman al-Awlaki, who was also a US citizen. Some people in Yemen were left with the impression, Shane writes, that ""the United States killed Abdulrahman deliberately to eliminate the possibility that he would grow up and take his father's path"".In addition to the background and history of Anwar al-Awlaki there are long sections on President Obama's evolution as a President whose duties include oversight of the drone program. This is a long and rambling exploration that could be summarized as: when the President was a candidate, he did not have responsibility for the national security of the United States. When he became President, Barak Obama had to wrestle with a variety of complex issues, including Islamic extremism and terrorism. The tools that the president has available include armed drones. After much deliberation and analysis, President Obama authorized a drone strike that killed Anwar al-Awlaki.Objective Trojan covers an important story: the evolution of President Obama's policies and the move from cleric to terrorist of Anwar al-Awlaki. Unfortunately the book is almost mind numbingly tedious. When presented with a book length narrative outside of the purview of the editors of the New York Times, Scott Shane does not seem to be able to tell this important story in an engaging manner.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R6X1FHDC9AHHS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0804140294#wasThisHelpful","R6X1FHDC9AHHS","A2RELU94NM7RWI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RELU94NM7RWI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Along with reading this book, I also watched Prof. Susskind's lectures, which are available on the web. Anyone with some background in linear algebra will have no problem with the math in the book or the lectures. What is difficult is connecting the ideas and mathematics to something in the real world.Reading this book I felt like I was studying theoretical math, that somehow, tangentially, applied to the real world of electrons and particles. This left me with the feeling that something was missing. Quantum mechanics was not born from theoretical physics, in the way string theory was. Quantum mechanics was a reaction to real experiments and problems in explaining these experiments. Yet there is nothing in this book that ties the quantum theory to its history and reality. Even when the experiments were described, I didn't understand how to tie them to the mathematics.Learning theory without anything real to relate it to made it hard for me to hang on to this material. I read the chapters and I think that I understand the math that is presented. But it's all abstract theory without flesh. Yet quantum mechanics is a critical part of the real world. Quantum mechanics helps explain why the transistors in an integrated circuit can only be made so small before they leak charge and become useless from noise. Quantum coherence appears to be an important part of the function of chlorophyll, the molecule on which most life on earth depends, either directly or indirectly. All of chemistry involves quantum mechanics (of electron probability shells). Quantum mechanics is not just an abstract theory, but a critical part of the world around us. But you'd never know it from reading this book.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RO8WDQJIAQH7X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FD36G1Q#wasThisHelpful","RO8WDQJIAQH7X","A2RELU94NM7RWI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RELU94NM7RWI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The heroic fantasy that started with Tolken (or perhaps Malory's Le Mort d'Arthur) is pretty much dead, killed off by George R. R. Martin, Joe Abercrombie and Daniel Abraham. I will always love Tolken, but Tolken was the fiction of my childhood. These stories are for older readers. They reflect the harsh reality of the fallen world that we live in.The story in The Blade Itself does not revolve around a single character, but rather orbits a group of interesting characters. One of these is Sand dan Glokta, who is an investigator for the inquisition and a torturer. Glokta is from a noble family and was, at one time, a champion swordsman. As an officer in the Kings Own Guard he fought in a war against the Gurkish Empire. He was captured and tortured for two years. This has left him crippled and in constant pain.Some reviewers have commented on Glokta's character, who has rejected any kind of morality and sympathy. If he were the only character in the story, this would be a problem. There are other interesting characters. Also, while we might not approve of Glokta's abandonment of morality and human sympathy, it is possible to understand how he arrived at this dark place. Glokta's constant pain and dark life gives him a certain strength. He does not court death, but he is completely unafraid of it. When death seems imminent, he does not flinch. This makes him a difficult person to threaten.I was introduced to Joe Abercrombie through his ""Half"" trilogy Half a King, Half the World and Half a War, which I likes (and are memorable, months after I read them). I then read Best Served Cold, which is set in the same world as The First Law trilogy. Of these books, I think that The First Law trilogy is the strongest, although the Half trilogy comes in a close second.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJOURZHKLTLQC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00H6T36QS#wasThisHelpful","RJOURZHKLTLQC","A2RELU94NM7RWI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RELU94NM7RWI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Middle books in trilogies are often bridges between the start and end of the story. This can make them weaker since the characters are moving toward the story conclusion, but have not arrived. The classic example of such a bridge book is Tolken's The Two Towers, which has been referred to as ""slogging toward Mordor"".Before They Are Hanged escapes the curse of the middle book. It is at least as compelling as The Blade Itself. The plot drives forward and the characters are interesting and deeply drawn.The Blade Itself reminded me a bit of George R. R. Martin's Game of Throws (the first book). There are lots of plot elements and I was not sure that Abercrombie could tie it all up in three books. I have not read the final book, The Last Argument of Kings, so I can't say yet how well Abercrombie does at tying things together. But after the first two books I'm looking forward to reading the find book (at least we will not have Martin's ""story that will never conclude"").These books reflect the world that we live in. Some of the events are harsh. Innocent people are tortured and killed. People act through amoral self-interest. The history that unfolds in the books is multi-faceted. Different people have different views of events and the heroes are flawed.With 400 reviews as I write this there's not much too add. This is a series that needs to be read together. So if you have not read The Blade Itself, start now. If you don't mind the harsh elements of the story, I think that you'll like these books.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3FOTG5LNNQ7MX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00H6T36UE#wasThisHelpful","R3FOTG5LNNQ7MX","A2RELU94NM7RWI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RELU94NM7RWI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""Ear bud"" earphones/microphone are great for cell phones when you're walking around (you can walk down the sidewalk talking to your very own private voices). But their sound quality and isolation for external sounds is not very good. The Panasonic headphones are a compromise between studio style headphones and earbuds. The Panasonic headphones fold up so that they can fit more easily in a purse or backpack. However, the Panasonic headphones have good sound quality and provide decent isolation from external sound (you can wear then in your ""open plan"" office to avoid the distraction of your colleagues talking). I tested the sound on both my computer workstation and on my cell phone. In both cases the sound was good. The computer has a better stereo hardware so the sound was richer.They headphones have a built in microphone. I tested it with my Nexus 5 Android phone and the voice quality was good. I'm not sure that you would want to walk around with the headphones on, but if you're listening to music on your phone, you can take calls.I have been happily using the headphones to listen to music while I write software (studies have shown that heavy metal improves software quality) and I am very happy with the headphones.One note: the headphone jack is the longer type, that has both stereo and microphone contacts. It fits cell phones, but it may not fit all computer or stereo systems that don't support the microphone jack.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3LY2MMUXP1V77/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NVERK0A#wasThisHelpful","R3LY2MMUXP1V77","A2RELU94NM7RWI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RELU94NM7RWI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Palace of Treason is a novel about the core of intelligence: espionage, both by and against the United States. The plot revolves around a member of the Russian intelligence service, the SVR (the modern version of the KGB), Dominika Ergorova, who has been recruited by the CIA in the preceding book Red Sparrow. Dominika is a Russian patriot, but she is disgusted by the naked corruption of Putin and his inner circle. (Although there are some references to the events in Red Sparrow, Palace of Treason stands on its own and can be enjoyed without reading the previous book.)Covert activity, suspicion and distrust seem to be wired into Russian culture. The Bolsheviks who created the Soviet Union started as a covert organization. As the history of Soviet espionage shows, they remained masters of covert operations once they took power. The Soviets are gone, replaced by billionaire oligarchs, but the paranoid nature of Russian culture remains.Much of the suspense in Palace of Treason involves the danger of covert activity against the Russian foe. In the novel, Jason Matthews describes the complex choreography of avoiding surveillance and detection in a hostile environment like Moscow.Nate Nash, in the CIA Operations Directorate, is the handler for the Russian agent, Dominika. They became lovers in Red Sparrow and, as one of Nate's colleges points out, this is not only against CIA rules, but greatly complicates Nate's relationship with his agent.Both Dominika and Nate are in the classic spy novel mold of super agents. Dominika is a trained killer, as is Nate. Both of there are experts at evading surveillance. Jason Matthews manages to avoid the superhuman agent trope that one sometimes sees in thrillers. Nate and Dominika are unusually talented, but they often suffer to achieve success.The biographical sketch at the end of Place of Treason states that the author, Jason Matthews, spent his career in the CIA's Operations Directorate with overseas posting that included Eastern Europe and the Middle East. Although real life CIA handlers don't have beautiful Russian agents as lovers, many of the other details seem like they may have drawn on Mr. Matthews' experience in the field. Mr. Matthews makes reference to a number of the Russian assassinations in the post Soviet era and suggests that the oligarch Boris Berezovsky was assassinated (the evidence is conflicting and its possible he committed suicide).The great detail lavished on communication and evasion in Moscow and elsewhere seems so realistic that I wondered if Matthews gave away any secrets of trade craft. In the acknowledgement Mr. Matthews thanks the CIA's publication review board for reviewing the book, so presumably this was not the case.The only facet of the book that I found annoying involves Nate Nash, as the James Bondish lover who women can't resist and who can't ever say no to a woman. Nate just can't keep his pants on, even when he should. He comes off as unprofessional, without the discipline to say no when he should. But perhaps Mr. Matthews feels that even in a novel with strong female characters, James Bond lives on.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R26SS1LNOMG55G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1476793743#wasThisHelpful","R26SS1LNOMG55G","A2RELU94NM7RWI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RELU94NM7RWI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Building a venture capital funded start-up is one of the hardest things that most people will ever do. This is the best book I've found on building a start-up, from funding through exit. If you are founding a start-up or working for one, this book is essential reading.The press reports of SnapChat turning down a $3 billion acquisition offer from Facebook, or an app called Yo (which sends the text message ""yo"" to your friend's phone) getting $1 million venture funding reflects the mythology of start-ups. The book Hot Seat describes the reality.Dan Shapiro is not some ""Master of the Universe"" who founded a start-up during the dot-com boom and managed to sell out before the crash. He has built multiple start-ups from the ground up, the hard way. There's no business jargon in Hot Seat, no empty platitudes. He writes about the mistakes he made, along with his successes. He writes about how hard it is to raise money as a first time founder. But he tries to give you some of the knowledge that you will need to succeed.Dan Shapiro is an excellent writer and he presents the critical information in Hot Seat in an engaging manner. He writes not only of his own experience, but of the experiences of people he knows.The first half of the book discusses some of the challenges a start-up CEO will face. Raising money, attracting co-founders and early employees, dealing with investors, some of the critical forms you need to file. This book is so good that I have absolutely no doubt that I will read it again.The second half of the book is about how to manage your success after you survive the early challenges. Dan writes that there are always challenges and risks, they just change in nature. I have to confess that I didn't read the second half as closely because I kept thinking ""I should be so lucky"". But if I do succeed, I will be rereading the second half.One of the scariest things about founding a company is that there are few guides. This book is one of the best you're going to find.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1X0AUIGHUEPKC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XB1P4RE#wasThisHelpful","R1X0AUIGHUEPKC","A2RELU94NM7RWI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RELU94NM7RWI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have a weakness for finance and Wall Street stories, so I thought that I might like Michelle Miller's The Underwriting.  Unfortunately, the writing was good enough to suck me in, but there's very little substance in the story. In the end it felt like a waste of time.The plot of The Underwriting revolves a Silicon Valley company that makes a Tinder like dating phone app, called Hook. The app has become popular and the company is going to go public (issue an Initial Public Offering for their stock). Most of the characters in the story are either from the investment bank L.Cecil that is working on the IPO or work for the app company, Hook. We learn from the book's back cover and the early part of the story that a young woman dies under suspicious circumstances, which is supposed to add suspense beyond the weak drama of the IPO.I didn't find any of the central characters particularly sympathetic. They are all stereotypes. Almost all of the men in the story are sex obsessed jerks who use Hook to find women for one night stands. The only exception is a Latino software engineer from East Palo Alto. The women are neurotic (the main female character, Tara is taking the anti-depressant Lexapro and Xanax) or joylessly working insane hours (at least the jerk men seem to enjoy their money).Two of the men in the book order for their dates in restaurants, without consulting them (does anyone actually do this?)  Apparently this is meant to be a display of sexual dominance. The CEO of Hook is a sexist software engineer incapable of human connection. His CFO is an empty suit who graduated from Stanford. His classmate, Todd King, who is leading the IPO team from L. Cecil, rates women on a scale from 1 to 10. Early in the book we learn that he tries to bed women who are ""eights"" because they don't have the confidence of the ""tens"" and are grateful for his studly attention. As the story unfolds we find that, with one exception, all of Todd ex-hookups dislike him. This is understandable. Todd is such a jerk that he propositions his hot gym trainer and when he learns that she has a woman lover he asks her why she's a lesbian. And finally, to round things off, we have a romantic British investor who has a major position in Hook.There are some strange quirks in the book. There is a two page sex scene with Todd and some anonymous girl he picks up. Various words are blacked out, as if they were redacted as a result of a government classification review. This comes off as weirdly prudish since there's nothing here that Sidney Sheldon didn't write decades ago.I wanted to know how this vacuous story would finally end so I made it though to the end of the book (which by that time felt very long). When I finally got to the end of the book, very little was resolved. The ending is, apparently, meant to be a cliff hanger for the next book. As you might guess, I am not planning to read the sequel.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1KG374NVBQE00/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0399174850#wasThisHelpful","R1KG374NVBQE00","A2RELU94NM7RWI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RELU94NM7RWI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This switch did exactly what I wanted: I plugged the power in and connected the eithernet cables and it worked. In testing the performance, I found it to be extremely fast.I had a couple of daisy chained Netgear switches before I got this switch. I was able to replace the switches with the single Linksys switch and simplify my network setup. This is always a good thing, since home networks can easily become complicated.My switch didn't come with any documentation. Which isn't that unusual for switches since you power them up, connect the cables and they work. One of the advertised features of this switch is that it supports quality of service (QoS) packet switching. It was not clear to me how you set this up, if you want this feature. Looking at the Linksys on-line documentation I didn't find anything. I assume that QoS is set up through the router connected to the switch, which is why Linksys advertises the switch as working with a Linksys router. But the documentation that I found is silent on this issue.

"The network performance of this router is exceptional and the signal strength is very strong.I replaced a Netgear WNR1000 with the Linksys WRT AC1200 and I'm very happy with the way the new modem performs. My guests were having problems connecting in some rooms of the house. Especially with newer iPhones. These problems have disappeared. The coverage is also much better.Presumably because this model supports such high speeds, it is about twice the size of the Netgear modem. Where the Netgear had one antenna, the Linksys mode has two.I have a TP-LINK TL-R470T cabled router that sits between my cable modem and my home network. I connected the Linksys WRT AC1200 to the TP-LINK router. The TP-LINK router is on the internal address 192.168.0.1, so it does not conflict with the Linksys router which is on the internal address 192.168.1.1. However, I was unable to connect to the Linksys router. This may be a result of the fact that the 192.168.X.X addresses are non-routable and the TP-LINK may not have routed this address to the Linksys.Once I connected a laptop directly to a port on the Linksys router I was able to successfully connect to the router on 192.168.1.1.Most of the routers I've used have a simple ""wizard"" that take you though the router setup. I found the Linksys setup somewhat convoluted. There is a web style setup that runs on the local router. However, the router takes you to https://linksyssmartwifi.com and asks you to set up an account. The web site then allows you to set up the router name and passwords. The web site seems to be mirrored locally on the router (almost all routers come with embedded web servers). I didn't find that setup on the LInksys web site was as simple as the setup that I'm used to with the router ""wizards"" I've used in the past.When I connected my iPad via the Linksys Wifi I found that there was a guest account that seems to have been automatically setup. I didn't want a guest account, especially since I had not configured a password. I immediately went back to the router setup to disable the guest account. This account comes with a default password, so anyone who knows the Linksys default password can log in to your network.A number of features in the router web interface come with an on/off switch that acts like a light switch, not a radio button. I don't find the function immediately obvious (e.g., if it shows OFF, it is OFF, or is it ON because ON is covered). I believe that the guest account may have been enabled by default. I changed the password to something really long and then disabled the guest account.The linksyssmartwifi.com web site has some nice features. It will show all devices that are logged into the Wifi network. However,I am nervous about the https://linksyssmartwifi.com web site which has access to my router setup. Yes, the site is password protected, but if linksyssmartwifi.com gets hacked, it is possible that my network would be exposed. I have verified that I can access my router, via linksyssmartwifi.com, from outside of my home network. Apparently the Linksys router is routing through my TP-LINK firewall. All this suggests that it might not have been the best idea to set up the Linksys web access.I have marked the ""star score"" for the router down by one star due to the somewhat convoluted setup and the fact that Linksys leads you to setup the web site, which may be a security problem. I would have preferred the kind of straight forward setup that I've had with routers in the past. All the nice features offered by the web site are no good if Linksys gets hacked and their customer base is compromised.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3EFAG2NNV37JR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UVN20T0#wasThisHelpful","R3EFAG2NNV37JR","A2RELU94NM7RWI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RELU94NM7RWI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Since I liked Glass' previous work, I ordered this book directly from the publisher since it was not available at the time from Amazon.The first thing to realize about this book is that its really a pamphlet, rather than a book. And an expensive pamphlet at that. When it arrived I was shocked by its small size. It's something like 5"" x 4"".Charles Glass is without question an expert on Syria and the book focuses almost entirely on Syria and the roots of the Syrian uprising against Bashar Assad. There is also a long digression on the history of Syrian uprisings against various occupiers, especially the French.Glass went to Syria in 2013 and 2014. Or at least the areas like Damascus where he could go with some measure of safety. He provides some interesting background on the Syrian uprising, from peaceful protest, to armed resistance, to a movement that is dominated by Islamic fundamentalists.Although ISIS is in the sub-title, the book is weak in its discussion of ISIS. ISIS does occupy part of Syria and it had its roots in an Al-Queda faction in Syria. But ISIS as the West is fighting it is something that came from Iraq, not Syria.A number of other authors have noted that ISIS is a reaction to the Shia domination of Iraq and the Shia death squads. As horrible as ISIS is, many Sunnis have chosen to ally with ISIS because it is a better option than more certain death at the hands of Shia death squads.The Iraqi dimension of ISIS is largely ignored by Glass' focus on Syria. For a reader wanting to read about ISIS, this book is a weak and expensive choice. With the long historical digressions, there is little substance in this book.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1VFZKP2KXQS7J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=193929388X#wasThisHelpful","R1VFZKP2KXQS7J","A2RELU94NM7RWI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RELU94NM7RWI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I read Scott Sigler's book Infected before I read his recent book Alive. I enjoyed Infected. The plot moved quickly and the determination of the exfootball star Perry Dawsey, one of the main characters in the novel, was memorable. The idea behind the plot was interesting as well.Infected was mind candy. It was an engaging book that didn't take too much thought. I expected more of the same with Alive. Unfortunately I was disappointed. Alive is plodding and the plot is nonsensical.Most science fiction books involve invented worlds. A future that has not happened yet. Perhaps in this future there is faster than light travel, which most current science suggests is impossible. But within the invented world there is logical structure and consistency. In the best novels you get the feeling that the author had a rich back-story in mind, that they only had space to partially explain. None of this is true of Alive. The world of the novel makes no sense, even when the technology is accepted. If there was any back-story in the author's mind, it was not apparent from the plot that made it onto the page.The novel seems to be a young adult novel. All of the characters are teenagers.  The plot starts well, but soon becomes, literally, a long slog. It is downhill from there. At the end of the advanced reader's copy the author asks reviewers to avoid giving away the plot. I have tried to honor this wish, but the final plot reveal is almost as tedious as the rest of the book.","2.0 out of 5 stars","May 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R249TWRL8ISJRI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0553393103#wasThisHelpful","R249TWRL8ISJRI","A2RELU94NM7RWI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RELU94NM7RWI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"University professors in the United States are not rewarded for teaching at most schools. At a research University, the professors may be great researchers, but they are sometimes reluctant instructors. These professors cover what you ""need to know"", but taking their courses can be a grid. Reading Life on the Edge: the coming age of quantum biology, I wish that I had the opportunity to take a class from the authors, Johnjoe McFadden and Jim Al-Khalili.Cell biology, biochemistry and quantum physics are complex topics. Like great teachers, Drs. McFadden and Al-Khalili build their explanations up piece by piece, with interesting minor digressions on some of the personalities involved.Life at a biological level is fascinating and profound. The foundations of life are the nano-machinery of enzymes and huge macro-molecules. Underlying these molecules is quantum physics.The authors do a good job of moving from the high level to the low level of quantum interactions. They clearly explain the basics of quantum interactions and the experiments that demonstrated that quantum theory is both true and seemingly nonsensical. For example, they clearly describe the ""two slit"" experiment that demonstrates that particles and even molecules can act like waves, unless they are observed, in which case they act like particles (a recent experiment, not mentioned in the book, provides evidence that the truth may be that they are particles and waves, not particles or waves).Once they lay the foundation of biology and physics the authors describe how it applies to photosynthesis, which is a remarkable process. The authors quote research that shows that photosynthesis is near 100% efficient in converting sunlight into energy that can be used by the plant. Several research groups have shown that this efficiency is do to a quantum process that the authors liken to quantum computing. Quantum processes also account for the ability of robins to navigate in the earth's magnetic field.Although modern quantum mechanics is nearing its its centennial birthday, it remains at the leading edge of science and what we understand. The authors discuss more speculative work at the end of the book and the suggestion that consciousness may have a quantum nature that is beyond the simple chemistry of neurons.The book is written for a general audience. Much of the material is going to be familiar to anyone who has taken University science courses. Initially I found the authors discussion of quantum biology annoying, since the quantum effects that they discuss underlie the organic chemistry of life. The quantum nature of chemical bonds is something that is covered in undergraduate inorganic and organic chemistry. The quantum effects at enzyme binding sites are standard areas of study for biochemistry. As the book unfolds and they authors describe photosynthesis and some forms of avian navigation, it does become clear that quantum biology can be seen as a special area of study.Science has not stopped delivering a sense of wonder. The world is stranger than we can imagine and constantly surprising. The quantum level underlies the macro-level of our existence. Life on the Edge provides a fascinating view into biological life and this quantum layer.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1AZ2X7QN3YT7N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0307986810#wasThisHelpful","R1AZ2X7QN3YT7N","A2RELU94NM7RWI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RELU94NM7RWI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Watchmaker of Filigree Street is set in 1884. This is not really a steam punk novel.  Most of the technology in the novel is the actual technology of the time (if you're willing to be flexible about some magical clockwork).The novel revolves around three characters: Thaniel Steepleton, Grace Carrow and Keita Mori. Keita Mori is a Japanese nobleman who has come to London, where the novel is set, to perfect his mastery of clockwork.The novel is really a historical novel, with some fantastic elements thrown in. For example, Mori makes clockwork that displays behavioral complexity that would be difficult to reproduce with modern microprocessors, lithium batteries and servo-motors. Mori is both a master of clockwork and someone with other remarkable skills.During the late part of the 19th century the Clan na Gael, an ancestor of the modern Irish Republican Army, had a bombing campaign in London which was referred to as the ""Dynamite War"". The terrorist bombings and their origin play a central role in the plot of the novel.Thaniel Steepleton is the main character around which Grace Carrow and Mori revolve. He is from an educated but poor background and is working as a telegrapher for the British Home Office when the novel opens.At the same time, Grace Carrow is attending Cambridge, hoping to perform seminal physics experiments that will result in her being granted a fellowship. Grace is trying to prove the existence of ether, which in this case is not the chemical but the ""luminiferous aether"" that was thought to be the medium through which light is transmitted. She was working with a light interferometer in order to do this.The experiments that she was doing in the novel broadly follow the famous experiments done by Albert A. Michelson and Edward W. Morley, who published their work in 1887 (Wikipedia is a great resource). Like Michelson and Morley, Grace is unable to show that the ether actually existed. As it turns out, this is one of the most famous negative scientific results in history, since it laid some of the foundation for Einstein's work a few decades later.With all of these interesting piece one might assume that this would be a fascinating novel. Unfortunately that is not the case. The plot meanders around. The interesting ingredients never come together in a compelling whole. The only character who has any real depth is Grace, with her burning desire for scientific discovery. I didn't think that either Thaniel or Mori where elaborated as they could have been. Which is too bad since the character of Mori had great promise. What was it like to be Mori and to have his talent?  We never really find out.By the end of the book, I thought it was dragging. I stayed up late reading it not because I couldn't put it down, but because I wanted to be done and move on to a new book. I think that Natasha Pulley may have a great book waiting to be written, but unfortunately this is not it.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2JIA0A8M97FHS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1620408333#wasThisHelpful","R2JIA0A8M97FHS","A2RELU94NM7RWI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RELU94NM7RWI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I read Peter Clines book The Fold before I read ""14"". As it turns out, The Fold is a sequel to ""14"". Obviously I liked The Fold enough to buy a copy of ""14"".The book was an enjoyable, suspenseful read. The story follows a plot arc that was popular with Heinlein era science fiction. The main character is an underachiever. Nothing is going on in his life, he has no girl friend and most of the women he's interested in don't return his feelings. Then, out of no where, our hero is called upon to do Great Things. He grows as he rises to the challenge, he gets the girl and gets laid.One of the odd quirks in the plot is that most of the characters are always making wise cracks and satirical comments to each other, even under extreme life threatening stress. Death, it has been observed, tends to focus the mind and most people don't make smart ass comments when they face it.The other odd plot element was the steam punk part of the plot. It is never really explained how a machine, designed a hundred years ago, with moving parts that are constantly in motion, is still working. I don't think that we could design a machine today that could last that long without any maintenance.Since there are over 500 reviews I'll wrap up my review. I've compared the novel to Heinlein era science fiction, so it seems reasonable to use Heinlein's metric for whether the book was worth buying and reading. Heinlein's metric for worthwhile science fiction is science fiction that is worth foregoing six beers for. At a Kindle price of $7.99 I'll compare the book to the enjoyment received from six beers from a case of Sierra Nevada ale purchased at CostCo. Using this metric the book is, at best, equal to the beer and certainly not the clear winner that a book by Alistair Reynolds would be.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R23LKHXAPRQMEB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00898J9IE#wasThisHelpful","R23LKHXAPRQMEB","A2RELU94NM7RWI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RELU94NM7RWI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"For my web application nderground (Amazon doesn't allow links), I needed a key/value database. I considered MongoDB, which has become so popular that its starting to resemble a fad. When I looked into MongoDB however, I read many accounts that discussed the problems of scaling MongoDB beyond one server. Yes, it can be scaled, but apparently you have to take extra steps to shard the database over multiple servers. Scaling is critical for nderground, so my search for a key/value database continued.Somewhere in my searches I encountered Riak. Riak is built to scale and I read a couple of discussions by people who had successfully migrated from MongoDB to Riak. I taked to Basho Technology about Riak and bought this book.Mathias Meyer provides a good introduction to Riak. Riak will scale naturally (e.g., you don't have to take extra steps to shard the database). However, I also learned that Riak was originally inspired by Amazon's DynamoDB paper, which was published before DynamoDB become available on Amazon Web Services (AWS).In my opinion Riak is an attractive solution if you are going to host a key/value store database (e.g., noSQL database) on your own servers. However, in my case nderground is hosted on AWS. In order to bring Riak up I would have to allocate EC2 instances to host it and manage the database. Or I could just use Amazon's DynamoDB, which has a similar design. Using DynamoDB means that you don't have to configure and manage the database. Also, DynamoDB will scale effortlessly. So for AWS the choice seemed pretty obvious.I've been writing software for DynamoDB for a couple of months now. I am still happy with my choice, although Amazon's documentation leaves something to be desired (their examples for referencing global secondary indexes in Java didn't work for me - I found what I needed in a Stackoverflow post).So, in summary, if you've decided to use Riak, this is a good reference. The writing is much clearer and more complete than Amazon's DynamoDB documentation.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2XFDC9D6SOBHI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009ZIUCJ2#wasThisHelpful","R2XFDC9D6SOBHI","A2RELU94NM7RWI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RELU94NM7RWI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have all of Within Temptation's albums and I like them all. Within Temptation works to constantly evolve, not just produce the same music they always have. This album branches out in new directions. For me the great departure was the inclusion of rap, by Xzibit. I'm not a big fan of rap. The closest I get is 900 Foot Jesus' The City Sleeps. I had to listen to this album a few times before the rap started to grow on me. I think that it was a worthy artistic experiment and it works well in the Within Temptation pieces, but I hope that they will not go farther down this path.Other than the inclusion of rap elements, I think that most Within Temptation fans will like this album.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1EB49YFJBIG7D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HW0LY4C#wasThisHelpful","R1EB49YFJBIG7D","A2RELU94NM7RWI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RELU94NM7RWI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Joshua Dalzelle's book Warship is an entertaining read. If the book were a Hollywood screen play and I needed to do an ""elevator pitch"" I'd say that it was like the Battlestar Galactica reboot, mixed in with Leviathan Wakes by James S.A. Corey (James S.A. Corey and M.L.N. Hanover).There are almost seven hundred reviews of this book, so I'm not sure that I have much to add.The writing is good, as is the character development. With faster than light travel, the human race has expanded out to countless star systems. The only alien race that has been encountered lives is an environment that is incompatible with human life. At the opening of story, an aggressive alien race is encountered. The rest of the book is an account of the drawn out battle between the Bluejacket and the alien starship.The book was entertaining, but I don't think that I'll read the sequel when it comes out. I didn't find it as good as James S.A. Corey's work and it's certainly not as deep and rich as the new Battlestar Galactica (admittedly in a different medium).","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R179GCHDUF9YKB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RS8FT2G#wasThisHelpful","R179GCHDUF9YKB","A2RELU94NM7RWI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RELU94NM7RWI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have not read Heda Margolius Kovly memoir, but from the reviews it sounds like she was a remarkable person who survived the Nazi death camps and then her husband's unjust execution by the Czech Communist state.The creator and the work they produce are two different things. The fact that Heda Kovly was a remarkable woman does not make this a good novel. In fact, I suspect that it never would have been published had it been written by someone else.Heda Kovly was, among other things, a translator who translated novels by Raymond Chandler into Czech. This appears to have influenced the style of the novel, where some of the characters speak in bad noir novel jargon.The novel seems to have been set in the 1960s when the worst of the Stalinist excesses of Czech Communism were starting to fade. While people are no longer being hauled off to basements and shot in the back of the neck, the Czech Communist state is oppressive and constantly spying on its citizens.At most the plot reaches tragedy, but there is little tension. The characters are all living gray iron curtain lives. The novel opens with a murder, there is a touch of espionage and another murder. The writing style is so flat that these events lose any of their power.I have no idea what the style is like in Czech, the original language for the novel, but the english style is poor and as gray as the characters. The few twists in the plot end up having little drama and the book plots towards it conclusion.An interesting contrast to this novel is Simon Sebag Montefiore ""One Night in Winter"", which is set in Stalin's Soviet Union. Like ""Innocence"", ""One Night in Winter"" is set in a totalitarian society. But the characters are deeply drawn and the novel is strongly plotted. All that ""Innocence"" is not.","2.0 out of 5 stars","April 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2RXKVV58CX3TL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1616954965#wasThisHelpful","R2RXKVV58CX3TL","A2RELU94NM7RWI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RELU94NM7RWI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My father took me to see the movie Chshingura (the 47 Ronin), by the Japanese director  Hiroshi Inagaki, when I was a kid. The story is based on true events, but it has gained mythical standing and has become a core tale of Japanese culture. I have seen the movie many times since. The story has been recreated by a number of artists. Here we have a telling by the graphic novelist Stan Sakai, who created the Usagi Yojimbo novels that I read with my son when he was young.The story that Stan Sakai tells closely follows the story of the Chshingura and Sakai was clearly influenced by Inagaki's movie. There is a scene before Lord Asano commits Seppuku, where he walks through the blossoming cherry trees that is in both the movie and the book. This scene has always stuck in my mind for its beauty and sadness.One of the themes that is stronger in the movie is the egotism of Asano. He is goaded and abused by Lord Kira. For a time he tries to put up with the abuse, but finally he snaps, he anger overcoming his control and he attacks Kira in the Shogun's palace. By the action he causes terrible pain for all of those around him.If Asano were stronger, as strong as his 47 loyal retainers and his wife, the tragedy would not have happened. So part of the story to me has always been about Asano's weakness and flaws.In enjoyed Stan Sakai's retelling of this complex tale. It was a change to revisit the story in the medium of a graphic novel.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3MZMAYQ4RHWCM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1595829547#wasThisHelpful","R3MZMAYQ4RHWCM","A2RELU94NM7RWI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RELU94NM7RWI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The Fold is the first novel that I've read by Peter Clines. I liked The Fold enough to buy a copy of his earlier novel ""14"".The Fold is well written, entertaining fiction with both science fiction and horror elements in it. From reading a little of Clines biography on his blog, it doesn't appear that he has a scientific background. But he does his homework, so there are plausible science fiction elements. But Clines also throws in an unusual twist, which I didn't see coming.The main character is Leland Erikson, who goes by the name of Mike. Mike has photographic memory and an extremely high IQ that can make use of all of the material that he can read once, but never forget.The portrait of Mike and his abilities is a nuanced one. Many of us would like to have that kind of intelligence and memory. But it also comes with a huge cost. Mike doesn't read much, for example, because he remembers everything that he reads, which ironically reduces the enjoyment. His intelligence also means that he doesn't fit in without carefully hiding his abilities.When the novel opens, Mike is a High School teacher, within a few minutes of summer break. An old school friend of Mike's, Reggie, is a program manager for the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), the government agency that originally funded the Internet (no, it was not Al Gore), supercomputer architectures and self-driving vehicles before Google existed.Reggie has been after Mike to come work for him for years, but Mike has always refused, preferring his mundane life as a teacher. As the book opens, Reggie has an offer that Mike can't refused. He wants Mike to act as Reggie's eyes and ears looking into a project that Reggie has funded that has developed what seems to be a way of creating a fold in space that allows people to travel through a gateway from point A to point B, instantaneously.Mike's character is the most deeply drawn character in the book. As the plot unfolds it becomes easier to understand how someone with Mike's remarkable abilities has made the decisions he has.The plot moves forward quickly and I found the book an engaging and enjoyable read. The mix between science fiction and horror provides some interesting twists.The women in The Fold are all strong characters. When the going gets tough they are there slugging it out along side the men. Mike has unusual mental abilities, but he's hardly a superman. He takes his knocks and is saved in a couple cases by the female characters.The only feature of the plot that I found annoying was the description of Mike's inner thought process. As a child Mike saw ant hives and ants became a sort of memory palace model for the organizational process that he uses to organize what he remembers flawlessly. We get sentences like:""The ants leaped into overdrive. They counted and cataloged and quantified. They gave him more details than he wanted to know""or""A few ants got out. They carried hypothesis and ideas and wild guesses""This is fine in a few places, but I found the references to the ants got old since they are the constant metaphor for Mike's thinking.The fold was a well written, enjoyable diversion. I'm looking forward to reading Clines' earlier book ""14"" (which apparently has some tangential connection to The Fold).[Later]I just finished Peter Clines book ""14"". It is a prequel to The Fold, although The Fold can be enjoyed without reading ""14"". I suspect that people who read ""14"" first are not going to find as much suspense, since the events in ""14"" foreshadow those in The Fold.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R51CAE0LI6M65/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0553418297#wasThisHelpful","R51CAE0LI6M65","A2RELU94NM7RWI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RELU94NM7RWI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I just got the electronic token generator from Gemalto. As their notes specify, this is a specialized device for Amazon Web Services (e.g., you can't use it with your GMail account). It seems like a good product. The only reason I didn't give it a five star review is the Amazon definition for five starts is ""I love it"". How in love can you be with an electronic token generator? But I certainly like it.Anyone who is developing a significant web application should be thinking about security from the start . Amazon Web Services also gives you tools for locking down your application (although it can be time consuming wading through their sometimes obscure documentation). One area of weakness is your AWS root account (e.g., the account you use to login to the AWS consoles). This account has absolute power over your application. Obviously this account has the power to delete your databases and remove all of your EC2 instances, crippling or destroying your application.  If your application gets notice and starts collecting a user base, people will attempt to hack it.Two factor authentication makes your AWS root account unhackable. Only someone with your email address, your password and the token generator can log in to your account. Short of kidnapping, this is unlikely to happen. Two factor authentication removes a major security vulnerability. All for the cost of $13.Sure you could use the free Google App on your phone. Right now, phones are one of the items most targeted by thieves. Perhaps this will change as stolen phones are set up to be disabled.

"I really enjoyed Joe Abercrombie's books Half a King and Half the World, so I thought that I'd give this book a try. Best Served Cold is set in Ambercrombie's ""First Law"" world, but the book is a stand alone novel (although there are some characters from the First Law book and having read them may add a little depth).Some Amazon reviewers have commented that the ""heros"" in the first law books are monsters: killers, guilty of many crimes. Abercrombie seems to specialize in this type of anti-hero (although this is less os in Half a Kind and Half the World).The world that Best Served Cold is set in has a technology level that appears to be equal to that of the late middle ages. Stone architecture is sophisticated and they have siege engines, along with the first appearance of something like gun powder. These are not sword and sorcery books, but sword and bloodshed books.Most readers are probably familiar with the saying that ""vengence is a dish best served cold"", so it should not give away much to write that Best Served Cold deals with vengeance. The main character is Monza Murcatto, a mercenary general. She has been through many wars, with all of the bloodshed and murder that these entail. As a woman mercenary general, she has to be tough, tougher than a male general would be. As a result, her personality seems almost flat, her only driving desire is vengeance at any cost. This includes the cost of her own life, but also the cost of any bystanders who happen to be near her target.One of the themes in the book is that doing good has no reward. Interestingly, another theme, elaborated at length by one of Monza's opponents, is the futility of vengeance.While the world that the story is set in may contain some admirable people, they make no appearance in the book. The endless campaign for Monza's vengeance is saved from tedium by Abercrombie's excellent writing and descriptions of the bloody world that the characters rampage through. Reading his description of the cities, you can almost see them. Monza is a flat character, consumed by the desire for death, but the other characters are more fully drawn.These are adult novels and if you object to descriptions of sex (along with the bloodshed) these are probably not books for you.After finishing the book, I had to wonder if Abercrombie really believes that good deeds are completely pointless and are frequently punished. Our civilization rose from a world somewhat like that in Best Served Cold. Somehow democratic republics emerged where we have science and law, not just the rule of the warrior. In fact, our generals frequently have Phds. One of the forces that drove civilization, in my view, is the human desire for justice. But such justice is completely missing from the dark First Law world.After reading this book I'm not sure that I want to read others in this series.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2YGCSYLBDWQ0Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002GUK7JQ#wasThisHelpful","R2YGCSYLBDWQ0Y","A2RELU94NM7RWI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RELU94NM7RWI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Facebook, as portrayed in Kate Losse's book The Boy Kings is a case study of Silicon Valley culture in the twenty-first century. In many dimensions, Facebook is an impressive achievement that has taken years of engineering work. As I write this, Facebook has a billion users, spread throughout the world. Ms. Losse was involved in the birth of some of Facebook's first overseas networks and was the program manager for the internationalization effort. Facebook has defined social networking and has changed the way many people interact.Along with its impressive achievements, the Facebook described by Ms. Loose can also be seen as an exemplar of many of the things that are wrong with The Valley.In 1956 William Whyte wrote a book titled The Organization Man. In Businessweek, David Leonard writes that The Organization Man was ""A critique of society as much as business culture, the book diagnosed groupthink--a term Whyte coined--in the suburbs as well as the boardroom, and became one of the century's most influential pieces of commentary."" Although Facebook claims that their ethos is ""move fast and break things"", what they have created in many ways mirrors the corporations of their Grandfather's generation.Corporations in the 1950s expected conformity and so it is with Facebook and many other Silicon Valley Companies. I once spoke to a start-up that was building a ""App"" for the Apple iPhone which, they claimed, was going to change the world (an iPhone App, really?) The actual nature of this change is rarely stated but everyone is supposed to buy into the idea that they are doing transformative work.From the beginning, Mark Zuckerberg has believed that Facebook has a mission that will change the world. The mission of connectedness and ""transparency"" (where all your information is public).  The ""mission"" is something that employees are supposed to endorse or at least never openly question. At one point in the book Ms. Losse recounts a conversation she had with a manager who said that one of the people in his group didn't ""get"" the mission and he was going to have to fire her. Facebook employees are expected to be enthusiastic users of Facebook, displaying their curated public personas.In the 1950s large corporations mostly employed white protestant men. Women were usually secretaries and the idea that a women could run the corporation would have been considered outlandish.As Ms. Losse describes Facebook, the culture is similarly homogeneous. Almost all of the engineering staff is under 30 and male. Mark Zuckerberg famously said:""I want to stress the importance of being young and technical,"" he stated. If you want to found a successful company, you should only hire young people with technical expertise.""Young people are just smarter,"" he said with a straight face. ""Why are most chess masters under 30?"" he asked. ""I don't know,"" he answered. ""Young people just have simpler lives. We may not own a car. We may not have family."" In the absence of those distractions, he says, you can focus on big ideologies. He added, ""I only own a mattress."" Later: ""Simplicity in life allows you to focus on what's important."" [quote from Venture Beat, March 2007]When Zuckerberg says ""focus on what's important"", he means focus on ""the mission"", focus on Facebook. The Organization Man was expected to have a family and a supportive wife - Facebook in Losse's book had dispensed with this. Facebook provided a living allowance so that staff could live near Facebook, all the better to dedicate their waking hours to the Company.The claim that Silicon Valley is a ""meritocracy"" where anyone can succeed based on their skills and intelligence is being exposed for its hollowness. Ms. Losse describes in detail what she sees as the gender discrimination of the ""Boys"" who run Facebook. Facebook doesn't value work outside of engineering and jobs occupied by women at Facebook, like Product Management and customer support are seen as lesser work. The exception to Facebook's engineering stratificaiton seems to be Sheryl Sandberg, who appears to be so brilliant that she's in her own category.Kate Losse's Facebook is hardly alone in populating engineering with young men. As an exercise, look at the web pages of any number of start-up companies. Many of them have team pictures. Most of these team pictures look so similar that it is difficult to tell them apart. You will see few women and even fewer people over 40 years of age.Age and gender discrimination are sometimes justified on the basis of ""cultural fit"". Ms. Losse describes the Facebook engineers as ""Boys"" who are still riding around on stake boards and going out after work drinking. Most people grow up and leave these things behind. As they mature, their engineering and system design skills mature as well. But this is lost on Ms. Losse's Facebook and most Silicon Valley companies where experience is discounted.Kate Losse is a good writer and the book is an easy and enjoyable read. Her book is not only an account of The Boy Kings, but also of her journey with Facebook from a small company to a globe spanning social network. She is good at describing some of her inner self. She seems to have a taste for rocker boys. But at Facebook the rocker boys are software engineers. She has a long friendship with an engineer she calls Thrax. In most of her relationships she substitutes the curated intimacy of Facebook for real world intimacy. It is not until the end of the book that she finally has sex with Thrax, although they have danced round it for years.There are a few strange omissions. Losse starts out as an hourly employee. At some point she must have become more of an official employee with stock options, but it's never clear when this happens.At another point she mentions to Zuckerberg that Facebook should get a house with a pool. He agrees and they rent a house which the engineers and support staff hang out in. Losse apparently moves into one of the rooms, but she never comments on this arrangement. For example, was she expected to clean up after the engineers who, no doubt, left pizza boxes and beer bottles scattered around? What was it like living in Facebooks early hangout house?I never got the feeling from reading the book that Losse burns with any particular passion. The closest she comes is her love of travel. But transience is an interlude, not a life. Hopefully Facebook, with its various pathologies, will not be the defining event of her life.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RMOO8SVA2JT6Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007MAXH38#wasThisHelpful","RMOO8SVA2JT6Z","A2RELU94NM7RWI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RELU94NM7RWI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I first read Neuromancer when it was published in paperback, in 1984. Of the thousands of books that I have read since then, Neuromancer remains one of my favorite books. I have read the book several times and will, without a doubt read it again.Neuromancer is a singular work for Gibson. He said that he could never write another book like this again, that this is a work from the heat and passion of his youth (he mentions that all authority figures in the book end up dead).As countless people have commented, Neuromancer is one of the first imaginings of a vast globe spanning computer network and of a world on-line. The writing is unforgettable and the plot is complex and multifaceted.I have wondered if Neuromancer is like The Catcher in the Rye, a book that tends to have generational attraction. People who are a couple of decades younger than I am don't see to love the book as much as I do. Perhaps this is because I remember when what Neuromancer described was completely science fiction. At time before the Internet had changed everything.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R25CB7UXI91G01/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000O76ON6#wasThisHelpful","R25CB7UXI91G01","A2RELU94NM7RWI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RELU94NM7RWI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Joe Abercrombie's novel Half the World is the second book in his Shattered Sea series, which begins with Half a King. The characters in Half the World overlap with those in Half a King, but I think that you will enjoy the book even if you have not read its predecessor. I liked Half the World better than Half a King because it is less dark, in both setting and the themes.If you liked Half a King, I think that you will definitely like Half the World. If you don't like any kind of plot summary then stop reading now and buy the book when it comes out.Abercrombie is an excellent world builder. The Shattered Sea is a cold sea that is partially ice bound in the winter. The Kingdoms that surround the sea have a long history of feuds and warfare There is a High King that, in theory, all of the Kingdoms owe allegiance to.  The people of the northern Kingdoms are closely modeled after the Vikings (they reminded me of the early books in Bernard Cornwell's Saxon Tales). They sail longboats and fight in shield walls. They are largely illiterate warriors where history exists only in songs sung by bards. In such societies the King is a war leader and must be a strong warrior, always ready to fight. Abercrombie adds an interesting twist.. To temper the constant warrior's refrain that ""steel is the answer"" to all problems, Kings have ministers who are almost always women (generally known as ""Mother"") who council restraint and, when possible, peaceful solutions.The novels so far have been set in Gettland. In Half the World the minister is, unusually, a man, named Father Yarvi. Yarvi is from the royal line of Gettland and briefly sat in the Black Chair of Gettland as its King. However, Yarvi's left hand is crippled and unable to hold a shield. His deformities mean that he can never be a war leader. In Half a King Yarvi realized that he can never be the King. But unlike the warriors, Yarvi is not illiterate and he is smart. He comes to the realization that although he cannot be Kind, he can be a power behind the King as a minister, which is what he always expected he would be before his brother and father were killed in battle.Yarvi is the puppet master behind the plot in Half the World, but he is not the central character. One of the elegant twists in Abercrombie's plots is that there are the rare woman warriors in this Viking like society. One of these woman warriors is Thorn Bathu, who is the central character and hero of this story.Half the World is the coming of age story of Thorn, as Father Yarvi maneuvers to save Gettland from the machinations of the High King and his minister, Grandmother Wexen. The fact that Abercrombie brought in a new character rather than just continuing a linear story with the same characters adds to the richness of the story. I never get as much time to read as I wish, but I still finished this book in a few days. I will impatiently wait for the Abercrombie's next book in the Shattered Sea series.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RGHV9R1Y94W2A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0804178429#wasThisHelpful","RGHV9R1Y94W2A","A2RELU94NM7RWI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RELU94NM7RWI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Peter Fugazzotto, the author of Black River, is an excellent writer. When the characters slog through the desert or through the cold glens of the North, you can almost feel the heat, cold and mist. From his biography it appears that he has spent most of his life honing his skills as a writer and it shows.Black River is a sequel to the Peter Fugazzotto's novella The Witch of the Sands. The central character is Shield Scyldmund, who is a Northern clansman. Shield is the leader of a band of warriors who call themselves The Hounds of the North. The Northmen come from a warrior culture of clans, something like a combination of the Scots and the Vikings (but without the long boats). Shield and his Hounds have been fighting for a couple of decades for the Dhurman Empire, which needed warriors like them as it was conquering its neighbors. But the wars are starting to wind down and the Hounds are aging warriors. Their beards are starting to grey and they can see their horizons closing in. As the Empire focuses inward on the purity of the Dhurman race, the Northmen become killers without a war or welcome.The Hounds have no clear path to follow. They became exiles from the North when Shield killed the Warlock King, who had killed Shield's father. The Warlock King had unified the Northern clans and tribes. With his death the Dhurman Empire conquered the tribes on the South side of the Black River. Many of the Northmen saw Shield Scyldmund as a traitor to the North.Between battles, the Hounds tracked down warlocks and witches and killed them. While some of the wielders of ancient magic are evil, many are healers. In The Witch of the Sands we see that in some cases the Hounds are no more than assassins for hire.The Hounds get one final commission - to go North, across the Black River and kill a powerful warlock who is again raising the Clans against the Empire.This is a dark story. The protagonists lived by the sword and are little more than killers groping for some kind of meaning. Other than a long trail of death, they have accomplished little. The hopes they had when they were young are fading. The quest across the Black River is a return home and a last attempt at fulfilling what they once dreamed of.Peter Fugazzotto is a skilled writer and the tale that I have outlined is not the kind of story that would be woven by a shallow sword and sorcery writer. I look forward to reading more of Peter Fugazzotto work, although I hope that future books will be less dark.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 31, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2BKI5UYFOWHOL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QTYI9K4#wasThisHelpful","R2BKI5UYFOWHOL","A2RELU94NM7RWI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RELU94NM7RWI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am a great fan of K.J. Parker's Engineer trilogy, his novellas (Purple and Black and Blue and Gold) and his short stories (Academic Exercises). So far I have enjoyed all of Parker's work. Until I read The Company.Everyone has faults and The Company seems to collect all of Parker's faults as a writer.The Company is five men who have had a remarkable run as ""line breakers"" in the army. Line breakers break the line of pike men in medieval warfare. In many cases, once the line of pike men is broken, the rest of the infantry breaks and the army can be routed. Line breakers tend to have short lives, however. The men in The Company have had almost preternatural survival.The Company alternates between the history of Company A, the line breakers, and the current story. Neither of these story lines is very compelling and over a book which seemed very long, they became tedious.  The story meanders around and when I finally reached the end of the book, I didn't care much about the ending, but only that I'd finally finished the book.K.J. Parker has a rather jaundiced view of women. In the Engineer Trilogy the central character's wife never stand by him and is mercenary. The portrait of women is even worse in The Company where men don't trust women and this is justified by the duplicity of the female characters.If you're a K.J. Parker fan, I'd give this book a pass. Most authors have at least one book that doesn't work out and this is Parker's.","2.0 out of 5 stars","December 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1GI92KQCIK0F2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002B9MHQ8#wasThisHelpful","R1GI92KQCIK0F2","A2RELU94NM7RWI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RELU94NM7RWI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Review from an SUP beginner...Part 1: Unboxing and Test InflationPros:- Carry bag is well constructed and big enough to casually fit the rolled up SUP and with room to spare for all the other parts, and then some. Zipper opens up the ENTIRE bag which makes it easy to put in and take out the SUP.- Inflated easily at a casual pace in 8 minutes. Towards the last two minutes it gets a little harder, but not enough to warrant getting an electric pump, unless you are particularly frail.- After inflation it is extremely stiff. It's hard to imagine it's an inflatable SUP.- Paddle is fiber glass.- Instructions are pretty straightforward.- Padding is made of stiff foam so easy on the knees and lots of grip.- One of the few paddle boards with enough D rings for carry pouch AND to attach a kayak seat.- Handles on front, middle and rear.- There is a sleeve on  the board to insert the paddle to make the board and paddle easy to carry together.Cons:- Amazon will not ship this to Hawaii so I ended up going to Sea Eagle direct. However, all parts arrived well padded via Fedex from New York to Hawaii via second day air ($100 shipping).- Pump and gauge is as you would expect- a cheap plastic pump. Gauge display itself is not particularly well designed- part of the markings are yellow, and yellow on a white background seen in broad day light is generally not conducive to visibility. But all you really need to know is that the inflation point is in the region between the Yellow and Red which marks the beginning of the 12lb point. Recommended pressure is 12-15lb.Part 2 : In the ocean with gentle waves.Pros:- It is incredibly stable since it is so wide and is 6 inches in thickness. The flat tail also helps with stability. I tried a similar sized ""real"" board and it was much less stable.- It remained very rigid throughout.- Paddle floated without problems.- Padded floor is a god-send, sparing your knees and giving you incredible grip.- Fits well in a small convertible car trunk. Essentially it's the size of a golf bag. The paddles separate in half also making it easy to fit in the trunk.Cons:- Since it is so thick, climbing back on board can be challenging. Recommend approaching from the rear pushing downwards on the thick padding to hoist yourself up.- It moves slower than a regular paddle board and also tends to not track as straight.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RS0PY7KZG6GOO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TEBYHQO#wasThisHelpful","RS0PY7KZG6GOO","A7GXT5V1VL5UT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A7GXT5V1VL5UT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Note:I have never played any of the Sacred series so I am treating this game review on the games own merits rather than based on expectations of what this game should have been.Pros:- Plays like a Gauntlet-style hack and slash.- No inventory to manage. Ive played my fair share of RPGs dating as far back as the 80s with Wizardry. Ive played Skyrim, Diablo 3, Torchlight, and now and then its nice to just NOT have to deal with inventory management.- It actually has a black character for a change.- Technically the game is well executed. Audio/Visual quality are generally good. No noticeable glitches.Cons:- The dialog is truly terrible and the humor is forgettable. Oddly after a while you just completely tune it out. Its like a noisy jet engine. After a while you just dont hear it any more :)Summary:- Gauntlet-like repetitive hack and slash. Acceptable if that is what you are expecting and when sold at same price as Gauntlet (2014).If you are a fan of Sacred 1, 2, youve already seen the other reviews of this product- so stay away.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R29NH92E7CS3CG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IQCRO3K#wasThisHelpful","R29NH92E7CS3CG","A7GXT5V1VL5UT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A7GXT5V1VL5UT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have used a traditional heavy counter-balance-based steadicam system before which took a lot of practice.

"Pros:Extremely lightweight.Attractive.Watch was shipped from Japan and instead of arriving in a month as Amazon had predicted it arrived within a few days!Watch came in great shape. Brand new, including a pillow which the watch was wrapped around.Watch was already set to English and for the city in which I live including the current DST setting. Wow that's service.Inexpensive given the exceptional features. You can't find another analog + digital + atomic + solar watch that's reasonably water resistant in one package- ESPECIALLY not in a field watch.As far as its water resistance, I have swum with it numerous times in the ocean for a mile at a shot and it is still fully operational.Cons:Watch strap is indeed stiff as others had noted. I took advantage of the pillow that came with the watch and tightened the watch around the pillow to let it stretch over night. That seemed to help a little with the stiffness.Update: over time the stiffness reduces.Summary:This watch is essentially the WVA-M640-1ACR except it is rated only at 5 ATM depth rather than 10 ATM, and the strap is a nylon strap rather than a plastic strap.The nylon strap is what makes this watch look more like a military field watch, and also much easier to replace. I've always hated having a great Casio watch where over time the plastic strap would break and it would be impossible to replace. I guess that's probably what Casio intended...","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R13JINC96RADK5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00B2IT71C#wasThisHelpful","R13JINC96RADK5","A7GXT5V1VL5UT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A7GXT5V1VL5UT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Pros:- Thermal stainless steel carafe is well made. I brewed a container of coffee and let it stand in an air-conditioned office for 24 hours and it was still warmer than luke warm.- There is no heating element underneath the carafe (which is good) so it wont sit and burn your coffee into oblivion.- Overall device is attractive in design.- Makes a decent cup of coffee.- If all the high tech stuff fails you can still push the on/off button on the coffee maker itself.Cons:- Takes up a substantial amount of counter space.- Expensive for what is essentially a timer and on/off switch. It really isnt clear what the real advantage of having the timer be wifi accessible is. You have to go to the coffee maker to fill it before using it anyway. Why add the complexity, and the extra landfill as a consequence of adding more technology.- The large reservoir has markings on it and it gives you the impression that you can perhaps make a smaller cup of coffee (like the Keurig), but there is no way to do this automatically other than to manually turn off the coffee maker at some point in the brewing process.- While I was able to turn the coffee maker on and off via wifi, I could never actually set a time. The software kept saying there was a scheduling conflict and I hadnt even created a schedule yet.- The opening to the coffee pot is too small to stick your hand in for cleaning.Note:- Does not come with any coffee filters.

"I own a Philips Flexcare so that will be my point of reference for this product.Also Amazon sent me a different brush to review than the one pictured here. My brush only has 1 button on it and  2 modes of operation.Anyway heres my review for the unit I received:Pros:- Much lighter and 2 inches shorter than the Philips. Makes it easier to wield and carry on travel.- Dock is more secure than Philips- It has the same 30 second timer as the Philips but unlike the Philips the unit doesnt stop after 2 minutes. It just keeps going. I much prefer this because after my 2 minute cycle I typically go on to do tongue cleaning anyway. The Philips requires me to press the go button again. Anyway, small detail...Cons:- This isnt really a true cons and perhaps a perceived one. If you are used to a Philips the first thing you will notice is that the vibration on the Panasonic feels substantially weaker than the Philips. So I decided to try a simple test. I put a dab of tooth paste on each brush and just let it vibrate to see what happens. Surprisingly the seemingly weaker Panasonic brush seems to disassemble the toothpaste blob almost immediately whereas the Philips did not. Thats suggesting to me that the Panasonic is just vibrating at a much higher frequency which might lead to the perception that the vibration is weaker. In all likelihood it is probably just as effective as the Philips.- From what I can tell on Amazon, the Panasonic brushes are a tad more expensive than the Philips. And like the Philips its also not quite clear which replacement heads Im supposed to buy.Summary:- A decent light weight travel toothbrush. Although it feels weaker than the Philips it may be due to the higher frequency at which it vibrates.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1OAGKEFEVL4H3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JTUOVAM#wasThisHelpful","R1OAGKEFEVL4H3","A7GXT5V1VL5UT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A7GXT5V1VL5UT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The title says it all really. It is mint flavored hydrogen peroxide. Straight hydrogen peroxide triggers my involuntary gag response, the mint flavoring seems to help mitigate that to some degree.

"Pros:- Unit feels solidly built and has some weight but not so much as to be inconvenient to take on travel.- Buttons have a nice solid feel to them when pressed.- Lots of good auditory feedback in the system:  = LED light blinks when charge is low.  = Audio feedback (beeps) when you adjust volume level. Different beep sound when you have reached max volume.  = On max volume it is sufficiently loud for a small conference table.  = LED blinks when searching for Bluetooth connection.  = Additional LED lights up when muted.- Supports both USB and Bluetooth audio.- Unit includes a USB cable and an attractive faux wool case to protect it when taken on travel.Cons:Testing on my MacPro laptop:Audio output quality in Bluetooth is much better than with the USB connector. With the USB connector the audio sounds garbled as if it wasnt sampling enough.Music plays quite loudly over Bluetooth and for the most part does a good job, but do not expect a Bose! On the other hand audio output at voice frequencies appear to be very good. So clearly they are trying to optimize the frequency response for the intended use.Testing on my iPhone5:Audio input using Bluetooth seems to be an issue. When I test it with an audio recording app the recorded audio is decent. However when I engage in a phone conversation using the default iPhone phone app, the remote participant complained that they were intermittently losing parts of what I was saying, so I tried toggling back and forth between the built in mic on my phone and the philips to determine if the problem may be due to  ""cellular"" transmission problems. The philips seemed to be the problem.When I get a chance I may try out the other permutations.  But for now the device does not appear to be very effective.I began testing it again recently about 2 weeks since I wrote the review and now the microphone has ceased to work entirely. At first I thought it was a glitch with my iPhone connection so I tried connecting to my MacPro instead. With both Bluetooth and USB connector the microphone no longer works. So sadly I cannot review this further.","2.0 out of 5 stars","March 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R23UAGSU58UAYM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HH0ESYK#wasThisHelpful","R23UAGSU58UAYM","A7GXT5V1VL5UT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A7GXT5V1VL5UT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

It may have something to do with the substantially smaller opening the flies have to navigate to get lured in.A few weeks later and with warmer temperatures things are starting to work significantly better.Now this trap is teaming with flies and the flies are also laying eggs and you can see tiny maggots as well.I am attaching a video I took to give you an idea of what I mean.

But I would definitely say that this is the MINIMUM config.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 25, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2Y83T84MLHDTY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00C5GZWLY#wasThisHelpful","R2Y83T84MLHDTY","A7GXT5V1VL5UT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A7GXT5V1VL5UT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"An interesting device.At first when you connect it to the mains and turn on the water, you wonder whether you will have to keep pulling on the hose in order to keep it lengthened. But eventually it does and remains lengthened.Then you wonder how this hose is going to retract to its original form, and so you turn off the water and let it drain from the hose and it slowly recoils. Pretty nifty concept.The only thing I wasn't too impressed with was the screw on head that attached to the water mains. It doesn't really seal very well and so there is a small jet of water shooting from it.But I think given the choice between a non-retracting hose and this retractable one, I would go with this one. The water seepage is a minor nuisance.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 30, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1USC06WJL4WOL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00A0IW49W#wasThisHelpful","R1USC06WJL4WOL","A7GXT5V1VL5UT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A7GXT5V1VL5UT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I used to own Case-mate's Tank for the 4S which was a tough case with a sliding screen protector. Though I liked the concept I wanted something slimmer for my iPhone 5. Imagine the Tank has a Hummer wrapped around an iPhone.The Xtreme case worked very well. It is one of the fewer cases that have an integrated screen protector as part of the case rather than a separate, and annoying, stick on protector. It feels solid with lots of ""bumper"" protection against falls but does not have the huge bulk as in the Tank or Otterbox cases. The Military green with orange stripe is also stylistically awesome and makes the phone easier to find in a dark room- though it isn't bright green as to attract a lot of attention.I had considered the Lifeproof case as well since it also had a built-in screen protector, but the reviews (and also a friend who owned one) have suggested that when the iphone is installed there was an air gap between the screen protector and the screen itself which made it a bit clumsy to operate. This is not the case with the Xtreme. Of course to be fair Lifeproof's case is intended to be completely submersible in water and Xtreme is not.Note: if you use the Apple 30-pin to lighting adapter, it will not fit with the case. You have to use the regular lighting adapter that came with the phone. This means that  old devices  like a Griffin AutoPilot, won't work for you.So overall, Xtreme is a great case for someone who wants a bit more protection for their prized investment without having to suffer the penalty of bulk and having to apply those horrid screen protectors.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 1, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R18RJS5BW98X5G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008U6Q4LA#wasThisHelpful","R18RJS5BW98X5G","A7GXT5V1VL5UT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A7GXT5V1VL5UT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"When this game first came out, I took one look at the cover art and the silly name of the title and never looked at it again.When it hit the bargain bins I again ignored it for the same reason. The cover art makes the game look like a cheap 90s game, whereas in fact this game has quite a lot of depth- the visuals, the characters, the gameplay and the plot are all quite engaging, and certainly more so than the popular critics give it credit for.Some highlights of the gameplay""- When the robots are shot they come apart piece by piece and continue to function. So they will continue to crawl at you and shoot you. If you shoot off their head they will walk around shooting blindly. This adds something new to the first person shooter genre.- You earn points as you play which you can cash in to either improve your skills or buy more bullets, med packs, nano enhancements, etc- not to dissimilar to Borderlands.- You get to choose your squad mates and when you are shot down you can either use a medpack on yourself to revive, or if you are out, you can ask one of your squad mates for help. And while you are in this injured state you can still crawl (e.g. into safety) and continue to shoot before you eventually die or are revived by your squad mate.- The script and voice acting are decent (for a Japanese title).  Each character has a distinct personality/attitude which makes them engaging though cliched perhaps, but surprisingly they are sometimes humorous. This is refreshing for a FPS. I don't think I have ever laughed at or with any of the Halo and Gears of War characters. Probably the most cheesy line in the game is ""Holler if you're dead!"" which later you discover was intended to be cheesy as the game laughs at itself.- I really appreciate being able to give voice commands to your squad mates using a microphone. It is something seldom used in a first person shooter but makes a lot of sense. Further I liked the fact that if you shoot your squad mates they will eventually lose trust in you and stop following your orders. Also if you compliment them too much they eventually get irritated. Lastly the trust system will determine who will fight with or against you in the finale.- Just when the game starts to feel repetitive toward the end they change up the story a bit and things quickly start to conclude.- Watch the end credits all the way through- there is a final cutscene.As others have mentioned, the multiplayer is rather weak. The character selection is very generic and there just aren't enough people online to make it worthwhile to play.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 22, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJIE9FX9Q5YBB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004EW948E#wasThisHelpful","RJIE9FX9Q5YBB","A7GXT5V1VL5UT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A7GXT5V1VL5UT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

This is probably the biggest flaw with the shoe and it only took a few months  for the leather part of the sole to begin to wear.

"ProsThe product dissolves very rapidly in water.The taste is also very mild and it is very drinkable with water and therefore also mixes well with other flavors without overpowering it.It has a very light sweet taste because of the fructose.

But it accounts for less than 1% of your daily allowance. So it should not be a concern.

"I have used PSP since as far back as version 4. It is still my go-to image editor over Photoshop- which I have also used as far back as the early 90s when it was first introduced on the Silicon Graphics.For the past two years I've been primarily using X3, foregoing X4.X4 changed the Organizer from X3 and introduced the Manage tab whereby you need to put the images you are working with into trays. The problem with this approach is that whenever you want to go back to the Manage tab it assumes you are starting a fresh new workflow. So it requires you to either save things away or discard the changes. Fortunately in X5 they have removed this rather cumbersome restriction allowing you to move fluidly between Manage and Edit.Overall X5 appears stable (I am using the version with Service Pack 1). If you are switching folders too quickly when it is trying to cache them (especially if there are large animation files) there is a chance it will hang. Otherwise in a 4 hour test session of opening many files, copying and pasting between images, editing, touching up etc, it did not crash once.They also appear to have FINALLY fixed the scaling problem that has plagued PSP for as long as I can remember. In previous versions whenever you interactively scaled an object proportionally there is a chance that it will not. So objects appear stretched. So you have to undo and try again.The bundled add-ons: Facefilter Studio and NIK Color Efex filters aren't really worth it. Facefilter lets you touch up facial skin tones and expressions in photos- so that if someone wasn't smiling, you can make them smile. The problem of course is that sometimes these modifications tend to make people look creepy!NIK Color Efex filters - to be completely frank, I haven't figured out WHERE those actually reside. After installing it provides you with no guidance whatsoever. Once I figure it out I will report back.With regards to the so called dozens of royalty free brushes etc. Those have to be downloaded and most of them are the same ones that came free with previous versions of PSP.Conclusion:If you haven't updated PSP since X3, X5 is worth the jump (but get the standard edition, not the Ultimate). If you own X4, I don't see this upgrade as being necessary except perhaps to remove that limitation with transitioning back and forth between Manage and Edit modes. If that doesn't bother you then ignore X5. Upgrade ever other year or every few years.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 26, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2MBCIT6TVFVWX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008MR2GKA#wasThisHelpful","R2MBCIT6TVFVWX","A7GXT5V1VL5UT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A7GXT5V1VL5UT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Fantastic for growning herbs in your own home all year long! My daughter loves to plant things and watch them grow. We live in the Midwest so the growing season is not very long.

I like that you can purchase different kinds of starter kits to grow what you would like. The size is perfect for a small table top. When the light is extended it gives you ample room to work with your garden bed, and to work with the growing plants.The only issue is that the LED light is pretty bright in her room at night, so we moved it to under her high bunk bed so the light does not disturb her sleep.I will update further when her plants start growing.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RC457P0RI6NCY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010NBJMMW#wasThisHelpful","RC457P0RI6NCY","A1S7YQQGJPPFLG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1S7YQQGJPPFLG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"What a life saver! I have not slept through the night in months. I started waking up a few times a night, and the last month I have been waking up 5 to 6 times a night, and then would have a hard time getting back to sleep. Some times it would take me 2 or 3 hours to get back to sleep. I have been so exhausted at work everyday, and generally miserable. I figured this must be due to my age and that there was nothing I could do about it. Sleeping pills wipe me out, and make me even more tired during the day.I had heard of Melatonin, but didn't really believe any natural product could fix such a serious issue. I had just given up hope when my Mom mentioned she had tried Melatonin and it was helping her stay asleep at night. I decided that maybe, just maybe it could help me.I saw this Nature's Truth Melatonin and was excited to give it a try.The bottle states that you can take 1/2 a pill at first to get used to the Melatonin, but after such a serious lack of sleep I decided to take an entire pill (they are very small and dissolve quickly in your mouth)  I took it 30 minutes before bed, and fell asleep quickly. I did wake up 5 times, but went right back to sleep (which in itself was wonderful!) The second night I woke only 3 times. And the third night only 2x's. I still found myself a bit groggy during the mornings though. So I decided to take half a pill on nights 4 and 5 and I slept the entire night! Never woke up! How wonderful! And I felt refreshed in the mornings.If you have trouble staying asleep at night, you really should try these tablets. I consider them a life saver, as I can only imagine what a toll lack of sleep was taking on my body.A Great Product!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RTIA4Z67AT5C4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XHKC350#wasThisHelpful","RTIA4Z67AT5C4","A1S7YQQGJPPFLG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1S7YQQGJPPFLG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have been using a small blender for a couple of years, and unfortunately it stopped working a few weeks ago. I have been trying to decide which blender to get next, and was thrilled to get to try out the Oster Mason Jar Blender.I make vitamin shakes for my daughter and myself every morning. I used a vitamin/pro-biotic mix that I add Ice and almond milk too.  I need a blender that can chop up the ice as well as mix the ingredients.This blender does a great job of blending! It quickly chops the ice and mixes everything up to make a great morning shake.I love the cups - they are made of plastic, which I like because they are lighter to carry on the way to work each morning. They are made of a very sturdy plastic, and will last a long time. The lids attach securely and include a straw. Perfect for my daughter and I's use each morning.I am very happy with this blender, and think you will be too!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R227FTYUY9OBLA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XHXN4VO#wasThisHelpful","R227FTYUY9OBLA","A1S7YQQGJPPFLG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1S7YQQGJPPFLG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This Kaplan World History Book and DVD is loaded with tons of information. It is essentially a World History course with a DVD that contains practice tests.Looking through it, I can see that it definitely contains all the information you would ever need to know to do well on the test. If you already are well versed in World History you might find there is too much information. It would be easier to study if it was more of a outline and just important details to refresh your memory type of book. You will be well served though reading through the entire book to make absolutely sure you know as much as you can before the test.I have been out of school for many years, so I personally need the amount of information in this book to study for the AP Test. So for students that have been out of school for awhile, this would be a great resource for study.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3FBZYMHZ24DQF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1625231423#wasThisHelpful","R3FBZYMHZ24DQF","A1S7YQQGJPPFLG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1S7YQQGJPPFLG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I teach in a small private school, and have been hoping to get a new desktop for my classroom. My students love playing math and spelling games, but the desktop I have used the past several years is very old, and would not play videos or connect to the internet. This severely limited what games I could make available to them.The ASUS M32CD Desktop was ready to go right out of the box. I plugged it into the wall, and then plugged in my personal monitor, and the keyboard and mouse that were included.The desktop started up right away and only took a couple of minutes to do its initial load up. I was very surprised to see that it has wireless capabilities, I guess I am really behind the times! LOL  I was able to connect wirelessly very easily.I already have Windows 10 on my home laptop so I was familiar with it, but did not realize that it does not come with a DVD player app. I put in a movie for the kids and it would not play it. Turns out you have to pay $15 to download the Windows DVD player. I did an internet search and found that there are free DVD player apps you can use for Windows 10, but our school internet filter will not let me go to pages that have free apps. So, I will be paying for the download when I can.I use an external speaker that plugs in with USB when I show movies to my students, and I like that there are USB plugs in the front and in the back of the computer.I have been able to find several websites with games for my students to play and the computer has worked flawlessly since we have started using it.My son, who is an active gamer, read through the specs and let me know that it is a nice computer for school or office use, but did not have the graphics card and other things that would make it a computer he could use for his online games. It is a great computer though for Minecraft and Roblox.I have included a picture of the back of the computer so you can see what it looks like. My son wanted to look inside the computer, but there is a warranty seal sticker on the back, and if it is removed it voids the warranty. So you might not want to open it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2CDVGEC564PCO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014QVM2KO#wasThisHelpful","R2CDVGEC564PCO","A1S7YQQGJPPFLG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1S7YQQGJPPFLG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I got this for our cat Tiger - although he is just one cat, he can sure make a big stink when it comes to the litter box. I just couldn't clean it enough to get rid of the smell. I found that I had to use multi-cat litter which helped a whole lot with the smell, but the idea of a automatic cat litter box really intrigued me.The Healthy Home Automatic litter box was easy to set up, and works really well. I love that there are choices as to whether you want it to rake the liter hourly, every 4 hours, or every 8 hours. The rake glides through the litter and then lifts a trap door that then allows the waste to be deposited into the provided trash liners. (3 liners are included with the litter box)I followed the directions and set it up, while leaving the cats original litter box out so that he could get used to the new one. After he started using the new box I got rid of his old one.I'm giving it a four star rating because I came home the other day to find the rake part detached and litter all over the place. All I can imagine is that the cat was in the box when the hourly time to rake came around. I managed to put it all back together and cleaned up the mess. I was really worried my cat would not use the box anymore, but was happy to see that he still uses it. I am just really hoping the same problem doesn't happen again.I have also discovered that you need to use a fine littler and not a very chunky one ore else it pushes the litter up over the trap door when raking.This has definitely cut way back on the smell problem and I am very glad that we got this litter box system. I won't go back to the old litter box, but will keep using this.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R27X5V76S5YCDR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012DSMRDE#wasThisHelpful","R27X5V76S5YCDR","A1S7YQQGJPPFLG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1S7YQQGJPPFLG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"My husband needed a computer to use while going back to college. It was important to him that the screen be a big size so that he would be able to see well when typing up papers and doing research. The 15.6 inch screen is perfect!The laptop also needed to be lightweight enough to carry around campus and when traveling. It weighs 4.85 lbs which makes it very portable.One of the challenges of buying a laptop is figuring out what type of processor and how much RAM to get. This laptop has plenty for the college student as well as those who use the internet for social networking and light gaming.The computer powers up quickly so you can get right to work. It was very easy to set it all up and to start using it. The battery lasts about 7 hours as it says in the description.This laptop is eligible for the free Windows 10 upgrade which is great!It is an amazing computer at the price offered - perfect for the average user!!","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R19M0RO0AYNZ3D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VFY8LY2#wasThisHelpful","R19M0RO0AYNZ3D","A1S7YQQGJPPFLG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1S7YQQGJPPFLG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Love this BBQ/Smoker so much!The MoJack arrived in a big box, and in great condition.I first want to say that it looks great on my back patio - very high quality, and sturdy. I expect to be using it for many years.I love how it uses pellets - I decided to order some from Amazon until I could find some where I live. Using the pellets gave my hamburgers a great taste. Didn't fill the water pan the first time we cooked on it, and realized we should have because the meat was a little dry. The next time we put water in the pan and it made a big difference. Also make sure you season the grill by following the directions before you use it for the first time.The only issue I have had is that the directions were a little hard to follow  so it took some time to get it all together correctly. In fact we had a couple of parts left over after putting it together and had to go back through and figure out what we did wrong. So you need to read them very carefully.This is a great product - wonderful for BBQ and for smoking meats. It is very well made, and should last for many years to come. MoJack has definitely improved this grill and I would highly recommend it!","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1K5YORZIZ5DIY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JMAPD88#wasThisHelpful","R1K5YORZIZ5DIY","A1S7YQQGJPPFLG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1S7YQQGJPPFLG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The show itself is still great.  It does, in some ways, feel like a sitcom that has been on the air for a while, but they have been able to keep the show as fresh as a longer running sitcom can be.  This was done by doing a Cam and Mitchell engagement to wedding story arc throughout the season.  As in past seasons it does a good job giving all the characters stories, but there are times when the kids were kind of relegated to the background.As has been the case in prior seasons there were on location episodes.  This time one in Vegas and one in Australia.  The final two episodes of the season focused on the wedding day, and had the somewhat predicable disasters that almost ruined the day, but with everything being okay in the end.  They did get a little over the top and repetitive with the almost cancelling and moving the wedding, but by the end it was a funny and touching episode.For those who actually get the discs, the quality is very sub par.  First of all, after making the first 4 seasons available on blu-ray, the studio completely went the cheap route and made it only available on DVD, which many of the non-CGI heavy shows are doing.  Although Modern Family is still popular enough that it should have still been available on blu-ray.  Then to add insult to injury, the DVD transfer is horrible.  Unfortunately fox has focused far more on streaming their shows and made the physical media almost an afterthought.  On top of all that, there are very few extras.  Deleted scenes on disc 2, then a couple behind the scenes features on the location episode, a couple featurettes on the wedding episode, and a gag reel.  Okay for what is there, but not as much or as quality as in the past.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1JP7VUJUPPZJB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FGEO4AC#wasThisHelpful","R1JP7VUJUPPZJB","A1D1MIFRSG50Y3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1D1MIFRSG50Y3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is the movie that, to me, proved The Rock had some bona fide acting chops.  That, of course, is not always a given (see Hulk Hogan and Jesse Ventura for the laughably bad end of the spectrum) when it comes to pro wrestlers turned actors.  It was a role that allowed him to be the action hero everyone thought he would be coming from the pro wrestling world, show off his sometimes underrated comedic side, and even allowed him to make fun of himself a little.The story involves his character, Beck, who is basically a bounty hunter for a rich loan shark.  He calls himself a retrieval expert.  He is tasked with tracking down the boss' son (played by Sean William Scott in his most ""un-Stifler like role yet) in Brazil as his final job, after which he will be paid enough to open a restaurant and pursue his real passion as a chef.  Along the way he crosses paths with the head of a strip mining operation played wonderfully (albeit in an almost over the top ""more cowbell"" SNL parody of himself) Christopher Walken.  Rosario Dawson also stars as a member of the local resistance trying to get the mining company out of town.It is certainly not an overly complicated plot, nor does it take much thought or energy to watch.  That said, it is more than just a ""shoot em up"" kind of action movie, although there is also plenty of that.  If you are a fan of The Rock, or just a fan of action movies, it is definitely worth checking out and makes for a good way to kill a couple hours.For those who get the actual disc, for bonus material there are two different commentary tracks, one with The Rock and director Peter Berg, and another with a couple producers.  Then there are about 45 minutes or so worth of behind the scenes and making of features and deleted scenes.  Good for what is there if you like going through the extras.It is definitely not a movie that will appeal to everyone.  It would not ever win an academy award, but it is a good action movie that does not take itself too seriously.  Definitely worth a look.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3SFIAOAK84A8X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00016MSV2#wasThisHelpful","R3SFIAOAK84A8X","A1D1MIFRSG50Y3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1D1MIFRSG50Y3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It is more a nod to the spy movie genre than an outright spoof.  It is really a cross between the Bond films and movies like Kick Ass and Watchmen.  It is an extremely violent film, so if that turns you off to a movie then stop and do not even consider it.  There is not really any sex until the very end, and it really consists of a joke and a split second of nudity.  That said much of the violence is done in a very over the top and sometimes humorous way set to musical interludes.The story is set around Samuel L Jackson's character trying to purge the world of most of the human race in order to save the Earth from humanity, with a select few being spared.  The Kingsmen are a group of spies out to protect humanity and stop the plot.  Most of the plot around the actual Kingsmen story is Collin Firth's character Harry trying to get a street kid named Eggsy through the training.  Much of the story revolves around the training of potential recruits who get whittled down one-by-one.  I will not say any more about the plot to avoid giving too much away, but there are the requisite spy gadgets, a ton of action, some comedy, and behind it all an interesting story with a great cast.For those who get the blu ray, it looks and sounds great.  For extras you have an hour and a half behind the scenes/making of feature with the cast, crew, and producers along with Mark Millar who wrote the comic.  There is also a stills gallery of production photos and the trailer.  Good for what is there if you like to go through the extras.It is definitely not a movie for everyone, but if you are a fan of similar movies, this is a good way to fill a couple hours.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2FU0D1ZHXDA4D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00W6OOAAY#wasThisHelpful","R2FU0D1ZHXDA4D","A1D1MIFRSG50Y3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1D1MIFRSG50Y3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

This includes a time jump (albeit a very subtle one) in the middle of the season  The jump ends up eliminating or pushing to the backburner many of the season one stories (Barton's arc dealing with his homosexuality for example is almost non-existent after the first couple episodes) and Ethan is heard from in the first couple episodes and does not resurface until the very end.The big theme of this season are the character's relationships with each other, whether they are strengthening or deteriorating.  Intertwined with that is the backdrop of the civil rights movement, and racial issues in general, for the most part involving Libby.  Sexual dysfunction also becomes a major theme as the study begins to look at people with sexual problems instead of rejecting them.  And of course the entire sex as a taboo subject is ever present as it was in the first season.It is very important to note that this is not a documentary or even a docudrama.  It is a very fictionalized version of the story of Masters and Johnson's work.  There are many made up characters, story lines and plots that are added in the show that never occurred in real life.  It is telling the larger story, but takes a lot of liberties getting there.  This is even more apparent in the second season than in the first.  There is a lot added for dramatic effect, and if that is something that would bug you, it is best to skip this.  There are also some ancillary plots, like one involving the sale of diet pills that Virginia starts out in that ends up involving doctor Langham, a story between Lester and a new character, Barb, played by Breaking Bad's Betsy Brandt, and a story involving a new character played by Sarah Silverman.  Some of them work better than others, and while none play a dominant role in the show they are all given time to play out.For those who get the Blu Ray discs, the show looks and sounds great as you would expect.  For extras there are deleted scenes on select episodes, a History of Sex feature where the show runners and some of the actors talk about the second season, and where the show has been and overall where it is going.  Then there is a Women of Sex feature that focuses on the female characters, and a Men of Sex, which is a roundtable discussion between the male actors and their characters in the second season.  All in all, good for what is there.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R14JSZTMBMCOSK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00U3UL07Y#wasThisHelpful","R14JSZTMBMCOSK","A1D1MIFRSG50Y3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1D1MIFRSG50Y3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book is really a story involving the precursor to the Jedi, called the Je'daii, which were really more like samurai than the Jedi knights we know of from the movies and the other books.  They wield swords that they make themselves, but do not use lightsabers.  The narrative is about finding balance between the light and dark sides of the force, but not adhering to one or the other.  There is really nothing in the story about the transition the Je'daii  took to becoming the Jedi.  That would have actually made for a better story in the long run.This story involves a Je'daii ranger named Lanoree Brock, who is on a mission to stop her brother Dal, from opening a hypergate (which seems to be akin to a wormhole) which would open a gateway to other galaxies.  It jumps back and forth between flashbacks of Lanoree and Dal's Je'daii training and the present day chase.  I think way too much was focused on the flashbacks, and a lot of that could have been removed.  It does help set up the confrontation itself, but also gets in the way at times.  It would have made for a better read to have the flashback material in the first few chapters, then flash forward and tell the chase story uninterrupted.Overall it is a good self contained story.  Given that it takes place thousands of years before the battle of Yavin, none of the characters from either movie trilogy are even hinted at in this book.  You can definitely see the set up for what will ultimately become the Jedi, and even how their philosophy of balance between light and dark could have created the Sith, but that is really all in the background.  While it makes for an interesting short read, it is not really one of the novels I would read multiple times.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1UZNS6CDNBE5X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0345545052#wasThisHelpful","R1UZNS6CDNBE5X","A1D1MIFRSG50Y3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1D1MIFRSG50Y3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The movie is really about relationships and interactions between men and women.  It stars Campbell Scott as Roger, a sharp talking, womanizing sleazeball who on the one hand fancies himself a pickup artist who can talk any woman into his bead, but on the other cannot get over being dumped by his boss and is totally childish and immature after she ends it.  It also stars Jesse Eisenberg as his 16 year old nephew Nick, who runs off to NY city to learn how to get women from his uncle.The movie really is dialogue driven.  It is not an action movie at all, and even though it is billed as a comedy, it is not really a conventional comedy (at least not in the vein of something like The Hangover or any of the comedies of its ilk that have come out recently).  Really the high point of the film takes place in a bar where Roger is trying teach his nephew how to talk to girls.  It really ends up showing that Roger is not all  he claims to be, and Nick realizing that he does not really want to be all that much like his uncle.The movie is definitely not for everyone.  If you do not like bad language and frank sexual discussions, this is definitely not for you.  If you are bored by movies that contain mostly conversation and are not chock full of action and violence again not for you.  But for a character driven story it is not a bad couple hours to spend.For those who get the DVD itself, the extras consist of making of and behind the scenes features with the film makers, and a NYC walking tour with Jesse Eisenberg.  There are also a couple different commentary tracks on the film.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R17ISBUGCRAVTQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00005JLX8#wasThisHelpful","R17ISBUGCRAVTQ","A1D1MIFRSG50Y3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1D1MIFRSG50Y3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The slicer is easy to put together, and so far (I have used it once) sturdy.  The slices came out even and were much better than my attempt to ""eyeball"" even slices before which always ended up either too thick or thin.  For the money (and lets face it this is cheap) it does what it should.  The only complaint I have so far is that you cannot slice an entire loaf at a time because the guide only goes about halfway down the board.  It would have been better (and would likely be sturdier with a couple more screws) for the guide to extend the entire length of the board so you could slice the entire loaf at one time.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1GBUJPNU648ER/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00004UE6T#wasThisHelpful","R1GBUJPNU648ER","A1D1MIFRSG50Y3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1D1MIFRSG50Y3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The book is really as much, if not moreso, the story of Palpatine's rise to power as it is about Darth Plagueis.  Considering most reading the book will be well versed with the movies and know what the actual outcome of the Plagueis/Palpatine relationship will be, the author does a very good job of getting the readers to that point without making the story get boring or lacking suspense.  In fact as others have noted, by the end we see just how evil and manipulative Palpatine really is, and just how long his plan to become Emperor had been in effect.The book does tell the story of Plagueis killing his master, and taking Palpatine on as an apprentice.  The story essentially spans from when Palpatine was in his twenties until the events just after Episode I.  In fact some of the events of Episode I are seen from the sith's perspective and we learn of Darth Maul's origins, and how Dukou ended up as Palpatine's apprentice.  In all it does a good job of filling in the back story and leading up to the parts of the story we already know.  It is well written for what it is.  No, it is not a classic novel, but it does not try to be.  The pacing of the story is very good, and it is a pretty easy read.  Depending on how fast you read and how into it you get, you can easily finish it in a few days (or less).","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2EXI32DSQHKCE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0345511298#wasThisHelpful","R2EXI32DSQHKCE","A1D1MIFRSG50Y3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1D1MIFRSG50Y3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As has been the case with the other extended editions, this is really for die hard fans of the story and/or those who love bonus material.  If you do not fall into either of those categories then you probably want to stick with the theatrical edition because this will be way more than what you are looking for.Most people who are considering this know the movie well enough that I am not going to spend a lot of time reviewing it.  The extended edition itself comes in just over 3 hrs in length if you count the credits.  It has tacked on about 25 minutes to the theatrical version of the film.  There is generally a lot more action in this movie than the first, and it really just launches into the story.  The only real setup is a flashback showing Gandalf and Thorin meeting at the Prancing Pony in a scene that was taken from the Lord of the Rings Appendices.  As most know this movie started to diverge more from the novel (because of in large part the decision to split the story into three movies), although many elements of the book are in the movie.  The highlight of course, is the full reveal of Smaug and the scene with Bilbo when he is trying to find the stone, which leads into the climax of the movie which is a battle between the dragon and the dwarfs.The real meat of the extended edition are the two bonus discs (which are titled appendices 9 and 10).  Between the two there are 10 hours of bonus material.  The first disc is really a bunch of behind the scenes and making of features showing the process of filming and creating the movie.  The 10th disc goes more into how they came up with various plot points, the look of the movie etc.  There is a great hour and sixteen minute feature on conceptualizing the look of Smaug and the process Benedict Cumberbatch went through to give his performance.  If you are a fan of bonus material you cannot go wrong with what you get here.Chances are if you are getting this you know what to expect because you have the other extended editions.  It is much the same as before.  You get a ton of material, and the movie looks as sounds great as you would expect.  Plus the movie is on a single disc unlike the LOTR extended editions, which is a nice plus.  The only downside is with both the movie and the bonus material, if you have to stop (and watching everything straight through is almost impossible) it will not pick up where you left off.  A relatively minor point, but it is easy enough to do that they should have done it.  Otherwise, everything is great and it is definitely worth adding to your collection.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2NXOT36ZAXYYB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MG4RIXU#wasThisHelpful","R2NXOT36ZAXYYB","A1D1MIFRSG50Y3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1D1MIFRSG50Y3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"WARNING....This will contain spoilers from season 1, and hints, but no major giveaways from season 2.  If you have not seen season 1 yet proceed at your own risk.Hannibal is an interesting show in that the audience is ""in"" on much more of the story than the characters are.  We know where the story is going, but the show is taking much more creative license with the path of how to get there.  So while we know who Hannibal is, and where he will ultimately end up, since the show predates the events of the novels and the other movies, it is definitely putting its own twist on the story.Season 2 picks up after the events of season 1, with Will (Hugh Dancy) in jail framed for Hannibal's (Mads Mikkelsen) murders.  He is still out to prove Hannibal is the Chesapeake Ripper, but has the additional obstacle of having to do so from behind bars.  The season actually opens showing part of the events from the season finale, so we know what the story is leading up to, and the rest of the season plays out the events that lead to that moment.The thing you have to accept from the series is that while it pays homage to, and uses the overall universe that the books and movies were set in, it twists events changes characters etc to meet its needs.  For example the reporter from Red Dragon, Freddie Lounds is now a female, Dr. Chilton has a much more expanded role then he ever had in the films, and the characters are all more intertwined in the film.  So if you cannot accept the fact that the show does not mirror the world of the novels and movies exactly, and does things that would ultimately change some of the mythos, then you should steer clear of this.Mads Mikkelsen does a great job making the Hannibal Character his own.  His take on Hannibal is much different than Hopkins' and you really do not see him turning into Hopkins' version. Every so often however he lets in a little of the snark that Hopkins brought to the character.  While a lot goes on throughout the 13 episodes, the season boils down to Will, Jack, Hannibal and Alana, and Will trying to convince the others of what Hannibal is, while playing a dangerous game of friend and enemy with Hannibal.  This season also introduces the Mason Verger storyline showing its twist on what Hannibal did to Mason, and also introduces Mason's sister Margo who was left out of the movie version of Hannibal.Like the first season not everyone makes it out unscathed, and the season ends on a pretty big cliffhanger that leads you wondering about many character's fates.For those who get the discs, the show looks and sounds great on Blu Ray.  The same stunning visuals that were prevalent in season 1 are here too.  As far as extras go, there are commentary tracks on many episodes.  All have Bryan Fuller, and one other person, which changes each time.  There are two different commentary tracks on the season finale.  There are also several deleted scenes a couple different making of features (including an 1hr 20 min one on the making of the 5th episode) and a great Post Mortem series in which Scott Thomson (who plays one of the Lab techs, Jimmy) interviews members of the cast and crew.  That is the only extra that Mads Mikkelsen actually appears in to discuss the character.  Then there is gag reel.  All in all a lot of content for those who like going through the bonus material.Like the first season the series is very violent and leaves little to the imagination when it comes to the kills and gore.  There is some sexual content, but that is relatively tame compared to other shows of Hannibal's ilk ( to the extent there are any) especially shows like The Americans or some of the basic cable shows.  It is definitely going to be hard to watch if you have a weak stomach.  But if that does not bother you, and you are a fan of the books and movies, yet can accept the series as being its own thing, then I highly recommend it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R313APS6UDOW2I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LHVZIT4#wasThisHelpful","R313APS6UDOW2I","A1D1MIFRSG50Y3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1D1MIFRSG50Y3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It is big, and pretty heavy (about 50 pounds in the box with all the packaging). It will definitely take up a lot of desk or shelf space.  It can connect to your wi-fi or directly to a computer via a USB cable.  I have it set up in the living room via a wi fi connection so everyone in the house can print to it.The printer is very easy to set up.  Setting it up and connecting it to wi-fi only takes about 10 minutes.  The software installation probably takes another 10 minutes.  The install instructions are a bit confusing because they allow for setting up the printer at your desk too, which you do not have to do if you go through the printer's touch screen menu.  Once everything sets up it prints very fast both in black and color.  Especially if you are just printing mainly text.  It can also print and scan oversize paper (which was the appeal for me).  I would definitely recommend it if you need  or want a printer/scanner combo.  If not you could probably get by with a less expensive option.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R341B9Z0OKC3AF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JXLGETI#wasThisHelpful","R341B9Z0OKC3AF","A1D1MIFRSG50Y3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1D1MIFRSG50Y3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"WARNING...this will contain spoilers from season one, one spoiler (although since it is in episode 1 it is not much of one) and hints from season 2.  If you have not seen season 1 proceed with caution.You know what you get with a show like this.  It takes a lot of suspension of disbelief and not trying to break it down logically.  If you try to nitpick everything you will probably end up hating it.  If you can take it for what it is, then it is entertaining, even if silly at times.Season 2 picks up after the events of season 1 where Joe is blown up in the shed, and Ryan and Claire stabbed in Ryan's apartment.  We see the aftermath of the stabbing, then the show flashes forward 1 year.  At that point Ryan seemingly has his life together.  He is sober, out of the FBI and teaching.  We quickly find out that much of it is an act, and that he does not believe Joe is dead, and is working with his niece (played by Jessica Stroup) to try and track Joe down.There is also a new cult out there, who does not believe Joe to be dead, and commits a series of murders to try and lure Joe out.  We find out at the end of episode 1 (spoiler) that Joe really did survive the fire and has been hiding out separated from the other cult members who managed to get away at the end of season 1.  Mike and Ryan eventually end up teaming up again, along with Ryan's niece and the FBI (mainly in tow and a step behind) end up tracking Joe, and the new killers.  Mike and Ryan's relationship is strained after the events of season 1, and because of that and things that happen in season 2, Mike becomes a darker and darker character.The show definitely tries to go for the over the top shocking moments just as in season 1.  This season it is much less of who is bad vs good.  There was really only a couple instances of that, then the good guy/bad guy aspect was pretty clear with all the characters.  In that way the twists that do happen in this season are a little easier to swallow than those that occurred in season 1 where it seemed damn near everyone was a part of the cult.  The season was in danger of going off the rails a bit by introducing too many unnecessary characters, but did a good job of eliminating them by the final couple episodes and getting it back to the main characters.By the end of season 2, some of the plot lines are resolved, at least to the point where the character's roles are clearly going to change.  There is also a big unresolved plot line that you know will at least be part of the season 3 focus.  Like in season 1, not all the characters make it out alive, but they did a good job of not just doing a rehash of season 1.For those who get the physical discs, like all WB sets the series comes with blu ray discs and (whether you want them or not DVD).  There are 3 blu rays and 4 regular DVDs.  The show looks and sounds great on Blu Ray as you would expect.  For extras there are short ""Inside The Following"" behind the scenes features for most episodes, deleted scenes for select episodes, the comic-con panel, more behind the scenes features, and a gag reel spread across the three discs.  Unfortunately, again like all newer WB sets, there is no way to play it in a season mode.  So if you stop in the middle of the episode, you have to find where you were after the disc booting up from scratch again.  Not a major issue, but still kind of a pain.Overall, the series is well acted, but does have its moments with the writing.  Like I said above, if you cannot suspend your disbelief or have to have logic driven plot and story lines all the time, then this may not be the show for you.  Plus you have to accept it is ultra violent, with a lot of killing.  I cannot necessarily say if you liked season one you will like this one, but if you can accept the show for what it is, then I think it is still entertaining.  Certainly not a perfect show, or a perfect season, but still good, and sets up what could be a very compelling and better season three.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RY886KAZ2WKF7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LERXGMW#wasThisHelpful","RY886KAZ2WKF7","A1D1MIFRSG50Y3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1D1MIFRSG50Y3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"WARNING...this contains some season 1 spoilers and hints, but no major giveaways from season 2.  If you have not seen the first season proceed at your own risk.It can certainly be argued the second season of Banshee was even better than the first.  At the very least they are on par with each other.  In part because much of season 2 is a continuation of what was set up in season 1, and also fleshes out the story lines from season 1.  Given that they only have 10 episodes to pack everything in, a lot happens.Season 2 has the main storylines of Anna/Lucas/Rabbit, and the ancillary stories involving Anna's/Carrie's family.  Then you have Kai Proctor vs Lucas and Proctor vs Longfellow.  Intertwined in those story lines is the insertion of Rebecca, who like Proctor, was excommunicated from the Amish community.  The main stories intersect at times, are independent at others, and sometimes intersect with the ancillary storylines involving the other characters, including a visit from the real Lucas Hood's son, who discovered at the very end of season 1 that his father was being impersonated.Like in season 1, there is a lot of violence and sex.  I would not really call either completely gratuitous (with some exceptions).  In fact part of what was weaved into the story is Hood's desire to leave the violence that seems to follow him behind.  But he always seems to keep getting dragged back in.  All the characters walk the line between good and bad, even more this season than in season 1.  In fact, Brock is about the only character this season that stays on the ""good"" side of the line.  And while he does not trust Hood, he is becoming more accepting of the fact that he is the least bad of the bad guys, and wants to do good.Much of the season is spent fleshing out the Rabbit/Lucas/Anna storyline.  We get a lot of back story (told through flashbacks)  about what lead up to the events of Lucas going to prison, Anna becoming Carrie and ending up in Banshee.  It also sets up season 3 with more Proctor/Hood conflict and Introducing a new bad guy, Chayton Littlestone, a gangster on the Reservation.The season contained many great guest starring characters, among them Zeljko Ivanek as FBI agent Jim Racine who has been trying to bust Rabbit for years, and the stunning Odette Annable (of House and Cloverfield) who is Alex Longshadow's dangerous sister Nola (who made a brief appearance at the end of season 1.  The season again boasted great writing and acting.  Antony Starr and Ivana Milievi have great chemistry as the series leads when they do have scenes together, but both do a great job with their characters even in the story lines where they are not together.  Hoon Lee as Job continues the steal the show in almost every scene he is in.  The best was his ""introduction"" shown in a flash back in the last episode.For those who get the actual blu rays, the series looks and sounds great.  There is audio commentary on about 4 episodes.  A couple episodes with twitter commentary from the cast and crew, deleted scenes for nearly every episode, a few behind the episode featurettes, and deconstructing the title sequence features for every episode.  There is also a 45 min (or so) Banshee Origins series that show some of the events leading up to season 1.  All in all there is a lot for people who like to go through the bonus material.Banshee is definitely not a show for everyone.  It is very violent and sexual, but everything has a purpose.  It is certainly not what you would think of late night Cinemax fare, although there are definitely some Skinemax lite moments in the show.  That aside it is a very well acted, well written show with interesting and compelling characters.  Like a lot of the TV series (especially the cable series) it benefits from having a shorter season.  It packs a lot into 10 episodes, yet still gives all the characters something to do, and just as with season 1, by the time I got through all 10 episodes I was left wanting more, and excited to see where season 3 goes.

"Masters of Sex is a show about the famous 1950s study on human sexuality by Dr William Masters (played by Michael Sheen) and Virginia Johnson (played by Lizzy Caplan).  It is a fictionalized version of the events surrounding the study, with true elements woven into the story.  Like most of the cable shows the season is relatively short, just 12 episodes, but it packs a lot of story lines into the season.  Some of them get resolved, some are left open and some are even cliffhangers leading into season 2.What makes the show work is the quality writing and acting.  Sheen is great as the sometimes distant, sometimes off-putting  often times arrogant and sometimes very emotional Masters.  He plays the character very buttoned up, but in the moments where he has to let loose with any kind of emotion he does it very well.  Likewise, Caplan is great as Johnson a mother of two, who has no qualifications to assist in a medical study yet, in part because of the controversial nature of the work, manages to get herself a position first as Master's secretary, then as an assistant.  The two have seemingly great chemistry and portray the ups and downs of the relationship between Masters and Johnson extremely well.  Aside from the two leads all the ancillary characters and the actors playing them are done almost perfectly.The show does a great job of capturing the backdrop of the 1950s, from the absurdity of the duck and cover nuclear drills, to women's role in society vs men's roles, a hint of the racial divide that existed then (and still does in some way today) and so on.  The show even explores the issue of homosexuality involving one of the main characters and his effort to ""cure"" himself.  It also explored the science vs society debate that is still raging today.The show does have a lot of sex and nudity in it, obviously, but it is not there just for the sake of having sex in the show.  But for some that will make them just as uncomfortable as it did back in the 50's so if you are one you probably will want to skip this.  While there certainly are some soap opera like elements to parts of the stories, that part is toned down quite a bit, so if you hate soap opera like shows, be they daytime or prime time, don't worry about this one.For those who get the blu ray set, the show looks and sounds great.  For extras there are deleted scenes for select episodes, and making of and behind the scenes material spread across the three discs.  Probably about an hours worth of extras all totaled.  Enough to keep those who like going through the bonus material happy.  If you have heard great things about the show but have not yet checked it out, I would definitely recommend it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1FBBAVESQWOOI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HI4EFO8#wasThisHelpful","R1FBBAVESQWOOI","A1D1MIFRSG50Y3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1D1MIFRSG50Y3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The great part about this program is that all the workouts for one phase are on a single disc, so you do not have to keep swapping discs in an out, aside from the Saturday Special disc, which is the last workout of the week.  Each phase has a resistance workout (Sculpt A, B and C), a Cardio workout (Sweat A, B and C) and an Ab ripper workout.  In every workout there is a low impact modifier that you can follow if you are a true beginner or very out of shape, and a higher impact/intensity modifier that you can follow if you are in great shape, then one person doing the ""regular"" workout.One good thing about this program is that if you hate all the pull ups in P90x, this one has no pull ups at all.  Everyone, including the higher intensity modifier uses bands for the pull up type moves.  The low impact modifier uses bands for every non-pushup resistance moves, where the others use free weights.  There is no stretch or yoga DVD with this set (although depending on where you get it, it may come with the P90X3 Dynamix workout which is kind of a moving stretch workout, but there are some yoga moves incorporated into the program itself.  The workouts in the first month are all very short, under 30 min including the cool down.  The ab ripper program in the first month is about 8 minutes.The second month the workout times increase to just over 30 minutes each including the cool down.  The ab ripper program in the second month adds 5 more moves to the original 10 from month 1, so you are doing the same moves as in Ab Ripper A, with just a few more added in.  In month three the workouts are about 45 minutes including cool down.  The Ab ripper program add a couple more moves on the end so it ends up being just under 15 minutes.You have the option of following a strength program which basically means doing the Sculpt workouts 3 times a week, or a more cardio based program where you to the Sweat workouts 3 times a week.  The final Saturday special workout is a more cardio based program that works in some flexibility and ab work as well.  In the resistance programs every move set is 16 repetitions, so you will be using lighter bands or weights for the most part.  The max amount you would likely need in terms of free weights are 25lbs if you are very strong, to do some of the bicep and shoulder exercises.  My weight ranges went from about 10lbs for some of the shoulder exercises, to 25lbs for the arc presses.  Mostly though I stayed in the 10-15lb range and a medium band for most of the band moves and was still able to get a very good workout.The big con for the program is that it does not stick with the shorter (30 min max) workouts that most of their recent programs have been.  But when compared against the length of the original P90X workouts, this is still far under the time commitment required for most of those.  It also comes with a pretty easy meal plan guide for those who want to follow the meal plan and not go with their own nutrition plan.  Finally on the Sculpt workouts every move is shown for about 23-30 seconds before the set starts so you can see proper form both for the modifier and the ""regular"" version.All in all it is a very good program that anyone, of any fitness level can use.  It may be a little too easy for those who are ultra fit, but you can tailor it to some extent.  For those who are a beginner and/or out of shape I would highly recommend it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RBIL6N3EYEKFZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ODASJOC#wasThisHelpful","RBIL6N3EYEKFZ","A1D1MIFRSG50Y3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1D1MIFRSG50Y3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This was a movie that could have been very good, or very bad, depending on whether it was done right.  Fortunately, it was and the result was a very fun, and funny action movie.The story revolves around the formation of Marvel's ""B Team"" of heroes, or as the Honest Trailer calls them, Space Avengers.  It is set in the Marvel Universe, so while superheroes exist none of the guardians have powers.  The closest is Groot, who is a 7 foot plus tall tree looking thing.  There is some cross-over with the other films as well.  Thanos, who was last seen in the end credits to Avengers plays another background bad guy in this one, and the collector who was in Thor 2 also makes an appearance.The story revolves around an orb which is more powerful than most know.  It is in fact another infinity stone which can destroy almost anything (or anyone) who touches it.  Chris Pratt's Star Lord/Peter Quill character, who ends up the leader of the group, is basically a thief hired to steal the orb.  Which sets off a huge galactic chase leading to the end battle with Ronan the Accuser, played by Lee Pace.What makes these characters interesting is that even the good guys are not all good.  And they all have very different motives.  Drax is after Ronan on a mission of revenge, Gamora is an assassin for Thanos wanting to get away from him, Rocket, Groot and Quill are basically all bounty hunters in it for the money.  But what separates them from everyone else is when they need to do the right thing to save each other, and stop the bad guy, they do.Like I said in the beginning, this was totally a movie that could have bombed.  Considering 2 of the main characters were totally CGI, and one was an ex-wrestler who was never known to have what passes for good acting skills even in the world of pro wrestling, it could have gone bad quickly.  Luckily they wrote Drax's lines totally deadpan and made his character so monotone and serious that Bautista really did not have to do much other than be big and scary.  And the animators did so well with the CGI characters, that unlike how they would have looked back at the beginning of the CGI craze, they did not look fake or out of place at all.  Bradley Cooper brought great life to a wisecracking smart-a** racoon and the animators did such a great job giving Groot a personality, it ended up being Vin Diesel's best acting performance yet despite him only repeating the same line over and over.For those who get the discs, the movie sounds and looks great on blu ray.  I did not watch the 3D version, but the regular version was flawless.  As far as extras go, they pretty well mirror what was on Thor 2 and Captain America 2.  A couple behind the scenes and making of features, deleted and extended scenes, a gag reel, and short look at the making of Avengers 2.The movie does have a Star Wars meets Marvel Universe feel to it.  Or even more appropriately Spaceballs meets Marvel Universe feel.  It is as much a comedy as it is an action/adventure movie, and both aspects work very well.  If you are a fan of the other Marvel movies and are in any way on the fence about this one, I definitely think it is worth checking out.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3SAG0H9IFPSNM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N1JQ2UO#wasThisHelpful","R3SAG0H9IFPSNM","A1D1MIFRSG50Y3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1D1MIFRSG50Y3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Dark world is a continuation of Thor and Loki's story after the events of The Avengers. Loki is brought back to Asgard and thrown in prison. Christopher Eccleston plays the lead bad guy Malekith, who is trying to not only bring down Asgard, but gain power over the 9 realms by taking advantage of the realms converging. Thor ends up breaking Loki out of prison to help him track down Malekith.Of course the movie is heavy on action and special effects, which look and sound great on blu ray. They tell enough of a story and do try to in a sense resolve the Thor/Loki storyline (at least from one of the character's standpoint), and also did a good job with, at least for the first part of the movie, avoiding the question of why not just get the Avengers to help? Theoretically they could have assisted in the final battle, but in the Asgard and Dark World battles there was no way for them to get there. That said, Captain America does make a pretty hilarious cameo.The movie also rekindles the Jane/Thor relationship as he continues struggling between his duties to Asgard and his feelings for her. Kat Dennings and Stellan Skarsgrd reprise their roles, but neither are really given much to do. Dennings is really there for comic relief, which she does well, and to an extent Skarsgrd is as well. While Jane is central to the plot, there are times when she cannot do anything because she is basically sitting on the sidelines of battles between essentially immortal beings (at least as compared to her).By this point you really have to look at the Marvel Movies (and even to some extent Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D) as one big intertwined story. This definitely had the feel of a filler movie to get to Avengers 2, where we know more will happen. Unlike Winter Soldier, which I think was on par with, if not better than First Avenger for Captain America's story, I do not think this worked as well as the first Thor movie. Partly because I think the fish-out-of water, god with no power on Earth thing had a great comedic element that this movie did not, and could not based on the story. That said, if you are a fan of the genre and the whole ""Marvel Universe"" movies I think it is worth checking out.For those who get the actual disc, as I said, the movie looks and sounds great on Blu Ray. For bonus features there is a mockumentary on The Mandarin (the villain from Iron Man III) that was included here for some reason. Then a multi-part making of/behind the scenes feature on the movie and the story. A first look at Captain America 2, a gag reel, deleted scenes and a feature on scoring the movie. All in all, good for what is there, with about an hour plus worth of extra content.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R34KDHL8YYR870/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HERGNR6#wasThisHelpful","R34KDHL8YYR870","A1D1MIFRSG50Y3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1D1MIFRSG50Y3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is not a traditional television series.  It is really a mini-series or a 10 part movie, that has a beginning middle and end.  There is no thought of this story continuing over another season, which definitely worked for the story they were trying to tell.Like the 1997 movie it took its title from and was paying homage to, the show is a completely made up ""true"" story.  Using the same ""This is a True Story..."" opening from the movie.  It is set in MN, but unlike the movie was not actually filmed there.  This time set in the small town in North Cetral MN called Bemidji and the slightly less Northern and Eastern town of Duluth. To those of us who know the area, it is comical when they had the characters making a quick drive from one town to the other, when in reality it is a good 4 hr trip between the two.The story was centered around Lester Nygaard played by Martin Freeman, who at first glance is mirroring the character of Jerry from the movie.  We come to realize however that Lester is much more cagey and slick than Jerry ever was.  But he does start out as a bullied loser.  He runs into Lorne Malvo played wonderfully by Billy Bob Thornton, who is a bad guy almost in the Anton Chigur vein from No Country in that he is a hit man, but his motivation is more personal than it ever is for money.  For Malvo it is messing with people (especially the weak and/or stupid) and bringing out their dark side.  Lester is in a sense infected by Malvo, and becomes more and more of a bad guy as the series plays out.Allison Tolman and Colin Hanks play cops (one from Bemidji and one from Duluth) trying to crack the murder mystery involving Lester and Lorne.  Molly is about the only cop in Bemidji who has any sense of what is going on, and her investigation is impeded at all turns by the moron of a chief played by Breaking Bad alum Bob Odenkirk.  Hanks Plays Gus, an actual lovable loser character who first comes into contact with Malvo, and then almost becomes consumed with catching him.There are actually several stories going on at one time, which all end up interacting at points because they either involve Lester, or Malvo or both.  The only story that ties to the movie itself is that of grocery story kingpin Stavros Milos, which involves discovery of the ransom money buried in the movie.  Aside from that the series is treated separate from the movie, although there are several places where the series is paying homage to the movie (by having similar scenes) as well as many of the other Cohen brother's movies.What makes it work is the great writing and acting.  The writer of the series Noah Hawley was able to capture the feel of the movie without just blatantly copying it or making a spoof of it.  The show definitely belonged in that universe, but was its own animal, and while it was also had elements of dark comedy like the movie did, I think it was far more of a drama than the original movie was.  And even though the over the top Scandinavian accent and dialogue was there (done very well by Martin Freeman through the entire show and hilariously by Billy Bob Thornton for part of an episode) it was actually very toned down in the show.For those who get the discs themselves, the show looks and sounds great on blu ray.  For extras there are commentary tracks on three episodes. Two of them have Hawley and Thornton and the third has Hawley and Tolman.  Then there are a couple making of and behind the scenes features on the third disc and deleted scenes on all three discs.  Definitely enough to keep the people who like going through bonus material happy.Like the movie it is not for everyone.  It is very quirky and offbeat.  It is very violent in parts, and has as much swearing and nudity as a non premium channel cable show can put in there.  But if you are a fan of the movie, this is definitely worth checking out.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RN1A6A2M6941M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KXEMDRG#wasThisHelpful","RN1A6A2M6941M","A1D1MIFRSG50Y3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1D1MIFRSG50Y3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"++Warning++ there are minor spoilers in the review summarizing the plot.  Most likely nothing who is looking at this now does not already know, but if you have not seen the movie you may want to skip the first paragraph.Fargo is a very quirky, very dark blend of comedy, drama and suspense. It tells the story of a local doofus, Jerry Lundegaard, played brilliantly by William H Macy, who is a used car salesman in Minneapolis running a scam operation. He hatches a plot to have his wife kidnapped, and plans to split the supposed 80k (really 1 million dollar) ransom with the kidnappers. Things go wrong when the kidnappers start murdering people, and the whole plan unravels.Like is the case with most of the Cohen Brother's movies, the quality writing and acting makes it work. The comedy comes in mainly with the over the top accents the characters had (and yes there are people in MN that have that accent, but usually not that pronounced), and how the kidnappers keep messing things up.Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare play great polar opposite bad guys, one who won't shut up, the other who barely says anything, but both not above killing anyone in their way. The highlight of the movie is Francis McDormand playing the very pregnant police officer Marge Gunderson.For those who get the blu ray, the movie looks and sounds about as good as a movie that old can. As far as special features go, there is a commentary track on the film by the director of photography, a 27 minute documentary on the making of the film, a trivia track, the trailer and TV Spot. Not a ton of material, but good for what is there.Most people looking at this have likely seen the movie multiple times, or the recent TV show by the same name on FX. If you have seen the show, but not the movie, it had a very similar tone and theme to the movie. And sharp eyed viewers will note a tie in to the movie involving the ransom money. Like most Cohen brother's films it will not fit everyone's taste, but if you are a fan of any of their others, or have not seen the movie in a long time, this is definitely worth adding to your collection.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RW1AEZ3XMANR2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HZN8S9U#wasThisHelpful","RW1AEZ3XMANR2","A1D1MIFRSG50Y3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1D1MIFRSG50Y3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Rather, the Whitshank family just unspools; goes nowhere.The book covers three generations: Red and Abby, Red's parents -- Junior and Linnie Whitshank -- and Red and Abby's children, all wrapped around the nexus of the house on Bouton St., Baltimore.The main character of the book, in many ways, is the house on Bouton St. Built by Red's father, Junior Whitshank, for wealthy client. Junior covets the house and finds an underhanded way to obtain it. Tyler does a good job helping you feel the nearly obsessive focus Junior develops about the house and the social standing one acquires living at such an address. Two thirds of the way through the book Tyler uses the device of going back in time to illuminate more about Red's parents, and how their image of themselves became tied to the house on Bouton St. For Junior it is a bit of an arrival, in his mind achieving a status he always deserved, while for Red's mother, Linnie, it takes her away from friends and a way of being where she is more comfortable. A front porch is a house's most public face, and the non-verbal war Junior and Linnie have over the appearance of the porch's swing (Junior insisting it be a sophisticated natural stain, whereas Linnie changes it to a friendly Swedish blue, causing Junior to have it stripped back to natural again) exemplifies how each wants to see their future life within the house's walls. This part of the story should lead us to understanding Red more clearly, and yet it doesn't. You expect Red to either fiercely love his parents' house, that he inherits, or want to flee. Instead it is all handled in a tepid fashion. Life just goes on.The story lines of Red, the 2 sons, Denny and Stem, continue to be only sketchily drawn. Without getting a better handle on Stem's background, an orphan brought into the family as a toddler, it makes it harder to understand the dynamic between Stem and Denny, let alone between all the Whitshank children. Abby and Red's 2 daughters seem like after thought characters. In many ways, beginning with Junior and Linnie, the characters proceed from being vibrant, even funny, to more and more faded as the generations unfold. At the level of Red and Abby's children, I really did not care about any of them anymore. Linnie's Swedish blue had faded to grey.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1A293J350SW27/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1101874279#wasThisHelpful","R1A293J350SW27","A1BBAJVMUMR46S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1BBAJVMUMR46S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Let me start with the positive. I am always in favor of illuminating the horrors of our grandmother's era regarding the utter control men - fathers, husbands, doctors - had over the destiny of the women in their lives, and the laws that supported them. And we never shed enough light upon the abuses within the mental health facilities at the beginning of the 20th century. I appreciate Ms. Wiseman's research into the Willard State Hospital; what she revealed is both startling and sickening.I also do not have an issue with the story's overall device, that of following two characters, sequential in time, then bringing their stories together in the final chapters, even if I found the wrap up highly unlikely and quite saccharine. What I do have problems with is stilted unimaginative writing.We readers, after all, choose the medium of the written word because we enjoy it. In addition to plot, good writing is a bit like visiting a fine arts museum. You will never appreciate the wonder of what is before you unless you can fully enjoy the skillfllness of the technique. I want more than an interesting tale, and more than a wrong revealed. That could be done with a newspaper or magazine article. If I am to spend my time with someone's book, I also expect him or her to demonstrate their craftsmanship through the language they choose.When I began to loose track of how often both main characters (Clara whom we meet in 1929, and Izzy in the present) each responded to anxiety, fear, and distress of any sort with ""her stomach clenched"", or ""she dug her nails into her palm"", I began to find my own jaw clench. Surely a good writer could offer we readers variation and imagination. When the exact same phrasing is used over and over, it becomes thoroughly distracting. I found myself growling, ""Really, we're clenching again?"" Just as bad, all the secondary characters in the story are rendered in a completely flat manner, having no depth or complexity, no self-reflection or internal tension. I finished the book mostly out of pure stubbornness to recoup at least something from the purchase price.My opinion of this book may have suffered by my having recently read another historic novel that uses a very similar device, that of following two characters during World War II, children on opposite sides of the conflict, letting us follow them in alternating chapters. Where the books differ profoundly is in the subtlety and artistry with which they are written. All the Light We Cannot See by Anthony Doerr was a delight on every page. The main characters, as well as the supporting cast, were never drawn in simple back/white ways. You understand their heroism and flaws equally. Moreover, Doerr finds ways to be surprising, inventive and fresh at every turn.It seems to me the whole point of writing, particularly fiction, is to be read, offering the reader far more than story. Truly good books remind us that writing is an art form, language being the brush. Wiseman's What She Left Behind may have been informative regarding terrible wrongs committed upon vulnerable women who were, in some cases, nothing more than disobedient, but her job is writing. As readers, I think we deserve much more.","1.0 out of 5 stars","February 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R23V84GPIEDOJ2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0758278454#wasThisHelpful","R23V84GPIEDOJ2","A1BBAJVMUMR46S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1BBAJVMUMR46S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"We bought the special edition mostly because of the mug size versatility plus the experience we had with a friends machine. Whenever I stop by, she and I catch up over a hot cup of coffee/tea/hot chocolate - whichever one each of us chooses and the other can have whatever they want too. My husband and I were willing to go out to the Keurig website and get a wide variety of coffees, teas and a couple of hot chocolates to try so that we can focus on what we like the best. Here's where the versatility is such a plus. We don't even have to compromise on one brand/type of coffee. My husband is happy with Caribou Co.'s Sumatra, whereas my perfect cup is Timothy's Columbian. When we want tea in the evening, he reaches for a Twinning's herbal and I want a different company's Chai Latte. Additionally we can choose from china cup size, small mug and a larger mug with this model. (Some models do not let you pick mug size). And last but not least, there is no more worrying if we remembered to shut off the coffee maker when we're out: this one can be programmed for auto shut off.And one more comment. Another reviewer remarked on the packaging waste of the K-cups. It's true you are throwing out a cup each time, but there are waste issues with standard makers as well: filters, grinds, the original packages the coffee came in and all that brewed coffee that goes down the drain when a pot is not finished. Just a thought.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 27, 2009","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1R5X75Z6EVKE5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000AQSMPO#wasThisHelpful","R1R5X75Z6EVKE5","A1BBAJVMUMR46S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1BBAJVMUMR46S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"If you love your dog, if you love speed in a zen-like way, and especially if you have ever lost a close family member to cancer, you will be glued to this story. I guess my reaction to this book is very personal. We lost our only child to cancer when she was just five. Our dog would not leave her side and neither would our Main Coon. Those two animals were a steady force in her life and a tremendous source of comfort when she was gone. Sometimes when I felt overwhelmed I would go for long drives and I must admit there were times when speed did something strange--rather than being exciting, it calmed me, it made me concentrate, forcing me to feel the car as if it were alive. It took me somewhere else. The author really gets all of that. Stein has the dog Enzo explain this and more. Having the book written through Enzo's point of view allowed Stein to set much of his imagination free to great effect. Through Enzo we get to laugh at his frustration of missing thumbs (dexterity), we smell tragedy coming through his senses, we feel the rage at circumstances to the point where we would like to jaw-snap at some of the characters. There is more than one way to lose a child. Enzo's grief of his master's losing custody of his child is a completely different way of exploring the raw edges of a man's sensibilities when a family is torn apart. And in many ways this is also a buddy-story, a not always perfect relationship. I loved it so much I pressed my husband, who rarely chooses novels, to read it.Is this the best book ever? No. Did it grab me? You betcha. Hard. That's more than enough.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 24, 2009","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1GN92GO48X612/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0017SWPXY#wasThisHelpful","R1GN92GO48X612","A1BBAJVMUMR46S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1BBAJVMUMR46S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This Utimi USB vibrator is amazing! I had one before but it was a little too big for me to hold it comfortably. This one however, is the perfect size. I can hold it comfortably without my hands hurting from the vibrations. This vibrator is very user friendly. Simply roll the white dial piece to turn it on and increase the vibrations.

Roll it back in the opposite direction to decrease the vibrations and to turn it off.This vibrator is easy to clean and does not harbor any smells. It is rechargeable by using the USB charger that is provided. I am so glad that it is rechargeable because batteries are expensive and die out sometimes before you can even finish.

"This skillet was easy to put together right out of the box. It is deep and can hold and entire bag of one of those frozen Voila meals without any issue. The handle does not get hot at all when you are cooking. That was an issue I was running into with my old skillet and I have not had that issue at all with this new Utopia Kitchen skillet. So far it is cooking evenly but it is only a matter of time before my husband does something to mess that up :) We don't put our skillet in the dishwasher unless we absolutely have to but it does hold up to the sponge and hasn't been scratched. There's nothing chipping off yet. It is super easy to clean and it makes my life so much easier when it doesn't take 20 minutes to scrub it clean like it did my old skillet. I can't say enough good things about this skillet. I would highly recommend this skillet for your kitchen.

"I ordered the socks that look like they have flowers on them and boy did they come at just the right time. I was sitting in my living room just as the storms were rolling in and I was freezing. I'm one of those people who refuses to turn on the heat until I absolutely need to so the second these socks arrived in my mail box I put a pair on my feet and I was satisfied. They kept my toes nice and warm. They come up about two-three inches above my ankles so they would be the perfect pair of socks to wear with my boots because they won't show. The material isn't too thick or too thin. Just the right amount of thickness to keep your warm enough during this fall weather.Another thing to point out that I really appreciated, was the packaging. Each individual pair of socks were packaged and labeled. I loved it! It just added a cute touch to an item. It wasn't like something you would buy in a store where everything is just clipped together with one boring label tacked onto it. It's just the extra little details that matter to me. The actual style of the socks fits my personality to a T. My husband says I have the style of an old lady sometimes and that's just fine with me. I would definitely recommend adding these stylish socks to your fall wardrobe.I received this item a reduced rate in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R39WHKSE1XABQW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UPXD522#wasThisHelpful","R39WHKSE1XABQW","A2ZYD2EPOZORCS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ZYD2EPOZORCS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I ordered this silicone wedding ring set for my husband. I wanted him to have the option of trying on a variety of sizes so that he could wear the one that fits best. This set is great because there are five different rings and the best part is, you don't have to keep exchanging and returning rings. You get a whole set and one of them is bound to fit. My husband has a tungsten wedding band but it is all scratched up after wearing it to work. The silicone wedding band hasn't scratched that I've noticed and they fit perfectly. If you want a silicone wedding band then the smallest one should fit! You could match :) I work from home so I don't need the silicone ring.The massage ball is pretty neat as well.

"I love sports bras and this one has become one of my top 3 favorites to wear. I will say that I am 36DDD and I wasn't anticipating this fitting as well as it did. It was comfortable the entire time that I wore it and I didn't feel like I was suffocating while wearing it.I ordered the blue and pink sports bra. The blue is a cute, bright, and playful shade of blue. It adds a nice splash of color to my workout tank tops. It has built in ""pockets"" to hold the padding/liner for the bra. The padding is removable and should be removed before washing. It is super easy to remove the padding and put it back it. The opening is big enough that you can comfortable mold the padding back to where it needs to be.

"My issue with these sheets and pillow cases is the inconvenient placement of the tags. Tags don't belong at the top of the flat sheet where it can touch you while you're sleeping. There's nothing more annoying that having a piece of paper scrape up against your face while you're trying to sleep. Other than that this sheet set is nice. It comes with four king size pillowcases. I usually have six pillows on my bed so four cases for the smaller pillows and then the other two pillows get whatever pillowcase came with the comforter set I use. The fitted sheet fits perfectly on my king size bed. I haven't had to readjust the fitted sheet since I put it on and that's amazing for me because my husband flops down on the bed and then rolls around while he's sleeping.Overall, I would recommend this sheet set. It is soft and not too hot when you're sleeping. The black is a nice, dark black...Not a faded black.I can't wait to see how these sheets will hold up over time.

"First and foremost, it must be understood this is is an access point and not a wireless router. This access point is an entry level device into the 802.11AC world at 433 Mbps.After removing the device from the box, I noticed it was very small. This device is actually smaller than a cup coaster. The device was actually very simple to setup, but the instructions are very minimal. Do not expect a detailed guide or any technical information in the instructions. Setup is done via a CD on a windows PC. The setup utility will find the access point, and allow you to do a minimal setup. A few steps after the setup started, the AP was completely configured and running.Once on line, I tested the device with an Samsung S5 Phone, and a Windows Surface Pro 3. Both the Surface Pro and Samsung S5 would connect at 351 Mbps. Every once in awhile the Surface Pro would jump up to 433 Mbps, but would then return to 351 Mbps. The AP was around 2 feet away from both of the devices. Throughput testing was done using Iperf with the Surface Pro. Actual throughput numbers started at 80.4 Mbits/sec, and maxed out at 92.9 Mbits/sec at a rage of 2 feet from the AP. The second test was done from a different room on the same floor on the other side of a wall and stairwell. The connection rate on the Surface pro dropped to 117 Mbps with a throughput of 54.9 - 59.4 Mbits/sec.This unit would be best used to cover a room, small apartment, or to provide coverage on one floor of a two story house. It will not have the power or range to cover a larger one story or two story house.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R38FVC4K5OR5XT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MPDPFMI#wasThisHelpful","R38FVC4K5OR5XT","A2BZCHIDR5FTYA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BZCHIDR5FTYA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My husband tried this one for me over the course of a week.  In the applicator, is smells of citrus and maybe a bit of ocean.  The scent is not overly strong or musky, which is good as neither of us like many of the ""sweeter"" scented deodorants.  It goes on smoothly and is clear.  On my husband, the scent mixes well with his to create a pleasant odor that remains with him for the better part of the day without being overpowering.  From my perspective it is nice because of the scent.  He said it remains effective even when he goes out after work.  Overall, we both like the Axe Phoenix scent.

"My family games together. My son lives in the house directly next to mine. Recently while questing together on ESO ... uh, during an online game ... my Mumble (like Team Speak) started acting hinky. I could not help but think that this would be the perfect time to test out this product. I had already given my son one of the pair so all I had to do was tell him in group chat (within the game) to turn on his ""walkie"". Here are the results:One: The batteries only lasted 30 minutes before we had to recharge.Two: There are no cradles for the devices to recharge. Included with the devices are cords for us to plug into the devices and then into a wall's power outlet.Three: Recharge took several hours.Four: When we tried to use them again, they only lasted 45 minutes.Five: We spent most of our time repeating ourselves because we could not make out what the other was saying.Six: After tossing out the batteries given with the devices and inserting normal ""throw away"" batteries, the devices became clearer (though not crystal - more like what a weather radio sounds like) and lasted 6 hours.Our thoughts:The batteries that came with the units must be pretty old and can no longer hold charges - or something like that. Perhaps mine were faulty. I only know that they did not work well for more than 45 minutes and took what seemed like forever to charge.Yes, we are sure we were on the same channel and the distance between us was a little under 1/2 an acre.Once regular batteries were inserted we could hear what the other was saying, but not clearly as the description made me believe I would. The product description says it can use regular batteries for up to 21 hours. That must be if the device is on but not being used often. We used hands-free for our game questing and it lasted 1/3 of that time before it began sounding like the rechargeable batteries did.I give the product 3.5 stars and that is going on the assumption (something I hate to do) that the batteries that came with our pair were old and/or faulty. I would not suggest these if you plan to use them non-stop for 6+ hours. So if you are going on a long hike (in multiple groups) take extra batteries. If you plan to use them to report back to a camp site, I suggest checking in every 15 minutes to make sure you can still hear each other.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RLYLQ7OX4HDM8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00W75BLVS#wasThisHelpful","RLYLQ7OX4HDM8","A2BZCHIDR5FTYA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BZCHIDR5FTYA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"As others have noted, the Syma indoor copters are pretty sturdy.  It is fun to fly indoors and easy to control.  Purely by accident, I discovered just how resilient the little copter is while flying it around the room and not noticing my cat stalking it. Flying only a few feet off the ground, it passed his hiding spot. He jumped from cover and promptly swatted it out of the air...hard.

"This product is 5 pieces of thick paper with a tab on each. Unlike the picture provided, my tabs are not colored. Each divider paper and tab is simply white. When I say ""thick paper"", I do not mean as thick as cardboard. I mean thicker than normal computer paper. Each divider paper is already punched at the top with reinforced (on one side only with copper) for two-hole folders. This product does not include the folder or anything else that you use these divider sheets with. You must purchase folders separately.At the time of this review, the price for these 5 divider sheets is just over fifteen dollars. That is pricey for this product. You are mainly, in my opinion, paying for the Avery brand name. I did not find these to be any better than the cheaper brand that I normally purchase; use your own judgment.If you use pencil or erasable ink on the tabs, then you should be able to easily erase and reuse the tabs - if the divider paper is not worn out by then. I give three stars since the product does what it says and is as good as other brands.

"Okay, this stuff must be like catnip to outdoor felines. I have two indoor cats and one outdoor cat. (Actually a stray.) The indoor cats do NOT like wet/moist cat food; however, they will eat this.

The outdoor cat, who is used to catching prey and eating meat, cannot seem to get enough of this cat food. These cans are small. They are the perfect size for a kitten, but for a full grown cat I had to use two cans. (They must make a larger size and I just don't know about it.)

"I bought this kit, not quite sure how it would work up but for the price it was worth the gamble.  Turns out the kits is comprised of very nice quality felt, the patterns are stamped on the felt and are clear and easy to see.  You add the tassels and stuffing, but otherwise everything you need is included.  I would say that if you do not have the patience for tiny stitching this kit might not be for you, but if you enjoy small detail work, the results are well worth the time.I used by own cotton thread, but that was the only material substitution I made.  I did not follow the instructions as to color and stitch, but rather used more vintage colors and a single strand of cotton DMC thread.  The result was outstanding.  Very delicate, very vintage and very pretty.  Even if you used the colors suggested the results would be very pretty, but I would caution that a single strand of DMC works far better than the doubles they recommend.Overall - 5 star for quality of materials, clear instructions and impressive results.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 17, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RCJCR56EYE5AP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00G822LTM#wasThisHelpful","RCJCR56EYE5AP","A3UUZSGN8C9AEG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3UUZSGN8C9AEG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Ordered a set of these scarf bails and they arrived quickly and nicely packaged.  The color is an antique bronze and nicely matches all the antique bronze findings on the craft market today, so adding jump rings or extensions is easy to do.  The only thing I would mark this set down for is that a feels a bit 'plastic' rather than metal.  That was a bit disappointing, but once I had attached the center ornamentation, the bail took on some weight and the plastic feel was not quite so noticeable.  I would also mention that you want to use some caution when you pull your scarf through the bails at there were some burrs inside which would snag a more fragile scarf.  I simply used an emery board to smooth the inside a bit before inserting the scarf - problem gone.Overall, I would order this set again.

"This kit is very cute and quick to complete.  As with all of Rachel's of Greenfield kits, the materials are excellent quality and the instructions are clearly written and easy to follow.  This kit is one that can be completed with very nice results by beginners as well as experienced stitchers.The only thing I would caution is that you should measure, measure, measure before you cut your fabric as there is not much margin of error allowed in the fabric.

"Don't know why I did not think to look here a long time ago...silly me.  Use these for pill delivery to my sheltie and they work great.  He gobbles them right up just like a treat.  The price here is about $1 LESS per pack than what I had been paying in the stores, so this is the bargain.  Groups of six might seem excessive, but there are only 40 (more of less) in a package and when you use them twice a day you can burn through a pack pretty quick so the six-packs give you a good supply.  If you need to deliver some type of pill/capsule to your pet this is a good way to do it - no fuss, no trauma - just gobbling and wagging tails.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 10, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R284TRFI8IK9QM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008HRSWV2#wasThisHelpful","R284TRFI8IK9QM","A3UUZSGN8C9AEG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3UUZSGN8C9AEG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Ordered this 2-way for my dogs - a 2 year old Sheltie (25 pounds) and a 5 month old collie pup.  I ordered the 'medium' thinking it would be strong enough later for what will be the larger dog (collie) but still light weight enough to not burden the smaller sheltie.  In theory it was a good plan, but the reality is that the lead is a bit heavy duty for a smaller dog.  The strap is fine, about 1/2"" wide, but the latch at the end is very heavy duty.  No complaint as I would rather have the security of the heavy strength, but if you are working with smaller dogs you might want to consider down-sizing a bit to reduce the weight.  Otherwise, the lead is of excellent quality, appears to be well made and should work just fine for my needs.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 10, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R25EU74YFQ2ASB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000Y8UUBW#wasThisHelpful","R25EU74YFQ2ASB","A3UUZSGN8C9AEG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3UUZSGN8C9AEG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This stuff is great, once you open the package your mind starts to venture off to all kinds of possible projects!  I wanted to use it for transferring needlework designs to cross stitch fabric, so I was not sure if it would work.  Printed the design up and ironed it onto 18 count even weave fabric and had no problem with it at all.  The design transferred perfectly the first time.  While ironing I did pick up the corners to peek and see if it was working and had no problem when I laid the corner back down and continued to press.  The paper came off clean and easy, but if it does stick simply run the iron over it again and it comes right off - best removal  of the transfer paper results when the transfer is still warm from the iron.  I have an iron with the steam holes in the bottom and had no issue at all with the transfer.  The paper background is clear so you do not see it on colored fabric, only the design prints.  I noticed that it does tend to have a bit of a tendency to pull fabric fiber up with it when you remove the sheet so the smoother your fabric the better your results seem to be.Overall this transfer paper might be the best thing since sliced bread.  Yes, it is a bit expensive, but you certainly get what you pay for which is a super quality transfer.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 1, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R6VWF7TRGTGFP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003XQTQAS#wasThisHelpful","R6VWF7TRGTGFP","A3UUZSGN8C9AEG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3UUZSGN8C9AEG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Yes, it really works!  It is a rare moment it would seem when you purchase a computer program that is supposed to do something and it actually does - amazing but true in this case.  I needed a program that would assist me with the creation of both cross-stitch diagrams and needlepoint diagrams so I took a leap of faith and ordered up.  The install was quick and easy, and YES it works just fine on Windows 8.  The learning curve is a short one, and once installed you will be up and running very quickly as the commands are very intuitive and easy.  There is an instruction booklet with the program but you must print it out from a PDF format.  I do wish the instruction book came with the install disc, but it was easy to print.  It is 180 some odd pages and well worth the time to read it so that you get the full use of this wonderful program.  I purchased the 'professional' version and it does have some differences from the base program that makes your work a bit easier and faster.  Creating patterns for your sewing machine is an add-on that DOES NOT come with the Professional version.  The main difference between the base version and the professional appears to be mainly editing functions and a few other bells and whistles.  I would consider them to be well worth the extra money if you really intend to use this program to its fullest capabilities.This program also allows you to import (very easy to do) a photo and translate that to a stitch pattern, even assigning DMC color numbers to the colors in the photo - very impressive and pretty darned accurate.  You can assign color numbers from a substantial list of standard fiber makers such as DMC, Anchor, needlepoint wools, silk threads, they are all there for easy use.  You can also import a prepared chart and then trace over it to create a new pattern off that chart - again very easy to do and quite accurate once done.  You can cut and paste from the included library of designs, or you can create your own library and cut and paste from there.  The number of things you can do seems almost unbelievable, and the more I work with the program the more impressed I am with its abilities.Overall, this was well worth the money and one of the best purchases I have made for the computer in a long time.  If you are thinking about purchasing this program I would say treat yourself, you won't regret it!","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 31, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R25XHJW09E0F4W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0010YKYYM#wasThisHelpful","R25XHJW09E0F4W","A3UUZSGN8C9AEG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3UUZSGN8C9AEG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Back again for more!  We go through these 'spitty toys' pretty quick with two dogs that love to play.  Have a Sheltie and a Collie and they both carry these rope toys around with them all the time in case the occasion should arise for a quick game of tug-of-war.  It never ceases to amaze me how long they last when they are being battered about as much as they are.  Seldom do I get strings on the carpet as they are twisted quite tightly.  Both dogs are what I would consider aggressive chewers when it comes to these toys, and they are one toy that can take the abuse.  General life span with two dogs working on them is about 4-5 months before they have to be 'retired' to the trash.  If your dogs love to play and you want a toy that will last, I would recommend these rope toys.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 11, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R297RP2QG5UBIW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0002AR36M#wasThisHelpful","R297RP2QG5UBIW","A3UUZSGN8C9AEG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3UUZSGN8C9AEG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Ordered these for the garden as my other pair had worn out and I really did not want to pay a lot for garden shoes that always take more abuse than normal shoes.  Took a chance and ordered up.  They arrived quickly and are exactly what I was hoping they would be.  The shoes are a bit wide, but when working in the yard they are more comfortable that way rather than have them rub on your toes and the sides of your feet when you are hot and sticky.  The sole liners were pretty much useless and I just pulled them out and threw them away because you really do not need them in the shoe, and they did not want to stay in place but rather kept walking out the back end.  The strap across the back helps the shoe stay on your foot and the little vents on the side provide a nice bit of ventilation for an otherwise plastic shoe.  For the price they are comfortable and well-suited to survive the dirt, water and mud of the garden.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 11, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R35ULTLINHNHT0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0013B0IYI#wasThisHelpful","R35ULTLINHNHT0","A3UUZSGN8C9AEG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3UUZSGN8C9AEG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I needed some glue to hold the ear tips of my Collie pup in place.  I was desperate to find something that did not sting or burn as most super glues do.  I ordered this glue as a last ditch desperate effort to avoid the prick ears.  It is wonderful, and I wish I had found it much earlier.  I admit to having doubts, and was not overly excited about paying almost as much to ship the glue and the glue cost itself, but in the end it was worth every penny of the expense.  The glue is rather runny so rather than put it directly on the ear edges, I squirted some onto a small piece of foil and let it set for a few minutes to 'sticky up' a bit.  Then I applied a thin line to the fur edge of the pup's ears with a q-tip and held the ear in place for about 30 seconds.  It worked just perfectly and the ears are still in place over two weeks later with just the original glue application.  No burning, no stinging, no crying - completely painless for the pup.  I wish I knew about this glue a couple of years ago when I had the same ear battle with my Sheltie.  The glue is latex based so it washes off easily if you get it on your fingers and it simply wears/rub off the ear edges so there is no mess for the puppy, and no super-glue stiff edges to contend with.  I would highly recommend this glue for ear training, it is easy to use and provides you with a safe and humane way to train the dip into your puppy's ears.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 11, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R4PUVP2NQF9C6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001SBE68C#wasThisHelpful","R4PUVP2NQF9C6","A3UUZSGN8C9AEG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3UUZSGN8C9AEG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I ordered this book because I was looking for a basic compilation on the Rough Collie, height, weights, coats, breed standards, basic care and medical issues, etc.  Just a general overview of the Collie from puppy to adulthood.  I thought this book might be what I was looking for, but actually it was not.  Now, this is not a negative review of the book, simply a statement that it did not contain the information I was hoping to find.  What this book does cover in great detail is the genetic lineage (European and American) of Collies from just about the beginning of time.  Approximately 75% of the book was dedicated to tracing the breeding line of the Collie.  This is outstanding information if you are a breeder and you want the complete breeding history, but if you are a Collie owner who simply wanted some basic breed information, this book is not for you.  The remainder of this book was dedicated to the basic of breeding and keeping of breeding kennels once you have obtained a Collie.  It is important to point out that this book is a vintage book, and the techniques and approaches offered reflect the age of the book and the thinking of the time when it comes to dogs.  A great Collie 'heritage' resource, but not helpful for a new Collie owner who is looking for general breed information relating to care and feeding of their new 'pack member.'","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 13, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R274EKQJAYNCW1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AHCU07Y#wasThisHelpful","R274EKQJAYNCW1","A3UUZSGN8C9AEG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3UUZSGN8C9AEG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I ordered this bistro set to put outside by the fire pit.  I had previously ordered a cream color set, also from Wayfair, so this is a second purchase.  Like the first purchase, it arrived in lightening quick time (less than four days from date of order), in excellent condition and assembled quickly and easily (I used my own tools).  The set is a perfect antique bronze color which matches nicely with the existing iron patio furniture I purchased last year.  The set is sturdy and comfortably accommodates an adult in size.  The chairs have rubber 'feet' which is a nice touch.  The 'rose' pattern is very pretty.  The set is not completely wrought iron, but some combination of stainless and iron, but it is heavy enough to resist the strong winds we are subject to out here in the open agricultural area of Indiana.

"Ordered this harness for my Sheltie who loves to ride.  Was concerned about the measurements, but it fit perfectly.  Ordered a S/M for him because his body weight is 24 pounds, and his neck measured 16 inches, body girth 24 inches.  The harness fits perfectly, not too tight but with enough room to let it out a bit if we needed to later down the line.The line that buckles to the car seatbelt fit perfectly and locked in as it should to our 2012 Ford Explorer and our 2012 Ford F150 truck.  The line from the ""D"" ring of the harness to the seat buckle is short but can be lengthened if you desire.  It is short enough to keep him in place on the backseat but with enough room to move and reposition himself comfortably.Overall, for the price this harness is excellent.  Quality is good, in fact so nicely done that I am ordering another harness so we will have one in the truck and one in the car.

"This game is black and white and does not work on the Kindle Fire, in fact you cannot even download the game to the Fire, only the older version of the Kindle.  Wish they would have said that on the front side, but it was only 99 cents so not a big deal.  Just disappointing for the grandkids.  The game itself is cute and would be one that the grandkids would have liked to play, but in black and white on the older Kindle where navigation is a bit more difficult for little fingers, it simply does not score too high.","2.0 out of 5 stars","May 3, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RHVQP92BVA1RN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009RRBDTO#wasThisHelpful","RHVQP92BVA1RN","A3UUZSGN8C9AEG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3UUZSGN8C9AEG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I purchased this video from the Interweave website.  Mistake.  Yes it was on sale on the Interweave site which is what lured me to it, but after having paid for 2nd day shipping and receiving the merchandise a full TEN days later - and receiving no response from Interweave when I made an inquiry - I learned my lesson and Amazon it will be in the future.So, that being said - the DVD is outstanding.  I purchased (from Amazon) one of the old Priscilla reprints for Irish lace and it was enough to get me started, but this DVD sealed the deal as far as technique.  I am a visual learner, much quicker to pick something up when I see how it is done, rather than read how it is done.  This DVD made it so simple.  I understood the concept from the Priscilla book, and was able to complete the patterns, but this DVD gave me further insight into what was happening with the stitch and why it was happening, you can see where the stitch is going on the DVD which makes the directions so much more clear.  There were a few 'cheats' on the DVD that were much easier than the written directions in the vintage books.  The stitches are exactly the same when completed, but much easier to accomplish when you can actually see the stitch happening.  I wish the DVD was longer than its 124 minute run time, but it will certainly get you going in the right direction.  The instructions Ms. Treanor provides are clear, concise and when she weaves her Irish history into the technique you feel like you are recreating a bit of history.Overall this DVD is outstanding from start to finish.  If you want to the learn Irish lace technique, or if you think you might have the concept but want to gain a few 'cheats' or insights I would highly recommend this DVD.  If you are an accomplished Irish lace creator this DVD could be disappointing for you as I suspect if is the basics without much in the way of advanced technique.  I will say that it is one of the best I have purchased and I would highly recommend it to anyone interested in getting started with Irish lace.  Ms. Treanor would be doing the art a great service if she continues to share her knowledge and expertise in this format.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 30, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R21MH6HR6X2JYS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1596687320#wasThisHelpful","R21MH6HR6X2JYS","A3UUZSGN8C9AEG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3UUZSGN8C9AEG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I read all the reviews before ordering this bistro set for the front porch.  The reviews seemed to be mixed as to the quality, stability and assembly, but from the photo the set was exactly what I was looking for so I took a chance.  The price was reasonable and the set shipped quickly and arrived earlier than estimated.  The set comes unassembled, but is well packed inside the shipping box.  The parts/pieces were in excellent condition when I unwrapped them, and all the parts/pieces were included.  The set went together in under 30 minutes (did use my own screwdriver and wrench), and no engineering degree was required for the assembly.The set is both sturdy and well made, there were no chips, dents or flaws in the chairs or table.  The color is described as 'off-white' but in reality it is more of a very light mocha color with specks of color in the gray/rust range.  It does have a nice vintage appearance and I do not object to the color at all, but it could be easily painted if a person had a desire.  The table and chairs all had rubber protectors on the bottom which was nice.  I live in an open rural area and the winds come blowing through at a pretty high clip, but this set is heavy enough to stay in place, but not so heavy that it is inconvenient to move around.  Overall, I am very pleased with this little bistro set and can't wait for a sunny morning to sit and enjoy a cup of coffee on the porch.If you are looking for a good quality set, an affordable price, quick shipping and charm - this set should check all those boxes for you!","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 26, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQRL6M1LTZLLO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003H00V9U#wasThisHelpful","RQRL6M1LTZLLO","A3UUZSGN8C9AEG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3UUZSGN8C9AEG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I ordered this reprint of a vintage pattern source.  It is nicely done, the photos are clear and the instructions are clear and easy to follow.  The patterns are the typical vintage designs you see in filet crochet, so if that is what you need this book is an excellent source.

A basic presumption of crochet is assumed, but even beginner crochet folks will find this book easy to follow.  Wonderful pattern resource from the days past.By way of an update...while I am a great supporter of Amazon and the Sellers doing business here, I found an excellent site at [...] where all of these vintage pattern books are available for free.

"My Dobie is a very picky eater an easily bored if given the same food more than a couple of times. He weighs in at around a hundred pounds so the recommended serving size for this food is 3 1/4 - 3 3/4 cups.

Sometimes I will mix in FreshPet chicken or beef just to give him some variety to satisfy his pickiness.I usually don't buy food not made in the USA nor do I buy any food that has ingredients from China. This Eukanuba is made in Argentina but I have not been able to learn if it contains any ingredients that originate in China.

"I have a large Dobie. According to the recommendations on the can I should feed him about ten pounds of this stew per day or roughly one entire case. That would eventually have him grow to a size about as big as my house. My cost would run over $1000.00/month.No way am I gonna feed my dog 10 pounds of food per day. My Dobie does like this stew so what I do is put roughly 1/2 a can of stew on top of his dry food. He is OK with that and I save about $965.00/month. This food says ""Made in USA"" and beneath that it says Growth and Maintenance. I hope it means the ingredients are grown in the USA and not that my dog will grow.

"I received a 12 pound bag of this dog food which used the customary  ""Made in the USA"" on the back of the bag. Pet food companies are obviously of the opinion that if they claim the product was made in the USA it will be assumed by consumers that the ingredients originate in the USA as well. That is far from actuality. Ingredient sources are not provided in most cases because the pet food folks are ashamed of their ingredient source. In the case of Wellness I researched their web sites and many other sites to try to get some inkling of their ingredient source. It was not to be.I have a Dobie who will not be served any product unless I know the ingredient source is safe. This Dobie replaced a previous Dobie who was killed by being fed dog food that contained ingredients, such as chicken, from China. You may recall the news reports of the many pets that were likewise killed in this manner. Did that stop pet food companies to stop using ingredients from China? Of course not because it is the dollar that counts not the food safety.I will hang on to this bag of Wellness while I continue to search for the ingredients sources.

"This has been an enjoyable series for me.  I've read the first three books so far, and while I liked the Ellie/Brett book the most, this one is a close second.Both Carter and Regan are pretty likable characters.  Regan had a truly awful childhood, and she's still sorting through that with her mom, who's in a psychiatric institution because of severe mental illness.  (What is it with the parental figures in this series?  Almost all of them are a big bunch of suck.)  Regan and Carter start out as a one night stand, but that doesn't last long.  They were good together and good for each other.My only complaint about Carter is that he kept referring to women as chicks.  That's douchebro behavior, and he's a doctor for god's sake!  You'd think he'd move past that once he was out of high school/college.  I did like that Regan didn't put up with him calling her that.The circle of friends Regan had (Jayne, Maya and Ellie) was a great aspect of the book.  I also enjoyed Regan's conversations with Mrs. G.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2FIXQOFSSRFUN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IBZ60E6#wasThisHelpful","R2FIXQOFSSRFUN","A16ZTSR8M5J5G2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A16ZTSR8M5J5G2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I read the third book in this series (about Ellie and Brett) first, and I liked that one better.  I really liked Jayne, but it was really hard to like Nick.  I mean, the point of a romance is to root for the couple to get together, right?  I wasn't sure I wanted Nick for Jayne, I thought she deserved better.  Nick was a TERRIBLE boyfriend.  He had a girlfriend, Lisa/Linda (ok, that was pretty funny) for 3/4 of the book, and she took a back seat to Jayne 99% of the time.  Jayne was always concerned with Lisa's feelings, why wasn't Nick?  And it wasn't like Lisa was a horrible person, she was quite sweet.  She wasn't the right person for Nick, but why did it take so long for him to figure that out?  He was such a tool!  The ENTIRE TOWN could see it, Stevie Wonder could see it!Jayne had been through a lot, her grandmother was the worst, and she had no other family.  I liked how she formed friendships with Regan, Maya and Ellie, so she wasn't just pining after Nick the entire time.  Nick's dad was great, as was his cousin and sister, but his mom was kind of awful (she annoyed me much like Ellie's mom annoyed me in the third book).","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R38XCPMU9EFZHT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FUZQZZO#wasThisHelpful","R38XCPMU9EFZHT","A16ZTSR8M5J5G2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A16ZTSR8M5J5G2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Usually, Courtney Milan + historical romance = a good read.  This one didn't quite do it for me.  I liked the characters, but something was missing.Despite his stony demeanor, I really liked Smite.  The author did a great job of explaining his childhood and how it shaped the man he grew into.  I especially enjoyed the scenes with Smite and his bothers, the scene with Ash was my favorite of the book.  I liked Miranda too, although I liked her less as the book went along, and usually I love the heroines in Courtney Milan's books.  Her interference in the situation with Smite's school friend Richard annoyed me.  Really, Richard annoyed me, his character was kind of useless.My interest waned whenever the story focused on the Patron.

Lianne turned out to be a great supporting character, after a not-so-good start.  Her devious mind was a real asset to Bella.

"This is the fourth book of the series I've read, and I'm a little disappointed.  The blurb indicated this one would be different from the ones before it, but it really wasn't.Again with the sexism, another woman who's only had one sexual partner and the dom who's been around the block a few thousand times.  If I'd done a shot every time Sawyer mentioned Chloe's innocence I'd be in a coma.This could have been an interesting book, a woman who is not a submissive and not interested in BDSM and a dom who might be wiling to give it up for her.  But it turns out she is a sub, she just didn't know it until he told her (ugh) she just isn't into the public stuff.  And all he really gives up is his club membership, he gets to be in charge of all the sexy times with Chloe.  ""So tell me Chloe, what woman do you want to be:  an inhibited one, or a woman ready to explore?""  Because of course, if you're not into kink, you're boring.

I bought a bundle of DVD's from Barre 3 featuring Sadie Lincoln and I really like her as an instructor.There are two workouts filmed in a gorgeous outdoor setting.  Burn & Firm is a lot more challenging than Lengthen & Strengthen.  I was sweating up a storm and my legs were shaking durning B & F, whereas L & S was much more gentle.Compared to the Barre 3 workouts that I've done, these have almost no upper body work and I missed that element.

"This is the third book in this series I've read, and I'm glad I didn't start with this one even though it's the first.  The others I've read are better than this one.The heroine of the book is Ellie Mae Clampett, err Presley, from Apple Pie-ville.  When she's not frozen in a perpetual blush, she likes to read kinky erotica.  She's 25 and has had one boyfriend her entire life.  So of course her roommate Cora decides that the local BDSM dungeon is the place for her.  Just because I read this book does not mean I'm looking for this type of stuff in real life.Of course Dmitri, the dom who trains her, is completely enraptured by her blushing innocence.  Like the other doms in this series, he's taken lessons in how to speak like a condescending a****** to women.  Like the other books in the series, we have the pathetic woman who needs super dom to rescue her.  He makes sure to tell her exactly what she needs, because she's clearly too dumb to figure it out for herself.One of her hard limits is humiliation, so after two days of training Dmitri decides to punish her by humiliating her?  Apparently she's on the fast track sub training.  ""The time for gentleness had ended.""  After all she'd had TWO DAYS of training.  ""Her submission, body, heart and soul were his for the taking.""  Of course they were, it's already DAY THREE!In this world, only the doms are allowed to have well paying/interesting careers, while the subs seem to have mundane jobs.  God forbid she have a more important job than him.  She even mentions that she's glad she has a less responsible job (oooh, all that thinking!!!!).  Plus, he makes a few remarks to imply her job is clearly beneath him, I guess that's partly how he keeps her in her place.  The other part is clearly his immense manhood.There really isn't a lot of angst or drama in this book, save a little with Presley's ex Steven.  Thought I was actually on Steven's side when he told Dmitri to stop talking to her like she's a child.  But clearly, she's into it, so to each their own.","2.0 out of 5 stars","October 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2JM24QPDL9I48/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00C4BA44K#wasThisHelpful","R2JM24QPDL9I48","A16ZTSR8M5J5G2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A16ZTSR8M5J5G2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This book really, really needs a good editor.  There are numerous typos throughout.  The most glaring example is near the end when aroused is used instead of roused, considering the context it was particularly cringe worthy.  Beyond the typos, the story is bogged down by so much unnecessary detail.  Every time Bailey walks into a room she describes it in painstaking detail.  There was just so much mundane life stuff that it made my mind wander.  Really, the book could be shortened by a third.Honestly, the best parts of the book were the dark parts (and the part at the end with Anna and Nick), because these were the parts that made me feel something.  I felt sadness, rage and violence, I wanted to rip off Stephen's face with my fingernails.  But the rest of the book didn't make me feel much of anything, except annoyance and disbelief.Jax and Bailey's relationship happened way too fast, especially considering the Bailey had been abused (in the most horrific ways) her entire life.  The day after Jax meets her he starts calling her angel and he's always touching her face.  I find that creepy, why doesn't a woman who's terrified of men?  And I found Jax's lines so cheesy.  But he's not always cheesy, he also has rage issues, which is the last thing an abused woman needs in her life.Andrew seemed to exist only to be the cliche gay friend.  He has a huge crush on Jax, but Jax is NOT GAY!  I know because it's pointed out numerous times that it could never happen.  I get it, Jax is straight!As horrific as Bailey's life with Stephen is portrayed, I can't help but be skeptical.  She was hospitalized numerous times and no one noticed she had scars all over her body.  Doctors are required to report that kind of stuff.  I get Stephen was a well connected lawyer, but come on, it's not like he could have all of law enforcement in his back pocket.

"One thing this book made me appreciate is authors who have a gift for writing realistic dialogue.  Nothing about this book felt realistic to me.  Not only could I not connect with the characters, I didn't like them at all.  They all seemed selfish and petty.  Honestly, I didn't get the sense that Quinn and Chase even liked each other (even when the book was almost over), let alone believe that they were falling in love.My random thoughts as I was reading:Soap opera actors do not make that much money, no way could Ginger afford a house like that.  Paparazzi don't follow around soap actors, either.  Maybe if one of the characters had been friends with a Kardashian, I could believe it.Quinn works at what Chase calls an ""elite restaurant"", where movie stars eat, yet Quinn spends her down time wiping down menus?  It's like calling  IHOP elite.Why is Chase still on a soap opera if he's got so many movie offers he's turning them down left and right.Someone needs to clue in NA authors (not just this author) that smirking isn't sexy.  It mostly screams ""I'm a douchebag!""If birth control pills really had the effectiveness that they do in romance books, there would be an enormous population explosion.

"I borrowed this ebook from my library.This book could have been so much better.  There were parts that were really good, but I found myself really frustrated with it more often than not.  My main problem was Miles POV, and unfortunately this was every other chapter (although, thankfully, they were much shorter than Tate's).  It was like reading a ""Fun With Dick and Jane"" book, soooooo distracting!  Because of the way it was written, I got no sense of chemistry between Miles and Rachel, no sense of anything really.  And that should have been some emotional stuff, but it just fell flat.And I also have a problem with weak heroines who let a**hole guys walk all over them and treat them like crap.  Tate reiterates over and over that she knows nothing about Miles, so why is she falling in love with him?  He's defined the terms of their ""relationship"" (f*** buddies), he'll never love her, never let her in.I feel like I'm listing only negatives even though I've given this three stars, and there were good parts.  The story is well written, I finished it in a day, so clearly it kept my interest.  I loved Cap and Ian, particularly Ian who should be sainted for being such a loyal friend to Miles.

Since there are already so many reviews, I will explain my rating by comparing it to some similar series I've read.It's far better than the ""This Man"" series by Jodi Ellen Malpas, where I was praying for a murder/suicide of the two main characters.  Even years after reading it, my hatred still burns for those characters.It's slightly better than the 50 Shades series, and J. Kenner is definitely a better writer than E.L. James.  I liked Nikki and Damien a little better than Ana ""the color beige is more interesting than I am"" Steele and Christian ""I'm a stalker with creepy E.T. fingers"" Grey.It's no where near as good as the Crossfire series by Sylvia Day.  Everything between Eva and Gideon also happens at warp speed, but I felt ""it"" as I was reading, it was palpable.  And no other author that I've read brings on the steamy like Sylvia Day.I've got the other two books in this series on hold from the library, but I'm not sure I'm interested.","2.0 out of 5 stars","May 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJ73SCFR5AQQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008WOTQGU#wasThisHelpful","RJ73SCFR5AQQ","A16ZTSR8M5J5G2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A16ZTSR8M5J5G2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I glad I checked this out from the library instead of buying it, because it was a really frustrating read.  Suckered by all the good reviews again!Where this book fails spectacularly is in all the flashbacks, especially putting them in the beginning of the book (and really there are way more flashbacks than present day).  I would have liked it so much more if we'd gotten to know Cassie and Ethan in the present first.  Present day Ethan seems like maybe he's an ok guy, but college Ethan is an enormous jerk.  I could not see a SINGLE redeeming quality in him, not one.  Why would I root for Cassie to give him another chance when he's such a colossal a**hole?  It took me very little time to completely hate him, at least let me see some of the good first!Maybe I've read too many NA books in the last few years and my tolerance level is at an all time low.  I'm SO OVER doormat virgins who keep going back to guys that treat them like crap.  And I'm even more over these guys who act like brooding a**holes and still have women falling all over them.  And part of me couldn't even feel sorry for Cassie about the way Ethan was treating her, because she just kept taking it!  Even when she finally (!!!!) has enough and breaks it off, she's crawling back in a few days.  And his excuses were the lamest ever.  Really, your high school relationship didn't work out, how shocking (said no one ever).The only reason this gets two stars instead of one is because I liked some of the present day stuff.  But 99% of me doesn't want Cassie to give him another chance, no matter how much he grovels and says he's changed.  Cassie was right when she said people would think she's and idiot for going back to him.  Even so, I'm on the waiting list at the library for the next book, hopefully it will be more in the present and college Ethan will be a distant memory.","2.0 out of 5 stars","May 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1X92D4E1AX4VK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00L0I2GQ2#wasThisHelpful","R1X92D4E1AX4VK","A16ZTSR8M5J5G2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A16ZTSR8M5J5G2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Nothing in this book made sense.  My WTF face was on the whole time I was reading.  The idea was a good one, unfortunately it was not executed well.  The dialogue was completely unrealistic and cheesy.Everything moves at warp speed.  Even for teenagers, many of whom fall in and out of ""love"" at the drop of a hat, things moved at warp speed.  Hey, there's a cute guy!  He kissed my hand and looks at me all dreamy-like!  I think I'll have sex with him in a car in broad daylight hours after I meet him!  That happens within the first few chapters, and then it's teenage angst interspersed with a biological weapon making dad on the run from the FBI and other secret government agencies.There are five parts to the book, alternating between Luke and Bea's POV.  Luke's chapters were nearly intolerable.  He's beaten and left partially brain damaged, which turns him into a jerk and a super athlete.  Um, ok.  But when we get back to Bea, she's gone from wallflower to drinking, drugs and a sort-of orgy.The further the book goes along, the sillier it gets, and I can only suspend my belief so much, even in fiction.After rereading my review, I realize it doesn't make much sense, but neither does the book so...","1.0 out of 5 stars","May 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R31KTX1OMU1K9G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JBL6MBU#wasThisHelpful","R31KTX1OMU1K9G","A16ZTSR8M5J5G2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A16ZTSR8M5J5G2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book has been on my TBR list for almost a year, so I was a little fuzzy in the details about who Sawyer and Jared were from the Him/Her books.  While I caught up quickly, I wasn't in love with the romance in this book.Sawyer is a free spirit, not one to be tied down.  Jared has been in love with her for awhile, and waits patiently (almost too patiently) for almost the entire book for Sawyer to catch up.  Sawyer and Jared were both nice, good, people but I just never got that excited about their romance.  There was a lot of sex (almost too much), and it kind of made the story drag for me.Surprisingly, where to story shined the most was Sawyer coming to terms with her past.  Finding out about her grandmother, going to visit people and places from her past, these parts felt more interesting to me.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R20VVTNBA1HT7O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00K6PQBVG#wasThisHelpful","R20VVTNBA1HT7O","A16ZTSR8M5J5G2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A16ZTSR8M5J5G2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I kindly received an invitation to try this product for free in an exchange for the review.First off this product is qualified as a handbag and as such must be treated and reviewed as such. To add on to it it also says ""briefcase"" in the description, and this bag surely seems to fit such qualifiers. I will also add that I'm not a fan of handbags. My best coloquial description of this would be a ""Murse"" or a man purse. That said I would not have bought this on my own. However, there are several pointers to be made about this particular Murse:The dark, brown, almost milk-cholocate leather color is suitable for any individual to use it, either female or male. The details, for example, straps and bolts are not flashy yet do remind a similar fashion design in women's purse--which is a turndown for me. The straps that would qualify it as a handbag also make it look like a purse. The material is what appears to be well tailored and treated leather. Now I'm no connoisseur when it comes to leather, but it looks genuine to me. The insides are cotton. The protective inner pocket that would hold your laptop, books, etc., isn't grand or as stylish as the outside. So be wary. This detail actually made me take off another star (-1 star for looks in general). All in all I would say it's an OK Murse (man-purse) that would suit most men or women who're into this style.I'm the type of guy that prefers a normal Adidas backpack to carry my laptop around, but that's just me. If you're like me, perhaps this is not the product you're looking for. If you're into a Murse and would like to look in style (and accept the details as depicted above in exchange for your $$), then this is your product.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R24VX77KP5DNZF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SPDV8O6#wasThisHelpful","R24VX77KP5DNZF","AG0UP5II9OSP2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AG0UP5II9OSP2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'll start off by saying I'm grateful for having received this product in exchange for a review. However it will not alter my analysis of the product: its presentation, durability, and performance.Presentation: The dispenser is made of plastic, making it seem like a durable ""polished"" metal type of dispenser. Not that there's anything wrong with plastic, however it does stain after a couple of uses with kitchen gunk. It uses 4 AAA batteries which makes the device quite uncomfortable as a rechargeable dispenser would be preferred. In terms of how long the batteries last is difficult to tell. See why in the explanation below.Durability and Performance: The device worked well for over 1 month and then it crashed. What!? Well...yes. The device stopped working. We changed the batteries and the device was still silent. After inspecting the battery chamber is was evident gunk was building up inside the AAA chamber. What? I think this is a flaw of the device. Yes it comes with a small fame so it the battery chamber will never make contact with water; however I think this is why the device malfunctioned. Water entered the battery chamber and it stopped working. This is clearly a flaw in the design. The soap dispenser is made to be in the countertop, alongside kitchen stuff and soap and the disaster of a post-meal sink. Bottom line is: I do not recommend this product. Shortly after it stopped working I went back to using my usual pump-ing hand soap dispenser. If you can't beat the basics its definitely not worth purchasing.","1.0 out of 5 stars","April 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R17IB98HHDT8F8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QSQR1ZM#wasThisHelpful","R17IB98HHDT8F8","AG0UP5II9OSP2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AG0UP5II9OSP2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Merlin appearance and the lack thereof was just enough, but perhaps I could've enjoyed more about the main character and her quest to... oh, sorry, I do want to avoid spoilers. Never mind.

"There's a short version of this review at the very bottom. If you'd the extended version, hold on and plunge into its words:And as I close the gap between me and the book Ready Player One, a deep sense of nostalgia surges over me, such as the one that has powerfully embodied me after finishing a book I have loved and will remember perpetually (at least as long as my brain function remains intact).The depth of detail the author grants his readers is surreal. It will most definitely immerse you deep within the world of the OASIS, and especially for the generation that has witnessed the creation and evolution of the video game, this book will resonate with them. I bet the effect it will have on most of us geeks who have loved and cherished video games, we will be easily transported in the OASIS, even in the absence of an immersion rig, suit, or gloves.The characters were superbly developed. The main character I felt had an excellent development as the story progressed. I especially liked the parallels between his life within the OASIS in comparisson to his existence in the real world, of how those two lives converged and diverged in different parts of the story, and of course of how it unraveled in the end. The other characters that leave a strong impression are Aech, Art3mis, Shoto, Daito, Og, Anorak, and Serranto, with whom it is easy to sympathize with.The plot and the development of the story was excellent. You start off in the OASIS world as a normal user named Parzival and quickly immerse into the deep culture that has flowered in the world of the OASIS. The effect of the megacorporation trying to grasp it all, the unrelenting search for power and its ultimate effects on freedom, are all palpable struggles in the story, to the extent it resonates with you and the reality we live in today. Our hero, in the end, prevails defending freedom to create and to navigate a world free of oppression and control; where we converge as a humanity in our trouble times of undeclared yet fierce wars, of tyrants ravaging lands and burning thousands in exchange for ultimate control.The reality is our technological world isn't far away form creating an immersion rig that will allow us to live parallel lives and realities. You can already see how people interact in complete anonymity and the benefits and consequences of such interaction. With both pros and cons, as you can easily fall for a personality or ""spirit"" of a user of unknown age or sex. The purity of this click is heavily exploited in the book Ready Player One, one of the many currents of the book very well developed by the author. Many of us have friends around the globe who's avatar might be quite different from their real persona, resemble a phantom they cherish or wish they were in some parallel reality. And these friends, as far away and strange as they might be, are still bound to us by the ties for friendship.I will end this book review by saying YOU HAVE TO READ IT, especially if you've ever played a video game in your life and have fallen in love with it and its characters. For me, Zelda - The Ocarina of Time, Grandia II, Halo, Half-Life, Super Mario Bros, and many others, have been worlds I visit once in a while in the deep vaults of memory. I see a movie of this book is on the way, a fact that makes me cringe. It can go both ways, or either be a superb film reaching fat beyond what the detailed book could do, or fall short. If the author is involved in the development of the movie (I hope he is), such as Fight Club and Gone Girl were, perhaps we might yet expect a grand movie that will best the book. A feat I feel will be very difficult to achieve, yet not impossible.Short version of the review: READ THE BOOK!","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2R0AFSG0ZO3AJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004J4WKUQ#wasThisHelpful","R2R0AFSG0ZO3AJ","AG0UP5II9OSP2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AG0UP5II9OSP2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"To add to the other reviews stating the recent hassles involving difficulty reaching the butttons---they have been solved! As expressed by others, the case is great looking and it avoid the mildly bulging camera on the back to touch flat surfaces while on its back.

"Loved it. Th price is just right. The material is...well just what you would expect from a $15 pair of headphones. It's by no means luxurious and not rock-solid, but it gets the job done and pretty well at that. The sound quality is superb. I mean, if you're a ""gusto"" kind of person looking for that palate-refined sounds, I bet you already know you're looking at the wrong product. This is for the layperson who doesn't give a crap about a few details in decibles and other idiosyncrasies, but enjoys good sound and good bass...and a low price. I absolutely love it and, such as was stated by a reviewer previously, it's awesome there's no branding nor pictures invading the ear set. It just is.In terms of comfortability its pretty comfortable on your ears and head, enabling you to wear them for hours on end. One reviewer argued the cable wasn't long enough--I disagree. It's just right. If you're the type of person who listens to music more than a few meters from your computer, then you're probably better off getting a blue-tooth set (and sacrifice more precious $$ in exchange for some freedom). In conclusion, get this if your demands meet the product description and if this review helped you at all in deciding whether or not to get them.  One turn-off (and this is merely superfluous) is the packaging. It gave me an initial shock to find the box was so little and light-weight. Then I unraveled the insides and was happy thereafter. Of course, this detail by no means damages the product's review since its performance is great as depicted above.Amazon Basics products offers a nice variety of stuff to which I respond--if you need a reviewer for such stuff, I'll very gladly put in the work and review such items.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3H7F9CORB9QUP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KQFO12W#wasThisHelpful","R3H7F9CORB9QUP","AG0UP5II9OSP2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AG0UP5II9OSP2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book is the true champion regarding self-publishing. It is the go-to manual every indie author should read not once, but at least two times straight out. As in Sparta, the leader was a soldier battling shoulder-to-shoulder with his comrades; this book is the leader inspired by the misgivings and blossoms of hard working indie authors who are inspired to create amazing stories compelled by a vision full of art and emotion. Not only have they manage to inspire me as an author con continue plowing the field of words, but have also given me hope in finding the truest of camaraderie when a soldier tells another soldier--yes, it's a rough road; walk on and you will eventually see the light.

"Over the years Greg Ip had transitioned in my perception from financial journalist and follower of the latest economic news to something higher.  His surveys of the US economy were well worth pulling out of the middle of the Economist and keeping as a reference.This book calls that judgement into question.During the crisis many people commented that we could draw an analogy between the work of forest fires for the health of the forest and recessions for the health of the economy.  It was rather interesting.Greg Ip takes this analogy and turns it into a book.The book fails because analogies are just that: analogies.  At some point they break down and at 280 pages this opus stretches them way past the point where that happens.So if you want to get a smattering of knowledge about the Peltzman Effect, ecological systems, forest fire management, the insurance business, the European lending crisis, the AIG debacle, levies on the Mississippi and in Holland, how to run an airline and the role of capital in banking mixed in with interviews only the phenomenal access Greg Ip and his ilk enjoy, then thats cool, this book is for you.If its serious analysis you want, if you want to be able to hold a conversation with somebody who works in Immunology or Psychology or Forestry or Medicine or Insurance or Aviation or Banking or even Central Banking and do not want to come off as a dilettante who is merely parroting easy-to-digest platitudes, best you dont read this at all.I can only comment on the stuff I understand well:  So for example Germany is allegedly to blame for the fact that Greece has borrowed money it cannot pay back because it is the lender who makes it possible for the borrower to borrow.  Thats plainly ridiculous.  Its a macroeconomic explanation for microeconomic ills which mainly affect Greece, Portugal, Italy and Spain (and the north of Europe too, of course, but at least they can afford the sundry inefficiencies in their market structure)  And it's, of course, an argument the financial press has put forward to justify the unjustifiable solutions that are currently being pursued, namely the official sectors perpetuation of the rot in the south of Europe in the interest of avoiding overall change.Banks Greg Ip really really really does not understand.  He thinks banks take depositors money and lend it to borrowers.  That was true, dunno, five hundred years ago, and even then it was half true.  Its certainly not how M3 is generated, for example.  With most of the money that goes around, both the deposit and the loan are generated in the banking system itself, of course.  M3 arises when you come to the branch to ask for a loan, I approve it, I open you a bank account and stick the money in there (my liability) in exchange for expecting you to pay me back one day with interest (the banks asset).  Then you buy stuff, your money moves to the bank account of whoever sold you the stuff, the banks asset remains your loan but the banks liability is in the bank account of the guy who sold you the stuff.  No saver ever got involved in this, and thats where 90% (actually more) of all money in the world comes from.  This totally escapes Greg Ips simplistic discussion.This misunderstanding sets the scene for him to mis-prescribe capital as the ultimate solution.  DUH, I say.  Obviously, if for every loan Ive given I hold an equal amount in shareholders capital my enterprise is safe.  And if I hold no capital whatsoever Im in trouble and so is the guy who has a bank account with me.  So the answer is somewhere in the middle.  Ergo, capital is the answer to a question nobody asked.  The correct question is how much capital?  This he does not even attempt to answer, other than to say we did not have enough during the crisis.  You dont say, Greg.If you want to read about the ills of portfolio insurance and the fallacy of composition, get a hold of Richard Bookstabers A Demon of our Own Design, a bloody good book on the subject.  If actually explains how to deal with these things.  If Im not mistaken its also covered in Dermans book My life as a Quant, but I read that some time ago, so I cant vouch for it.  Both books certainly spare you the tour of Yellowstone Park and Alexander Flemings petri dish, which I count as a positive.Lets put it another way: its taken me two weeks to read this book.  I found it to be the opposite of a book you cant put down.  I could not pick it up.  It was like ""what is he going to get half-right next?""Positives?I liked page 212, which explains rather well why hedging risk with zero-sum derivatives cannot protect the system as a whole: if you stand up in the stadium you can see the game better, but if everybody stands up then were back to where we started.I was also quite excited that, after pages of fawning at Goldmans allegedly incredible risk management he dares to mention the fact that their protection against AIG failing had been bought from other banks like Citibank that would go down together with AIG and was thus a sham.  Given how many interviews this will cost him from the ban on him that will ensue, thats kinda cool.The overall feeling?The book was like being harangued at a party by an investment banker who knows everything because hes rich.It had its moments, but it robbed me of reading time that wont come back.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2K6O8RZFGHWOG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0316286044#wasThisHelpful","R2K6O8RZFGHWOG","A2ZK9VNGT3HE2I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ZK9VNGT3HE2I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"So if you compare the assets and liabilities of the banking systems of economies around the world you realise there's 6 trillion of undeclared financial wealth (orphan liabilities that don't appear as anybody's asset) and if you account for a couple more effects it's more like 8.5 trillion.And it's really all about Switzerland, with supporting roles for Luxembourg out of where the funds are invested (because Luxembourg does not withhold any tax on dividends or interest) and the Cayman Islands out of which you can create shell companies to hide who the beneficial owner of the assets is, but it's primarily about Switzerland.  Recently also about a couple other places like Singapore, but still controlled out of Zurich and Geneva, mainly.And it costs $200 billion of tax that rich people don't pay and everybody else (other rich people) have to pay.Additionally, corporates avoid $120 billion of taxes by moving their profits to countries Luxembourg and Ireland, or by moving their IP to the Bahamas via Ireland.The trick with people is to1. punish the countries (Switzerland) that help the rich tax avoid by imposing taxes on their exports and2. create a global registry of financial assets and3. tax distributions (and wealth, hello Thomas Piketty) at source and let those who don't actually owe the tax claim it back.The trick with corporates is to shout very loud at Luxembourg (but not Ireland, for some reason)Also, all these states that help the rich hide their tax never deliver on promises they make to clamp down on people who avail themselves of the tax-avoidance setups they provide.  I wonder why that is.This covers the entire contents of the book.  The End.(Incidentally, the idea that you could simply get rid of corporate tax and impose a tax on all distributions in lieu of a corporate tax (which again individuals who owe it could claim back) does not occur to the author, much as it could kill two birds with one stone.  Perhaps he could not fit that within the 140 characters....)","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZ3385Q2HBIXO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=022624542X#wasThisHelpful","RZ3385Q2HBIXO","A2ZK9VNGT3HE2I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ZK9VNGT3HE2I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Capitalism most definitely is at a crossroads.  To claim otherwise is, at best, denial.Whats more worrying is that that there is next to no debate on the relevant issues.I disagree with, dunno, four out of five conclusions Robert Reich draws in Saving Capitalism, but it is regardless the best book Ive read in years because it defines the terms of the debate.You read that right.  I consider this left-wing book by a former Clinton (wash my mouth) Labor Secretary one of the best I can remember reading.  Im buying copies for my whole family.The first major issue he tackles is the false debate that pits free markets versus the government, and this he does straight from the Mancur Olson playbook: spontaneous free markets exist everywhere.  A visitor to the former Soviet Union would be confronted with tons of black markets that of necessity sprung up in the absence of official ones, same way a visitor to Marrakesh can walk into the suk where he can find practically anything.  (My favorite such market is the former Soviet market for dead lightbulbs you could then bring to work to screw into the fixture left open by the functioning light bulb youd pilfer from work to bring back to your apartment)But heres the deal:A bunch of rules must be in place for orderly markets that go beyond the flea market.  If you want free markets to thrive, then you need an institution that comes up with and enforces the rules for:1. What am I allowed to own?  Can I own other people?  Can I own my beachfront?  (In Greece, for example, you dont, the beach is everybodys).  How about ideas?  If I cant own them, will I bother having them?  If I own a life-saving idea is it OK for me to own it?  Who is allowed to buy me out of a house thats blocking a new highway and what must he pay?2. If I own something, can I sell it?  Where does the statute trump the contract?  Californian women can sell their womb, but they cant sell their blood.  Dutch people can own cannabis, but, to quote from Pulp Fiction, to sell it they need a license.  And here in the west you cant sell your children (or yourself) to strangers, period.3. When is it fine to run a monopoly?  In pretty much all countries the military is up to the government.  The police, not entirely.  It is illegal to sell protection, of course, but it is becoming legal to hire security.  Most governments are busy giving up the monopoly on mail.  Nobody cares that one company in America sells pretty much all chewing gum.  Overall, the decision on market power is not trivial.4. What if I cant pay for something I bought?  What recourse should my seller have?  Can he seize my property?  My familys property?  What am I allowed to contract into offering as security?The institution that (i) decides and (ii) enforces these rules has a name.  We call it our government.No government, no market.  Just flea markets.The discussion that pits free markets versus government is dust in our eyes, Robert Reich says and he says so in a non-patronizing, wonderful narrative a kid can follow.He does not stop there.  This beautifully penned call to arms breaks the taboos of the unsophisticated, parochial American Left and spares nobody.  On page 183, Robert Reich takes aim at the preoccupation of Americans on his progressive side of the argument with noneconomic issues such as same-sex marriage, abortion, guns, race and religion, and urges them to find common economic cause, because thats the arena where the politics of the government have true influence first and foremost.  Chapeau!What we have here is the bare bones of a ten-star book as far as Im concerned.I find tons of stars to take off from there, of course, because I disagree with a lot that he has to say.So, for example, I think shareholder capitalism is self-correcting and I genuinely think the stock market is about to punish self-dealing corporates that issued debt to buy their own stock with a massive correction that will bring the practice into disrepute for at least a generation.  The government would be hopeless in terms of attempting to adjudicate on who can and who cant buy his own stock (though I totally agree with Reich that it should not tax-favor such behavior, of course)  New competitors, unburdened by silly amounts of debt will spring up and devour the dinosaurs, bet your house on it.  (Well you cant, in this zero rates forever world, they are all privately owned, it drives me crazy)Along the same vein, I think theres nothing to do about globalization or the progress of science.  You just need to give palliative care to the victims and assure they can afford to give the necessary education to their children.  I dont think a futures floor trader will ever earn as much money again shouting and gesticulating and I dont think a petroleum engineer will ever earn as much money again drilling holes and I have zero problem if they join the girl who used to look at me funny from behind the screen and book my airline tickets at STA travel in whatever endeavors she has chosen to pursue.  As for the guy who lost his job reading legal documents to some guy in India, he hasnt really lost all that much: the outsourced job is about to move somewhere to the cloud.  Same as all those Chinese manufacturing jobs.  At this point, China fires more people from manufacturing jobs every year than we do.Let us not forget that in 1910 some 25% of Americans used to work in Agriculture.  That number is now 2% and the US remains the worlds biggest exporter of grain.  And fewer than half of those who officially work in Agriculture actually get dirt under their fingers, they mostly work for companies like the Monsantos Robert Reich seems to dislike for monopolizing what is now a tiny (though obviously vital) part of the American economy.  My point is that the children of the 23% did not disappear into an abyss, the Great Depression was their parents problem and society made sure it wasnt theirs (chiefly through the GI bill that followed WWII).  Our job is not to restore the jobs of the parents. Its to make sure the kids fit in the new economy.  Yes, its a massive job, but lets talk about that, please, lets not cry about whats lost and never coming back.And I think hes barking up the wrong tree with all the campaign finance stuff.  The billion dollar charitable foundations set up by the Clintons and Blairs and so on mainly sell exemption from tax.  Suppose corporate tax was set to some extremely low number (dunno, 5%) you would not collect a penny less from Amazon, you would help the law-abiding small corporates Reich loves and you would deliver a very targeted punch in the stomach of the gatekeepers of tax exemptions in Congress, the lobbyists, the 10^3 tax accountants GE employs etc.  It would not be without its challenges of, course.  Youd have to then be draconian about taxing the people who would rush to dress themselves up as companies.  All Im saying is Reich is not at all imaginative when it comes to looking for the right place to strike at the status quo, hes repeating some of the old solutions and just shouting louder.So when he says we must give power to the unions, hes ignoring that in the new economy we keep changing jobs all the time.  The companies themselves come and go.  And hes ignoring progress.  GM had to shut down because it makes cars 8 times more efficiently than it used to.  It makes twice as many cars as before, but that means it needs a quarter as many people to make them.  Them guys cant carry four retired people on his back each, all of whom are living longer than it was anticipated they would, incidentally.  We cannot magic a solution to this problem.  The union actually exists, its called the UAW and its rather powerful, but it cannot work miracles.More generally, unions can either be all-encompassing, like in France, where they cover millions of people across the entire industry, or they can be more industry-specific (example: teachers, autos etc.) or they can even be firm-specific.  The all-encompassing union is what we chiefly have in Europe and the results are out: it redistributes to its members from other poor people.  Germanys super successful Hatz reform was all about allowing more specialized unions, in order to reward industries that were performing better AND THUS INCENTIVISE PEOPLE OUT OF INEFFICIENT INDUSTRIES AND INTO MORE EFFICIENT INDUSTRIES whose workers command more power at the negotiating table.In summary, unions of course have a role to play, but they are already playing it and (much as the managers at Walmart are not exactly angels with wings and halos) this role is being diminished by the realities on the ground.And so on.  The rant against Steve Cohen, for example, should also have been included in his list of red herrings, along with same-sex marriage, abortion, guns, race and religion.  Theres plenty wrong with finance, but the (tens of billions of) profits from insider trading are not on my top-ten list, much as they are distasteful.  There are trillions at stake here and if you get the trillions right, the billions will follow.  And I get to watch the same movies and same football games as Steve Cohen, it turns out.  They don't make different ones for him.  I still have (marginally) more hair than him too.  I avoid jail by not breaking the law, on the other hand, but I don't find that enormously burdensome and I have bigger cares than cutting him down to size.I also thought the sundry solutions involving a minimum endowment for every citizen were rather off the wall.  We need to look at what it is were already doing and we need to fix it.  There cannot be a deus ex macchina, thats the wrong place to look.I can go on taking stars off and discussing points where I disagree rather vehemently with Reich.But I cant get below five stars, because this is a tremendous call to arms for the American Left to come to the table to discuss the real, material issues we all face.  Im not aware of an equivalent book for the Right.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RSXG19TW2IVQV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385350570#wasThisHelpful","RSXG19TW2IVQV","A2ZK9VNGT3HE2I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ZK9VNGT3HE2I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"So the central banker who defined this recent era of QE finally gets around to writing about the crisis.  Paulsons book is gathering dust on my shelf.  Geithners I gave a miss.  Bernankes I had to read.  I wanted to read his view on how the crisis came about.We are not lacking for theories of how we ended up here.1.  A popular view is to blame it on free-market hubris.  Proponents of this theory bring up the names of Ronald Reagan, Francis Fukuyama and Bob Rubin a lot, with a dash of Sandy Weill and Larry Summers thrown in.  According to them, we have let free markets and deregulation run amuck and we need to go back to more government, back to the fifties when the government funded fundamental research, the era when the DARPA created the Internet and government kept its hand on the tiller, rather than the world of companies chasing quarterly earnings and shareholder value above all else.2.  In a less luddite and probably more relevant version of this view, a Great Deformation has occurred, whereby the government has crept into every facet of our life, in partnership with some very powerful people who have ended up collecting the economic rents that come from corporate equity withdrawal enabled by the combination of (i) the perennial policy of tax deductibility on debt financing, (ii) perma-low interest rates thanks to Greenspans Fed and (iii) a regime whereby returns on capital get taxed less than earnings from work, most recently thanks to George W Bush.  The people gets low rates to pay for its borrowed life; the government gets to run the show by targeting tax relief to the super-rich who use the proceeds of their wealth to buy more influence and live happily ever after.  This theory also aims to explain how come the world is getting more unequal out here in the west and goes some way toward explaining the serial bubbles we seem to be going through.3.  The more fatalistic simply state that the fundamental instability of capitalism is upward.  This theory (expounded by Minsky, Kindleberger and Koo for example) states that if I borrow money to compete with you in business, you are left with little choice other than to borrow money just like I did, otherwise I will out-compete you.  This starts a cycle of more and more borrowing, which feeds into more and more goods and services becoming available because you and I build more capacity to provide more goods and services.  This cycle of increased borrowing ends when we have gone through the three phases of borrowing (hedged, speculative, and finally Ponzi) and the whole thing ends in the form of a balance sheet recession whereby you and I and everybody else has over-borrowed and built all sorts of capacity (assets) that we must then spend years working out of, like Japans been doing for a couple decades.  This is a more relaxed theory, in that it does not try to go into the detail.  If you like Capitalism, it seems to say, get used to a bit of a depression every seventy-eighty years.  Were in one of those right now, do what you can to convince the politicians to take Keynesian measures and be patient, basically.  Oh, and give it up on the monetary fixes, youre pushing on a string, those who are in debt will not behave how you expect them to.  Overindebted corporates wont invest and overindebted consumers wont spend.4.  Others say the crisis is borne of Globalization.  As emerging economies are coming up the technology curve, the corporate world has unscrupulously chosen to re-locate production, and increasingly expertise in design, to the third world, destroying good jobs in the places we all live.  So the past few years weve been living through a period when workers in the emerging market economies are outcompeting workers in our neck of the woods, leaving no choice to engineers here in the west other than to flip burgers or mow lawns.  Moreover, the masters of the economies who are out-competing us are keeping a lid on their currency, thereby accumulating dollar reserves and creating a situation Bernanke himself dubbed the the global glut of liquidity which finds its way to western assets and creates bubbles.5.  Others, again, say the depression is only really starting.  Theres a rather convincing 76 page book by professors Brynjolfson and McAfee that says all people who learned the three rs (reading, writing and arithmetic) and think theyre cool had better make sure they are not using them repetitively, because if thats the case theres a little invention dating from 1982 called the PC that will wipe them out and its only really getting started.  To travel agents and open-outrcy futures traders the list of over-educated burger-flippers is about to extend to radiologists and professors at lesser colleges and theres no telling where it will end.  Same way the 25% of Americans that worked in agriculture in year 1918 is now down to 2% and the 23% suffered a thing called the Great Depression in the twenties and thirties, basically.  If you agree with this view, all the efforts expended on fiscal and monetary policy are merely serving to postpone the inevitable at the cost of distorting incentives.  Difficult to disagree entirely, but many do!  A competing theory, also very fancied, claims were in trouble for precisely the opposite reason: weve picked the low-hanging fruit of innovation (example: the washing machine, that freed women from the drudgery of daily work and allowed them to enter the workforce, the airplane that shrunk distances and the TV that lets information travel in real time) and now were ONLY benefitting from the computer.Go figure, basically.  And thats just a quick selection; there are probably as many theories of the deeper causes of the financial crisis as there are people who have looked into this.Seven years after the crisis, with the full benefit of hindsight and having run the worlds best economics department (that would be the Fed) what does Ben Bernanke have to say about all that?  I was DYING TO KNOW.It turns out he has nothing to say.  Nada.The Courage to Act is a dry account of the crisis days, a diary, with some autobiographical stuff thrown in.The main problem with such a book, apart from the fact that it comes three years too late and adds little that we did not already know,  is that Alan Blinders already written it three years ago, and actually did it better.If you are looking for the ultimate in nave, unquestioning of conventions, blow-by-blow account of the crisis, Blinders After the Music Stopped is shorter, better structured and better oriented toward the lay reader, and its replete with frequent explanations of the relevant economic and financial concepts that you wont find in Bernankes book, much as Courage to Act is twice as long.There are two things Blinder does not cover that you can find here, though:1.  The bits about Bernankes personal life.  His parents background, his upbringing in Dillon, South Carolina, his 26th placing at the national spelling bee contest, the fact that he held the SAT record in his state (exact scores sadly not provided), the name of the guy who told him he could get into Harvard, his first date with this wife (a double date, if you care to know), and the hoops he had to jump through to get the job at the Fed that he claims he never aspired to.  If youre looking for the details of his interview with George W Bush or the color of his socks, this is the place to go.2.  The intra-agency politics.  Fed versus FDIC, Fed and Treasury versus the OTS, if you have an interest in how sausage is made, this is a pretty good tour of the factory.  You get a very complete account.  When you read in the paper that Bernanke is a consensus seeker what it means in plain English is that he plans all his moves way in advance and if you are against him youre going to find hes been softening up your allies for months without you having noticed.  Also, you get a very good picture of how intractable the politics were, and continue to be, with the various agencies mainly protecting their turf, actively preventing other agencies from keeping tabs on the banks they are supervising (example, the regulator for thrifts would not let the Fed inspect IndyMac or Countrywide or AIG) and Congress mainly keeping an eye on the election calendar.This all makes Bernanke sound petty and mean, so Im not describing it terribly well.  When you read the book he does not come off at all as being mean.  And you are left in no doubt regarding his good intentions.  In fact, reading this book reinforced my belief that he meant well and in his heart of hearts was batting for the little guy.On the other hand, the book also reinforced my feeling that he made a conscious decision to only pick fights he could win and planned ahead to make sure he only found himself in fights he could win.Im not necessarily saying he made concessions to Wall Street that allowed him to get in a position to assist Main Street.  Perhaps he did and perhaps not, but there is no evidence of such a pact with the devil in these pages.  My between-the-lines reading of the book is the following: Bernanke realised that he was an academic nerd, totally out of his depth swimming among the sharks of Wall Street.  Rather than get swallowed whole, he made a conscious decision to stick to Hank Paulson (who was vested with Wall Street cred and Republican support) and Tim Geithner (of the Rubin / Summers / Weil / Clinton axis) and limited himself to employing technocratic, esoteric, geeky means, rather than getting the hammer out.  Stuff like paying interest on reserves kept with the central bank, stuff like inflation targeting, stuff like increased communication and transparency, stuff like how to conduct monetary policy if we get ever stuck at the zero lower bound.  In plain English, he made a decision to stick to his knitting.  Which brings us to the fact that events did not allow him to do so.Regarding those fateful events, I brought prejudice to my reading of this book.  My list of preconceived notions about how the crisis unfolded is as follows:  Hank Paulson, as a matter of ideology, was more than happy to move Fannie and Freddie into conservatorship  Hank Paulson was relaxed about bringing market discipline to Bear and Lehman, as he held both institutions in low regard  Perhaps (and this is contentious, I know) Hank Paulson considered the firm he once ran, Goldman Sachs, unfairly targeted by the market  Nobody had any idea in how deep trouble AIG was, not even Goldman and certainly not AIG itself, to say nothing of the Fed  Nobody had ever considered that money market funds could break the buck.  They were on nobodys radar.  Bernanke went with whatever Hank Paulson thought about these issues and concentrated on pure monetary policy issues, like inflation targetingMore than anything else, I read this book with a view to revising my opinions and was looking forward to be proven wrong on some of these prejudices.Ive now finished it and I havent changed my mind.  Bernanke hides behind the fact that he had limited powers.The argument is made, not explicitly, not very forcefully, and not convincingly at all, that they got extremely lucky and were able to save AIG using the same limited means that had proven inadequate to save Lehman three days earlier.Challenge, I say!After reading the book, my view remains unchanged that they did not break the glass for Fannie and Freddie (quite the opposite, if anything) and they did not break the glass for Lehman, but when it became clear AIG would bring down everybody else they broke the glass for AIG a short three days later.To be clear, only the mean-spirited would dare suggest the Paulson / Geithner / Bernanke triumvirate did not do their best to save the economy.  The jaccuse element of all criticism against them is that they abandoned the principle of market discipline sometime between the Lehman failure and the AIG bailout.Its human.  Its precisely what Congress did when they first voted down TARP and then the stock market tanked and then they changed their mind and voted in favor.  Its what the Greek government did the other day between the referendum to leave the Euro and the acceptance of all the Europeans terms.  But Bernanke has not used this book to admit it.He does not even admit that his Fed was one of many agencies and regulators that had not done their homework.There would have been no shame in saying we had no idea, because we were not structured in a way that would have allowed us to gather the informationThere would have been no shame in saying we underestimated the shadow banking systems effect on the banks we were supervisingThere would have been no shame in saying we were allowing free market ideology to blind us, but we became practical when things went terribly wrongThere would have been no shame in saying if we knew then what we know now we would have done things differentlyInstead, the book says I regret nothing.Very poor.Also, its petty.  Fine, we know, Sheila Bair was difficult.  It was instructive to see how much emphasis she put on protecting the FDIC, perhaps over the interest of the system as a whole.  It was interesting to see that subsequently she was happy for her agency to be paid to guarantee all the banks debt, including the newly-christened former investment banks.  But is there room in a book like this for innuendo like she was Bob Doles protegee?  Thats low, no?  On the flip side (and this is me being petty now) it is refreshing that Neel Kashkaris name does not appear anywhere.  Or is that because he now works at Pimco, where Bernanke consults?  I dont care, an account of the crisis where his name is missing is very refreshing.Merits of the book?Well, aside from the very complete understanding one obtains of how the relevant politics work (and thus the inevitable conclusion that Bernanke was an adept politician, first and foremost) pages 398 - 411 offer an extremely good understanding of how a financial crisis moves from the liquidity crisis phase to the solvency crisis phase.  Additionally, pages 514  520 also explain very clearly the thinking behind various candidate policies the Fed considered, from negative rates all the way to nominal GDP targeting.  Solid stuff.  The concluding remarks about the prospects for the American economy on pages 575 - 578 were good too.When people say we were lucky to have a student of the depression at the helm, I believe thats two half-truths in one sentence.  Neither was Bernanke truly at the helm (his courage to act did not stretch much past technocratic stuff), nor did he (for all his studying) explain how the crash of 1929 came about.  But he has formulated a theory of how the lack of liquidity turned a financial disaster into an economic depression.  Pages 398-411 take you through how this works and shed a lot of light on how Bernanke went about preventing the financial crisis of 2007-08 morphing into a depression.  For those pages alone, the book is worth its purchase price.Finally, on QE:As a guy who had been predicting the demise of our rotten system and as a trader who had heavily bet against its survival, I was very upset with QE when it happened.  Rather than a piece of Paulson and Geithner style ""financial fascism"" whereby the rules of engagement are broken to maintain the status quo, the purchase of dirt-cheap Treasuries was a genuine case of a good trader ""knowing his market"" and making people on the other side like me look stupid.  He gave us doomsayers a good spanking and he did it all using powers that were already fully vested in him.  Oh, and he brought everybody's attention to the existence of a ""safe asset,"" exactly as Minsky would have wanted him to do.Ive spent seven years thinking that, whatever people say, Bernanke is God for this reason alone: when he launched QE he understood that the economy was so deeply wounded, he was UNDERPAYING  for all those Treasuries.  He got the price right and the rest of the world got it wrong.  Ergo, to the extent that QE amounted to the purchase of cheap assets, it was three birds with one stone:1.  It was a massive confidence booster (were not out of ammo after all!) and a confounder of people like Soros who were worried about who was left to buy T-Notes2.  It lowered rates for mortgages at a time when the politics of sick rantelliism was piling onto the vested interests of bondholders to make principal reduction an impossibility3.  It was guaranteed to make the Fed money, confounding the misguided critics who (in the middle of a depression!) were worried about losses at the central bankNot saying I'm happy he did it.  But I respect him the same way you have to admit generals Lee or Rommel were rather tough nuts to crack.That said, theres no mention of #3 in the book.  So now Im less sure he understood how good he was.  Maybe he was just executing the steps from the famous helicopter speech. Maybe his trading brilliance was accidental after all.And of course were now left with a policy we cant stop and a means for those who can still borrow (with enough distance, of course, for example via a company they control but has no recourse to them) to carry on getting exponentially richer, with the economy and the good companies increasingly becoming privately-owned, with a proliferation of monopolies and monopsonies, with the companies my pension fund can buy getting more indebted by the day etc. etc.  But I guess thats not his fault.  He did what he had to do and then the politics took it over from him.  Tough to argue you can put the QE genie back in the bottle.  Its going to have to die of natural causes.Whatever the truth may be, none of that stuff is in the book.Buy The Courage to Act if you want to find out what building the spelling bee contest was held in (the one where he came 26th) and what speech he gave there next time he visited.  If you dont care about that, get somebody to photocopy pages 398 to 411 for you and save.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3TN6N6EL1KBZV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=039324721X#wasThisHelpful","R3TN6N6EL1KBZV","A2ZK9VNGT3HE2I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ZK9VNGT3HE2I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I took five single-spaced pages of notes from this tiny little book, thats how tightly packed it is with the parallel history of (and strong opinion on) the US housing market and the GSEs.Bethany McLean has done it again, basically. And she makes it all feel like a short story.Im still in awe at how much was made to fit into this pocket book without making it at all feel like the Cliff Notes for a much bigger opus. In fact, when I finished it I thought to myself wow, this was nice and sweet. Only when I went back to summarize my findings did I realize what a feat the author has accomplished.That said, her analysis has two HUMONGOUS gaps. Lets get them out of the way:1. All countries in the world automatically favor owning versus renting, because my rent is someone elses income on which he pays income tax. Elementary understanding of the distinction between the formal and effective incidence of tax shows renters pay tax that owners dont. They pay it indirectly (via the landlord) but they pay it all the same. The American systems additional support of owning versus renting (via tax deductibility of mortgage debt, via the creation of the market for 30yr mortgage debt etc.) is merely the American cherry on a worldwide cake.Rent means tax. Ergo, if you can own, you should own, unless you think youll be moving soon or if you think prices are falling. Worldwide, this is one of the ways the poor stay poor, and they are not stupid for wanting to own like everyone else; it is uninformed (or worse) to look down on them for taking on subprime loans. Their (perhaps unrealistic) aim is to duck that tax like you and I can (though Id recommend a book called House of Debt by Mian and Sufi to anyone who cares to see how this totally backfired in the 2008 crisis). Conversely, any government attempt to further tilt things in favor of homeowners is in rather poor taste if your leanings are egalitarian.2. Fannie and Freddie did not survive the crisis because of the 400 billion commitment from the Treasury and are not crazy profitable at the moment because they are naturally set up to make money. They owe their existence and profitability to the fact that the Fed has throughout the crisis bought staggering amounts of their debt at pretty much flat price to the safest investment on earth, US Treasuries.If you can always borrow, then you will never die. If you can always borrow for free from someone with infinite pockets (2.8 trillion and counting, with the Fed still as of October 2015, as Im writing this, replacing maturing GSE debt it holds from QE1,QE2 and QE3) then you can earn some very high ""economic rents."" This argument alone is enough to make a total joke of any claim from any hedge fund regarding how capitalism should work.Claims on Fannie and Freddie are contingent claims on the mindblowing and continuing largesse from the part of government called the Fed. If, for arguments sake, the Fed has paid 100 cents on the dollar for 2.8 trillion of debt that would otherwise trade at 99 cents on the dollar, thats an 28 billion gift right there. If the debt should trade at 90 cents on the dollar, then that part of the gift is worth 280 billion. If it would not trade at all (which it didnt during the crisis) you get the picture.The geniuses who invested in Fannie and Freddie stock in 2011 did not spot some amazing free-market company with undervalued stock. They took a bet that they could benefit enormously (something like 30:1) from a government subsidy that was meant for people other than themselves.Bill Gross did it safer, he bought himself GSE debt at the lows, and bet the Fed would follow in his footsteps to save the Chinese. Perry Capital and friends thought theyd pull the same scam three years later, absent a crisis. Unlucky, fellows! For now, at any rate. Tomorrow, who knows? I would not bet against them eventually earning that 30:1 return. This is America!With those two points behind us (and they do cost the book the final, fifth, star from where I stand, much as I totally loved it) here come the five pages of notes I took in my attempt to summarize this little masterpiece:HISTORICAL PURPOSE OF (AND MOTIVATION FOR) THE GSEs1. Other countries chose healthcare. We chose housing2. Other countries, like Germany, subsidize rents. We subsidize ownership3. Until very recently, the US banking system was regional, so mortgage lenders were exposed to local economy. There was a need for way to pool mortgage risk across the nation4. 30yr mortgages are impossibly dangerous instruments. They carry three risks: credit, interest rates and prepayment (p.63) Only a government-backed scheme could hope to create a market in such instruments5. What the GSEs really were was a giant subsidization machine, where wealthier borrowers in desirable areas paid more than they otherwise would have, while less well-off borrowers in less desirable locations paid less than they otherwise would have (p. 81)PRE-CRISIS HISTORY OF THE GSEs1. The National Housing Act (1933) provided for the creation of privately owned mortgage associations that would buy FHA-issued mortgages from lenders (p.64) but in the three years after they were authorized none were set up. So government set up Fannie Mae in 1938. Jessie Jones (chairman of the Reconstruction Finance Corporation) pledged in the NYT to match private competitors capital dollar-for-dollar but nobody accepted.2. Fannie was set up as a company with shareholders much more recently, in 1968, during the Johnson administration, precisely to avoid consolidating its debt with that of the US. It was privatized to get it out of the budget. -Paul Volcker (p.67) The 1968 law also removed any limits in the amount of Fannie debt banks could hold on their balance. Freddie was established around that time (1970) to compete with Fannie and was privatized like Fannie a decade or so later, presumably for similar reasons. Originally Fannie and Freddie owned mortgages, but later they started guaranteeing them instead. In 1986, finally, restrictions were lifted on buying non-GSE guaranteed mortgages, paving the way for the creation of the private market.3. In 1992 Congress established OFHEO to oversee Fannie and Freddie with a pitiful budget, equivalent to the pay of the top 4 Fannie executives. The same legislation (i) set tiny capital requirements for Fannie and Freddie and (ii) established affordable housing goals (originally goals that were already comfortably exceeded).4. By 1999 Fannie Mae had become Americas 3rd largest corporation by assets (p. 74) And right about then, they started selling bonds to foreigners, stepping in where the Clinton surplus left off: in 1998 USD 198bn; in 2000, USD 348bn; in 2004, USD 875bn: foreign money was funding the most domestic asset (p. 75) They took the worst possible investment and turned it into the second most liquid instrument on earth (p. 75) BIS regulations assigning relatively low risk weighting to their debt contributed to this, in all probability.5. Just as Fannie and Freddie were reaching the zenith of their powers, the private market was working hard to supplant them. Subprime mortgages rose from 8 percent of mortgage originations in 2003 to 20 percent in 2005 (p. 28) By 2006, private label issuance reached USD 1.15 trillion and an astonishing 71% of the mortgages were either subprime or Alt-A (p.28) As the private market boomed, Fannie and Freddie were rapidly becoming irrelevant. Their market share fell from 57 percent in 2003 to 42 percent in 2004 and to 37 percent in 2006 (p. 29)6. The choice was explicitly made not to fall behind the private market: We face two stark choices: stay the course or meet the market where the market is  Tom Lund (head of single-family business); If youre not relevant, youre unprofitable, and youre not serving the mission. -CEO Dan Mudd (p.31) Ken Bacon: Its very hard to any one person to sit as the market moves and say Im smarter than everyone in this market. Everyone was getting into the market and I just cant give you a breaking point. Over time, we started doing things we used to not do. Ken Bacon congressional testimony (p. 53)7. Fannie and Freddy together purchased 3.8 percent of subprime issuance in 2001, 11.9 percent in 2002, 34.7 percent in 2003, 38.9 percent in 2004, and 28.9 percent in 2005, tapering to about 25 percent in 2006 and 2007. Between 2005 and 2007 they also guaranteed USD 350bn of Alt-A.8. Whats more, they conned the Department of Housing and Urban Development into allowing these loans to count toward the congressionally mandated goals to provide affordable housing that Fannie and Freddie had had to meet since 1992. Wall Street even began designing a special product just for Fannie and Freddie that was packed with loans that satisfied the goals.9. Its very difficult to argue that in embracing subprime they were actually promoting affordable housing. Subprime was chiefly to take money out of your home, not to help you buy it in the first place: by 1999 a staggering 82% of subprime were refinancings. (p. 27) Between 2003 and 2007, homeowners cashed out approximately $966 billion in home equity from Freddie Mac. In 2006, cash-out refinancings accounted for nearly 30 percent of all refinances at Freddie Mac. (p.28) One could argue that refinancing worked to undermine, not strengthen homeowners, by generating a lot of overextended homeowners who couldnt make their mortgage payments.10. One thing they may have achieved is to crowd out the private sector. Ed Pinto, a former chief credit officer of Fannie May who left the firm in the 1980s argues that Fannie and Freddie drove the private issuers further out on the risk curve. (p. 54)FLAWS OF THE GSE MODELMichael Stegman: The critical flaws in the legacy system that allowed private shareholders and senior employees of the GSEs to reap substantial profits while leaving taxpayers to shoulder enormous losses cannot be fixed by a regulator or conservator because they are intrinsic to the GSEs congressional charters. (p. 141)The CBO produced study after study showing that the subsidy was not going to homebuyers. It was going to shareholders and executives (p. 80)Larry Summers: The absolutely best way to mine money out of government (p. 76)1. Non-transparent (implicit guarantee)2. Staple the rents to a broad middle-class subsidy (so you cant attack the rents without attacking the middle class)3. A source of positive opportunity for opportunistic politiciansAustan Goolsbee: whatever safeguards you put in, the flawed nature of the structure having any kind of government subsidy that isnt fully paid for- means it will inevitably go bad Even if the government guarantee is priced appropriately initially, meaning that it covers the risk, the pricing will inevitably become politicized by the housing industrial complex. And it may not be possible to price it appropriately. If you do, those who can opt out will do so, leaving the weaker credits to the government, which actually magnifies the problem (p. 148)HOW IT ALL WENT WRONG1. The GSEs became the epicenter of the Housing Industrial Complex. Under leaders such as Jim Johnson they became the biggest lobbyists in Washington, established foundations such as the Fannie Mae Foundation and established revolving door hiring practices with Congress. Also they traded enough derivatives with Wall Street (ostensibly to manage the prepayment risk of the mortgages they held) to make Greenspan worry (p. 86) Such is still their clout, that despite the humiliation of having to restate their earnings in post-Enron 2003, the disaster of 2008, the establishment of conservatorship status and the curtailment of their lobbying budget they have seen off three attempts to shut them down: (i) Shelby and Calabria, (ii) Jon Hensarlings PATH and (iii) the Obama-endorsed Corker and Warner bill.2. By the turn of the millennium they had become the embodiment of private profits and public losses with their management mis-stating profits by up to USD 9bn to smooth earnings and maximize personal compensation, but also deciding to protect market share in order to stay relevant rather than focusing on their public mission of supporting the market for 30yr mortgages, cross-subsidizing mortgages at less desirable zip codes and promoting affordable housing.3. And then in 2006 house prices started going down and the GSEs goose was cooked. The roughly USD 64bn in cash losses they accumulated ended up exceeding their very slim capital buffer. That said, Fannie and Freddie resolutely did not create the crisis: Subprime was not invented by Fannie and Freddie. Entrepreneurs started the subprime lenders, to make money. Fannie and Freddie bought mortgage insurance on all the loans with less than 20% down. The private sector took this risk! Landesbanken, IKB, New Century, Bear Sterns funds and BNP funds took the first hits, not Fannie and Freddie Fannie and Freddie did not bring down Lehman or AIGRegardless, Fannie and Freddies mortgage exposure and their foray into subprime and Alt-A in particular drove them to bankruptcy in all but name as they were forced into conservatorship (a fact that among other things (i) robbed them of their lobbying budget (ii) robbed them of their deferred tax assets and (iii) forced them to pay a 10% of their future profits to the Treasury).Institutions that should have acted as a bulwark against panic required massive bailouts themselves. As the crisis got worse, in early 2009, the funding made available from the Treasury to Fannie and Freddie was doubled from 200bn to 400bn (half of the 10yr Obamacare projection) and even that cap was removed on Christmas Eve of 2009 (p. 95)Meantime, however, as part of Quantitative Easing, Bernankes Fed started buying billions of Fannie and Freddie paper every month. The purpose, of course, was to restore confidence in the mortgage market and the housing market, thereby bringing back down mortgage borrowing rates. A side effect would prove to be to restore the profitability of the GSEs when the market for mortgages eventually took off again.According to Paul Willen, a senior economist at the Boston Fed, between 2008 and 2014 the Fed purchased $2.8 trillion of agency mortgage-backed securities. (p. 95)WHY THE GSEs AND THEIR BONDHOLDERS WERE BAILED OUT1. Private flows to the mortgage market had disappeared. By the end of 2009, Fannie and Freddie, along with Ginnie Mae, accounted for 97 percent of mortgage-backed securities issuance, according to the GAO. In the absence of Fannie and Freddie. housing would have collapsed they have to be used to keep the flow of capital going to the housing market Larry Summers (p.42)2. Foreign institutions, mainly central banks, owned around $1 trillion of agency debt and mortgage-backed securities. China and Japan also owned almost half of the U.S. Treasury debt in foreign hands at the time. (p. 43)3. A Fannie and Freddie failure would have taken down the whole financial system. It would have been worse than the Great Depression (Paulson, p. 44)4. If you were to abolish Fannie and Freddie, what would happen to the existing $5 trillion of GSE-backed securities? (p. 103) 2009 was a very bad time to consolidate that debt into the US government debt (and, politically, there is no such thing as a good time to do so, besides)WHAT HAPPENED NEXT + HEDGE FUND OPPORTUNISM1. The fate of Fannie and Freddie was then left to Ed DeMarco, provisional chair at the FHFA, who was not provisional at all and ran the FHFA for six years after the bailout. The way he put it, theres no one making policy; Ill make policy (p. 100) De Marco fought all principal-forgiveness schemes tooth and nail to protect the one remaining shareholder, the government, from strategic defaults (p.99) De Marco also sued 18 banks seeking to recover USD 200 billion in losses from mis-sold private-label mortgage product. Nomura and RBS foolishly did not settle and lost in court. Under De Marcos prodding, GSEs steadily increased their guarantee fees for new mortgages. Fannie Maes average effective guarantee fee on new loans tripled from 21bp in the first quarter of 2009 to 63bp in the first quarter of 2014. He also began charging extra fees for riskier mortgages in order to decrease the amount of cross-subsidization in the system. The whole idea was that as the cost of Fannie and Freddies insurance policy rose, the private sector would see an opportunity to make money, and come back into the market (p. 101)2. When almost everyone was gnashing his teeth about the apparently mounting losses at the GSEs, some investors began to do the math, and they found that Fannie and Freddie werent doing nearly as poorly as it seemed. (p.111) Many hedge funds slowly started snapping up Fannie and Freddie3. In a particularly bold move, on June 13, 2011 Skadden Arps and Blackstone pitched to the government on how to deal with Fannie and Freddie: build up fresh capital through their earnings and make sure investors are paid. private capital will not make any substantial commitment to a solution in the absence of any likelihood of a meaningful return on capital (p. 114)After the meeting, Blackstone loaded up on Fannie and Freddie securities. (I view this as blackmail, basically, but the author never calls it that)4. The government took about a year to respond, and it was not what the hedge funds were expecting: August 17, 2012, the Third Amendment of the conservatorships rules requires Fannie and Freddie to send every penny to the government, not just 10%. The government is doing itself the trade the hedge funds had been eyeing for themselves. This has turned the GSEs into the piggy bank for the government, helping it circumvent the annual debt ceiling stalemate. In the words of Jack Lew as a practical matter, its what has helped us reduce our overall deficit (p. 117) Thanks to the GSEs profits, federal spending was under-reported by a combined $178 billion in 2013 and 2014, according to a paper by the Heritage Foundation.

Why do we even need homeownership?If what we need is energy-efficient multifamily housing for the urbanized world, what are we doing subsidizing the construction of ever-larger single family homes?If what we want to subsidize is homeownership, why not limit government backing to first-time homebuyers and exclude refinancings, or at least cash-out refinancings?Dont cheap mortgages make homes more expensive?","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2CZ4KYWLIQ9QG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0990976300#wasThisHelpful","R2CZ4KYWLIQ9QG","A2ZK9VNGT3HE2I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ZK9VNGT3HE2I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This 150 page little book starts with a 28 page introduction that is a very strong candidate for best 28 pages Ive ever read.  Author Greta Krippner explains that there are three official versions of how we got here:1.  Benign: The world got to be so financialized because due to intense competition the model of the firm transitioned from the old one that looks out for multiple stakeholders to the one that looks out only for the shareholder, and the shareholder does best when the firm uses leverage.2.  The Minksy / Kindleberger critique that the fundamental instability of capitalism is upwards, which takes the above observation that competing firms must borrow and via the three stages of finance (not mentioned by name in this book, but they are hedged, speculative and poinzi) leads to the conclusion that we wil forever create bubbles and forever take them to the point of bursting3.  The Neo-Marxist critique that says that post-WWII the state made and delivered to the peoples of the Western world promises of entitlements that became increasingly difficult to keep as the post-war growth slowed down, leading to financialization of the economy as the only way these promises could be kept and offering a solution to what the author describes the three crises of the state: (i) the social crisis of who gets what (ii) the fiscal crisis (self-explanatory) and the (iii) legitimation crisis of sinking public confidence in the states ability to provide.She never says it in so many words, but its the Neo-Marxist explanation she seeks to explore in the book.Before she starts, theres a 29 page expose on what financialization means and how prevalent it is.  Long story short, she defines it as 1. a bigger chunk of all companies profit coming from financial activity and 2. a bigger chunk of all corporate profits across America coming from companies one would officially classify as belonging to the financial sector.  She defines how she went about measuring the increasing financialization, defends her methods well against standard critiques and proves from the official numbers that its been happening.What follows is the meat of the book: How exactly did the state go about pandering to the masses?  Well, the building on the cover of the book is Eccles Building in Washington, where the Fed is housed.  Turns out that this is not a book about the Neo-Marxist critique.  Its a book about the Fed.So first the author discusses how Regulation Q used to work and how it regulated the supply of credit to the US economy for 40 years following the Great Depression and how, faced with rampant inflation on top of a stagnant economy the decision was taken to liberalize interest rates.The expectation had been that leaving the level of interest rates to the market would allow price (the interest rate) to ration credit.  As it turns out (and as we are observing in places like China today, for example) credit became readily available to all, because the high price of credit created its own supply.  So the abolition of Regulation Q was a big first step toward the financialization of the US economy.Next comes the story of how Paul Volcker himself, the man who killed inflation, ushered in not one but two important trends in the history of financialization of the US economy:First, by targeting the size of the money supply rather than rates, he introduced the practice of fudging the goals of monetary policy:  The idea behind targeting the money supply was to hide the fact that this would result in higher interest rates, against which people were fully prepared to complain.  Couching this approach in monetarist theory and invoking Milton Friedman was but a trick, and indeed a trick that was abandoned as soon as it became clear that M1 could no longer get pinned down due to the emergence of NOW accounts.  But the precedent was established of invoking a strategy to deflect the publics criticism of monetary policy.  This echoes all the way to this days Quantitative Easing, though the author does not mention this.Second, by causing rates to touch 20%, Volcker was hoping to strangle growth by limiting the demand for credit.  Instead, he made the US the destination of the whole worlds spare cash.  Money rushed to US investments like it had never done before.  This, in turn, aided financialization in two distinct ways:1. Reagan was able to borrow via the Treasury market amounts nobody had dreamt of before, leading to deficits that were unheard of in peacetime before his presidency2. Companies that used to earn their bread selling goods and services found that they had to be involved in the financing of their customer purchases, both to compete with others who did, but also because very often thats where the profit was lurking.  For example, the auto giants had to get involved in the financing.Next comes the history of how the Fed moved toward transparency.  This has zero to do with financialization, so it does not really fit that part of the story, but it is weaved very well into the other theme of the book: the move toward Fed transparency is all to do with the branch of Government called the Fed being able to tell the masses that its hands are tied as it goes about doing whatever it has pretty much decided it will do, provided of course the target it has in mind behaves in the manner it expects.  So for example, this would be a good way to describe the Feds most recent unemployment target that was meant to act as the condition for QE to end.  And now unemployment is at 5.5% and rates are still at zero we know that this goal, while transparent, was not necessarily an honest goal.So its fair to say that, while the book could not possibly hope to hold the promise offered in the introduction, it tells a very interesting story and it even predicted in 2011 stuff thats happening right now.Neo-Marxist or not, I loved it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1VCPQPCB15HF5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0674066197#wasThisHelpful","R1VCPQPCB15HF5","A2ZK9VNGT3HE2I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ZK9VNGT3HE2I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Financial Times always features an enormous article called the Big Read that focuses on an important topic in the news.  The FTs writers interview absolutely all the relevant players, tease out of them juicy quotes, present all sides of the argument, explain a fair bit of the detail and, generally speaking, set a tone, but leave the conclusions to the reader.Edward Luce has done just that with this book.  His topic (my prose) is Seven things that are going wrong in America: Manufacturing, Education, Healthcare, the Federal Government, Polarization, the Permanent Election Campaign and the Death of the Entrepreneurial Spirit to which he also adds the missing middle.What makes the FT Big Read my favorite read of the day is pretty much what makes this book a mess: a format that works well for a one-page article begins to sag by the time youre on page 50 and becomes downright annoying by page 280.  Edward Luce has INCREDIBLE access and interviews a good 500 of the most important 1,000 Americans, but you, the reader, cannot possibly hope to remember what they all said.  And you lose count of the many arguments that are made.Also, this being a book, the author tends to sympathize a bit extra with what all his important interviewees have to tell him.  The result is a 280 page long rant.  Everything sucks in America, apparently.  And everything was absolutely awesome a generation ago.When I finished the book, I was fuming, basically.  I was angry Id spent my time reading this dense concatenation of quotes and comments and aghast at the paltry effort made to weave them all into a theme or story.  Yes, I want to start thinking, but what are your thoughts, Mr. Luce?He ends the book with a question: can America forge the consensus that will allow it sustain an open economy that benefits everyone?Does he attempt to answer?  Noooooooo he doesnt.  Youre on your own.  Time to start thinking.And yet, Im glad I read it.  I challenge anyone to say he knew everything that is listed in this extremely dense, thoroughly resourced and exquisitely written tome.  Theres some serious information packed in here.  And one particular theme, the Killing of the Golden Goose is developed particularly well.That would be the part of the book where Luce argues America has thrown the secret recipe for innovation out the window.  When once it attracted the best of the best and turned them into Americans, it now loses most of them to their home country once theyve gotten their PhD.  The trademark office that once used to make America the repository of the worlds best ideas has turned into a tax on innovation.  The Passport Agency that once turned an interviewed Indian-born entrepreneurs application in four weeks has turned into a Maginot Line.  The VCs that once sought long shots now shop for sure things.  Some weirder ideas slip in there too.  Like Sarbanes-Oxley allegedly stops innovation.  Or competition allegedly is a tax on innovation.  Thats clearly stuff CEOs sweetly whispered into his ear.  But the story is compelling, you read it and youre like perhaps hes right.Some other stuff hes got flat wrong though.  China is firing manufacturing just as fast as the US and has been for at least a decade.  I dont care what Jeff Immelt tells everyone (Edward Luce included) but you have to agree with Austan Goolsbees view on page 161 that people will point to China ten years from now and wonder how it could have wasted so much money.  A good 100 pages of this 280 page book argues passionately that the US ought to be throwing the same types of subsidies at high end manufacturing and I, for one, was far from convinced.  Yes, yes, Regina Dugan of DARPA is right when she argues on page 147 that to innovate we must make but this does not mean the US governments role is to match every new entrants subsidies.  And it really cant be that the future is in manufacturing if its also true that all new jobs since 1990 are in the non-tradable sector, can it?Also, this would contradict the story Edward Luce (very convincingly) tells aboutwhat he considers to be the US governments main problem, namely that, tightening budgets notwithstanding, its plagued by complexity and fragmentation of a frighteningly accelerating nature.  Quoting Silicon Valley entrepreneur Ed Perhoet, (p. 145) Lets say the president wanted to combine all research money into one agency.  He wouldnt stand a chance.  The easiest step would be to set up a new agency, which would then compete with all the others for authority and funds.  Luce quotes all the necessary numbers on the size of the tax code (best exemplified by the fact that the head of the IRS has his taxes filled out by a professional), the geometrically growing number of regulations (70k pages at last count), the escalating number of executive titles (with 64 chiefs of staff under George W Bush), the staggering number of outside contractors (10.5 million compared with fewer than 2 million direct federal employees, their number having been capped there by Congress in 1951), Barack Obamas 37 policy czars, the 56 programs to promote financial literacy, the 82 different programs to improve teaching ability, the 51 entirely duplicative schemes for worker assistance and the US militarys dozens of independent ways to deal with IEDs in Afghanistan.  How exactly could this government steer industrial policy, even if it made sense to do so?I was most reminded of the FTs Big Read when the FDA came under Luces microscope.  First comes a vicious attack from the angle of the Semiconductor Industry, but its swiftly followed by an impassioned plea to support the FDA.  All it seems to have taken is an audience from its charismatic leader.  The chapter ends with an exhortation to fund regulators better or risk losing control of the global commons.  Rather weird.The education chapter is a list of failed initiatives, some government-sponsored, such as the cash-starved community colleges and some private, such as Bill Gates crusade to make classes smaller.  An initiative to get schools to enter robot competitions is more of an excuse for the author to hang out with and hitch a plane ride from legendary inventor Victor Kamen.The healthcare section.  Erm, what healthcare section?  Oh, yes.  If we ever were to go back to the era when US corporations ruled the world and provided continuous lifetime education and opportunities to a loyal workforce, with no risk of their investment jumping ship to the competition, perhaps they could also pay for said employees' healthcare.  Sure.  And we could also watch the Fonz together and be cool, one presumes.The chapter on polarization is convincing.  You find out about the Tea Party and Glenn Beck and a funky referendum consultant who can get Californians to vote for anything if you pay him enough.  America is dangerously polarized, and this is conveyed extremely well.The explanation of how we got there is missing though.  Yes, its true, the manufacturing jobs that are forever gone were lost to people who would normally have stood in between the two extremes.  They were middle class jobs.  Yes, the tax breaks in America all help the rich homeowners, rich stock owners, rich corporations that can hire tax specialists and they all deprive the state of money it could have targeted to the poor, but this 100% true and rather unfortunate fact makes the rich richer and the poor poorer.  It does not do much in terms of annihilating those in the middle.  The only decent explanation is rather indecent.  It comes from Edward Luces former boss, Larry Summers who argues that since the eighty/twenty rule is true, things arent that great for the 80 percent. (p. 59)The last chapter is the one about how money buys power in American politics and it turned my stomach.  You follow around Jim Messina as he raises millions for Obama, you are confronted with the nasty hypocrisy regarding lobbyists and how Senator Baucus, who has received so far USD 38 million in campaign contributions cut big Pharma a sweet deal and killed the public insurance option after Obama gave him the keys to Obamacare, before handing over to Liz Fowler (a frequent recipient of paid work by Wellpoint) to lead the actual drafting.  Page 231 you can read the vomit-inducing endorsement she gets from the Obama administration after somebody questioned the logic of her appointment.  Similar examples are given from all recent administrations.Away from the China is taking over because we lack an industrial policy the book does not really have a narrative, basically.  It does not have a beginning and an end.  You could mix up the chapters and nothing would be lost.  And it does not offer answers, just soundbites.  Well, there is one answer (we need an industrial policy to save high-end manufacturing) but I disagree with it.Perversely, Im glad I read the book, Ive learnt a lot.  A bit like I feel after Ive read the Big Read.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RS0Y3G048ZCOX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0802120210#wasThisHelpful","RS0Y3G048ZCOX","A2ZK9VNGT3HE2I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ZK9VNGT3HE2I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Two of the worlds most famous behavioral economists are on a mission from God.  Their task is critical.  They must travel 239 years back in time, all the way to 1776, to introduce Adam Smiths butcher, brewer and baker to their nemesis, the dreaded phisherman.  If it all goes to plan, the economics profession, and the world at large, will be rescued from the touch of the invisible hand.Somewhere in the time capsule, and while they are waiting for the synthesis between the Phishing Equilibrium and General Equilibrium to occur (chiefly through incantation of the Greek ph in lieu of the vulgar letter f), the two giants collide.  They probably realise they dont agree about much.  Hank Paulsons TARP was a phish in one guys view, but saved the world from a second Great Depression in the others.The biggest phish in the history of Finance, Quantitative Easing, is taboo, because Georges wife remains heavily involved.Defeated, they jump back out of the capsule, only to discover that their writing powers have been reduced to those of a diligent high school student.  In horror, and facing a deadline on a book promised years ago and pre-sold on Amazon six months ago, they take a leaf out of said students book and copy down from Wikipedia the biographies of some evil advertisers and snake oil salesmen.It works! Joseph Stiglitz, Alan (couldnt be) Blinder, Dani Rodrik and Laura Tyson pronounce the book a triumph.  It works out less well for you, the reader, unless you are a precocious 17 year old and have never heard of the Keating Five.In fairness, for that audience its probably a rather good intro to Alternative Economics.  But this is not the seminal work I was expecting.  Its a laundry list of standard stuff the two authors could agree on.  Probably decent assigned reading for the one or two lectures on alternative views that the Stephen Marglins of this world are invited to give to Freshmen in Economics.AHA!  Thats precisely what it is.  No wonder they praise N. Greg Mankiw.

"Theres a ton of information and loads of opinion in this beautifully written book, but not terribly much cohesion when it comes to the telling of the story itself. Rather, what we have here is a collation of twelve very separate chapters about the six theaters of war that transformed the Great War into WWI: the Caucasian front, the European front (chiefly the Dardenelles), the North African front, the Arab Peninsula, Mesopotamia and what we call today the Middle East. You also get a chapter about the Armenian Genocide.On the plus side, each chapter stands on its own and can be read separately. On the minus side, stuff gets repeated unnecessarily and youre often left asking yourself questions along the lines of this al Askari fellow whos leading the Arabs against the Ottomans, is he the same guy who was fighting the British earlier in the book in North Africa? A bit more of an effort could have gone into turning this book into a narrative.No idea what some of the reviewers are talking about here, the angle is 110% British. Its not a whitewash, its not an attempt to make the British look good, but its told by a Brit to other Brits and youre invited to listen in if you care. For all the personal accounts included, it is most definitely NOT a history of WWI from the Ottoman perspective. That said, with the exception of two and a half fronts (the Caucasian front, the Hijaz and Libya) this is the story of a war between the British and Ottoman Empires, so the British angle is far from inappropriate.No attempt is made to glorify war. The author admires many of the protagonists and does a very good job of giving their background and explaining their motivations. He does an even better job of conveying the horrors of trench warfare, the divided loyalties of the Ottoman subjects and the plight of the civilians who played host to the two warring empires. Apart from the harrowing descriptions of what it was like to be in the trenches and what it was like to be an Armenian or a POW marched to ones death, the heart-rending story of the civilians caught in the crossfire in Kut also stands out. The annihilation of Gaza some 100 years ago is quite poignant too.What I most liked about the book is that the author says it how he sees it. No wishy-washy stuff here. In no particular order, heres a selection of views: Churchill is poorly served by history. Yes, he ordered the original naval attack on the Dardanelles, but the Gallipoli disaster is pretty much down to one man, Kitchener. The time honored British technique of naming places with reference to ancient history is outlined, with the example of Cresiphon given, near Baghdad. The author does not mince words about the motivations: it is to take the focus away from the Muslim religion that tied together the subjects of the Empire and toward the ancient history that often divided them. (The author keeps quiet when it comes to the word Palestine, on the other hand) Sykes Picot, the Balfour Declaration and the promises made to the Hashemites and the Iraqis were shameful, alright, but thats easy to say after the fact. In practice, they all amounted to the same thing: in order to beat the Germans and the Ottomans, the British repeatedly promised the same piece of land to multiple sets of people; after the war was over they did what they could to accommodate them all as best they could. (Yes, probably a bit too convenient an explanation, but a brave view nonetheless) Laurence of Arabia was a self-promoting buffoon with a good Oxford accent, a solid command of Arabic and a knack for turning up at the right place at the right time, rather than a pivotal character; similarly, if the spoils of war are due to those who have spilt the most blood, the Arabs he occasionally escorted do not truly deserve to feel cheated out of their entitlements. The Armenians were clearly targeted for death, they were not merely marched out of their homeland; but their extermination has to be seen under the light of an empire that was facing dismemberment at best and annihilation at worst. While this does not excuse genocide, it provides insight as to what motivated the death marches. The author does not quite say it was war, but he comes close. The Kurds are invariably depicted as bloodthirsty bandits and looters who did the dirtywork of the Ottomans. When they are not singled out as undisciplined looters, the Bedouin tribes are depicted as fickle allies to the Arabs, the Ottomans or the British. This judgement I personally could not square with the understanding the author shows for the very similar behavior of other locals who had no choice other than to bow to the latest conqueror of their territory. Indians and Anzacs are a supporting act. The author only ever goes into any detail about them to quote letters they are sending home from the front or to recount Kiwi rowdiness.While I dont necessarily buy all these views, and even though they are all rather Anglo-centric, I have to say they are probably what Ill be left with after having read The Fall of the Ottomans.Overall, this book has kept me excellent company for the last ten days. My recommendation would be read it, but take notes along the way.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R12DFNT0GE9DFH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=046502307X#wasThisHelpful","R12DFNT0GE9DFH","A2ZK9VNGT3HE2I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ZK9VNGT3HE2I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Theres a cabal of London-based writers who love Italy but write (chiefly) about its ills.  Im thinking Bill Emmott and Beppe Severgnini and the Economist magazine here.  Clearly, theres also a set of losers (to which I belong) that does not have the inclination to go to the sources and tries to understand Italy from reading their works.It is perhaps a bit unfair to bundle in with them David Gilmour, but he writes precisely in that vein.The Pursuit of Italy is a fantastic read, of that have no doubt.It captures the 3,000 year history of the peninsula in the shortest 400 pages you could possibly hope for.  Clich, I know, but it applies fully.  This book strikes a truly incredible balance between listing the facts and not losing the reader.  The main historical characters appear just enough so you can keep track of who they are for later in the story and no more.  Their biographies are sketched fully enough for you to remember them by whatever quirk it is that best secures them space in your memory, but they dont drag on at the expense of the narrative.  To the great benefit of readers who know some Italian, the author often submits to the temptation of throwing in an Italian phrase that best explains whats going on, but not often enough to annoy the non-Italian-speaker.  Hes done his research, he quotes his sources and he leaves no gaps.The other thing I like a lot about the book is that its infused with opinion.  David Gilmour does not attempt to be even-handed, he tells you who he thinks was good and who he thinks was evil, who was good for Italy and who was bad, always within the context of alternative historical figures from the same period in history.  And he allows his personal tastes and preferences to creep into the book pretty much unhindered.  By the time youre done reading this youll have been exposed to strong views about Venetian proto-democracy, the unfair position Naples holds in todays accounts of Italian history, the complicated but mostly backward role of the papacy, the comparatively benign rule of the Austrians over most of northern Italy, the indifferent rule of the Spanish over the south and the catastrophic ineptitude of the Piedmontese at waging war against anybody other than fellow Italians.The problem is that this all descends into a one-idea book.  Starting with a detailed anti-history of the Risorgimento (which seems fair from my angle, though I must admit ignorance; perhaps it would be worth it to ask a historian if it is indeed the generally acknowledged view that it amounted to a forced and unpopular Piedmontese takeover), the book turns into a polemic against the establishment of a nation-state, which the author summarizes on the last page of the book, should you have failed to get his point: Geography and the vicissitudes of history made certain countries, including France and Britain, more important than the sum of their parts might have indicated.  In Italy the opposite was true.For a one-idea book, this is not well-substantiated enough a claim.  Pretty much everything David Gilmour has to say about the ills of Italy applies equally to my home country, Greece, and its fair to say that Greece does not owe its low birth rate, inability to collect tax, over-dependence on poorly-done agriculture, rotten legal system and dirty politics of clientelism to a misconceived nation-state that fails to rise to the sum of its parts.  If the argument is true for Italy, the author needs to provide significantly better proof, rather than a romantic list of ways in which the sundry city-states worked better than Italy, if they ever did.So what we have here, in my view, is a tremendous page-turner of an introduction to Italy, but a rather poor pursuit of Italy.  If anything, David Gilmour is desperately seeking an anti-Italy.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1W69ZRPOBV05I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0374533601#wasThisHelpful","R1W69ZRPOBV05I","A2ZK9VNGT3HE2I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ZK9VNGT3HE2I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I had immense fun reading this little book.Obviously, the entire discourse is under the premise that a central banks role is to pursue both full employment and price stability, while also pursuing financial stability by supervising the banking system and making sure the banks have a lender of last resort. It surely cant be too long before the world concedes that maybe one or two of these four goals are more than enough for central banks, but between now and then they will keep trying and its fun to see how they think about it.The book kicks off with Liaquat Ahamad (author of one of my favorite books) interviewing Ben Bernanke. My takeaway: Bernankes (and now Janet Yellens) Fed is comfortable with the lesser evil of letting stocks to go to the moon because few people own them on a leveraged basis so it wont be a complete disaster when they return to planet Earth at some point.Next up is an article about Monetary Policy when Rates hit Zero by Fed governor John Williams, followed by a Q&A monitored by Marty Feldstein. Its nothing too groundbreaking, but the point is emphasized that we had better get used to life at this zero floor, because crises like weve just had used to be regular rather than exceptional. Everybody kind of agrees that QE is better than nothing under the circumstances, but that ideally the government kicks in with fiscal policy too.Paul Tucker next steals the show from his American peers with an extensive, thorough and extremely interesting treatise on the transformed role of bank supervision in a world where markets and banks are all part of a continuum. The main point is that whenever theres funding involved, the central bank needs to understand and supervise the related activity, lest the funding be suddenly withdrawn. So if youre a broker dealer and youre a prime broker to hedge funds, youre really their bank and you can suffer from a run and the central bank ought to supervise you. If youre a conduit and you hold mortgage paper against which youve issued CP, youre a bank and you can suffer from a run and the central bank ought to supervise you too. Ditto for money market funds etc. etc. A second point he makes is that we neednt have hit the problem with resolving international banks if theyd adopted the modus operandi of American banks that operate across a large number of states on the model that a holding company owns enough subordinate debt of its subsidiary in every state, so the holding company takes the first hit when something happens locally. Ive just picked two things that struck me, the discussion is very thorough, much as its also quite concise. It makes the book worth buying.Last comes an article by Don Kohn on how recent developments have probably (and justly) hurt the prospects for future central bank independence. To the extent that central banks have used this independence to race ahead of what dependent or pandering central banks probably would not have dared do in their wildest dreams to attain the dual mandate I find his assertion that the independence would somehow help fight inflation rather quaint, but opinions can differ, and indeed they do among the panelists in the discussion that follows.Overall, and despite what sounds like a not terribly promising title, I had a blast reading this book.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3JXECOMAIOLZ9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0815726082#wasThisHelpful","R3JXECOMAIOLZ9","A2ZK9VNGT3HE2I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ZK9VNGT3HE2I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Poetry this ain't.  It's written in the style of self-help literature and it goes on and on.But I had one ""aha"" moment after the other as I was reading it.It describes precisely how I felt as a five-year-old with inadequate English at the American Community School in Athens: because I was uncomfortable with my language skills I ended up befriending the other marginalized kids.  When my mom volunteered to be a ""tour guide for a day"" the only two suspended kids in the whole class were in my group of five friends.  I was OK academically, indeed the school pushed me up a grade, but my parents did precisely what this book says they should do: they pulled me out so I could get a fresh start somewhere else.And it anticipates my dismay when my Greek-dad / Japanese-mom son answered ""England"" when I asked him if he was supporting Greece or Japan at the recent World Cup (and admonishes me about as much as my wife did for having shown my displeasure)And it nails how bad it sounded to everybody when my partly French-raised Hungarian/American college roommate deplored the provincial attitudes of his peers from New Jersey.That said, it's mainly a book about the sons and daughters of American missionaries, diplomats and army personnel who were stationed outside America.  Them it covers comprehensively.  Everybody else is in there just to make the book more complete.A shorter and less ambitious book would be much easier to recommend.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2DL9IYS28XT5T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1857885252#wasThisHelpful","R2DL9IYS28XT5T","A2ZK9VNGT3HE2I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ZK9VNGT3HE2I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I came across this book because I went to a ""compliance training"" in my bank where I was expecting to hang myself from boredom and was instead treated to a video featuring the author.  I was unconvinced by the video, but the guy was funny enough (""son, I'm so disappointed in you.  How could you steal a pen from school?  After all, you know that anytime you need a pen all you have to do is ask me and I can get you all the pens you want from work"") that after the training I walked to the bookstore and picked up a copy of the author's original best seller.I was not disappointed.  This awesome little book lists a baker's dozen ways we humans can be counted on to do the wrong thing:* Among two offerings, a merchant can reliably make us pick the one he prefers by sliding a ""decoy"" bad choice that is more similar to the choice he wants to steer us to* The first price we see for anything is the one we remember forever.  Get that high ""anchor"" in and you can sell anything at a high price (and vice versa)* We are suckers for ambience/context.  We won't just pay up for a product if a setting looks upmarket or is sold in an upmarket setting, we'll enjoy it more too.  If something's presented as expensive, basically, we are drawn to it almost automatically, with a very notable exception:* We're drawn to stuff even more if it's FREE!  FREE! (with an exclamation mark, like Yahoo!) is a law unto itself* We can't deal well with mixing social norms and market norms.  We'll do things for free that you could not possibly pay us to do.  Conversely, if a price is put on something that has previously been rationed but free, the magic is gone and we can't go back to looking at it through the prism of social norms* We can do some very stupid things when the ""animal"" inside us comes to the surface* We simply don't have it in us to delay gratification.  We're not wired like that.  We have to find ways to trick ourselves to save for a rainy day, to get medical checks etc.* We value stuff we own higher by dint of owning it.  Our house, our stereo, theatre tickets, the lot.  It all goes up in our estimation because it's ours* We place immense value on keeping options open and waste disproportionate resources on keeping our options open relative to the potential benefit of exercising them* When we think something will be good, we end up liking it and when we think medicine will work it will end up working better!* In the same vein, a 50-Cent Aspirin can do things a 1-Cent Aspirin cannot* When nobody's looking, we all cheat, but we don't cheat too much, lest we end up feeling bad about ourselves* The more removed we are from actual cash, the less inhibited we are in our cheating""What little book,"" I hear you say, this is a 347 page book, after all!  Funny thing is, it's light enough reading that I polished it off in 15 trips between Earl's Court and Liverpool St. tube stations.  It ain't exactly ""Thinking Fast and Slow,"" it's a list of 20 anecdotes (sorry, experiments) that leave you with no doubt that we humans not only are irrational, but that guys like Dan Ariely can predict exactly how we'll get it all wrong.From there, the author moves on to heavier stuff, like how economics ought to find a middle way between ""rational expectations"" orthodoxy and ""behavioural economics,"" but if I'm honest I could not care less.Also, I read the ""revised and expanded"" version which attempts to explain in 8 steps how irrationality is what led us to the recent financial crisis.  I loved all the points made, I almost believed them, except of course humans were just as irrational for the 70 years that preceded the crisis and the crisis happened in 2008, not in the 70 years before.Still, this was immense fun.  Not a masterpiece like Kahneman's, but a fun and instructive book that spares you the thinking.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R6EWY2KPTVTTI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0061353248#wasThisHelpful","R6EWY2KPTVTTI","A2ZK9VNGT3HE2I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ZK9VNGT3HE2I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Don't be confused by the flashy cover of this book: it's written by a lawyer for lawyers.The author, a professor at the University of Virginia, has done some very important work in putting together data summarising all criminal prosecutions of corporations in the USA in the past decade, as well as data on deferred-prosecution and no-prosecution agreements for that period.  In the same vein as Thomas Piketty, who wrote a book to go with his data on capital and wealth, what we have here is the words that go with the data.But as an author Brandon Garrett is no Thomas Piketty.  If you are not a lawyer, reading the book feels a bit like you're eavesdropping on a conversation between lawyers or reading a legal publication.  To the extent that I'd so far been spared both pleasures, that was a new experience for me, and to the extent that I really wanted to find out about ""how prosecutors compromise with corporations"" it has been mildly enlightening; but this was decidedly not light reading.The title of the book is no coincidence: Only criminal charges can result in incarceration.  Civil charges cannot.  So this is a book about the process and the consequences of bringing criminal charges against corporations in the United States of America.Given that corporations can be punished / disciplined in a variety of ways, therefore, what we have here is a partial view of what happens to corporations that break the law in America.  Via an overview of the relevant case history (Siemens, Arthur Andersen, KPMG, Barclays Bank, HSBC, BP, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Zimmer, Southern Union, AU Optronics, BAE Systems etc.) you find out that while in theory corporations can be held liable and punished for the misdeeds of their employees, in practice it's all wide open.  There are (poorly observed) guidelines on what fines ought to be for convicted corporations, there actually aren't any real rules on what victims can expect, care is taken not to punish the rest of society along with inanimate corporations, and the law makes a huge effort to reform rather than punish corporations (preferring to impose and monitor future compliance rather than imposing crippling fines or incarcerating principals), all while going 100% the other way when it comes to citizens themselves, with the US holding all sorts of records on convicting and jailing private offenders.  On the other hand, corporations are not given the same constitutional rights (4th and 5th Amendment, chiefly) as individuals.The one thing we can conclude for sure is that the US is a very bad place to go to court if you are a foreign corporation.  Perhaps a second thing that comes out is that listed companies pay much larger fines, while smaller companies that break the law tend to see higher percentages of their principals jailed.The author fails, in my eyes, to place criminal prosecutions in context and, other than stating his serious doubts about the efficacy of deferred-prosecution agreements, largely stays on the fence on tons of issues.  For example, he caveats his one real finding (that foreign corporations overpay on fines) with a pages-long list of reasons why this might not be as unfair as it sounds.That said, I'm now ""confused about higher things"" than I was when I picked up this book and I also copied out some useful stuff I'd like to share.First, the set of criteria that judges officially need to consider before they prosecute a corporation (p. 56):1. Seriousness of the offense2. Pervasiveness of wrongdoing within the corporation3. Firm's history of similar conduct4. Firm's timely and voluntary disclosure of wrongdoing5. Firm's compliance program6. Any remedial actions7. The harm a prosecution would cause, including to shareholders8. The adequacy of prosecutions of individuals9. Whether it would be enough to impose civil or regulatory remediesSecond, the law offers employers enormous incentives to look for ""bad apples,"" to ""blow the whistle"" on  employees.  In an environment where every effort is being made not to disrupt the economy by bringing corporations to their knees, individual low-level employees make very good scapegoats, while those at the top are statistically extremely unlikely to end up behind bars.So overall this trip through the case history left me rather confused, but hopefully a bit wiser...","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2TEWQHR6QCTHE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OUP1Q6I#wasThisHelpful","R2TEWQHR6QCTHE","A2ZK9VNGT3HE2I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ZK9VNGT3HE2I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The update of Richard Koo's classic ""The Holy Grail of Macroeconomics"" is a better book than the original.It is less verbose, more to the point, has more evidence to support the main thesis, it applies the theory to the European Union particularly well and comes with a bonus chapter on China.It is however not as significant a contribution, and here's why:The original appeared in 2008, just as things were unravelling in the West and predicted with uncanny accuracy exactly how horrible things could go if the wrong policies were adopted.  Drawing on the author's reading of the Japanese experience from 1990 to 2007, it explained for the first time anywhere a very unorthodox, but 100% correct, theory on when monetary policy works and when it amounts to what Keynes described as ""pushing on a string.""  The ten line summary of the theory has two parts: first that there are two types of recessions (i) the ones caused by the five to ten year inventory cycle and (ii) the ones caused by the thirty to fifty year leverage cycle previously described by Irving Fischer and Hyman Minsky.  Second, the author postulated that if a recession is caused by the overbuilding of inventory and capacity for which there was no corresponding demand, then low interest rates will be seized by healthy borrowers to pick up the pieces and re-start the economy.  If however it is overleveraging and a subsequent collapse in asset prices that lies behind the recession, then the private sector will be more concerned with rebuilding its balance sheet than with profit maximization, cheaper money will prove to be of no use to anybody and the only way to set the economy right is with fiscal stimulus, funded by the government issuing the necessary bonds to absorb savings that would otherwise not be put to productive use.Richard Koo was for the longest time the only person anywhere making this point, and very sadly this book could very easily had been entitled ""I TOLD YOU SO.""That's obviously a shame, because I was really hoping that after having made the biggest contribution to macroeconomics in a good seventy years (I'm aware that it's extremely controversial to say this, but I think it's a statement that will stand the test of time) the author would have tried to address the instances where his theory did not work 100% to plan.  So, for example, the US seems actually to have ""reinflated the bubble"" by means along the lines of getting every American to accept a car loan again.  As I'm writing this, subprime car loans are all the rage and have pushed US car sales past all previous records.  I'd have loved to hear what Richard Koo thinks about that.  Similarly, asset prices are setting new records, even though entire continents remain deep in what he calls ""balance sheet recession.""  Please, Dr. Koo, tell us what you think, we beg you.So where the ""Holy Grail"" fully explained the past and did an unbelievable job of explaining / predicting the future, the ""Escape from the Balance Sheet Recession and the QE trap"" kind of pretends that the bits where the predictions turned out to be 75% accurate actually hit the bullseye.Some great new ideas / observations are introduced, of course:* The author explains why we're now stuck with QE and demonstrates a series of problems we will face on the way out* In particular he explains why the current plan to first raise rates and then sell the accumulated bonds is flawed (a low anchor for rates would be very useful when we're selling, if we ever do)* He explains that excess private savings in peripheral Europe actually get recycled into German government bonds rather than in their domestic markets, preventing peripheral European governments from engaging in the necessary fiscal stimulus* ...while conversely private savings in core Europe, no longer hemmed in by currency risk, chased higher yields in peripheral Europe, fuelling housing bubbles and government-spending bubbles* Based on the two last observations, he proposes that private savings in both core Europe and peripheral Europe should be prevented from investing in non-domestic government bonds, or at the very least penalised (e.g. via risk weightings) when they do* He explains that Eurobonds would address the procyclical and destabilising effects described above, but would not solve the political problem of how much debt to issue and how to allocate the proceeds among Eurozone members* The concept of the ""Lewis turning point"" is discussed with reference to China, this being the point where the labor that could easily be diverted toward urbanization and industrialization is as good as exhaustedIn summary, if you have managed to get to year 2015 without having read ""The Holy Grail of Macroeconomics,"" then by all means read the new book instead.  It's better.  But this is nowhere nearly as big a contribution to economic thinking as the original.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ODDIM7BU2OP6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00O4Z55UM#wasThisHelpful","R2ODDIM7BU2OP6","A2ZK9VNGT3HE2I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ZK9VNGT3HE2I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"First things first, I must declare a massive bias here because I come from a most distinguished flock of ""excellent sheep.""  Eat your heart out Amy Chua, my mom and dad (George and Effie Tolis of Athens, Greece) clocked 15.5 years of Harvard tuition between their three offspring.  My brother additionally spent 6 years at a lesser institution in New Haven, but has meantime somewhat redeemed himself: he teaches at Harvard these days.You have been warned, I am writing with considerable bias.  On the other hand, I believe I am at least as excellent a sheep as the author and thus reasonably qualified to comment.Second, I must declare that I disagree with a whole lot of what William Deresiewicz has to say, but quite perversely I totally loved the book nonetheless.  The last book that made me think as hard about my system of beliefs was ""The Worldly Philosophers"" by Heilbronner.  This book was truly cathartic for me to read.  It made me look inside my soul, it made me think about my own children's education, about meritocracy in education and about meritocracy in the world in general.The book has three very distinct parts that are spread over four chapters.  It's three books, really, but with a common theme running through them.From my angle, the most impressive was Part III, but I should probably first go over Part I.Part I is about the psychological travails of the excellent sheep.  The author describes the horrible ordeal students go through in order to secure for themselves a place at the elite institutions of the Ivy League, MIT and Stanford, the hoops they must jump through, the youth they never have, the true learning that never takes place, the whole pantomime we all had to endure.  Apparently it's all gotten a lot worse recently.  If the author is right it no longer starts during your Sophomore year in high school, these days you need to have it all planned out straight out of nursery.  Four fake activities no longer suffice, you need ten.  One wrong step and you're out.  Apparently a good 15% of all kids in America are part of this rigmarole and the psychological effects are devastating.  Studies and statistics quoted in the book leave no doubt the author must be right.But I don't see it that way.  To me it sounds more like1.  the 85% who don't play this game are not affected so we're only talking about the kids of the pushy parents who to some extent get what they deserve (the parents, I mean)2.  the schools in question have thousands and thousands of spots, so everybody ends up somewhere good and everybody can rationalise ex post how he ended up where he should have gone (Stanford had been my first choice, but my dad refused to ""pay for me to have fun in California,"" so I speak from experience)3.  the kind of person who gets in, the kind of person who can ace tests (for that is the only indispensable skill), is possessed of exactly ZERO self-doubt.  I'm pretty full of crap now, at age 47, but when I was 19 I genuinely thought I was God's gift to any school that would be lucky enough for me to deign to apply to.  No, really.  I only applied to Harvard because Stanford did not offer early admission, that is the sole reason I bothered to apply to two schools.  I think I'm much more typical than the self-mutilating students described by the author.  He dedicates far too much time to the ""less excellent"" sheep who are not as full of themselves as I was (and still am).  Well, yes, if a kid does not think (nay, know!) success is assured, this could potentially be a harrowing experience.4.  don't believe the kids who say they got anorexic / took up drugs / cut themselves up because of the pressure of applying to college.  Again from experience I can say that stuff is all about who's boss (clearly me, not my mom, I can do as I please with my body and will carry on doing so until she drops the subject) and it happens WAY before college appears on the horizon, though it probably does happen to the same kids, because they rebel against / defy the same pushy parents who later in life want to send them to the Ivy League / MIT / Stanford.Summary of my point: Deresiewicz has the causality wrong.  The relationship with the parents and the weight of the parents' expectations is the place to go looking for the problems he describes, not the life the kids need to lead in order to ace the college application.  The kids who suffer would suffer the exact same breakdowns if they went to Disneyland with their mom and dad.  Acing tests and pretending to be interested in model UN is, if anything, an escape for people who can do the work.  Math and science, in particular, come naturally to those who do well in those subjects.  My sister aced GCA A-Level Math (the UK equivalent of AP Math) when she was 14 and her primary motivation was to prove the point that she was as good as her older brothers; it had nothing to do with her college application 4 years later and it did not cause her any grief whatsoever.  She probably thought highly of her tutor and wanted to impress him, but there's nothing wrong with that and it's not the situation the author is describing.The bit I KNOW the author nailed is more to do with the psychology surrounding the motivations of the ""excellent sheep.""  He describes my personal motivations of 25 years ago fully and makes a point I had never realised about myself until I read the book (as well as another important point that I had already figured out).  ""Excellent sheep,"" according to Deresiewicz, are motivated by exactly two things:1.  They need to be doing whatever is the hardest.  Check.  My Freshman week in college we were presented with a choice of three flavors of Sophomore year (naturally) calculus.  In order of difficulty it was Math 21, Math 22 and Math 25.  There was a test to be taken.  I aced it of course and without even examining the syllabus I selected Math 25, by far the least appropriate class for me (hello Peano axioms, delta epsilon proofs, sundry modes of convergence) but the one advertised as hellish in the ""Confidential Guide.""  My first day there this kid walked up to the teacher at the beginning of class and said ""I actually placed into Math 22, but I was told that with your permission I could still take Math 25.  I'm very good at Math, I just forgot how to integrate in the placement test.""  There is no moral about hubris and fall to this story; the kid was absolutely right, his name is Chris Woodward, he's a natural and he was a tenured Math professor at Rutgers within 10 years of this incident.  I, on the other hand, suffered the indignity of my first ever B+ because I'm not a genius, I was quite simply exquisitely well prepared (thanks mom and dad!)2.  ""Excellent sheep"" are the ""the best and the brightest"" and ""the world is their oyster"" and they attach maximum importance to keeping things that way, to making triple sure all options remain open.  ""Excellent Sheep"" don't only join Goldman Sachs or McKinsey consulting because it's the toughest option for those who don't go to Law School or Med School.  The true appeal is that these choices don't shut any doors.  You could leave Goldman or McKinsey and go run the Ford Motor Company or the US Treasury or go teach yoga and that's what it's all about.  I must confess that here the author has me TOTALLY FIGURED OUT and I never even knew it.  I left it till two weeks before graduation to decide if my degree would say ""Applied Mathematics"" or ""Engineering Sciences"" or ""Economics"" on it.  When I got off the fence from having to decide between my offer from Salomon Brothers (the hot ticket in the spring of '91 following the publication of ""Liars' Poker"" the summer of '90 and the choice I went for) and my offer to study Applied Mechanics at Stanford, I decided ""Applied Mathematics"" would look best.  Had I gone to Stanford to do Applied Mechanics I would have chosen ""Economics"" because that would have looked oh so diverse.  Ah, and I lied: I did  not turn down Stanford.  I asked them to wait a year for me to attend.  And then another year.  I was a total ass and I did not even know it, basically.  Thank you William Deresiewicz for imparting this bit of self-knowledge on me.  I spent that crucial part of my life doing my utmost to keep options open, rather than delving into something I loved, or at least looking for something I loved.With your permission I'll move from Part I straight to Part III and get to Part II last.Part III of the book discusses the place of meritocracy in our society, our civilization and our democracy.  It's heady stuff and comfortably the best part of the book, much as it is also the least resolved part of the book.The three parts of the book are not separate, and the main idea is planted as early as page 119 (of 242) where the author gives his working definition of what it means for a society to be civilized: it's a society where it's a legitimate option to be poor.I'd happily read a book five times as long and ten times as wrong if I knew it would contain such a total gem.  Maybe I don't read enough, or maybe I'm reading the wrong books, but I cannot fathom of more elegant a definition.  The full text reads as follows:  ""We're still a very wealthy country by any reasonable standard, which means that you've been presented with a rare and remarkable chance, one that's far more precious than the opportunity to be rich: the opportunity not to be.  To find your purpose and embrace your vocation, and still to live a decent life.""BANG!  That hit me so hard.The author fears that we are in the midst of a massive move in the opposite direction, heading quickly toward a dystopia where we will be governed by an aristocracy formed at Harvard, Yale and Princeton.  While as recently as 1985 ""only"" 46% of the students at the 250 most selective universities came from the top quarter of the income distribution, by 2006 we were looking at 67% and the main reason is not that college has been getting progressively more expensive (it has, of course) but that the cost of rearing ""excellent sheep,"" the tutors, music lessons, private school tuition, fake activities, Stanley Kaplan etc. has been building a moat around the offspring of the ruling class.Meanwhile, the colleges don't endeavor, according to the author, to teach as much as they aspire to act as finishing schools for the new members of the gilded class.  ""When Yale offers free fellowships to study in China or subsidizes a trip to New York to catch a Broadway show, it bills those luxuries as instruction in how to be broad-minded and cultured.  The truth is that they are, more than anything else, instruction in how to be wealthy"" he quotes a student as saying.A lot of the damage is already done.  Pages 226 to 230 are in my opinion REQUIRED READING FOR ALL AMERICAN CITIZENS and I do not jest.  In these short 5 pages the author tears into every single recent US President and most presidential candidates.  Here's a quote:""If Romney seems like an out-of-touch elite, consider the two Democratic nominees who preceded our current president, Al Gore and John Kerry: one each from Harvard and Yale, both earnest, decent, intelligent men, both utterly unable to communicate with the larger electorate.  In fact, consider our current president - a graduate of Honolulu's prestigious Punahou School as well as of Columbia and Harvard Law - who despite his race, his oratorical skills, and his years as a community organizer, is equally incapable of making an emotional connection with the people he calls ""folks.""""The point is made that both Bushes, Dukakis, Clinton, Gore, Kerry, Obama and Romney all attended Harvard or Yale, leading to the main thesis that we have abdicated government to mandarins who know how to gather credentials but know zero about the real world because they have only ever operated outside it, in the bubble defined by our only nominally meritocratic system.  Speaking about Obama again, Deresciewicz homes in for the main message of this book:""He also couldn't understand why people might object to some of his appointments -figures like Timothy Geithner or Larry Summers, both of whom were central to creating the conditions that led to the financial crisis. They're ""the best"" after all; whom else would you choose to run the economy.  Obama's arrogance and that of his advisors, as ill-concealed as it has proved to be unearned, is that of the double-800 crowd.  It's as if he can't believe that anybody might reject those commonsense solutions once he has explained them carefully enough -as if he has no conception of competing values, interests, or perspectives, no idea that society is more than just equations.  With his racial identity and relatively humble background, his election has been called the triumph of meritocracy.  The sad thing is that that's exactly what it was.""(Even harsher criticism is --justly in my view-- reserved for Bill Clinton, the ultimate dog that caught the car)He does not want to finish the book on a bad note, quoting E. Digby Baltzell who once wrote ""History is a graveyard of classes which have preferred caste privilege to leadership"" and proposes that the way out of our predicament is to invest heavily in our state school system, thereby ensuring that ""privilege cannot be handed down.""The argument is left incomplete, I actually think the author is merely observing the manifestation of our current political impasse in the space called ""Education"" rather than examining the root cause of today's ills.  But there can be no doubt that one of the reasons America is great is it twice in its history got ahead of all other nations in terms of imposing good, free education and it would be a fantastic idea if we had a third go now.Amazingly, Obama just announced a plan to offer free community college to all Americans, possibly heralding the third such revolution.But he would not find Deresiewicz in agreement, I don't think.  Not on the evidence of Part II of the book, at any rate.Part II of the book can be summarised as ""don't go to Harvard.  Get a liberal arts education instead.""The argument is built around two axes:1.  This is your chance to discover who you are.  College is your time to be selfish, ask yourself the big questions, figure out for yourself what all the big thinkers have said that is relevant to you today.  If you go pursuing some kind of vocational education you will be throwing out the window your one chance to explore the accumulated knowledge of all previous generations, which is distilled in the ""good books"" and in literature in particular.  Go ahead, ditch the pre-med curriculum, get your hands on the good books, become an English major.  You'll find out that not only will you land that coveted Goldman job / law school spot / med school spot regardless, you will actually perform better than your peers because your four year search for your soul will have equipped you better.  (The author, of course says this much better than I ever could)2.  Don't go pursuing this liberal arts education at some place that could not give a damn about teaching, go to a proper liberal arts college that will offer you attention, seminars, the appropriate size of class and other students might not be of the same calibre of your potential Harvard classmates, but they won't be robots, they will think like you do.  The teachers will be just as good as they are at Harvard because there's a massive glut of amazingly well-educated PhDs out there and the small liberal arts college will actually force them to teach.  Their peers at Harvard will actually be on the ""publish or perish"" treadmill and will have zero incentive to meet you, assuming you overcome the competition of the other fivehundred of your classmates in the lecture hall and manage to get to them somehow.The argument is very weak.  It's so impossibly weak I really don't know where to start, but here's my rebuttal:1.  First let's get the easiest bit out of the way.  Suppose you want to go to med school or law school and suppose you're sitting on a Harvard undergrad admission.  You're sitting on gold.  This is probably your only chance to get into med school or law school without straight A's.  If you get a B+ average from Harvard (which, as the author alleges is not that difficult) and ace your MCATs or LSATs, that's it.  You're in.  Not so if you get a B+ average at a good liberal arts college.  You're out.  And here comes the best bit.  You can use the spare time afforded by the luxury of only aiming for the B+ average to shop all the English seminars, philosophy classes etc. you ever hoped to attend.  And they will be taught by the same Helen Vendlers the author adulates.  And you can even play ""spot the guy on the treadmill"" with your enlightened friends.  My roommate Pete did exactly what I'm describing.  He got a C in orgo, OK?  He took a class about Beethoven and dared to disagree with his teacher's main thesis in his final paper, earning himself an undeserved B+.  Because he could.  He had a ball.  One night his Columbia girlfriend sent us her math-for-poets homework and we sat around and worked it all out from first principles and sent it back to her.  We most certainly did not do our work that night, we did hers.  And one day he woke up, took the train to Salem (because he'd left it till the last minute to apply), sat the MCAT cold, aced it and a few months later matriculated at Columbia Med.  He's now a prominent anaesthesiologist.  With a C in orgo.  HOW ABOUT THAT???  If you are the type who can ace the MCAT cold you probably aced the SAT too, you might be sitting on a Harvard admission and if you're considering grad school you've got to tick that ""I accept"" box, beg borrow or steal the tuition and go to Harvard.  Case closed.  Four years of liberal arts await you, if that is your wish.2.  Second, suppose you are a genuine genius.  Not a bloody-minded hard worker with the right set of parents like I was, but a proper genius.  You can go become the star student somewhere else, or you can measure yourself against your true peers at Harvard.  So I was there from `87 to `91.  The Putnam exam is the ""big deal"" among math competitions between college students, look it up.  Wikipedia will show you Harvard won it all 4 years I was there.  From tens of colleges that compete and thousands that are eligible.  What Wikipedia won't tell you is that none of those four years did we win it with our first team.  We won it with the second, third or fourth team we fielded.  And that is because a good 70% of the US Math Olympic team my year (and presumably the ones above and below) matriculated in my class, with the remaining 30% spread across America.  Unless I knew which exact field of Math I was looking to study and that the best faculty for that field was at a particular other college, I'd need some serious convincing to go study Math somewhere else.  THAT'S JUST ONE EXAMPLE.  Bottom line, if you are a genius, you would do yourself a disservice to forego the opportunity to hang out with your true peers for the sake of going to pursue some liberal arts discovery wild goose hunt.  Go to the proper school and take a year off to study the good books.  Or three.  Nobody will care.3.  Third, suppose you want to go to college as a preamble to entering American business or politics.  You genuinely cannot pass on the opportunity to make the connections you will make at an Ivy League college.  They ACTIVELY RECRUIT the scions of the richest and most influential families on earth.  The grill in my house was operated by the son of the CEO of Goldman Sachs.  When my roommate Gabe came back from his last round of interviews in New York he was still in shock: ""So for my last interview Phil's dad walks in, and it turns out he wants to know about Mad.  I told him she's fine.""  Bob Rubin was spying on his son's girlfriend, bottom line.  Gabe got the job.  Mad teaches at UC Davis (just looked her up).  No idea how Phil is doing, but his dad went on to become Treasury Secretary.  In summary, if you want to get into business or politics, don't go to the liberal arts college, have the grilled cheese at the Currier House grill instead.  Or go to Wharton.  Don't do something stupid you will regret.  Buy all those good books and read them when you retire.4.  OK, so suppose you are a guy like me, who only really got into Harvard because he was crazily ambitious, conceited, hugely supported by his parents and who had no idea what he wants to do in his life other than collect more degrees, keep all options open and look forward to a continued lifetime as an ""excellent sheep.""  You are at grave risk of never discovering that you are human.  Your bubble stands the best chances of getting burst if you go to a place that will deliver the surgical kick in the nuts you deserve.  I thought I'd b/s my way through an essay on Act II, Scene 3 of Macbeth.  I wrote it in, dunno, three hours.  Section leader Julia Dubner (I still remember her name) gave me the C+ I deserved and attached a pamphlet for the writing center, indicating I did not know how to write and needed professional help.  To me, the high school valedictorian, student government vice-chairman, crew team jock and all-round renaissance sheep!!!  How could she?  It hurt.  It didn't make me any less full of manure, of course, but it did me a whole lot of good.  I actually went to the writing center, for no credit I hasten to add, and somebody there took the time to teach me how to write (with modest success, I hear you say).Don't get me wrong, I agree the author on a number of levels.  I got no guidance in choosing my classes at Harvard.  I graduated with an Applied Math degree and could not define what a group is, because it's possible to do that at Harvard.  But I definitely got the kicking I deserved.  Every day I met people who were better than me at something.  I even met people (Kentaro Toyama springs to mind) who are better than me at ABSOLUTELY EVERYTHING.  I will thank Harvard forever for bursting my bubble.  After Harvard I stopped trying to be excellent.  I now positively enjoy being normal.  I escaped sheepdom at age 21.  Also, when at age 33 I decided to put things right and find out what a group is, the not entirely substandard university in my neighbourhood (Imperial College in South Kensington) admitted me to their Pure Maths program on the strength of my Applied Math degree from ten years earlier.  I doubt liberal arts would have cut it.5.  Suppose you are a legacy.  Well, what are your options?  There's Harvard, where your parents have donated ten bucks and who might take you and there's nothing else.  Default choice.  Done.6.  Suppose you are an athlete.  Tough one.  Unless it's crew or ice hockey we're talking about you can look forward to four years of losing the whole time.  That liberal arts college suddenly sounds rather more appealing.  Ah, they don't offer your sport, you say, and they are not offering a scholarship either, eh?  Sounds to me like you're going to Harvard then.  And for the rest of your life you'll wake up from your recurring nightmare with ""It's alright, it's OK, you're going to work for us someday""  still reverberating in your ears.  Tough, I must say.  You know what, I have an idea for you.  Do the sport for one year and then Harvard will carry on paying for you do study liberal arts just like William Deresiewicz says you should.  There we go, that's a plan.  Sorted!  Neeext!7.  You are an average guy, you are not in any way conceited, you take success in your stride, you did not invent any of your activities, you have to work extra hard to get good grades, but somehow managed to get a top GPA and you don't know what you want to study, you are not excellent at anything in particular but you are a very strong all-rounder.  Your parents had nothing to do with your academic record, you got there all on your own.  And you need to choose between Harvard and a liberal arts program.  IN YOUR DREAMS, DUDE.  Harvard does not admit people of your description.The above, rather inelegant, list is called in mathematics ""proof by enumeration.""  My point is the following: The Ivy League works for those whom it admits and does not work for those it doesn't.  Some guys do get in by fluke (or even worse, they get in through superhuman effort or a supersized donation) and they have a terrible, terrible time.  But generally speaking, if you're sitting on a Harvard admission, they know what they're doing.  You'll fit right in.  Go for it.This second section of the book also contains a full attack on Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) which the author hates because you don't exactly get taught in a seminar when you register for those, because you don't interact with anybody and because so far people seem to drop them who have not been taught how to learn.  If the idea behind college it to teach you how to learn, you are unlikely to learn how to learn from a computer screen.I buy all of the above, but the fact remains that they are cheap.  To the extent that tons of people know how to learn and might not be sitting on the spare quarter million dollars that it will soon cost to go to college, I can see how they might want to get away with staying with their parents and paying a fraction of the cost.  And I can also see how an employer might prefer to hire a guy who got an online degree in Engineering from MIT rather a full-time degree in Engineering from a college with a 450 math SAT average.  And I can also see how a college like Harvard might respond to a large dip in the value of its investments by selling online degrees using a sub-brand like ""Harvard MOOC.""  The Extension School already awards credits, a former minister in the Greek government who often likes to refer to his Harvard days attended the Extension School along with all the housewives and I don't think Harvard has a problem with that, his money was as green as any other student's.So jury's out.  And if the author is wrong and MOOCs take a hold we'll have half a million unemployed PhDs in our hands very soon as all lesser colleges will go to the wall.  Won't be fun to watch at all.  Let's hope he's right, then.So lots and lots of stuff to digest in this book, rather tenuously related, but all rather fascinating.  I look forward to disagreeing with this author more in the future.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R26KMMV92E7JFB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GEEYX90#wasThisHelpful","R26KMMV92E7JFB","A2ZK9VNGT3HE2I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ZK9VNGT3HE2I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My father is one of the pioneers of open heart surgery. For a twenty five year period, during which he set up three different hospitals' practices, he was the preeminent cardiac surgeon in Greece. For example, my father did the first coronary bypass operation in Greece in 1971, a short 4 years after Rene Favaloro's trailblazing work at the Cleveland Clinic.Transplants had to wait, for two reasons. First, for lack of donors. Second because the human body rejects hearts that come from other people. To solve the first problem science went a number of ways, including the artificial heart and grafts from animals. My father was reluctant to consider either, not out of principle (he was full of admiration for both Jarvik and Bailey, indeed he taught Len Bailey) but because Greece does not have the infrastructure to support either. As soon as Ciclosporin (the first good-enough immunosuppressant) was approved by the FDA, he sought help from world-class transplant specialists in Salt Lake City, Utah and set up the necessary infrastructure to perform heart transplants in Greece.It was a long wait. In June of 1990, the heart of Koralia Argeith, a registered organ donor, stopped beating after she'd been involved in a car crash. Her husband confirmed that he was comfortable with her decision to be a donor and within hours her heart was giving the gift of life to another human being. That was a full 23 years after Christiaan Barnard's similar operation in Johannesburg. This graft was rejected, sadly, but my father's second transplant patient was much luckier. The two of them had their picture taken together on the 20th anniversary of the operation!""So daddy, how come this took so much longer?""""The drugs have only now become good enough, son. Up until now you were only doing your reputation a favor by doing these transplants, not the recipient. The operation is no different, who cares if you're stitching back in the same heart's pipework or another's? But the drugs weren't there to give the heart a chance to bed in.""""Funny thing is,"" he added, ""it's the Chinese who're leading the way on those drugs.""I did not quite believe my father. How on earth could the Chinese be leading the world on any front? This was 1990, to me China meant crappy Rolex imitations, shoddy plastic toys, turtle-blood (and not only) drinking Olympians and cheap scrapyards, to say nothing of The Great Leap Forward, the Red Guards, the jet-plane position (I'd taken a class about the Cultural Revolution in college -it was triple credits that had attracted me, nothing more noble than that) and of course Tiananmen Square. So I thought to myself ""daddy just likes to make the point that not everything was invented in the rich countries.""Some twenty years later, dunno, in 2009, I was leaving work one afternoon and an RBS colleague approached me outside the office, near Liverpool St tube. He made it clear that this had nothing to do with work, but he wanted me to read a pamphlet he was handing out. The pamphlet said that the Chinese government was harvesting Falun Gong members for their organs. I read it with interest, went to the Internet, did a quick search and found absolutely nothing. Perhaps it was too quick an Internet search. I'm not an idiot, I did realise that the Chinese government would probably go out of its way to push the relevant results way to the bottom of any search I was bound to do and that my colleague at the bank would not be wasting his valuable time standing in the tube station for no reason, but perhaps I did not want to believe it. So I pushed it to the back of my mind and that was that.This Christmas either the FT or the Economist, can't remember, listed the favorite books of the year for sundry personalities, and ""the Slaughter"" featured. I immediately remembered my colleague. If a book had come out about organ harvesting in China, I'd clearly been wrong to push it all to the back of my mind. So I ordered the book and prepared for the worst.Or rather, I thought I had.If you're into accounts of torture, this is the book for you. Pages 31 through to 285 of this 315 page book are dedicated to Falun Gong, and chiefly to its suppression and persecution. Pages 100 through to 250 are strictly about how individual members of Falun Gong were persecuted, tortured and beaten to death, after first having valiantly done what they could to escape and then having held their faith. It's all entirely believable, well documented, highly unlikely to be fake, quite possibly verifiable, but just relentless. If you want to find about different ways people have been made to suffer, if you've read about the Roman persecution of the Christians and it whetted your appetite, then buy this book and you will not be disappointed. It's based on a good fifty interviews from people around the world.The bit that is dedicated to organ harvesting is much more limited. It's the first 50 and the last 65 pages of the book (many of which overlap with Falun Gong).If you read the acknowledgments you see what happened.Quite clearly, the author originally set out to map the history of Falun Gong and its persecution in particular. The meat of the book is the story of Falun Gong. But halfway through his project the author ran out of cash and his next funders for the project made it a proviso for their funding that he should change focus to organ harvesting. Given that Falun Gong is a religion / sect / faith that not only mandates daily exercises but also forbids drugs and alcohol, its adherents make for some extremely high quality potential organ donors and that's where the Venn diagrams meet: a book that is about organ harvesting in China is very much also a book about the organ harvesting of Falun Gong practitioners. They not only represent a high percentage of the Laogai (jail) system population, but also the cream of the pool of organs, so to speak.So what we have here is one of those books that present themselves rarely: a lot how ""the Great Deformation"" by David Stockman is a poorly-written, poorly argued, discursive bad read but is regardless the best book of 2013 because it is to this day the only place where you can go read (if you know where to look and skip a lot of the dross) exactly what Corporate Equity Withdrawal is and how it is the most accurate description of what is wrong with our current brand of capitalism, a lot like if you wanted to read what ""pushing on a string"" means you once had to read John Maynard Keynes' truly awful, dense and self-important ""General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money,"" I'm afraid that if you want to read about the persecution of Falun Gong, the persecution of the Uighurs or one single interview about organ harvesting in China, Ethan Gutmann's book is the only show in town. And you get 50 interviews.Now, 50 interviews is nothing, I hear you say. Not so, I'd argue. In a world where David Cameron, the prime minister of the United Kindgom had to go on all fours to China to beg for forgiveness for having previously muttered something about human rights, in a world where (contrary to the very well-articulated warnings of important thinkers such as Daron Acemoglu) we pretend that we will transform the Chinese dictatorship by doing business with China, a guy who publishes the results of 50 interviews that prove beyond reasonable doubt that China is(i) viciously persecuting a cult with 50+ million members(ii) engaging in systematic organ harvesting for profitis clearly somebody with enough courage to merit everybody's respect. There's tons of money to be made writing books which explain how China will lead the world, how it has the model that points to the future etc. A guy who has that opportunity but choses instead to live a life of relative poverty and research human rights abuses deserves our recognition and respect.Here's a wonderful piece of circumstantial evidence in support of the author's thesis: Israel does not allow its citizens to travel to China for transplants.And now I know how come the Chinese lead the world in immunosuppressants: practice makes perfect, they say. How disgusting!","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R27EKF3FVO2MWA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IHMBO6M#wasThisHelpful","R27EKF3FVO2MWA","A2ZK9VNGT3HE2I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ZK9VNGT3HE2I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"What with Hillary being the frontrunner for the 2016 election and Jeb Bush looking every day more like he might be the Republican candidate, my friends have taken to teasing me. When I protest that there's no way in Hell she'd get my vote they chuckle and, depending on how well they know me, they bring up one or more of the following points:1. Jeb's brother took Osama Bin Laden's bait hook, line and sinker and got us into two wars we were guaranteed to lose2. Jeb's brother has made all of us accomplices to torture, giving justification to the sundry Kalashnikov-wielding (and firing) maniacs currently in the news3. Jeb's brother enacted all the legislation that favors passive income, which is one of the foundations of today's inequality4. Jeb's brother looked Putin in the eyes and did not see KGB, perhaps because...5. Jeb's dad used to run the freakin' CIA6. My (pathetic) voting record stands as Dukakis '88, Obama '08My old friend and current business partner Bernard goads me pretty much every day. ""Your candidate"" he yells when Hillary's on the TV screen. He drove me so far up the wall the other day that I spent a half hour on Wikipedia listing what it is I dislike about Bill Clinton and totting it up on a (not so) quick email. To wit:First and foremost, he was the political godfather of irrational exuberance: he not only presided over the biggest post-war bubble in history (hello NASDAQ) but he actually helped cause it by leaving the economy to Greenspan, Rubin and a still very green (if academically brilliant) Larry Summers.And of course his policies seeded the next housing bubble.An anthology of relevant laws from his time reads as follows:* 1994 Repeal of the Interstate banking restrictions (the precursor to ""Too Big to Fail,"" and my fellow Greek Charles Calomiris can say what he wants)* 1999 Repeal of the Glass Steagall Act (that turned Citi, BofA, WaMu, Wachovia and Countrywide into investment banks ---and caused them to race each other toward insolvency)* 2000 Commodity Futures and Modernization Act (that freed all OTC derivatives from regulation and created the quadrillion dollar monster that will eventually swallow us)Lots of people also say he strong-armed the agencies into lending to minorities who could never hope to pay back, but opinions differ. History of course records that he balanced the budget, but if you can't do so in the middle of the biggest bubble ever then there's a problem.Second, and for all his posturing about civil rights, Clinton had exactly zero regard for human rights or human life. Not only did he give us the 1994 Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act (the precursor to the monster revealed by the Snowden revelations), but he timed his various international bombings, ""Wag the Dog"" stylie, to coincide with his own political battles in Washington (such as the Lewinski hearings) and of course he emptied our entire arsenal of depleted uranium-238 ammunition on Serbia. Hell, we actually ran out of Tomahawk missiles and had to order new ones. Look up ""teratogenesis"" on the Net. And of course, the ""first black President"" (funny how we don't hear that so much these days) brought us the 1996 Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act that forced single mothers out of the home and into ""workfare"" with disastrous repercussions on their offspring we are only now starting to fully understand.Third, Clinton wrote the book in terms of selling out to Corporate America. This is a true ""where do I start"" thing. Leaving banking and finance aside, he TOTALLY sold out to Big Pharma (for example, check out the 1999 FDA rule change that allowed Direct-to-Consumer advertising of prescription medicine -no other civilized country allows this) and indeed Hillary convinced Obama to get the Pharmaceuticals on side for Obamacare some 13 years later; he let corporate America run roughshod over the Sherman Act, allowing Microsoft to bury Netscape, Intel to destroy AMD, you name it, and all this of course could only fuel the bubble even further.Fourth, Al Qaeda happened under Clinton. Nobody talks about it, but it's entirely true. While he was busy putting together the crappy Oslo deal that contained the seeds of the Intifada, failing to put together a potentially better Camp David deal and buddying up with Jerry Adams (OK, I'm being unfair, peace in Ireland was a major achievement and he was part of it), he totally took his eyes off THE BIG ONE, even though the first WTC bombings happened three years into his Presidency.Also, he redefined the term ""sleazy"" (starting with the campaign he led against my compatriot Paul Tsongas for the nomination), makes Bill Cosby look like a good husband and a pillar of society, can't say no to free money (e.g. letting Refco give up good trades to his wife, charging a quarter million to speak, or charging out Chelsea on 80k if he can't make it himself), used the presidential pardon to absolve Marc freaking Rich, the man just can't help himself. I died laughing the other day when I saw his paws all over that supermarket heiress who'd just divorced Nixon's grandson. You know who I'm talking about, the one with the massive you-know-whats.That said, the points I lay out above are mere detail.My main problem with William Jefferson Clinton is the following: Politics is a game of see-saw. The essence of a stable society is that the government must alternate between the left and the right. When one party stays in charge for too long, it gets entrenched and forces the entire society toward an accommodation that proves to be disastrous. You get dead ends such as we find in Italy / Mexico / Japan and with denouements such as we are currently observing in Venezuela. BY DINT OF BEING A RIGHT-WINGER IN ALL BY RHETORIC, CLINTON BEQUEATHED US 28 YEARS IN A ROW OF SO CALLED ""FREE-MARKET"" / DEREGULATORY POLICY which coincided with the ""second machine age"" heralded by the general adoption of the personal computer as well as the ""End of History"" Zeitgeist that followed the fall of the Soviet Union and may have caused permanent damage to the fabric of American society and American democracy. That is, I believe, Clinton's disastrous legacy.Bernard was unmoved by my arguments. He still thinks I'll vote for Hillary. Hell, if she's running against Romney rather than Jeb I even might. (I really hope Bernard does not read my reviews, or that he only reads the first and last paragraph like most sane people do!)So I sought out help in the shape of Christopher Hitchens' classic anti-Clinton polemic, which I hadn't read before, presumably because at the time I did not have that big a beef against Clinton.The main premise of the book is captured in the following quote (p.60):""In the critical days of his impeachment struggle, Mr Clinton was often said to be worried sick about this place in history. That place, however is already secure. He will be remembered as the man who used the rhetoric of the New Democrat to undo the New Deal."" He adds further down in the book that ""In power he has completed the Reagan counter-revolution and made the state into a perennial friend of those who are already rich and secure."" (p. 94)The actual aim of the book, however, is more ambitious. It is to prove that ""Personal crookery on the one hand and the cowardice and conservatism on the other are indissolubly related,"" (p. xxiii) in other words that the outcome was the result of a Faustian pact ""Clinton the crook"" had to make to stay in power. In Hitchens' words, again, ""the traditional handling of the relation between populism and elitism involves achieving a point of balance between those who support you and those whom you support."" (p.6)Exhibit 1 is Robert Reich's take on welfare reform under Clinton. In the words of his Labor Secretary ""The original idea had been to smooth the passage from welfare to work with guaranteed health care, child care, job training and a job paying enough to live on. The 1996 legislation contained none of these supports. In effect, what was dubbed welfare reform merely ended the promise of help to the indigent and their children that Franklin D Roosevelt had initiated more than sixty years before. In short, being tough on welfare was more important than being correct about welfare."" (p.9) A quote from Hillary leaves no doubt that looking tough was paramount to the Clintons: ""Our liberal friends are just going to understand that we have to go for welfare reform - for eliminating the welfare entitlement. They are just going to have to get used to it. I am not going to listen to them or be sympathetic to them."" (p. 160)Exhibit 2 is Hillarycare. Here Hitchens alleges that the main beneficiaries would have been Aetna, Prudential, MetLife, Cigna and Travelers at the expense of the myriads of smaller, independent health insurers, the ones who fought tooth and nail against the reforms through the famous ""Harry and Louise"" ads. He quotes Robert Dreyfus of the Physicians for a National Health Program saying ""The Clintons are getting away with murder by portraying themselves as opponents of the insurance industry. It's only the small fry that oppose their plan. Under any managed competition scheme the small ones will be pushed out of the market very quickly."" I must confess I had no idea about this until I read the book. But I believe it. Hillary was at it most recently when she lined up the Pharma industry to stand behind Obamacare.From there we move to spinelessness. There's a chapter on Clinton's hypocrisy when it comes to his support of black people. Hitchens lists three Clinton allies who were left high and dry when it was no longer convenient to support them. I thought that was actually rather poorly argued. I don't think Clinton dropped these guys because they're black, he basically was the first president in a long line of presidents who will drop a strong candidate for a job if they can't get him through easily. Obama is certainly a lot worse than Clinton that way...By far the strongest chapter is entitled ""Clinton's War Crimes."" Hitchens focuses on three such ""war crimes,"" starting with the bombing of the pharmaceutical plant in Sudan during the Lewinsky hearings. He shows that all three claims made by Clinton to justify the bombing were false: it most certainly produced vital medicines, it most certainly did not produce building blocks for VX gas and it had nothing to do with Osama bin Laden. Moreover, the bombing destroyed the rapport local American agents had worked hard to build with the Sudanese government. Similarly, the Afghanistan bombings of the same vintage were totally unjustified and ineffective. As for the Baghdad bombings, Hitchens not only calls into question the purpose and effectiveness of the strike, but reveals that ""a much less questionable airstrike was cancelled because at that time Clinton needed to keep an ""option"" in his breast pocket."" (p. 117)Another chapter is dedicated to proving that ""we have a rapist in the White House"" and I must say it is rather convincing.With all that said, and while the book has given me tons of reasons to reinforce my feelings against the Clintons, I don't see how the sleaze and lack of morals are one and the same as the ""Triangulation"" of ""making promises to the Left while delivering to the Right."" From more recent history, Dominique Strauss Kahn is quite clearly not a man with terribly much respect for women, but he was a very principled politician. Kennedy and FDR spring to mind too, though they were less forceful about their conquests.Basically, the book failed to convince me that ""Personal crookery on the one hand and the cowardice and conservatism on the other are indissolubly related."" But it was a fun read nonetheless. And on p. 148 it has this awesome little gem of a put-down for the 2016 Democratic frontrunner:""Speaking of where things lie, she can in a close contest keep up with her husband for mendacity. Like him, she is not just a liar, but a lie.""Ouch!","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2P6BBQFIISI4L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007NJOR3M#wasThisHelpful","R2P6BBQFIISI4L","A2ZK9VNGT3HE2I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ZK9VNGT3HE2I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Laughing is a social thing. Its something you do with other people, or at the very least in their presence. Something needs to be positively hilarious to make you laugh by yourself or alone in the company of strangers in the tube. This book is so funny it had me doing exactly that more than once. It is hilarious.So heres me in the tube on my way to work starting this book and on page 8 I find out that the ultimate spellchecker booby trap is none other than the Nordic invader of Britain, king Cnut (Canute to you and me).That set the tone. From then on it got funnier.The research is superficial. If a high school student had submitted this volume of work as a research paper I would have given him an B+ and if a college Senior had pretended this was his research thesis I would have given him either the lowest passing grade (and him and I would share that joke for the rest of our lives) or an outright F, as in fail. And given the author has interviewed a good twenty luminaries from around Scandinavia to produce this 400 page volume I think I can state with some certainty that he was doing an Ali G on them. He lives there, of course, he needs to pretend this was research, but all that research has been done a thousand times.And thats the whole point. If you are a car fanatic you dont watch Top Gear. Its only tangentially about cars, even though it invites car people regularly and involves lots of driving. The program is about Jeremy Clarkson doing very embarrassing (but car-themed) stuff in a very embarrassing way. And its unbelievably funny in a very British way.Thats the spirit of this book. The author interviews professors, researchers and politicians and puts to them theories along the lines of you Swedish are trying to atone for taking the German side in WWII and the poor fellows take him seriously rather than kick him out the door. And the prose is just unbelievably funny.Its not a serious or a necessary book and you would not miss it if it had never been written. Its nowhere near as informative as buying the five separate Xenophobes Guides and reading them back to back. It's a hilariously set list of hunches and prejudices of a leftward-leaning, Nordic-loving Brit. Which makes it a cracking read.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2S0ZMVTXUWLJ0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FZLTYPQ#wasThisHelpful","R2S0ZMVTXUWLJ0","A2ZK9VNGT3HE2I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ZK9VNGT3HE2I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My friend Matt recommended this book. Matts a quiet genius with very well-defined musical taste and he plays in a band. Also, he recommended to me Le Freak by Nile Rodgers which I read and loved, so I thought nothing of taking another recommendation from him.The book arrived and, to my pleasant surprise, a quote from Ben Goldacre featured on the front cover saying By far the best book this year. Brilliant, discursive and wise. Ben Goldacre is, of course, the author of Bad Pharma, which I also read and loved and 2012 was a good vintage for books, so that made it two solid recommendations.Thus encouraged, I set about reading this little book and some seventy pages into it I thought it was utter drivel. Not just average, run of the mill, garden variety drivel, but drivel of the highest (lowest?) order. So I put it to one side.I got sacked from my job in February, but did not get around to organizing my leaving drinks till December. Matt turned up and I confronted him about the book. I even tried to couch my criticism by saying I totally loved the Freak book, but I have no idea what that KLF book was all about, Ive kind of given up on it some 70 pages into it.Ah, thats the better book, actually, you just need to persevere a bit, Matt advised me.I really really respect Matts views on all sorts of issues (mainly to do with bond trading and desk politics, admittedly, but also music) so I concluded it must be me. Also, my worst fears about the book, that its a compilation of quackery mixed with the odd musical reference, were assuaged by the fact that Ben Goldacre is quite possibly the best known British crusader against quackery.It had to be me.So I packed the book into my backpack for this past weekends trip to Greece.And now Ive read it.I must confess it did not leave me totally unmoved. Rather, it transported me back in time, a good 25 years. It brought me back to my days in college.Not any days either. More like the nights, in fact. Those nights when I was unlucky enough to be semi-unconscious on a couch while an inebriated loser has been spouting cod philosophy inspired by the latest science class hes taking and mixing it with the little philosophy he thinks he knows, more often than not in the direction of some girl who decided a half hour ago to give him the benefit of the doubt and is patiently waiting for him to be done talking and solicit her preference of his room or hers. Except this was worse, and there wasnt a noble cause involved, so to speak. It was me on a plane and valuable reading time being wasted that will never come back.The book is a gauche attempt to weave together the story of a band (about which I actually learned very little, but perhaps and in retrospect more than I needed to) with an eclectic mix of incongruous, incoherent and poorly stitched together theories about art, psychology, alchemy, magic and (Im serious) the world financial crisis of 2008. It is the worst book Ive ever finished out of, dont know, more than 500, perhaps 1000, Ive never tried to count.I resolved to publish as soon as I got off the plane, to make sure my fury at having wasted my reading time is undiminished:The one star I am assigning to this book is a total insult to the other two books Ive given one star to. This is a zero star book.No more Ben Goldacre books either. Might have to revise how I feel about Bad Pharma at this point. I guess Matt remains a good friend, but no more book recommendations from him.","1.0 out of 5 stars","January 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R26SCVF1EL99WB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EEBDFA8#wasThisHelpful","R26SCVF1EL99WB","A2ZK9VNGT3HE2I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ZK9VNGT3HE2I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"***Review posted on The Eater of Books! blog***Menagerie by Rachel VincentBook One of the Menagerie seriesPublisher: MIRA (Harlequin)Publication Date: September 29, 2015Rating: 3 starsSource: eARC from NetGalley***Warning: this is an adult book, and for the eyes of mature readers***Summary (from Goodreads):From New York Times bestselling author Rachel Vincent comes a richly imagined, provocative new series set in the dark mythology of the MenagerieWhen Delilah Marlow visits a famous traveling carnival, Metzger's Menagerie, she is an ordinary woman in a not-quite-ordinary world. But under the macabre circus black-top, she discovers a fierce, sharp-clawed creature lurking just beneath her human veneer. Captured and put on exhibition, Delilah in her black swan burlesque costume is stripped of her worldly possessions, including her own name, as she's forced to ""perform"" in town after town.But there is breathtaking beauty behind the seamy and grotesque reality of the carnival. Gallagher, her handler, is as kind as he is cryptic and strong. The other ""attractions""mermaids, minotaurs, gryphons and kelpiesare strange, yes, but they share a bond forged by the brutal realities of captivity. And as Delilah struggles for her freedom, and for her fellow menagerie, she'll discover a strength and a purpose she never knew existed.Renowned author Rachel Vincent weaves an intoxicating blend of carnival magic and startling humanity in this intricately woven and powerful tale.What I Liked:Super long review coming your way, people. No apologies.If you all were watching my Twitter and Goodreads feeds on Tursday (August 18th), you saw my slight meltdown/very strong reaction to what I had read so far at that point. At only a fourth into the book, I was horrified and disgusted, and very, very disturbed. I was on the verge of putting this one down for good (and I NEVER stop reading a book I start), putting a note on NetGalley explaining my failure to finish, and move on with my life.Obviously that wasn't the outcome with this book. I went one to read another 50%, and called it a night at 75%. I finished up this book on Wednesday at work. I've decided that I absolutely LOVED the second half of the book, but the first half really marred the book overall. So, three stars! This is my first Rachel Vincent novel (adult or YA), and while I didn't completely love it, I'm glad I stuck it out and muscled through this one.Delilah is a seemingly normal woman, with a boring boyfriend and great friends and a loving mom. When Delilah, her boyfriend, and two friends go to Metzger's Menagerie, the carnival of beasts, including a Minotaur, sirens, werewolves, etc. While there, she sees one of the handlers goading one a werewolf girl, and Delilah reacts. By sinking her claws into the handler. Claws? What claws? It turns out, Delilah is one of those creatures, though no one knows what kind. She is bought by Metzger's, and she is stripped of all human rights she used to enjoy. But Delilah starts to get to know the other ""attractions"" of the carnival, and she finds that she wants to help them, despite not being able to help herself. Delilah may be imprisoned, bruised, abused, but she discovers something about herself that she never knew, and will stop at nothing to get her freedom back and win the freedom of all the others.See my notes below on the first half of the book. It was ROUGH. However, once I got past the things that were disturbing and horrifying - human captivity, forced labor/slavery, sexual harassment, torture, abuse, etc. - I started to get into the story. I feel like a complete psycho for saying ""once I got past _______"" (i.e. horrible things), but at some point around the 50%, I guess I got desensitized? No, that's not true. At 75%, I was like, okay, things have gotten even more disturbing. But also really intriguing and slightly hopeful!The tone of this book is incredibly dark and hopeless, emphasis on the ""hopeless"" part for at least two-thirds of the book, maybe three-fourths. While I absolutely hated seeing Delilah tortured and abused the way she was, I have to say, Vincent did an incredible job of writing this tone and showing the brutality of this particular world. I felt just abut as enraged and panicked and filled with despair as Delilah, which shows how well Vincent dug into the character and the story!The world-building is incredible, though as I keep saying, it is disturbing. In this world, humans are afraid of surrogates, human-looking monsters. They're afraid of monsters and creatures in general. Delilah has no rights as whatever she is, not even to her clothes. One of the most disturbing scenes was when she had to strip in front of the handlers. Male handlers who were looking in more than one way - not just to see what she is. She is always chained, so any handler can do whatever he wants with her. You see what I'm saying about disturbing? I have to hand it to Vincent though, she really wrote this well. Disturbing, but the world-building is so exquisitely crafted. The carnival has all the mystique and appeal, but behind the scenes, it is a hopeless and cruel place.Again, the world-building is spot-on. Despite the fact that I struggled with how disturbing things were (see below), I have to say, the world-building was so well done. I couldn't have been so disturbed if the author had toned it down, right?I really like Delilah, so so much. She finds out she isn't human by sinking claws into his head, and then gets arrested, and then stripped, and then sold, and then has to do humiliating things like strip again, eat disgusting meat, live in a teeny tiny cage, hold her bladder for days. One handler takes every opportunity he can to abuse her in some way, and my heart broke every time. This is why I couldn't keep reading - I hated seeing Delilah suffer, her dignity lost, pride on its way. The thing is, Delilah kept struggling. She kept fighting. She never let them break her, though they hurt her over and over. Delilah is determined, even if she knows no way to escape.Her main handler is Gallagher, who was there when she was bought for Metzger's. He isn't cruel and abusive, and he goes out of his way to protect her and not to hurt her. Of course Delilah suspects the worst - how could she not? He wants something from her, right? Gallagher is actually a decent person. When you read this book, stay on his side and cheer him on! I lived for the scenes between him and Delilah. There is nothing romantic going on (yet???), no hints, but they seem to know each other without knowing, understand each other on some level. I love Gallagher and I love his role in this novel. He is critical to this story, don't underestimate him!The tone gets a little more hopeful as we slowly start to know Gallagher and his mind. I can't say too much, but I am happy with the direction of the plot after we finally figure out more and more about Gallagher - and Delilah. The two of them are a great pair, and I felt better about the story, knowing that they were on the same side.The ending is excellent! I am pleased with the ending, even if it ended a bit twisted. Maybe I really am a psychopath. In any case, the ending could have been much worse, so I appreciate that reprieve. I don't think my heart could have taken any more!What I Did Not Like:Clearly I liked a lot of things about this book. But it took me a looooong time to appreciate those things. The world-building? I HATED it initially. This book is disturbing on so many levels. I hated seeing Delilah go from average human to less than dirt. Suddenly, it doesn't matter if she's naked, or cold, or scared, or has a human appearance, or can speak. What matters is that she is a cryptid (creature), and once they figure out what she is, they can start breeding her (oh, yes). This part almost made me sick - but not to worry, this isn't a part of the story for Delilah. This is introduced with another character.There were so many disturbing scenes in this book. I wanted to shred Clyde (a handler) for abusing Delilah. She is always chained, and of course, it's really easy to do things to a person who is chained. Everyone treats Delilah like filth (with the exception of the other cryptids), so they think they can do anything with her. This broke my heart, over and over. You see why I was disturbed? One thing you don't need to worry about is rape, in terms of Delilah. Not ruling it out for other characters.There are mentions of forced breeding and rape, FYI. Also violence. Hence my adult warning at the beginning of the book. It's mostly because of the violence in this book.Still, like I previously said, Vincent did a great job with making this book so incredibly disturbing. But... it hurt. One of the secondary characters, Genni, is the absolute worst off. But if Vincent had made this book lighter on all the torture and abuse and captivity treatment and whatnot, it wouldn't have been as powerful a novel.One thing that I didn't understand was the newspaper articles and snippets, at the beginning of each perspective/chapter (by the way, there are many perspectives, all in third person, except's Delilah's, in first person). I don't know what they contribute to the story. They're about the scare with cryptids and surrogates that occurred years ago, but they don't seem to add to the plot. Perhaps foreshadowing? Or world-building? I'm not sure. I started to skip them after a while.So, once you ""get used to"" the disturbing stuff, you'll enjoy the story. The faster you can stomach it (and Vincent has it going for more than half the book), the easier the book gets to read. It was NOT an easy read, by any means. *clutches tatters of heart*Would I Recommend It:You know, despite my rating, it does seem like I enjoyed the book, right? I hope I can convince someone to read this one, and not dissuade (although, if you can't handle the disturbing stuff I mentioned above, definitely SKIP this book). I want you all to know my issues with this book, and while they marred the rating and enjoyment for me, I'm glad I picked up this novel. Vincent fans will probably like this one (how would I know, I've never read any of her other novels!), but anyone who doesn't mind dark, sinister, and disturbing fantasy set in a modern-day world will be intrigued and captured by this novel. ADULT BOOK, OKAY?!Rating:3.5 stars -> rounded down to 3 stars. Definitely on the positive end of 3 stars. But I can't give this novel 4 stars, knowing just how much I struggled with it for about half the book, even a little more than that. It is my first Vincent novel and hopefully the sequel will be my next one. Although I am totally scared of the sequel... if it's anything as disturbing as this book, I might need therapy!","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R39V9MZWH2FA35/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=077831605X#wasThisHelpful","R39V9MZWH2FA35","A3KR1H0TMY05U4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3KR1H0TMY05U4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"***Review posted on The Eater of Books! blog***Six of Crows by Leigh BardugoBook One of the Six of Crows seriesPublisher: Henry Holt and CompanyPublication Date: September 29, 2015Rating: 4 starsSource: ARC gifted (thank you, Kel!)Summary (from Goodreads):Ketterdam: a bustling hub of international trade where anything can be had for the right priceand no one knows that better than criminal prodigy Kaz Brekker. Kaz is offered a chance at a deadly heist that could make him rich beyond his wildest dreams. But he can't pull it off alone...A convict with a thirst for revenge.A sharpshooter who can't walk away from a wager.A runaway with a privileged past.A spy known as the Wraith.A Heartrender using her magic to survive the slums.A thief with a gift for unlikely escapes.Six dangerous outcasts. One impossible heist. Kaz's crew is the only thing that might stand between the world and destructionif they don't kill each other first.What I Liked:Okay, fine. The hype for this book is totally justified. Whether you read Bardugo's Grisha trilogy or not, whether you enjoyed it or not, you could easily fall in love with Six of Crows. On that note, you do not need to have read - or even liked - the Grisha trilogy. It's not necessary at all! The Grisha references are the setting, the locations and places. No characters make cameos (that I remember - but I'm shaky on my Grisha knowledge sometimes), nothing dire you needed to know from the Grisha trilogy. Set in the same world, but in totally different places, with totally different characters.Kaz Brekker is the most dangerous person in the Barrel, in Ketterdam. He is a gifted thief with an insatiable desire for money, and for solving puzzles and having all the tricks. He always has the drop on everyone, and he takes very risky risks that always seem to work in his favor. When Kaz is presented an opportunity with a large payout and even great risks, he has no other choice but to take it. He and five other unique individuals embark on a job, an impossible heist, to capture one thing and bring it back. But getting into the Ice Court is suicide, and getting there might prove even more perilous before the job has even begun.I think the thing that I liked the most about this book is that the tone of the book isn't gloom and doom, save the world, martyr or die trying kind of tone, like in Shadow and Bone/Siege and Storm/Ruin and Rising. It's not Alina fighting within herself on whether or not she should obtain all the amplifiers to defeat the Darkling. It's not all about destroying something. No, the tone of this book was so much more... adventurous than Bardugo's previous trilogy. I wouldn't necessarily say more ""fun"", because there is no way I'd describe this book as fun like it's some lighthearted adventure novel, but it is certainly more reader-friendly, with less heartache and gloom and doom, and more laugh-out-loud, head-spinning action.I absolutely adore the cast of characters. Kaz is definitely my favorite, but all six protagonists get their fair share of page time. This book is written in third-person perspectives, each chapter written in a different character's perspective. Kaz is my favorite, because he is so tricksy and smart, mysterious and surprising, unpredictable and more caring than he would ever let on. I personally think he is the most fleshed-out character, and the most likable. There is something about him that is cold and hard, and it's really appealing. He is also HILARIOUS, with a great sense of dry humor. But then he is deadly and quite the murderous thief. We see so many sides of him, and I love and/or am intrigued by all of them.The other characters are equally as interesting! Inej is the Wraith, able to move basically without being heard. She is light on her feet and quick. Kaz saved her years ago, and she has worked with him since. The same with Jesper - he's worked with Kaz for years, and is basically Kaz's second-in-command. Jesper is such a flirt! And I love him. He is all about his guns, whereas Inej is all about her knives. Next is Nina, a Healer/Heartrender, who has been trying to have her former friend Matthias freed from prison for years. Matthias is the fifth person, a convict who is out for Nina's blood. He used to hunt Grisha before he was thrown in prison, but he especially wants to strangle Nina because she is the one who put him in prison. Lucky for himself, he is from the area that the Ice Court is located, so he is useful to Kaz, and Kaz springs him. Lastly is Wylan, the son of the merchant who wants the thing from the Ice Court brought back. Wylan is seen as weak, but he proves himself to be quite clever and useful. He is so cute!I know what you all are thinking - SIX characters?! Six perspectives?! Third person, which is cool, but SIX?! Sounds like a recipe for disaster, like in Legacy of Kings by Eleanor Herman. However, not so! Since the six characters in Six of Crows are basically always with each other (once they're gathered), it's not like there are six plots happening. It's one, with six cars on the road, instead of six lanes or six exits or merging areas or something. You all love my analogies, I know! But really, there isn't six different plots and six different locations and six different schemes happening. It's one, with six different brains and hearts. Very different from Legacy of Kings, which was confusing with all of its perspectives and plots.There are so many action-packed scenes! There is no shortage of crazy action and high stakes. You'll hold your breath during so many scenes, hoping and praying and crossing your fingers that Kaz doesn't screw things up (and really, he always has a plan). Bardugo did an amazing thing, in which she wrote the book from third person, so we are not privy to any of the characters' inner thoughts at all times. Hence why Kaz can pull off all that craziness and surprising the readers! My heart stopped several times, hoping there was another way that Kaz considered. He is so clever!Like I said above, I really liked the change in tone of this new series by Bardugo. Don't get me wrong, things get very ""everyone-is-going-to-die-if-we-don't-do-something"", but it's more like a ""hold-on-we're-in-for-a-crazy-ride"" kind of thing. The story is very intriguing, and the 400+ pages fly by. I will say that the first 50 pages took me a bit to get into, but once I was in, I was hooked.ROMANCE. Well. There are six people in the group... and, as you might guess, there are three pairs. No love triangles AT ALL. Three linear relationships. And the other nice thing - the romances in this book are barely there. Sure, the author does an amazing job of hinting more-than-friendships, or when a character is acting really friendly with another, or just plain old hints. But there are no steamy romance scenes or even passing romantic scenes. I really like this, because it's Bardugo's way of giving the romances time to grow. There are three sets of romances, on their own wavelengths. Different starts to each romance. Each can develop in books two and three!Overall, I really enjoyed this book. I was wary, because the Grisha trilogy was just ""okay"" for me, and the hype for this book was/is pretty crazy. HOWEVER. I liked it and I personally think the hype is warranted. This book is so different from the Grisha trilogy! In great ways!What I Did Not Like:Like I said before, the beginning of this book was a bit slow, and it took me a while to really get invested. About 50 pages or so. Basically, once the six of them are actually gathered together, THEN things start to get really good. This might have been closer to around 100 pages in, but you get the idea.Would I Recommend It:For anyone looking for an adventure (yay Bilbo), definitely give this book a chance! Make it your first Bardugo read. I personally think it's Bardugo's best book to date, but I know others really, really enjoyed the Grisha trilogy. Shadow and Bone was my favorite of that series, but I think Six of Crows is better. It's a fantasy novel with a lot of action, high stakes, developed and fun characters, and well-placed humor!Rating:4 stars. A huge thanks to Kel from Booked Til Tuesday for passing her ARC to me. If you all get a chance, give this book a shot! If anything, the cover is gorgeous and would look great on your bookshelf!","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R38L8SVHDPHAXE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1627792120#wasThisHelpful","R38L8SVHDPHAXE","A3KR1H0TMY05U4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3KR1H0TMY05U4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"***Review posted on The Eater of Books! blog***Silver Eve by Sandra WaughBook Two of the Guardians of Tarnec seriesPublisher: Random House Children's BooksPublication Date: September 22, 2015Rating: 4 starsSource: Review copy sent by the publisherSummary (from Goodreads):A Healer without home or purpose, seventeen-year-old Evie Carew has found the perfect place to disappear: Rood Marsh. She can easily fade into its vast wilderness of towering reeds; leave behind the growing violence that is claiming her innocent world. Leave behind the tragedy that broke her heart and sent her far from her grandmother, cousin Lark and all she once loved.But Evie is not alone in the marsh. A seer, a Rider, and Breeders of Chaos all hunt herfor though opposed in objective, her seekers share knowledge she does not: Evie is one of the four Guardians of Tarnec, one who can help save the world from the coming destruction if she can reclaim the stolen amulet of Death. But whether she meets true love or a brutal end on such a journey is a matter of who finds her first.What I Liked:The publicity letter accompanying this review copy mentioned that this book was for fans of Juliet Marillier and Kristin Cashore - two extremely popular ladies in fantasy. Cashore is my favorite author, and author of my favorite book ever (Fire). I've only read one of Marillier's books (Dreamer's Pool), and I loved it. But my point to all of this - usually I dislike lofty comparisons, but I think this comparison really worked. If you've read anything written by Cashore or Marillier, there is a VERY good chance that you'll enjoy this fantasy series.Evie Carew, Healer and the cousin of Lark (protagonist of Lark Rising) has been wandering, not sure of what she seeks, healing people from different villages as she goes. A seer gives her a cryptic prophecy, and then she is rescued by a Rider after she successfully weaves a disastrous spell. Breeders of Chaos are after her. She and Laurent must find the amulet of Death - and protect it - before everyone she loves perishes and the Balance is forever lost.In Lark Rising, we meet Lark, the Guardian of Life. Evie is her cousin, and she finds out that she is the Guardian of Death. While Lark is slightly more timid, Evie is more outspoken, more vocal about her curiosities. Evie is also heartbroken at the end of Lark Rising, as the boy she loved died. But in death, her one connection to Laurent was formed - he was the one that killed the Troth that killed Raif. I like how complex Evie is; in the beginning, she is definitely lost and aimless. By the end, she is driven, by loyalty and love, protectiveness and a sense of rightness. There is a sadness in Evie, something that doesn't just disappear. Yet she still fights on, in her own way.Laurent is so dreamy! Like Gharain, he is a Rider, and a Guardian's Complement. He is stubborn and loyal, always protective of Evie, but cognizant of when to leave her. Evie is a Healer, and often insists that she need not know how to kill (or to kill anyone), but Laurent is always there for her, and not just for protection. He is so patient and and fierce, but he has such a calm disposition. I really like Laurent! He is an amazing Complement, Rider, friend, and then some.At first this book seems a bit aimless (like Evie) - Evie doesn't even know that she is a Guardian. She left home shortly after Lark showed up at the end of Lark Rising, heartbroken over Raif. What kicks this story into gear is a prophecy, a spell, and the appearance of Laurent. Never a dull moment in this book! Sandra Waugh takes us through many different locations, in search of the amulet, as well as the twists that occur after the amulet is located. I fear for so many characters!Which leads me to the ending - this book ended in a surprising way! It is VERY clear that this series really is not a companion series any more. I think the author is writing each of the four books from the perspective of each of the Guardians (Life, Death, Light, and Dark), so the next book will be written in the perspective of the Guardian of Light or the Guardian of Darkness. The ending is a cliffhanger for sure! It's bittersweet, yet a good ""hook"" ending. I already wanted to read the next two books, but after that ending, yes indeed!Romance - the romance was just as sweet as Lark and Gharain's romance in Lark Rising! I think I liked Lark and Gharain more, but then, not much is getting close to that book, for me. It was nice to see Evie move past Raif's death. Also, her and Laurent are a sweet couple. The romance is slow-burn and tender, not demonstrative but very swoony. No love triangle, also. Romance is never a central part of these books in the series, yet the romance is one of my favorite parts. Love!What I Did Not Like:I can't say there was anything I specifically didn't like. Perhaps the ending - it is quite the cliffhanger! I hate cliffhanger endings. But I know there are two more novels in this series, and I know Waugh would not steer us wrong, so I'm trusting her.I loved this book, though you'll notice my rating isn't as perfect as that of Lark Rising's. Honestly, Lark Rising was so SO good, and not much is touching that one. It was a favorite of 2014. So this book getting a lower star isn't because it was ""worse"" - it's because Lark Rising was THAT good. If that makes sense!Would I Recommend It:I would highly recommend this sequel, as well as the series in general. Definitely a favorite series, and I must agree with the comparisons of ""for fans of Marillier, Cashore"". I love Kristin Cashore and Juliet Marillier, and we can definitely put Sandra Waugh's name in there too. If you love fantasy (of the high/epic variety), definitely give this series a chance!Rating:4 stars. Gorgeous book, gorgeous story! I need more from the Guardians of Tarnec series. And I am so anxious to see who the next Guardian is! A year could not pass soon enough!","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R21CYDZ6OCJ6BG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0449817520#wasThisHelpful","R21CYDZ6OCJ6BG","A3KR1H0TMY05U4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3KR1H0TMY05U4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"***Review posted on The Eater of Books! blog***The Scorpion Rules by Erin BowPublisher: Margaret K. McElderry BooksPublication Date: September 22, 2015Rating: 1 starSource: ARC sent by the publisherSummary (from Goodreads):A world battered by climate shift and war turns to an ancient method of keeping peace: the exchange of hostages. The Children of Peace - sons and daughters of kings and presidents and generals - are raised together in small, isolated schools called Prefectures. There, they learn history and political theory, and are taught to gracefully accept what may well be their fate: to die if their countries declare war.Greta Gustafsen Stuart, Duchess of Halifax and Crown Princess of the Pan-Polar Confederation, is the pride of the North American Prefecture. Learned and disciplined, Greta is proud of her role in keeping the global peace  even though, with her country controlling two-thirds of the worlds most war-worthy resource  water  she has little chance of reaching adulthood alive.Enter Elin Palnik, the Prefectures newest hostage and biggest problem. Gretas world begins to tilt the moment she sees Elin dragged into the school in chains. The Prefectures insidious surveillance, its small punishments and rewards, can make no dent in Elin, who is not interested in dignity and tradition, and doesnt even accept the right of the UN to keep hostages.What will happen to Elin and Greta as their two nations inch closer to war?What I Liked:I think this might be a huge case of ""it's not you, it's me"". Or maybe it IS the book. I don't know. The ratings on Goodreads are very polarizing (at least, in my mutual friend group - but even outside of that group). To be honest, I wasn't really interested in this book. If the publisher hadn't sent an ARC, I wouldn't have read it. I don't make a habit of reading unsolicited review copies, but given the massive amount of flailing that people were/are doing over this book, I decided to give it a shot.Read on.What I Did Not Like:I gave this book a shot. It failed. Epically. And to be honest, there is no venom or sting in my one-star rating. I just couldn't think of a single thing I liked. I wasn't overly upset over this one, or disappointed. It was so meh and blah, and I couldn't recommend it to anyone (if you hadn't heard of it before, keep walking).I know some people liked the beginning but found the ending lacking. And some people loved the ending but found the beginning slow. For me, I found the entire book dry and boring, so there was no one part that I absolutely hated or absolutely loved. I will say, I had an easier time reading the beginning - the first one hundred pages. But keep in mind, this is largely due to the fact that I knew NOTHING about this book before reading it. So the first hundred pages were boring... but I still had hopes that maybe I was just tired, or it would pick up soon.It never picked up. And I got even more tired, even as I got more awake (I had started this book on a car ride around 8:30 am, but picked it back up around 2:00 pm). This book was draining me, and not because it was so exciting or action-packed or emotionally investing. No, I was bored.Maybe I never got into the world-building. This book is set waaaay into the future, in which the heir children of royalty are taken hostage, and killed when their parents go to war with another country or territory. It's just the way things are. This wasn't really interesting or intriguing to me. Greta, the protagonist, lives in constant fear of her mother declaring war on someone else.When Elin is brought to the hostage group as a hostage, there is a shift in... something. He is all about escaping and breaking the way things are. He refuses to be a ""good hostage"".Something about that alone seems cliche. Of course one day a boy shows up and changes everything. While it's totally true that one action can change the course of history... I just wasn't feeling it, in this book. Basically, I wasn't feeling this book?I almost DNF after about 150 pages. I skim-read a HUGE CHUNK of the book, at least 100 pages after the 150 already read. I just didn't read it with as much care. I didn't want to DNF, because I still held onto the hope that it would get better. It didn't. I can't say anything about the plot specifically because that would be a call for spoilers but... I didn't really get into the action. Once the hostage situation ""disappeared"", the book lost its appeal. Not that it had any appeal to begin with (FOR ME).The romance also killed things a bit for me. There is a love triangle going on in this book. That's bad enough, right? But the thing is, the author has you thinking that the protagonist is going to fall for one person, and spends a lot of page time showing these two making moon eyes at each other or whatever. But then the author introduces another leg in the romance (hence, the triangle), and switches gears. So it's like we're deceived into falling for Greta + person A, because then Greta turns to person B. I honestly didn't care if the person Greta loved was person A or person B. But I don't like falling for one ship, only for the other ship to be the successful one. If that makes sense?Because the thing is, in this book, I couldn't care less who she loved. Both of the love interests were dull, cliche, and uninteresting. One of them was supposed to be the ""bad boy"", the new guy, the one who changes the thinking of the protagonist. The other love interest was the steady rock, the best friend since forever. Two very cliche roles, and two very boring romances. Neither was swoony, and I picked the wrong one, the one I liked more. The fact that I had to ""pick"" is BS (I like it when there is one love interest and one only!).Are you getting a lot of meh vibes from me? That's because this book was solid meh. I almost wish I could be like, I HATED THIS BOOK UUUUGGGHHH!, because then there would be some passion in this review.The ending is so confusing! Heck, the whole book is, after a point. Kind of abrupt too, and weird. It gets so weird. I don't know if the author really fleshed out the plot. Like, THREE things happen in this book. Not a lot going on! Which, well, supports the meh feeling. MEH.And to make matters worse, this book appears to be a standalone. I feel like a sequel would maybe lift my rating a notch, only because at least I could tell myself that some of my confusion and questions could be addressed in another book. Nope nope nope. Not according to this PW rights report!Would I Recommend It:I really can't recommend this book. It's dystopia, but it's just weird. And not a good weird. A boring weird that doesn't get better. A boring weird that needs a lot of development on all fronts. I don't even know what I read. I skim-read about half of it, which is extremely rare! If you were already excited about this one, then you should definitely read it. If not, skip!Rating:1 star. Really, this rating is reflecting the amount of things I actually liked about this book (i.e. nothing). It's not that I hated everything. It's just that I didn't like anything. If that makes sense. It's all in the subtleties! Or something.","1.0 out of 5 stars","September 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1OV0EVA7G5W4M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1481442716#wasThisHelpful","R1OV0EVA7G5W4M","A3KR1H0TMY05U4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3KR1H0TMY05U4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"***Review posted on The Eater of Books! blog***Walk on Earth a Stranger by Rae CarsonBook One of The Gold Seer TrilogyPublisher: Greenwillow BooksPublication Date: September 22, 2015Rating: 3 starsSource: ARC sent by the publisherSummary (from Goodreads):The first book in a new trilogy from acclaimed New York Times bestselling author Rae Carson. A young woman with the magical ability to sense the presence of gold must flee her home, taking her on a sweeping and dangerous journey across Gold Rushera America.Lee Westfall has a secret. She can sense the presence of gold in the world around her. Veins deep beneath the earth, pebbles in the river, nuggets dug up from the forest floor. The buzz of gold means warmth and life and homeuntil everything is ripped away by a man who wants to control her. Left with nothing, Lee disguises herself as a boy and takes to the trail across the country. Gold was discovered in California, and where else could such a magical girl find herself, find safety? Rae Carson, author of the acclaimed Girl of Fire and Thorns trilogy, dazzles with this new fantasy that subverts both our own history and familiar fantasy tropes.Walk on Earth a Stranger, the first book in this new trilogy, introducesas only Rae Carson cana strong heroine, a perilous road, a fantastical twist, and a slow-burning romance. Includes a map and authors note on historical research.What I Liked:I absolutely ADORED Rae Carson's Fire & Thorns series. I'd read The Girl of Fire and Thorns before blogging (mid-2012), but read The Crown of Embers and The Bitter Kingdom as they were published. Such an agonizing wait for The Bitter Kingdom! I loved that the series got better with each book. I'm really hoping that the same will apply for this series.Leah Westfall can sense gold, which is a handy ability during the Gold Rush. No one knows about her ability excerpt her parents - and her uncle who murders her parents and tells Lee they will be heading West, him and her. Lee runs away, journeying to the West on her own. On the way, she joins a family - the Joyners - and a friend who also ran away - Jefferson - and it's not long before Lee feels like she has a place in the group that she's traveling with. But Lee has more secrets than one - she can sense gold, but she's also masquerading as a boy.Rae Carson has certainly created a unique and rich story, scene, and cast of characters. I haven't read many Westerns, or books set in nineteenth-century United States, in YA. I actually just read Vengeance Road by Erin Bowman, and it follows the EXACT PLOT (except Kate can't sense gold). Parents are killed (parent, in Kate's case), girl goes out on her own, gold is a huge factor in the story. I LOVED Vengeance Road, but I didn't quite love this one.Still, I was very interested in this story, from start to finish. Despite this book being slightly longer than most YA books (which doesn't bother me!), the story moves at a decent pace. I have a dislike about the pacing actually, but it's a little different (see below). I wasn't bored, even though the plot wasn't terribly fast.I liked Lee from the start. She is an only child, with no brother, so she does all of the labor that a boy would normally do, including mucking the stables and whatnot. She also pans for gold, since she has the gold sense. Lee takes care of her family, so when her parents are murdered, Lee knows that she can't let her uncle treat her like property. Lee is strong (and not just physically) and brave, brave enough to start her journey to California (from Georgia) by herself.Jefferson is her friend from Georgia, who leaves for the West before she does, just after her parents are murdered. The pair don't meet up until Lee reaches Independence (Missouri, I believe) with the Joyners. Jefferson is half-white, half-Native-American, and is used to people treating him terribly. He keeps Lee's secret about being a girl from everyone, but he doesn't know about her gold sense.Overall, I thought the story was interesting, maybe not engaging though (see below). I expect a lot more from the next books, which should be the case, given what I know about the Fire & Thorns series.What I Did Not Like:My biggest issue with this book is that I felt it was going nowhere. Lee is on a journey to the West, okay. But is that it? It really seemed like that was it. We REALLY get to know the people in the group she's traveling with (the Joyners, but also a few other family, and Major Craven, some college boys, and more). But there is no additional layer to the book. You'd think Lee's gold sense would come back to haunt her at some point, or Uncle Hiram would find her and kidnap her and force her to find gold. I don't know what I was expecting, but I think I expected MORE. This book was so one-dimensional, one-layered.Not to say that it was boring? But it moved in one direction, and that direction wasn't really anywhere. Going to the West. The end. Is the book about making friends along the way? Golly gee, I really don't think that's what I wanted to read, or expected to read. Given that her last series was a high fantasy one, I think I expected this book to have shenanigans going on.So I'd say the pacing was slow. Interesting, not terribly boring, but slow.Also, let's talk about anachronisms. Some of the speech and dialogue in this book were definitely anachronistic. I wish I had bookmarked where I saw these lines, but I didn't want to dog-ear my book! But I distinctly remember thinking, that sentence is way too modern, at least a few times. Not a huge deal, but not a good thing, necessarily.The ending felt so anticlimactic. I think this goes along the lines of what I was saying earlier, about the story being flat, but the ending felt like nothing really changed? Sure, there were plenty of deaths along the way, but the actual climax and ending didn't seem riveting or anything. It was just there. Just another day in the West. La la la.Also, isn't it strange that certain people caught up to the group in the West, while traveling? The West is a HUGE place... it seemed way too coincidental. Too convenient.This last thing I'm going to mention isn't *really* a complaint, but more of a comment for those like me who enjoy a good romance alongside a story - the romance isn't really a thing in this book. Sure, there are seeds, but not happens, nothing is going on. Just seeds. Please water them in the next book, Rae Carson. Knowing what I know about the Fire & Thorns series, I'm sure that will be the case.Would I Recommend It:Despite not loving this one, I'd recommend it! It's fun to read different genres, and Western historical fiction is definitely one that I don't read nearly enough. Granted, there aren't that many published in YA lit. Me reading two Westerns in one year is impressive, let alone two in two months! Even if you don't like Westerns, give this book a shot! I think things will pick up in the next book.Rating:3 stars. I hope to see more related to Lee's gold sense. I hope to see more once Lee and the gang reach California and tuck in. There needs to be more to the plot, because right now, this story isn't meaning much to me! Still, I am interested in the next book, as I trust Rae Carson.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2HJHZT3PJMCH1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062242911#wasThisHelpful","R2HJHZT3PJMCH1","A3KR1H0TMY05U4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3KR1H0TMY05U4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"***Review posted on The Eater of Books! blog***Led Astray by Kelley ArmstrongPublisher: Tachyon PublicationsPublication Date: September 15, 2015Rating: 4 starsSource: eARC from NetGalleySummary (from Goodreads):Two brand new tales anchor this wide-ranging collection from one of urban fantasy's most successful authors. Here is the first time that best-selling fantasy, YA, and crime author Kelley Armstrong has had her stories collected from Otherworld and beyond. With her signature twists and turns, Armstrong gives a fresh spin on city-dwelling vampires, werewolves, and zombies, while also traveling further afield, to a post-apocalyptic fortress, a superstitious village, a supernatural brothel, and even to feudal Japan.With tales that range from humorous to heart-stopping, these are the stories that showcase Kelley Armstrong at her versatile best.- Rakshashi (standalone)- Kat (Darkest Powers universe, non-series narrator)- A Haunted House of Her Own (standalone)- Learning Curve (Otherworld universe, Zoe)- The Screams of Dragons (Cainsville universe, non-series narrator)- The Kitsunes Nine Tales (Age of Legends universe, non-series narrator)- Last Stand (standalone)- Bamboozled (Otherworld universe, non-series narrator)- Branded (Otherworld universe, non-series narrator)- The List (Otherworld universe, Zoe)- Young Bloods (Otherworld universe, non-series narrator)- The Door (standalone, original to this collection)- Dead Flowers by a Roadside (standalone)- Suffer the Children (standalone)- The Collector (standalone)- Gabriels Gargoyles (Cainsville universe, Gabriel)- Harbinger (standalone)- V Plates (Otherworld universe, Nick)- Life Sentence (Otherworld universe, non-series narrator)- Plan B (standalone)- The Hunt (Cainsville universe, non-series narrator)- Dead to Me (standalone)- Devil May Care (Cainsville universe, Patrick, original to this collection)What I Liked:I don't think I've ever reviewed an anthology! I've certainly read a few, but not reviewed one (that I remember). I don't read anthologies often - the stories inside are too short for my taste, and I never feel satisfied. With this anthology, I was really only interested in the Age of Legends story, The Kitsunes Nine Tales. While that one was probably my favorite of all of the short stories, I enjoyed this anthology as a whole.There are so many stories in this anthology, and I won't bother summarizes each one, or even commenting on each one. We'd be here all day! I'll highlight some of my favorites - The Kitsunes Nine Tales, The Door, and Devil May Care.The Kitsunes Nine Tales is the only story I really wanted to read in this anthology, when I first heard that this anthology would be a thing! I've read Armstrong's Darkest Powers series, and the Age of Legends series. I wasn't a huge fan of the Darkest Powers series, but I LOVE the Age of Legends series. The rest of Armstrong's books are unfamiliar to me, though I know how popular her books are (as well as she herself!).The Kitsunes Nine Tales is the story of Alvar Kitsune and how he escaped death in the Forest. This story is very short, yet very dense. There are short cameos from Gavril, his son, but call that this story takes place over ten years ago, so Gavril is but a boy. This story seems like it is going in one direction, regardless of whether or not you've read the Age of Legends books, but Armstrong finds ways to surprise a reader. This story was certainly interesting, and a bit surprising!The Door is the next story that I really liked. It is an original short story, not related to any of Armstrong's published novels. It is the story of a young girl whose father brings her books and toys, and when her sisters are born, brings them books and toys. The girl is not supposed to go near a certain door. When her father dies, and then her mother, the girl opens the door. She must make a decision, if she wants to keep opening it, or not. This story sounds really simplistic, with little conflict, but the story itself is so intriguing! What's beyond the door? What didn't her parents want her to see? What do their deaths have to do with the door? This was a strange short story, and I'm not entirely sure I understand it, but that is the beauty of short stories!The last short story I want to highlight is Devil May Care. This story is a background sort of story relating to the Cainsville series. I've not read this series. This story is about how Gabriel's father and mother met, how Gabriel came to be. It is a strange story, because the Patrick and Seanna do not know each other until one they meet. Their interactions are very strange. Gabriel is conceived, but the parents do not want anything to do with each other. Nevertheless, I am very intrigued. The world of Cainsville seems to be one of fae, foretelling, fulfillment. This story was brilliant for several reasons, but importantly so because I am hooked and want to read the Cainsville series now!Overall, the stories in this anthology were engaging, entertaining, interesting, and definitely helpful if you've read the full-length novels of the series that the short story corresponds to. And the short stories that stand alone are mesmerizing and strange, definitely worth reading! All of the stories are rather short, which I (for the most part) enjoyed!What I Did Not Like:I don't know if there was anything specific I didn't like? It's possible that I might have enjoyed some short stories more, had I read the full-length novels associated. But that's my problem, not the author's, and it's not a negative towards the book! Just a note, in case you're in the same boat as me!Would I Recommend It:If you're a Kelley Armstrong fan, or even if you've only read one or two books by her, check out this anthology! I'm not usually one for anthologies, but this one was quite interesting, and very easy to read, as the stories were short and engaging. Armstrong is a talented urban fantasy writer, that is proven over and over!Rating:4 stars. One of the few anthologies I've read, and I've enjoyed it! Might I recommend the Age of Legends series to everyone? High fantasy YA, simply amazing! The short story in this anthology for that series is very eye-opening! Definitely check out some of Armstrong's books if you get the chance.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RHM5V6QMC5F05/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=161696202X#wasThisHelpful","RHM5V6QMC5F05","A3KR1H0TMY05U4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3KR1H0TMY05U4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"***Review posted on The Eater of Books! blog***His Lover To Protect by Katee RobertBook Three of the Out of Uniform seriesPublisher: BrazenPublication Date: September 7, 2015Rating: 4 starsSource: eARC from NetGalley***Warning: this is an adult book, and for the eyes of mature readers***Summary (from Goodreads):He's never met a challenge he couldn't take...Alexis Yeung did everything right....only to watch everything go horribly, horribly wrong. Broken and angry, Alexis high-tails it to Europe, determined to face the world on her own terms and without consequence. Which includes a mind-blowing night with a sexy, scarred stranger.Except, embittered former pararescuer Luke Jackson isn't exactly a stranger. He's supposed to keep an eye on Alexis without her knowing. Ending up in bed together was definitely not the plan. Now he's chasing her (admittedly hot) ass across Europe, a game of cat and mouse that always ends with the two of them tangled up in the sheets.Something in their scarred, damaged souls calls to each other. And God help them, the sex in unbelievably hot. But if Alexis discovers who Luke really is, he'll lose the one thing that makes him feel whole...What I Liked:It's no secret that Katee Robert is one of my favorite romance authors. The Marriage Contract is my favorite of hers, but I LOVE her novels with Brazen. This book was pretty great! I read book one of this series (In Bed With Mr. Wrong), and liked it. I haven't gotten the chance to read book two, but I'm glad and so happy to have had the chance to review book three!Alexis is running from her demons, taking a long vacation in Europe. She's running away from everything that isn't good in her life. Her family is very worried about her, and her brother-in-law has Luke Jackson tail her (without her knowing). Luke is a fellow pararescuer, so he will help out his friend by following Alexis, making sure she's safe. But Luke and Alexis end up colliding, sharing steamy nights together... without Alexis knowing who he really is. Alexis will have to find out eventually - will it be worth it?Both Alexis and Luke are both such scarred characters - mostly emotionally, but also physically. Being in the military has a lot of risk associated with it, and Luke was badly injured while serving. He has a limp in one of his legs, and he is very scarred there. Alexis's scars are less physical, but she carries around with her a lot of guilty, remorse, despair. Something was taken from her that she couldn't bear to lose.I love how Robert dug deep with these two characters. A lot of times, romance novels (like many Brazen novels) have great developed characters, but the complexity isn't on this level that Robert has displayed in this book. You can feel the agony and the pain that Alexis felt, that Luke felt. Both of them have reason to shut down, run away, forget about the world. They argue and fight initially, but they are perfect for each other, in so many ways.The chemistry between these two is scorching! The very first steamy scene is off the charts hawt. If there is one thing that you are guaranteed in Robert's books, it is excellent chemistry between the starring couple. And a nicely developed romance too! I love good chemistry, but also, a strong romance and healthy pair.Diversity! I love the diversity of this book. Robert is good at sprinkling diversity in her books, and I love that in this book, she chose to make a protagonist Asian. I am a fan!I had a bit of trouble with Alexis (see below), but for the most part, I loved this book! It's very short, but very steamy, and very angst-filled (not overwhelmingly so though), and very hopeful. You'll love Alexis and Luke's journey across Europe, the two of them discovering each other in various ways, and the climax - the big issue and how it is resolved. There is a nice ending to this story!What I Did Not Like:I struggled with Alexis, initially. I understand her issues, and I think I know how she felt. But she is such a coward! Running away from her family, so many people who were worried about her, all the way to another continent? It's just so immature! But to be fair, Alexis does grow throughout the story, and doesn't remain cowardly for the entire book.The dynamic seemed weird to me - Luke knowing exactly who she was the whole time, Alexis having no idea. It's almost creepy, someone following you, even if he is a family friend, sent by family. The dynamic of this book just seemed weird because of that. You have to get past it!Would I Recommend It:I would recommend ANY of Katee Robert's books! Especially her O'Malley series. Especially her Brazen books. Basically anything she has written. This one is no exception! It's not my favorite of hers, but I liked it a lot. Romance readers, you will enjoy this quick and dirty (hehe) novel by Robert!Rating:3.5 stars -> rounded up to 4 stars. I wonder if Robert has more Out of Uniform books up her sleeve? I loooove a man in uniform. Or out of his uniform. That's fine too. Gimmee more books!","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3A5XM2RKZ5IJ7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013BEDMPQ#wasThisHelpful","R3A5XM2RKZ5IJ7","A3KR1H0TMY05U4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3KR1H0TMY05U4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"***Review posted on The Eater of Books! blog***In Her Defense by Julianna KeyesBook Two of the Time Served seriesPublisher: Carina PressPublication Date: September 7, 2015Rating: 4 starsSource: eARC from NetGalley***Warning: this is an adult book, and for the eyes of mature readers***Summary (from Goodreads):Caitlin Dufresne has never loved anyone as much as she loves winning. A ruthless fifth-year associate at an elite Chicago law firm, shes on the fast track to partner...until a stupid, serious error enrages her bosses. Caitlins continued refusal to share workor creditlands her a forced two-week vacation. She needs to regroup and learn to be part of a team, not just the star.When she meets Eli Grant, head of the firms IT department, Caitlin knows the overgrown frat boy isnt her type. But too much alcohol and a very public game of Truth or Dare turn into a dirty, breathless one-night stand. Which turns into a (mostly naked) two-week fling. Which turns into something that makes Caitlin incredibly nervous, despite the great sex.Eli shows her the many upsides to sleeping in, and for the first time ever, Caitlin has more than the law waiting for her at home. But when she returns to the office and the relentless demands of a high-profile case, Caitlin must decide if winning this one is worth losing Eli forever.What I Liked:Back in February, I read and LOVED Time Served, book one of this series. It's one of my few five-star-rated novels for 2015 so far, and one of my favorites. Rachel and Dean's story was agonizing and heartbreaking and lovely. Caitlin Dufresne was a very important character in the story, and to be honest, I HATED her. So when I saw that Julianna Keyes had written a companion novel to Time Served in Caitlin's point-of-view, I was, well, wary. Still, I really enjoyed Time Served, so I put aside my doubts, and jumped at the chance to read this one early. No regrets!Caitlin Dufresne is Chicago's most successful lawyer, in her early thirties, and one of the most attractive. She works all the time, late into the night, early in the morning. When her bosses stiff-arm her into taking a mandatory vacation, Caitlin is furious. She has no interests outside of work. When the IT guy of the firm, Eli Grant, stumbles on her in a bar the evening of her forced mandatory vacation, sparks fly, and Caitlin and Eli find themselves very attracted to each other. Steamy weeks follow, and Caitlin is slowly finding out that she doesn't have to be made of only work work work. She finds that she can't walk away from Eli, and will soon have to decide what is worth more of the effort - Eli, or her work.Caitlin is so different from Rachel (the protagonist of Time Served). Rachel does not make any cameo appearances in this book. In Time Served, we find Caitlin to be a cold. heartless, cruel woman who seems to be sleeping with everyone in the firm. She made me so angry in that book. But as I've gotten into her head, I can understand her so much better. She wasn't sleeping with everyone to get power or promotions, she dated men, they broke up, like any relationship. Caitlin is cold and heartless, but she isn't made of stone. While she appears to be a marble sort of perfect, she isn't.I found that I actually really liked her. She is a fighter, a dedicated worker, and she never gives up, even when she isn't familiar with something or doesn't like it. Her attraction to Eli is instant and surprising, and she doesn't want to stop seeing him after that one time, despite the fact that he isn't her usual type. I like that Caitlin is honest and straightforward, and goes after what she wants.I really, really like Eli, especially in the beginning. He is also honest and straightforward, and goes after what he wants. He knows Caitlin's reputation, yet he stills want to get to know her, in more than one way. He pushes their relationship to new levels, and helps Caitlin feel comfortable with many things she wasn't previously comfortable with doing. Towards the end, there is a lot of miscommunication between Caitlin and Eli, and I wanted shake them both, especially Eli. But he is such a good guy, and a hawt one, at that. Overgrown frat boy? I know the type. I wouldn't mind one, to be honest.The chemistry between Eli and Caitlin is off the charts. Talk about steamy, right from when they meet each other. It's instant attraction, which leads to more. There are so many steamy scenes in this book, much like in Time Served. But unlike in Time Served, Caitlin and Eli didn't know each intimately previously (or at all), and have no history. I almost liked this more, because the romantic and sexual experiences between Eli and Caitlin were completely new. No history clogging their relationship. This book is so, so steamy, guys. This series, in general. Time Served and In Her Defense are both very sexy romance novels, that deliver on the sexy, and the romance.And of course, their relationship is very tested and tried. It's physical at first, but then the pair start to care about each other. There are some minor jealousy moments on both sides, and some miscommunication. One assumes one thing, the other assumes another. But their relationship seemed like an authentic growing relationship, and I liked how developed it was.This book goes through Caitlin's development of character very thoroughly. Caitlin doesn't know who she is if she isn't working. But the forced vacation allows her to explore areas of her life that she has not spent enough time exploring. She starts going to her niece's softball games. She goes to baseball games with Eli, and actually becomes a pretty big fan of baseball. She helps Eli remodel properties that he owns, which she doesn't love, but she likes doing it with and for him. Caitlin discovers a life outside of work, and a life with Eli.The climax of the story surrounds Caitlin and Eli's relationship, as well as a case that Caitlin has been working on. While I found the case interesting, I was more interested in how Eli and Caitlin would resolve their relationship issues. The ending is very bittersweet up until the last few pages. I kind of like how the author dragged things out a bit, because it felt very real. The ending itself is very sweet and a good one! No need to worry about that. Keyes always delivers a happily ever after that will satisfy readers!What I Did Not Like:Nothing specifically that I didn't like! The author did an amazing job with this novel.Would I Recommend It:I would so very much recommend this novel! It's the companion to Time Served, but I personally recommend that you read Time Served before reading this one. Then you can hate Caitlin as much as I did at first, and then love her in this book. Seriously, I didn't think the author could do it well, but she really convinced me to love Caitlin in this book, despite loathing her in Time Served. This is a really great contemporary romance novel that is not cute and fluffy, but dirty and steamy and moving.Rating:4 stars. More like 4.5 stars, if the world would let me rate books in half stars. This novel was an excellent companion novel, and such a fulfilling adult contemporary romance! If I want my romance fix, I know Keyes is the right author to look up! I am definitely excited to read more from her in the future, related to this series or not!","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1YWWCKUUN2OR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XPXLP3A#wasThisHelpful","R1YWWCKUUN2OR","A3KR1H0TMY05U4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3KR1H0TMY05U4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"***Review posted on The Eater of Books! blog***Vengeance Road by Erin BowmanPublisher: HMH Books for Young ReadersPublication Date: September 1, 2015Rating: 4 starsSource: ARC sent by the publisherSummary (from Goodreads):When Kate Thompsons father is killed by the notorious Rose Riders for a mysterious journal that reveals the secret location of a gold mine, the eighteen-year-old disguises herself as a boy and takes to the gritty plains looking for answers and justice. What she finds are devious strangers, dust storms, and a pair of brothers who refuse to quit riding in her shadow. But as Kate gets closer to the secrets about her family, she gets closer to the truth about herself and must decide if there's room for love in a heart so full of hate.In the spirit of True Grit, the cutthroat days of the Wild West come to life for a new generation.What I Liked:I don't like Westerns. At least, I haven't liked the idea of Westerns in the past. I also didn't quite love Bowman's debut trilogy - Taken, Frozen, Forged. However, given that I've read all of the author's published books to date, and I don't read enough Westerns, I thought I'd give this book a try. Maybe it was fate, maybe it was timing - The Quick and the Dead was on TV late one night, and I watched it because I couldn't sleep (I don't watch TV, very rarely). So perhaps I was coincidentally primed for this book - because I loved it!Kate is bent on revenge after she comes home one day and finds her father murdered - hung from a noose - the house burning. Her father left a note to find a family friend who can help her should he ever die, and Kate will stop at nothing to find the Rose Riders that murdered her father. She strikes a deal with the family friend's sons - help her to Phoenix, and they can reap some serious rewards. But Kate must stop and think - is vengeance worth it?This is easily my favorite YA Western. I've read another in ""recent"" times - Relic by Renee Collins - which was good. I really REALLY liked this one though. There are so many awesome elements of this book! This is (in my opinion) Bowman's best novel to date. I enjoyed it so much more than I enjoyed her Taken trilogy.I feel like Bowman captured Kate really well. A huge difference from the Taken trilogy, because that series was written from Grey's POV (and he's a male). Kate is a likable gal! She is very tough, very independent, very ornery and prickly. Seriously, the girl wants to be left alone at all times. She doesn't like when Jesse and Will (the family friend's sons) tag along to help her find the men (and something else). Kate is prickly as thorns, and there is nothing wrong with that! I liked her so much, and I think Bowman did an amazing job of developing Kate's character.The same goes for many of the secondary characters. Jesse is the male protagonist. He is the older son of Abe (the family friend), about twenty years old. He has a serious protective streak, as he has been the ""man of the family"" for years. He is smart and loyal and considerate, and he has a slow-burn temper that is kind of funny, especially clashing against Kate's prickly nature. I like Jesse a lot!Will is a hilarious guy! He is the humor of the story, and I loved his interactions and role in this book. Liluye is another secondary character that we meet later in the book - she is very smart and has wonderful morals! And then of course, the villain, Waylan Rose. He is ruthless and mean, but not in a fake over-exaggerated Disney way. There is also another villain at work...There are so many shootouts! In bars, outside of bars, in the trails while on horseback. Bowman definitely got that down. The *feel* of Western culture is alive in this book! There are so many little things, like the Stetsons, the rifles and guns, the dust storm. And then there are the obvious things, like the speech! Bowman has the historical Western accent written phonetically, so for me, it was easy to hear the Western accent! I loved that!The story goes by so quickly, with nonstop action and plain-old fun. Kate is hellbent on vengeance, and Jesse and Will are determined to get something else out of this adventure (it's something super important, too!). There are scenes when Kate breaks down a little and shows some emotion under all of those thorns. I like that Bowman has written an action-packed, fun Western that also delivers on the feels and friendships.There is a hint of romance! And no love triangle. Don't get mad (or excited?) if you read that ""pair of brothers"" phrase in the summary and immediately thought ""love triangle"". No love triangle. Jesse and Kate are the one pair of this book from the moment they meet each other - though there is no insta-love at all! In fact, Kate and Jesse barely have any physical romance, though you know emotionally that they care about each other. There are little things that Bowman does that shows us the development of the relationship. So wonderfully done - and so much more enjoyable than the romance in the Taken trilogy! Sorry, Taken trilogy.This standalone novel won my heart! I am so glad I decide to give it a shot, despite two very large things standing in my way (my dislike of Westerns and my so-so feelings towards Bowman's first three published novels). I love that this is a standalone! It wraps up a well, though a touch bittersweet. Just a touch. Not too much though. Very HEA-esque ending. Yay!What I Did Not Like:I can't really think of much I didn't like! I wasn't even bored or tired of reading or hateful of any of the characters. This book was awesome!Would I Recommend It:I would totally recommend this novel! Says the non-Western-fan! I had a feeling this one would be Bowman's best novel yet, and it really is. Not that the Taken trilogy was horrible - but this book was much better. And it is only a standalone! No waiting and agonizing cliffhangers required. I hear talk of companion novels, so that might be a thing! Even if you're not a fan of Westerns (like me), give this book a chance!Rating:4 stars. Very well done, Mrs. Bowman! I'm glad I took that leap of faith and read this book solely because it had your name on it (I like to read books by authors I've previously read, even if I disliked or felt meh towards the books I previously read). Go read this one, people!","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R159SDWQV76M3X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0544466381#wasThisHelpful","R159SDWQV76M3X","A3KR1H0TMY05U4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3KR1H0TMY05U4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"***Review posted on The Eater of Books! blog***Firewalker by Josephine AngeliniBook One of The Worldwalker TrilogyPublisher: Feiwel & FriendsPublication Date: September 1, 2015Rating: 3 starsSource: ARC sent by the publisherSummary (from Goodreads):Worlds divide, magic slays, and love lies in the second book of Josephine Angelinis The Worldwalker Trilogy.""You think Im a monster, but my choices, as ruthless as they seem, are justified.""Lily is back in her own universe, and she's ready to start a new life with Rowan by her side. True, she almost died in the Pyre that fueled their escape from New Salem, and must hide her magic for the safety of everyone she cares about, but compared to fighting the Woven, the monstrous creatures inhabiting the alternate Salem, life is looking pretty good.Unfortunately, Lillian, ruthless ruler of the 13 Cities, is not willing to let Lily go that easily. If she cant persuade Lily to return to her world, she will force her to come back by doing away with the ones she loves.Picking up right where Trial By Fire left off, Firewalker is another sexy, fast-paced, heartbreaking thrill ride from internationally bestselling author Josephine Angelini!What I Liked:I feel like waaay too many books I've read in the past few months have been three-star novels. Not quite terrible, but not great either. Might recommend, probably will never read again. I absolutely LOVED Trial by Fire! And in terms of Firewalker, it was decent! A good sequel, just... heartbreaking. Among other things, but the heartbreak was too much for me. I can't say much without spoiling things (I'll be keeping this as vague was possible), but this book left me too sad and not in a good way.Lily is back in her world, with Rowan in tow. Her mother and Juliet find them, and slowly, Lily heals. She goes back to school and discovers that several of her friends are drawn to her - meaning they have power, and are to be part of her coven. And it's a good thing too, because Lily is going to need all the help she can get - Lillian is after her, trying to bring her back into her world. Sacrifices will be made, lives will be lost, and relationships will be broken, as Lily attempts to unravel secrets and the past in order to save the future.The world-building is, like in Trial by Fire, stunning and captivating. I'm not usually a fan of witch books, but there is something about this series that is so different. Also, parallel worlds! That's definitely an intriguing aspect to mix with magic and witches and royalty.Like in Trial by Fire, I was a fan of Lily! She spends a lot of time injured during this book, which is unfortunate, but she is still strong-willed and resilient. Lily is a good witch who doesn't try to possess the wills of her claimed, or take over their memories or themselves, no matter how much the pull is there. Lily is decisive and smart, and has to make some pretty difficult decisions.The story is a bit slow-paced in the beginning, and it takes a while for me to get back into the story. I think I finally started getting into it when we meet three of Lily's soon-to-be coven. Tristan is one, and Breakfast (Stuart) and Una. I don't remember much of Breakfast and Una in Trial by Fire, if they were in the book at all, but I liked them a lot in this book. Breakfast is quite the jokester!Oh Rowan. I liked him, but I didn't. I mean, I did, but I feel like he did not get nearly enough ""screen"" time, and his character didn't develop much. He is still as swoony as ever, but Lily is keeping major secrets from him, and she distances herself from him... it's sad to see, because he doesn't get as much attention. Boo! But still, I love him so much, especially as a male protagonist.The story is very engaging, and you won't have difficulty reading it when you get into it (you might not have any issues getting into it at all!). There is a lot of craziness going on, and even if you don't remember much from Trial by Fire, you'll have no issues getting back into the action of things.What I Did Not Like:Urgh. This book is very heartbreaking, pretty much from the start. We know that Lily is keeping things from Rowan (and everyone else), and it's so sad to see her distance herself from him without him having a clue. He knows something is up, but he doesn't want to push her. She should have come clean from the start... but you know, that's how authors f*** with the romance. Even if the female knows, with all of her common sense, that the right thing to do is to tell the male, she never does it.Rowan plays a huge role in this book, and he is present (though not nearly as much as I would have liked). But I feel like in the second half of the book, his presence becomes bittersweet. We know that Lily isn't telling him things, and you get the feeling that he WILL find out, and it won't be pretty. No spoilers but... sigh.I'm pretty irritated with how the author handled all the secrets and Lily not telling Rowan. As you can probably tell.That sets the tone for the rest of the book. There is this dark cloud hanging over the book, and you know something awful is going to happen to Lily and Rowan (the romance), as well as Lily in general. I personally do NOT like reading books like this. I recognize that this is an ""Alyssa"" problem. But it's not enjoyable for me to be reading a book and feel sick about what's going to happen, or so crushed when it happens, etc. This is likely the biggest reason why this book is getting three stars.There was something missing, as opposed to Trial by Fire. Perhaps the romance isn't as seductive. Perhaps because we get to see a side of Lillian that is unexpected and frightening - in a completely different way than you would think. Perhaps because the ending is a total cliffhanger and the absolute worst kind of ending sequels could deliver. In any case, I'm not too happy about the ending.Would I Recommend It:I LOVED Trial by Fire. That book is definitely a top twenty favorite of 2014. But this book didn't deliver, for me. Still, I'd recommend this series. A fresh, interesting take on witches and parallel worlds? Yes please. But maybe binge-read the series when book three is published.Rating:3 stars. I'll definitely be tuning into book three (too bad there won't be ARCs for book three - the wait will be even LONGER). I can't say I really enjoyed this book (at least, not the second half), but that won't deter me from reading book three!","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RK0N0S4NVQD72/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250050901#wasThisHelpful","RK0N0S4NVQD72","A3KR1H0TMY05U4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3KR1H0TMY05U4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"***Review posted on The Eater of Books! blog***Public Enemies by Ann AguirreBook Two of the Immortal Game seriesPublisher: Feiwel & FriendsPublication Date: August 4, 2015Rating: 3 starsSource: ARC sent by the publisherSummary (from Goodreads):In Book 2 of the Immortal Game trilogy, Edie must learn the rules of the game . . . and then play better than anyone else.Through a Faustian bargain, Edie Kramer has been pulled into the dangerous world of the Immortal Game, where belief makes your nightmares real. Hungry for sport, fears-made-flesh are always raising the stakes. To them, human lives are less than nothing, just pieces on a board.Because of her boyfriend Kian's sacrifice, she's operating under the mysterious Harbinger's aegis, but his patronage could prove as fatal as the opposition. Raw from deepest loss, she's terrified over the deal Kian made for her. Though her very public enemies keep sending foot soldiers--mercenary monsters committed to her destruction--she's not the one playing under a doom clock. Kian has six months...unless Edie can save him. And this is a game she can't bear to lose.What I Liked:I'm actually not 100% sure how I feel about this book. There was no doubt that I would finish it, because I was engrossed in the story while I was reading. But I'm not sure if I fully understood and enjoyed what I was reading. This series in general is weird... this book is weirder than Mortal Danger. I'm not sure if that's a good thing or bad thing.In this sequel novel, Edie Kramer is desperate to find a loophole to save her boyfriend, Kian. He sacrificed his life for hers, and he will die in a few short months because of the deal he made. But Edie isn't going to take no for an answer, nor is she going to quietly do as she is told by the Harbinger (who is supposed to protect her, courtesy of Kian's deal). Armed with a new and deadly weapon, Edie is more dangerous than weak, and the immortal players of the game fear her. But Edie's battle isn't just with the gods and immortals, but also with Kian's deal to save her. Can she save him?This book departs completely from the story of Mortal Danger - it's no longer about getting revenge on her classmates. Few characters from book one are present in this book. The plot is completely different - it's all about playing the immortal game, and staying alive. Everyone seems interested in Edie, but Edie is interested in spending time with Kian, trying to find a way out for him, and getting her dad to less of zombie, after her mother's murder.I can't say I really enjoyed the story... Edie was an okay character, though I barely see any of who she was in Mortal Danger, to be honest. Her voice is just another bland YA female voice, to be honest. I liked her in Mortal Danger, but I was feeling kind of meh towards her in this book. I guess she's kind of kickbutt, but she's not a favorite of mine. Still, better than a whiny YA female.One thing that I REALLY liked was the Harbinger. I am intrigued by that guy. He's probably a gazillion years old and he can take on any face he wants, but I like him. I bet his hair is soft (this is totally relevant). I would give him a hug! Yay lovable villains.In general, the story is interesting and well, creepy, which I think the author wants. I don't know if it's this series is my thing (I don't do horror or even low-key creepy books) but I'm intrigued. I am HIGHLY interested in the third book, despite how this one went for me. The ending of this book is INSANE and then WACKY - two events are incredible shocking and I really want to know how things end!What I Did Not:One of my biggest issues with this book seriously hindered my ability to really enjoy the book - I couldn't remember much of what happened in Mortal Danger, and I struggled to keep up. The author didn't do a good job of slowly recapping events from book one, so there were a lot of times when I was like, wait. Edie's mom was murdered? Kian bargained away his life? Does xyz friend of Edie's know about the immortal game? Does Edie's father? All of these things (and more) happened in/were details of book one, and yet, I couldn't remember any of them! So I was surprised a lot as I was reading this book, and it had nothing to do with this book - more so, with book one. I needed to reread book one - or the author didn't recap things well.So this really hurt how well I could enjoy the book. This could have been a ""me"" problem, I realize that. But I didn't enjoy the book was much as I'd hoped because I was hopelessly confused. Still, the story was good. I just didn't really follow where things were going. Especially since the few things that I DID remember - Edie getting revenge on her classmates - didn't show up in this book basically at all.In general, this book is strange. I didn't quite remember that this game involves immortals and gods and whatnot, so that took me aback. And spirits - there is a creepy plot associated with spirits. I didn't care for that and was totally weirded out.I didn't really like or hate in Edie in this book. It's sad because I really liked her in Mortal Danger, but I didn't really like her in this book. She's lost what made her stand out in the first book, in terms of her voice. Now she just seems like any other YA heroine.Kian is pathetic in this book! I didn't find him strong or brave or kind or even swoony. He knows he has a time limit, but literally all he and Edie do is argue and fight, and it's annoying.So, the romance is... meh. No real swoony scenes, though Kian and Edie take their relationship up a notch. The bickering and fighting and miscommunication really turned me off. Edie doesn't trust Kian for whatever reason, though he loves her so much. Ugh!Would I Recommend It:Meh. Maybe. I don't think this book was disappointing, but I didn't really enjoy it as much as I'd hoped. I really, REALLY liked Mortal Danger though, and I'm really, REALLY excited to read Infinite Risk, despite not liking this one much. So, sequel slump?Rating:3 stars. The meaning of sequel slump! When you want to like the book because you liked book one, but it just isn't happening. But I absolutely will still read Infinite Risk - I must know what happens!","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2F73KSSKZ35PG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250024668#wasThisHelpful","R2F73KSSKZ35PG","A3KR1H0TMY05U4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3KR1H0TMY05U4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"***Review posted on The Eater of Books! blog***Nothing Left to Burn by Patty BlountPublisher: Sourcebooks FirePublication Date: August 4, 2015Rating: 4 starsSource: eARC from NetGalleySummary (from Goodreads):Reeces father hasnt spoken to him since the car wreck that killed Reeces brother. Desperate for forgiveness, Reece joins the Junior Cadet program at his dads firehouse. But the program is grueling, and Reece isnt sure he can make it through. Then he meets Amanda.Amanda understands wanting to belong. As a foster kid, the firehouse is the only place that feels like home. She agrees to help Reece, but falling for him wasnt part of the deal. And when a string of arsons suddenly point to Amanda, their relationship could go up in flames.What I Liked:I have a hard time with YA tough-issue contemporary novels. YA contemporary romance novels are usually fine, but the tough-issues ones? I always have problems with those. But Patty Blount's YA books - all tough-issue contemporary - seem to work for me. I liked TMI a lot, and LOVED Some Boys, and now it appears that I really liked Nothing Left to Burn! Something about her tough-issue contemporary novels make the tough issues real but readable, not too heavy or weighing the book down.Reece Logan's brother Matt died in a car accident - and Reece was the one driving. Months later, Reece's father hasn't forgiven Reece, and Reece's mother hasn't stopped crying. Reece decides to join the junior fire fighting squad (his father is a lieutenant, and his brother used to be on the junior squad), after his brother made him promise as he was dying. Amanda is a member of the junior squad, and used to have a crush on Matt. Seeing Reece is like seeing Matt, and Amanda can't help but feel anger towards Reece. But Amanda slowly realizes that Reece might be just as ""messed up"" as she is. Junior squad is what is keeping them going, and when a series of arsons are connected in an eerie, Amanda and Reece will put everything on the line - even their relationship.This book is written in dual, first-person perspectives, switching off between Reece and Amanda. Sometimes this works for me, sometimes it doesn't, but usually it does, especially with a couple (as opposed to best friends or siblings or worst enemies or something). I enjoyed reading from Reece's perspective especially - Blount does an excellent job of writing in the male and female perspectives, creating unique voices for each character. But I especially like Reece's voice.Reece is an interesting guy, from the start. His brother is the more athletic one, the more likable/outgoing/charismatic one, the one that their father loves more. Reece is very intelligent, with photographic memory. He likes chess, isn't on the junior squad, isn't a bulky/ripped guy, doesn't have all the ladies after him. Reece is quiet and doesn't stand up to his father. He takes the blame for his brother's death and carries the burden and pain of losing a brother - and indirectly, a father - with him all the time.And when he joins the junior squad, the juniors see the pain and loss. Lieutenant John Logan treats his son terribly, calling him a nickname he hates, picking on him when Reece wouldn't know, expecting him to be perfect, after only just joining. John leaves him and his mother. It's no wonder that Reece thinks that no one cares - and he begins to write his feelings down, in the form of a letter to his father.Amanda... I think I like Amanda. I'm kind of on the fence with her. The reason why this book didn't get five stars is because of her. I had a weird feeling about her from the start, and she didn't exactly redeem herself for certain things as the story went on. I wanted to cut her some slack though. She's a well-developed character, and I can understand some of her thoughts and feelings, but I don't necessarily like her. She wasn't a bad protagonist though. I liked Reece much more.Both characters develop and grow throughout the story - Blount writes the characterization and development of both Reece and Amanda well. Even though I was meh about Amanda, it was clear how she grew and matured. It was very obvious with Reece - without spoiling anything, I can say that Reece learned a lot about himself throughout the story. Reece is a complex and complicated character, and I think Blount developed and wrote him well.This book had me close to tears for nearly the entire book! You know that's powerful because I literally do not cry for books, movies, TV, etc. I really felt for Reece. The scenes that Blount wrote involving Reece and his father - over and over, Blount captured loss and pain and regret and betrayal, in terms of the father-son relationship. I read this book on Father's Day - it was definitely a good one, given the holiday. Blount does an amazing job of injecting gripping emotions into her stories, and making the situations understandable and easy to relate.There is so much more to the story than Reece and his father's relationship, and how it affects Reece's life on the junior squad, or his home life. Reece and Amanda begin to get closer, after a rough start. Reece begins to drift apart from his friend Alex, and isn't sure of how to fix that. Meanwhile, Reece is really enjoying junior squad, no matter the hard work and workouts that he has to put into getting into shape. And the bigger picture plot - a series of arsons has been spreading throughout the town, and it's related to someone in the story that we wouldn't expect. I love this mystery plot - I did not guess the culprit at all.The romance wasn't my favorite aspect of the book, mostly given that I didn't like Amanda, but I liked the romance. It was a hate-to-love type of relationship, and I like those. Reece is a sensitive guy, not your macho type with cute feelings. He is sensitive and quiet and intelligent, but he has a hidden temper and he's determined, a hard worker. Amanda is in-your-face and in-your-business, and she doesn't want to like Reece. But they both fall for each other, despite everything.This book ends pretty nicely, on all ends. I was surprised by who the culprit of the arson attacks was! And I was surprised with one or two others things, but in a good way. The ending made me very happy and a bit sad, too. We learn a lot about Reece, and I wanted to hug him so hard by the end of the book. Overall, I really liked this book!What I Did Not Like:Like I said above, I didn't really like or hate Amanda. She did things that I didn't like and couldn't forgive (I'm not Reece). But besides that, she just wouldn't be someone that I'd like in real life, I think. She's too callous. I understand that people have their own issues, but first impressions are everything, and I would have flipped her off and kept far away from her from the very first day. But then, maybe we're of similar temperaments and that's why. Or maybe not. Either way, I didn't really like/hate her. She was a decent character, but she wasn't a favorite, by any means.Would I Recommend It:I loved this book, and all of Patty's books (with the exception of Send - I own it, but have not yet read it), and I will definitely keep reading her books. I'm not a tough-issue contemporary fan, and this book deals with a lot of tough issues (especially with Reece, the poor guy!), and I know fans of contemporary will love this book. But this is one of those books that I wish everyone would read - dealing with feelings of not being wanted, suicide, etc. are definitely intense topics that need to appear more (and have been appearing more) in YA literature!Rating:4.5 stars -> rounded down to 4 stars (see above). I really, really enjoyed this book! My second favorite Blount book, I think. I look forward to reading more from this author in the future!","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3I6VPFMWKL3IY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1492613290#wasThisHelpful","R3I6VPFMWKL3IY","A3KR1H0TMY05U4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3KR1H0TMY05U4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"***Review posted on The Eater of Books! blog***Most Likely to Succeed by Jennifer EcholsBook Three of the Superlatives seriesPublisher: Simon PulsePublication Date: August 4, 2015Rating: 3 starsSource: eARC from EdelweissSummary (from Goodreads):In this sexy conclusion to The Superlatives trilogy from Endless Summer author Jennifer Echols, Sawyer and Kaye might just be perfect for each otherif only they could admit it.As vice president of Student Council, Kaye knows the importance of keeping order. Not only in school, but in her personal life. Which is why she and her boyfriend, Aidan, already have their lives mapped out: attend Columbia University together, pursue banking careers, and eventually get married. Everything Kaye has accomplished in high schoolstudent government, cheerleading, stellar gradeshas been in preparation for that future.To his entire class, Sawyer is an irreverent bad boy. His antics on the field as school mascot and his love of partying have earned him total slacker status. But while he and Kaye appear to be opposites on every level, fateand their friendskeep conspiring to throw them together. Perhaps the seniors see the simmering attraction Kaye and Sawyer are unwilling to acknowledge to themselvesAs the year unfolds, Kaye begins to realize her ideal life is not what she thought. And Sawyer decides its finally time to let down the facade and show everyone who he really is. Is a relationship between them most likely to succeedor will it be their favorite mistake?What I Liked:Ahhh, this book was a bit of a disappointment. It was good, but disappointing compared to Biggest Flirts or Perfect Couple. I really, really enjoyed those two, and could not wait to experience Sawyer's story. I liked Kaye in the previous books, but Sawyer was who I was concerned about. Also you really can't go wrong with Echols.Kaye is a model student - perfect grades, perfect transcript, perfect extracurricular activities (including student government AND a sport - cheer-leading!). To be honest, she is very much like me in high school - I was also the same meticulous, slightly obsessive, perfect person. I would say that I still am, but everyone here at Hopkins is, so who knows. Anyway. Kaye is dating Aidan, the student government president, valedictorian in the running (against Kaye), and a general pain in the butt. Kaye has been annoyed with him for a while... and then she hears about her and Sawyer getting the vote as Perfect Couple That Never Was. Kaye develops feelings for Sawyer, feelings that were already there... on both sides.This series is cute, but this book is probably the cutest. For most of the book, Kaye is ""dating"" Aidan - I have that in quotes because they're a couple, but Kaye can't stand him. He is demanding and controlling and doesn't like it when he doesn't get his way or when someone else has a great idea. Too bad his girlfriend goes toe-to-toe with him, in academics, student government, etc. Kaye eventually grows a backbone and speaks her mind to him (she usually let things go). And then things go way south with Aidan.All the while, her issues with Aidan open up opportunities for her and Sawyer to get closer. Sawyer has a reputation for hooking up with girls left and right - he's the high school's ""bad boy"". In a pelican suit at games (he dresses as the school's mascot). I'm not sure if I liked Swayer in this book. He didn't seem like himself, from what I saw in Biggest Flirts and Perfect Couple. In this book, he seemed a bit juvenile. I didn't find much depth to him, even with his sob story.But Sawyer was an interesting character, even if I found him to be a bit juvenile/immature. He has been through a lot, with no mother, deadbeat father, and no other family. He bounces around in terms of shelter (we can't even call it homes), and eventually ends up staying in Harper's mom's B&B restaurant (there are rooms there to live in!). I felt bad for him!Kaye and Sawyer are a great couple! It takes them forever for them to realize that they are good together and good for each other (really, it takes KAYE forever - Sawyer already seemed to realize that he likes her a lot, from the beginning). You'd think the romance would be weird since Kaye is dating someone for a good portion of the book, but their breakup is inevitable. You could feel it from the first and second book in the series! Anyway, the romance is sweet (and bumpy too though), and there is a little bit of chemistry, though I wouldn't say much.Overall, the book was okay... stay tuned for the big things that I didn't like about the book, that really detracted from my overall opinion of the book.What I Did Not Like:Kaye in general kind of bothered me. Something about her, I didn't like. Maybe because she was basically a doormat for most of the book? And not only in terms of her boyfriend (ex-boyfriend), but also in terms of her parents (specifically, her mother). I'm not saying I would be defiant at every turn and fight with my mother, but I would VOICE my opinions and concerns, even if it wouldn't make a difference. Kaye never voices her opinions with her mother - she never pushes for her mother to listen to her. She just silently hates how her mother is, but does nothing about it. Girl, you are not mute.On the subject of Kaye's mother - let me tell you. I understand parents like her mother. Overbearing, controlling, domineering, loud, rude, stubborn, know-it-all. My mom is kind of like that (or used to be). I get it, and I know this type of parent is real. But Kaye's mother really, REALLY bothered me. I HATED her, and if I were her child, I probably would have launched a vase at her by age seven or something. Kaye's mother's attitude very much took away from the story, and made the book worse. Yes, she is (somewhat realistic). But including her and her negativity and borderline verbal harassment (disguised as tough-luck, no-nonsense mother) was not amusing, and really brought the story down. This book was no fun to read, with Kaye's mother. The mother has a serious attitude, hates Sawyer, hates Kaye's choices, controls where Kaye applies to college, what extracurricular activities she does, how much time she spends on homework, who she dates... again, I know this type of parent exists (my mom used to be like that), but this CRAP really brought the story down. And the fact that Kaye always kept silent (beginning to end) and didn't stick up for herself, let alone Sawyer? Pathetic. Also very detracting from the quality of the story, as well as how much I enjoyed it.Seriously, this book is losing stars because of Kaye and her mother. Not fun to read. Not a good character arc - or plot arc. Making the mother a villain like that? Didn't work for me. It's an okay story, but it's really bogged down by the parent llama drama. Kaye's mother hates everything and everyone, including Sawyer. So... this story wasn't fun to read, though everything not tainted by the mother was very lighthearted. Towards the end, the mother plays a more and more important role in the story, and it just goes straight to the garbage by the end of the book. I didn't like the ending - too much drama, and then too much happy.And then there was the fact that I found Sawyer to be immature. Yes, he was a goofball in the first two books. But now that we have him up close and personal, I expected... more. Well, I guess I can say that he is an IMMATURE goofball. The ""player"" side of him doesn't seem to fit at all.Would I Recommend It:Nah. I mean, maybe. I liked this series, and I thought this book was okay, but I'm not sure I'd recommend it. I'd highly recommend Perfect Couple though, that book was good. And Biggest Flirts was good too! But this one is worth skipping. I know, I know, Sawyer. But he was so flat, as a character! And Kaye's personality - I didn't really like her much. So, there's that. This book was a bit of a disappointment!Rating:2.5 stars -> rounded up to 3 stars. Disappointing, but good enough to get 3 stars. But it's more on the negative side of 3 stars. Echols could have done so much with this book! I didn't like how she portrayed Sawyer (immature boy!), or how big of a deal she made Kaye's mother. Find/utilize a different plot arc!","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2BF7RJ61ZQ705/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1442474521#wasThisHelpful","R2BF7RJ61ZQ705","A3KR1H0TMY05U4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3KR1H0TMY05U4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"***Review posted on The Eater of Books! blog***The Seven Lady Godivas by Dr. SeussPublisher: Random HousePublication Date: 1939 (Re-Issued in 1987)Rating: 4 starsSource: Copy sent by the publisherSummary (from Goodreads):The book recounts in prose the tale of not one, but seven Godiva sisters, none of whom ever wear clothing. The explanation for their nakedness, even when walking in snow, is that ""they were simply themselves and chose not to disguise it."" The story opens with the sisters' father, Lord Godiva, deciding to leave for the Battle of Hastings on horseback. This upsets the sisters, as horses are wild and untamed animals. Sure enough, before Lord Godiva even manages to leave the castle walls, he is flung from his horse and killed. As a tribute to their father's fate, the Godiva sisters agree to never marrydespite the fact that each is courting one of seven brothers named Peepinguntil they can warn their countrymen of the dangers of horses. The book then follows the sisters as they set out on individual quests for ""horse truths"", which turn out to be well-known sayings involving horses.What I Liked:This book was hilarious. And adorable. It is Dr. Seuss's first adult novel, which is why I chose it for the blog tour for review. It's unique to all of his other books, which are generally for children. This book could definitely be read by a younger audience, but I see why it's an adult novel. Check out the cover, for starters!The story follows the seven naked Godiva sisters, daughters of Lord Godiva, Earl of Coventry. The seven Peeping Brothers and the seven Godiva sisters are in love (each a pair), but when a horse throws the Earl and the Earl dies, the sisters make an oath: each of them must find a ""Horse Truth"" or they can never act on their love and get married. The Horse Truth must be something that warns others about the mysterious nature of horses - because in 1066, not much was known about horses specifically! Will the ladies find these ""horse truths"", and true love?Like I said, this book was hilarious. In classic Dr. Seuss style, the story is both simple and complex, with a deeper meaning than what is on the page. The sisters are naked (think about why - this is open to interpretation, and it's also a legend!), and they swear off marrying until they can do some good for the world. The seven sisters stick to their oath - either they find a Horse Truth, or they don't get married.I love how Dr. Seuss took an old legend, with Lady Godiva and Peeping Tom. Don't know what I'm talking about? Check out the Wikipedia page on Lady Godiva. Legend has it that she rode around on a horse naked, taking a stand against the high taxes that her husband imposed on the people. She sided with the people, and rode on the horse naked to oppose her husband's policies. A man named Tom was punished for watching her ride naked (either blind or dead). Interesting, no?Dr. Seuss takes this legend and spins it differently - Peeping is the family name for seven brothers - Tom is one of them. Instead of one Lady Godiva, there are seven, who are always naked. When a horse kills their father, they swear to learn more about horses before they can ever get married. It is quite an intriguing story! And historical fiction, at that! I love medieval historical fiction.And it's a funny one, despite the grim nature. Trust me, Dr. Seuss gets dark. Horses are dangerous... someone should have told the Godiva sisters and their father that. Thus, it is very adult. But it is funny, heartwarming, and ends well!What I Did Not Like:Nothing for here! I enjoyed the book, and would love to give it to my baby cousins when they get older. It is a classic!Would I Recommend It:I would recommend this one to any Dr. Seuss fan! It's one of his oldest novels, and his first adult novel (not many adult ones), and it's probably among my favorites of Dr. Seuss!Rating:4 stars. I'm sad to see that this one is pretty much out of print! It is such a great novel. Check out the prices for copies of this book - it's practically rare! I urge anyone who likes Dr. Seuss's books to read it though - his adult books are just as fun as his children books!","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R13WS0L992CHOZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0394562690#wasThisHelpful","R13WS0L992CHOZ","A3KR1H0TMY05U4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3KR1H0TMY05U4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"***Review posted on The Eater of Books! blog***The Bourbon Kings by J.R. WardBook One of The Bourbon Kings seriesPublisher: NALPublication Date: July 28, 2015Rating: 4 starsSource: eARC from NetGalley***Warning: this is an adult book, and for the eyes of mature readers***Summary (from Goodreads):The #1 New York Times bestselling author of the Black Dagger Brotherhood delivers the first novel in an enthralling new series set amid the shifting dynamics of a Southern family defined by wealth and privilegeand compromised by secrets, deceit, and scandal....For generations, the Bradford family has worn the mantle of kings of the bourbon capital of the world. Their sustained wealth has afforded them prestige and privilegeas well as a hard-won division of class on their sprawling estate, Easterly. Upstairs, a dynasty that by all appearances plays by the rules of good fortune and good taste. Downstairs, the staff who work tirelessly to maintain the impeccable Bradford facade. And never the twain shall meet.For Lizzie King, Easterlys head gardener, crossing that divide nearly ruined her life. Falling in love with Tulane, the prodigal son of the bourbon dynasty, was nothing that she intended or wantedand their bitter breakup only served to prove her instincts were right. Now, after two years of staying away, Tulane is finally coming home again, and he is bringing the past with him. No one will be left unmarked: not Tulanes beautiful and ruthless wife; not his older brother, whose bitterness and bad blood know no bounds; and especially not the ironfisted Bradford patriarch, a man with few morals, fewer scruples, and many, many terrible secrets.As family tensionsprofessional and intimately privateignite, Easterly and all its inhabitants are thrown into the grips of an irrevocable transformation, and only the cunning will survive.What I Liked:Huh. This book was not what I expected. You know I have not read a single J.R. Ward book? I really want to try her Black Dagger Brotherhood series, but it's just so long... I'm not sure I have the attention span for that many books, companions or sequels. In any case, I really liked this book, and I'm glad it was my first Ward read.The Bradford family are not entirely who they appear to be. Kings of the bourbon industry, yes, but there is more going on behind closed doors than one could ever imagine. Lane Baldwine has not been at Easterly in two years, not to see his cold wife, or his cruel father, or his listless mother, or the horticulturist he once loved. Lizzie loved Lane too, but she is determined to forget him. Two years later, Lane comes back to Easterly, after receiving distressing news about someone he loves. The arrival of Lane not only brings back memories for Lizzie, but stirs up secrets - past and present - that shake the family and nation to the core.This book reminds me of daytime soap operas, a bit. My mom watches Days of Our Lives and One Life To Live (though I think the latter is no longer airing), so I know all about daytime soaps. This book rivals one of those shows. Unfaithful partners, cold heartless women sleeping with anyone and everyone, cold heartless men sleeping with anyone and everyone, cold heartless people using sex with anyone and everyone to get back at each other, rich spoiled princesses, underhand deals, paternity in question... this book has it ALL, in terms of soap opera madness.Luckily, Lane and Lizzie are not the crazy ones of this book. Lane wants to stay in New York, rather than live in Kentucky with his wife. He doesn't love her, hasn't touched her in years, but he's married to her... so I guess that his soap opera claim-to-fame. Lane is such a good guy though. He cares about Miss Aurora, who practically raised him. He cares about Lizzie, his former lover. He doesn't hide the fact that he cares about people, which makes him strong. I love his strength, also his protectiveness, and persistence, his intelligence.Lizzie is a very independent woman, having worked as a horticulturist (head gardener) in the Bradford home for a decade or so. She has her own farm that she is paying off, and she's doing her best to forget Lane and their history. But easier said than done, because he comes back to Easterly, and the memories are still there. Throw in the fact that he will be divorcing his wife (but not because of Lizzie. That wife, Chantal, needed to go from the start).This book also follows other characters. Edward, the older brother, who was kidnapped in South America and ransomed, but not before being tortured and injured and scarred beyond measure. Edward lives on a horse farm, breeding horses. Gin, the youngest child of the Bradford family and only girl, is a weird one. I actually hate her, I think. She sleeps with EVERYONE, mercilessly. She does NOT care who lifts her skirts. I'm sorry, I know we're all for feminism, but, um, not classy? Anyone, I felt back for her towards the end. She didn't deserve what was happening, but in the end, she chose it. She's a dumb woman (said so herself), but no one deserves that. Samuel T is the family's lawyer and Lane's friend. He's mixed up with the Bradford family as well, and knows all their crap. Samuel is in deeper than he knows, thanks to a little secret someone kept from him.This story follows what happens when a little secret unravels into a bigger one into an even larger one. Lane discovers things about his father and the bourbon business that he never would have known. I was riveted with and fascinated by the story. Ward takes this filthy rich, snobby family, and packs more drama and shenanigans than a soap opera. Lots of OMG and WOAH happening in this book!I liked the romance. There was a lot of romance going on, not just with Lizzie and Lane. Not in a love triangle way though. Lizzie and Lane are a pair, and no one, not even Lane's wife, can touch that. I had my doubts, because Lane is married in the beginning, but it becomes obvious what kind of marriage that is. Lizzie and Lane have history, so this particular story was a slowburn romance for them. They are angry with each other, yet desperate for each other. Love! The romance was sweet and steamy, though I was surprised by the scant amount of sexy scenes. If you know what I mean,Other romance - well, there's Gin and a certain someone, but that certain someone keeps his distance from her because he knows her game. The two of them are the exact same person, just different sexes. They make the perfect couple, yet Gin did something foolish at the end of this book. And then there's Edward - he's a dummy too. The only smart Bradford/Baldwine is Lane.Anyway. I really liked this book. I liked Lane a lot - I wanted to hug him at most times! I liked Lizzie, despite her lapse in judgment towards the end of the book (it's all good though!). This book wrecked me, had me going through all kinds of emotions. I had to stop reading and process things very often, because my heart was racing and my brain was in shock mode. Ward definitely knows how to write a great story, and a satisfying romance! I can't wait to read the next book.What I Did Not Like:The one thing I didn't like about this book is the lack of resolution we get, in the end. Like, we're left hanging a bit, in terms of Gin's future, or Samuel T's relationship with his girl, or the aftermath of a death that was unexpected, or Chantal's next move. Even Lane and Lizzie's relationship - it's solid, but I wish we had a fireworks scene at the end. Basically, this book ended a bit abruptly, and it could have done well with an epilogue. I know this is a series - it looks like it isn't a companion series, likely a sequel type of series? That bothers me a wee bit because with romance novels, I like a happily-ever-after with each book. But. I guess I will have to suffer and wait for the next book.Would I Recommend It:I loved this book, so I would totally recommend it! I am quite sure Ward fans will enjoy this book, and anyone looking for a fun (and terrifying) dramatic contemporary novel with a lovely side of romance. The romance is important, but not the focus of the book. So you don't even have to be a romance fan to enjoy this book!Rating:4 stars. I haven't been really enjoying the books I've read recently, so this book was a welcome change. I could not read it fast enough! I was literally rushing through some pages at times because it could not be read fast enough! The story was so engrossing and so intriguing and I want more. Give me the sequel or give me, well, I'll settle for only the sequel!","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RHYL8I99HHQE7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0451475267#wasThisHelpful","RHYL8I99HHQE7","A3KR1H0TMY05U4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3KR1H0TMY05U4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"*** Review posted on The Eater of Books! blog***Pretty Dark Sacrifice by Heather L. ReidBook Two of the Pretty Dark Nothing seriesPublisher: Month9BooksPublication Date: July 28, 2015Rating: 4 starsSource: eARC sent by the publisherSummary (from Goodreads):Its been five weeks, two days, and eight hours since the demons forced Quinn to throw herself into the raging river, since Aaron sacrificed himself to save her, since his body disappeared without a trace.Everyone wants Quinn to move on, but she cant, not after a spirit appears to her at Aaron's memorial, convincing her hes still alive.When a mysterious box materializes on the very spot Aaron disappeared, Quinn finds shes at the center of an ancient prophesy of betrayal, revenge, and sacrifice that takes her to the depths of the underworld to face LilithAdams first wife.If Quinn can stop Lilith from unleashing the demon horde Eve, trapped inside the box during the Battle of Eden millennia ago, she will save the human realm and free Aaron from an eternity in torment.All it will cost is her blood.What I Liked:It has been over two years since Pretty Dark Nothing was published! That book was one of my favorite books of 2013. It was very unique ad original and fresh, and I loved it from start to finish. I remember rereading it a few times, and so the book is still one that I remember pretty well. Nevertheless, while I didn't love this sequel like I did Pretty Dark Nothing, I certainly enjoyed it! My rating is more like 3.5 stars, but not quite 4 stars.It's been over a month since Aaron sacrificed himself in order for Quinn to live. He saved her from drowning in a river, but he himself died. The search for his body has been called off. Yet Quinn does not believe that he is dead. She is sure that he exists still. And he does, which she soon finds out. He is in the Underworld, held captive by Adam's first wife, Lilith. Also, Quinn has Eve's blood and flesh, and she is able to fight ad banish demons. Quinn will stop at nothing to get Aaron back, even if it means allowing Lilith to release an army of demons, effectively dooming humanity.This book felt different from Pretty Dark Nothing. Less raw, less emotional. In the first book, Quinn was all over the place, and her character was a bit shaky. By the end, she changed greatly, and became a strong and deadly girl. In this book, Quinn is desperate to find Aaron, with or without the help of her friends or her Sentinel, Azrael. Quinn's desperation makes her impulsive, but also very, very powerful. I am very pleased with Quinn's character development in this book.The story is wrapped around Quinn's search for Aaron. No one believes her when she says that she knows he is out there. Everyone looks at her with hatred, because he is the one that died saving her. Even Quinn's best friend Reese hasn't been speaking to Quinn. But Quinn's friends don't abandon her, and Reese, Marcus, and Caleb (a new guy friend of Quinn's) band together to help her and support her. I love Marcus - he is a tease and a flirt, and a great other half of Reese. Caleb is calmer and more of a low-key flirt, but he knows that Quinn's heart is elsewhere.We do get bursts of scenes with Aaron's point-of-view. Aaron is in the Underworld, captured by Lilith, who is trying to find a box that contains her demon army (they are trapped, kind of like Pandora's box). Lilith tortures Aaron in the worst of ways, and Aaron learns strange things about himself that he didn't know. Things start to click and make sense, but Aaron is still trapped. I really like Aaron - his situation is hopeless, yet he never gives up. He is a go-with-the-flow guy, but he is also an impulsive, angry guy when he's provoked. I like Aaron a lot!There is romance in this novel, and series in general. This book is told in third person, switching between Aaron and Quinn (though more Quinn than Aaron, by far). Though Aaron is held captive in the Underworld, he and Quinn do communicate in this book, in an inventive way. And when they see each other solidly, sparks fly like in book one. Readers will be very satisfied with the romance of this novel - no insta-love, no love triangle.Overall, I really enjoyed this sequel. There will definitely be a third book, given the way this one ended. This book was engrossing and engaging, and functioned well as a sequel novel. The third book looks like it will be the epic showdown, and I cannot wait!What I Did Not Like:This book didn't have the same feel as Pretty Dark Nothing. One of the things that I absolutely loved about book one was the rawness, Quinn's drama, the difficulty of all that she was dealing with. This book has significantly less baggage. I guess some people might like this though! I just wish it were the opposite, because the rawness of emotion and pain was one of the things that really drew me in,But still this novel was dark and full of guilt and shame and pain, so I really can't complain all that much!Would I Recommend It:Given the uniqueness of this series, I would definitely recommend this book and its predecessor! Not only is the series unique, but entertaining and quite dark, too. Borderline creepy and scary, though I scare easily. The romance is very satisfying The female protagonist is one of those characters that seems like she might be weak, but proves her strength over and over. Such a great novel!Rating:3.5 stars -> rounded up o 4 stars. I read this one pretty quickly, which is great, because it shows that the book wasn't boring. I am quite excited to read the third (and hopefully final) novel! I say ""hopefully"" because I hate waiting for series to be completed! Gimmee the next book now!","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RSK8YJXN9AVV2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01053ZW9A#wasThisHelpful","RSK8YJXN9AVV2","A3KR1H0TMY05U4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3KR1H0TMY05U4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"***Review posted on The Eater of Books! blog***All the Ways to Ruin a Rogue by Sophie JordanBook Two of The Debutante FilesPublisher: AvonPublication Date: July 28, 2015Rating: 2 starsSource: eARC from Edelweiss***Warning: this is an adult book, and for the eyes of mature readers***Summary (from Goodreads):There was once a lady who loathed a lord...Lady Aurelia hasn't always hated Max, Viscount Camden, her brother's best friend. In fact, as a besotted girl, she thrived under his kind attention  sure that he was the most noble and handsome man in the land. Until her young heart discovered what manner of rogue he really was. Now, though she enjoys nothing more than getting on his last nerve, she cant deny Max drives her to distractioneven if she tries to pretend otherwise....and a lord who was confounded by a lady.Max cannot recall a time when Aurelia did not vex him. If she was not his friends sister, he would stay far away from the infuriating vixen. Unfortunately, they are always thrown together. At parties and family gatheringsshe is always there. Infuriating him, tossing punch in his face, driving him mad...until one night, she goes too far and he retaliates in the only way he can: with a kiss that changes everything.What I Liked:I wanted to like this one more! Two stars isn't the worst rating, but I finished this book with a feeling of disappointment and discontent. My problems with solely with Aurelia - I seriously do not like that girl and she pretty much ruined the book for me. Nevertheless, I thought the story was okay, and I LOVED Max.Aurelia has two options: get married in the next few months, or move to Scotland with her mother at the end of the season. Her older brother and his wife are having a baby, and Aurelia will be a burden and a spinster old maid if she stays. So she sets out to get married. Max needs to clean up his act too - he's been caught yet again with someone's wife. Max and Aurelia have a bad relationship, ever since they were little. Aurelia antagonizes Max at every turn, the boy who she used to love, but never saw her as more than a friend, and then enemy. But there is a fine line between hate and love, and there is much more between Max and Aurelia than they think.I didn't like Aurelia, and I will list all the reasons in the next section. I LOVED Max though. I think his character was a bit rough and could have been seen as cliche, but I liked the tortured hero thing going on. Max had a terrible childhood, and it shows in his present personal life. He doesn't want to love anyone, he doesn't want children, he doesn't want to fall in the trap of feeling anything for anyone. Which is why he goes from woman to woman, and doesn't want to marry.I felt bad for Max, throughout the entire book. Aurelia is a witch and drew a caricature of him when they were in their teens, with him having a small, um, package. She was angry because she saw him getting impersonally intimate with a maid. She was sixteen, in love with him, and got angry at him. At this time in history, he saw her as a friend, nothing more. So she threw a tantrum, drew a picture of him with a small you-know-what, and ruined his reputation. Again, witch.The romance isn't as steamy as one would expect for a historical romance novel, or for Jordan. Probably because most of the book is spent with Aurelia and Max hating each other - it takes quite a long time for Max to feel something other than annoyance towards her. Aurelia always liked him, but held a grudge (for no reason, mind you - it's not like they were engaged or he owed her). So the romance wasn't steamy. The chemistry was took a while to boil, but ended up being pretty hot.So the romance was blah, the female protagonist was blah, the story was okay but not amazing. I did like some of the plot arcs in this book - but I can't say anything specific about them because that would be spoiler-y! But I like what Jordan did towards the end. Anyway. On to the dislikes.What I Did Not Like:I did. Not. Like. Aurelia. Borderline HATED her, really. From the start, I wanted to choke her. How dare she ruin Max's life like that, just because he was having sex with a maid/someone that wasn't her?! Max and Aurelia were NOT engaged, or promised, or anything at this point! Max and Aurelia's brother were friends, so Max saw Aurelia as Will's little sister. Aurelia was stupid in love with Max, and I suppose she expected him to be in love with her too. UGH. And then she goes and does that stupid thing with the caricature, ruining his reputation for years.Aurelia is quite possibly the dumbest historical romance heroine I've read about. I think I liked her in A Good Debutante's Guide to Ruin, because she seemed intelligent and clever. In this book, she seems dumb and senseless. She continues to create the caricatures, or misbehaving ladies, cheating lords, etc. Dumb dumb dumb. Aurelia claims it's her hobby, the only thing keeping her occupied. But then her brother and sister-in-law announces their pregnancy, and she realizes that she needs to catch a man.Problem? Yes, because Aurelia is as prickly as a porcupine and no one wants her for more than her breasts and behind (apparently she's not pretty, but she is curvy). Throw in her awful, high and mighty attitude, and no man (especially given this time period) would want her. UGH! She is a terrible person! I wouldn't want her either, if I were a gentleman looking for a wife!And she goes and hurts Max over and over again - the scene at the lake was mortifying and enraging. The author tries to paint the lady that Max was with as a cruel woman, which is supposed to make Aurelia's actions excusable. NO. Aurelia is a b****. And a dumb one. She doesn't even realize how stupid and cruel she is. UGH.I have a lot of frustration with Aurelia. Mostly, I can't believe Max would want her (or want to be with her), because he pretty much hates her the whole time. Jordan definitely forced this story in this direction, so it seemed choppy and fake.I could go on, but I won't. One last thing - what is up with these titles? They make no sense! A Good Debutante's Guide to Ruin was not at all in any way a good debutante's guide to ruin. This book in no way enumerated all the ways to ruin a rogue. This is a small thing but ugh!Would I Recommend It:Sadly, I wouldn't recommend this book. I like Jordan's books (I've read some of her YA, NA, and adult), but this one was a hot (and awful) mess. The female protagonist really deserves to be a spinster. I know fans of Jordan are going to want to read this one, but if you're not really familiar with Jordan's historical romance novels, don't bother with this one.Rating:2 stars. I wanted to like the story! But Aurelia and her terrible personality ruined it for me. Still, I suppose I could have given this book one star. Oh well. I'll probably read the next book in the series (if there are more?), because I liked the first one (A Good Debutante's Guide to Ruin), but this one was no good.","2.0 out of 5 stars","July 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RGV1UH6V9BCJE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=006222252X#wasThisHelpful","RGV1UH6V9BCJE","A3KR1H0TMY05U4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3KR1H0TMY05U4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"***Review posted on The Eater of Books! blog***The Highlander Takes a Bride by Lynsay SandsBook Three of the Highlander seriesPublisher: AvonPublication Date: July 28, 2015Rating: 4 starsSource: eARC from Edelweiss***Warning: this is an adult book, and for the eyes of mature readers***Summary (from Goodreads):A bold, seductive laird meets his passionate match in a scintillating Highland romance from New York Times bestselling author Lynsay Sands...Sword fighting, swearing, and riding astride come naturally to Saidh Buchanan. Simpering and holding her tonguedefinitely not. Raised alongside seven boisterous brothers, Saidh has little interest in saddling herself with a husband... until she glimpses the new Laird MacDonnell bathing naked in the loch. Though she's far from a proper lady, the brawny Highlander makes Saidh feel every inch a woman.She has an angel's looks, a warrior's temper, and seeks out his kisses with wanton eagerness. Little wonder that Greer is intrigued by his comely guest. When reckless desire overtakes them, he's more than willing to make an honest woman of her. But Saidh is the target of a hidden enemy, and Greer faces the battle of his life to safeguard the woman he wants above all others.What I Liked:First, let's get the chuckles and giggles out of the way. YES, the cover is a bit cheesy. Very cozy, but very cheesy, reminiscent of the covers from thirty and forty years ago. Greer is definitely meant to be that big and muscular, but goodness. The guy on the cover is meaty. The cover definitely fits Greer and Saidh though - they are a passionate and steamy couple! But the cover is, um, cheesy. Hehe.Also, a huge thanks to my lovely friend Racquel for bringing this book to my attention! I would have passed it straight on Edelweiss, sadly, because of the cover. I know, bad Alyssa. Sad face.Saidh is the youngest of eight children, with seven older brothers. She knows how to ride a horse well, use a sword, and swear like no other. Saidh is sent to the MacDonnell properties (castle?) to comfort her cousin, whose fourth husband, Laird MacDonnell has just died. The new Laird MacDonnell (cousin of the dead one), is fierce and dominant, all power and strength and cleverness. Sparks fly between Greer and Saidh, and nothing stops their passion from igniting. But danger lurks in the castle, and Saidh is not safe within its walls. Was Allen (the former Laird MacDonnell) murdered? Is the murderer looking to kill Saidh?This book was HAWT, guys. Steamy, sizzling chemistry scorched the pages. Saidh and Greer see each other, fall in lust, have a few interactions, but then go straight after what they both want. Neither of them are afraid to give and take - even Saidh, who is unmarried and a virgin. I love this dynamic! Saidh doesn't see herself as ""ruined"" after being with Greer - good for her.I liked Saidh a lot! She is feisty and strong-willed - as she should be, with seven older brothers to fight with her. She manhandles Greer and proves that she isn't a light-skirt or simpering lady - not that she needed to prove this to anyone. She is neither of those things, and she owns it. A but of a tomboy who also discovers some of her more feminine qualities she didn't know she had, thanks to Greer.Greer is hilarious, and quite likable as well. He is nothing short of an alpha male, but he is also caring and sensitive, and never tries to change Saidh or make her dress or act a certain way. He likes her eccentricities, and he likes her. I liked him a lot!The romance is very steamy! I have not read the other two books in this series, nor any of Sands' other series/books, but I found this book to be quite sizzling in terms of chemistry and intimate scenes! But tastefully done by Sands. Very well-written! But besides the chemistry - the romance is really developed. It's insta-lust to a progression of feelings. I like that neither Saidh nor Greer admit to loving each other prematurely, and are totally aware of this. But they do fall for each other slowly, and it is very sweet!There is a mystery plot to this book! The romance is not the only important part of the book. Did Allen die of drowning by accident, or was he murder? And who is now trying to kill Saidh? Is Fenella's terrible record of husbands (she has buried four husbands in as many years) cause to believe that she is behind everything? Secret after secret is revealed, and the killer is not who we think it could be! I love the climax and the big reveal. I was pretty surprised about certain things!Overall, I really enjoyed this book! I want to check out Sands' vampire series - there are over twenty books in the series! But vampire adult romance novels might appeal to me, who knows. In any case,t this Scottish historical romance novel was pretty amazing!What I Did Not Like:I almost wish there were more suspects to choose from! I know that sounds weird. In the end, there were only three... it would have been interesting to add more players to the ""game"", to add layers to the suspicion. But then the book would have dragged on. So never mind?Would I Recommend It:I really enjoyed this book! If you're into historical romance, definitely give it a shot! ESPECIALLY if you're interested in Scottish/Highlander historical romance novels. I usually love Highlander novels! Tessa Dare has one to be published, I'm really excited for that one. Anyway, don't miss this one if you are a fan of Highland historical romance novels, for sure!Rating:4 stars. I'm so glad Racquel pushed this one on me! I wouldn't have thought to download it from Edelweiss at all. I've been craving a good Highlander romance recently! What would my life be without this book!? Thank you, Racquel!","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3FFQY5IIREAQZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062273590#wasThisHelpful","R3FFQY5IIREAQZ","A3KR1H0TMY05U4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3KR1H0TMY05U4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"***Review posted on The Eater of Books! blog***Even the Score by Kate MeaderBook One of the Tall, Dark, and Texan seriesPublisher: BrazenPublication Date: July 21, 2015Rating: 5 starsSource: eARC from NetGalley***Warning: this is an adult book, and for the eyes of mature readers***Summary (from Goodreads):He'll make her an offer she can't refuse...Actress Tess McKenzie is performing in the Tenth Circle of Showbiz Hell-dinner theater. All she really wants is to start a theater of her own. Then Tess receives an offer she can't refuse. She'll get her funding...if she pretends to be the fiance to her nemesis, Texan property tycoon Hunter Dade. If she's going to pull this off, she'll need all the luck she can get. Break a leg, indeed.On the verge of a big business deal, Hunter needs to hire a fiance. He hasn't quite forgiven Tess for ruining his wedding, but when their chemistry goes from combative to straight-up lust, the ""no sex"" clause in their mutually beneficial arrangement is tested. Which is a serious problem, because if Tess isn't careful, she'll go from breaking a leg to breaking her heart...What I Liked:This is definitely one of my favorite Brazen books ever! I don't think I've ever rated a Brazen with five stars, but this one deserves it. It isn't super long - under 300 pages - but it is magnificent. I loved it from start to finish. Certain aspects really jumped out at me, and I urge anyone who enjoys adult contemporary romance and/or Brazen's titles to read this one in two weeks!Tess is a struggling actress that wants to start her ow theater, on her own terms. When Hunter Dade crashes back into her life with a huge offer, Tess finds it difficult to refuse. Play fiancee for a weekend, and get a one hundred thousand dollar check. But there is history between these two - Tess was Jenna's best friend, Jenna being Hunter's former fiancee and bride-to-be. On Hunter and Jenna's wedding day, Jenna left him at the altar, and Tess was the one that broke it to Hunter. Tess and Hunter don't like each other - but that changes very quickly as things between them unexpectedly heat up...I had my doubts about this one, initially. The guy is going to fall for his former fiancee's best friend/roommate/maid of honor? That seems odd to me, even if it was a year ago (I think it was a year ago). BUT. Here's what I found out: Hunter is a Texan business, buying properties for a living, and his marriage to Jenna would have been a political-type one. A business arrangement, sort of. Which is why Jenna left him at the altar - she had been cheating on him for a long time. Neither of them loved each other, but Hunter really wanted the marriage, for the connections, as well as to have a socialite wife.Hunter is a complex guy. He grew up in a trailer park and sometimes still considers himself Texan ""white trash"", which is why he wanted a socialite wife. But Hunter is know a very rich businessman who buys properties. He's trying to buy a specific property from a man he knows, but he will have to procure a fiancee to convince the man that he is living a stable life (and isn't after the man's wife - which Hunter isn't anyway). I like Hunter a lot - he has a good heart, and he is persistent. Also, he is one sexy guy. Dirty talking, smooth, and super hot. He knows how to turn about the heat! Tall, dark, and Texan, he sure is.Tess is an actress, and she is smart, funny, and feisty. One thing I absolutely LOVED about Tess is her relentless attitude. Once Hunter ""hires"" her to be his fiancee, he adds a no-sex clause so that it wouldn't be unethical or he wouldn't have her feeling like he was taking advantage of her in any way. However, Tess has other ideas. She is persistent and keeps teasing him, never taking no for an answer when she knows they both want each other. She knows she has an effect on him, and has no problem flaunting her inner sex goddess. Outer sex goddess?This book is HOT. Let me tell you, it didn't matter how short this book was - the intimate (and/or dirty) scenes were numerous but unique and scorching. The chemistry between these two are basically on fire, and there is no extinguishing it at any point in the book. *fans self*Another thing that really jumped out at me was the writing style, and the humor. The way Meader wrote this book had it reading very wittily and snarkily (the latter of which is not a word), and with a fair amount of humor. Witty humor, which is my favorite type of humor. Love!I love the progression of Hunter and Tess's relationship. This book takes place in a weekend, give or take, but the relationship feels very full and developed. I didn't think there was insta-love present - maybe insta-lust (fine by me), but Tess and Hunter do not love each other in the very beginning. I was rooting for them since the scene in the theater though! And then they go and play engaged... Tess learns a lot about Hunter. And she gets a good look at his past and his inner self-deprecating attitude. But their relationship is a strong one, and the finish of this book is very strong.Overall, I really enjoyed this book. Clearly, since I gave it five stars. I don't dish out the five-star rating often, but there was something about this one! I've already reread it several times. *wink*What I Did Not Like:I can't think of anything at the moment that was terribly ""bad"" or not good... like I said in the beginning - you'd think this romance would be weird, given that it's a guy and his ex-fiancee's best friend. But no, it was not weird at all, and a great romance at that!Would I Recommend It:I would absolutely recommend this novel to all romance readers! Especially if you enjoy Brazen's books, definitely give this one a shot. This is my first Meader book and I will definitely be looking out for more from her! Especially from this series.Rating:5 stars. I love Brazen books, and this one is one that I will be recommending as long as I am able! I am so glad I did not pass on the opportunity to read it. Be sure that you don't either!","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1QIBEGGA4943V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YM591DQ#wasThisHelpful","R1QIBEGGA4943V","A3KR1H0TMY05U4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3KR1H0TMY05U4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"***Review posted on The Eater of Books! blog***Resonance by Erica O'RourkeBook Two of the Dissonance seriesPublisher: Simon & Schuster Books For Young ReadersPublication Date: July 21, 2015Rating: 4 starsSource: eARC from EdelweissSummary (from Goodreads):As a Walker between worlds, Del is responsible for the love of her lifeand the fate of millionsin this thrilling sequel to Dissonance.Del risked everything to save Simon, and now hes gone, off in another world with no way for Del to find him.Shes back at the Consorttraining to be a Walker like everyone in her family. But the Free Walkers have other plans for her. This rebel group is trying to convince Del that the Consort is evil, and that her parents are unwittingly helping the Consort kill millions of people. The Free Walkers make Del the ultimate promise: if Del joins their fight, she will be reunited with Simon.In agreeing, Del might be endangering her family. But if she doesnt, innocent people will die, and Simon will be lost to her forever. The fate of the multiverse depends on her choice...What I Liked:It's been a year since I read Dissonance! That book was one of my favorite books of 2014, with a gorgeous cover to match. Since then, the covers have been redesigned - I LOVE the original cover of Dissonance, but I definitely think these new covers are unique! Del's stars are great symbolism to place on the covers, and the light/dark contrast of the background throughout the series. Interesting! And I'm pleased to say that this book did not disappoint at all!Be warned, there may/will be spoilers for BOOK ONE - Dissonance. As always, I will do my best not to spoil anything occurring in this book. Keep in mind, what I consider a spoiler or not spoiler depends on perspective! Given that I've read this book, I'll have a good feel for what I'm revealing or not revealing. So you're pretty much safe from spoilers for Resonance! But not necessarily for Dissonance. If that makes sense.Del is still grieving from Simon's departure into a different world, but she refuses to believe that he is gone forever. When the Free Walkers reach out to Del and tell her that Simon might be safe, Del wants proof. Help the Free Walkers and see Simon - or work for the Consort. With Monty in an oubliette and Lattimer forcing Del to interrogate Monty about the ""weapon"" the Free Walkers have, Del knows what she will do. Worlds are at stake, lives are at stake, Del's life is at stake, but nothing will stop her from righting wrongs and stopping the destruction of the multiverse.Ahh, it feels like just yesterday, my heart was broken over Dissonance's ending. It didn't take long, once I started reading Resonance, for O'Rourke to piece my heart back together. Del finds out that there is a chance that Simon is alive and unharmed, and she fights to know more, to find him, to bring him back. So many secrets are revealed in this book, and many surround Simon.There were so many twists in this book, so many secrets! It felt like bombshell after bombshell was dropped, but in a good way (not overwhelming). A lot of things started to come together and make sense, which was really nice to see. I don't think readers are left with many questions by the end of the book - if any at all. I certainly didn't have any. I was too busy hugging my Kindle and squealing with giddiness.Del continues to grow in this book, and becomes more headstrong. She's impulsive and reckless, but by the end of the book, it's clear that she has matured throughout the series, though she remains impulsive and temperamental. I liked Del in Dissonance, and I liked her in this book. She might be impulsive, but she's a determined and strong young lady who knows how to make up her mind.I thought this was going to be one of those books where the male protagonist is absent for like, the entire book - but no so! Simon is very much present throughout the book, in one way or another. It's pretty interesting to see how O'Rourke brings him back into the story, and this occurs fairly quickly. So, fear not! Simon returns, and is a huge part of the story (not just in terms of the romance!). Simon is his usual hilarious, cocky self, and I loooooove him!The romance... ooo, so swoony! Seriously, this OTP is probably one of my favorites, to be honest. Del and Simon are magical together! And quite steamy, too. Simon is very laid back and a bit cocky, and Del is a rule-breaker and impulsive - the combination is really good! Both of them move worlds to find each other (literally though), and both of them love with their whole hearts (and not just each other - their family, friends, etc.). This series' romance is one of my favorites - the relationship is developed, no love triangle, and sizzling chemistry!The conflict in this book is so much more complex than the synopsis (and my own brief summary) leads on, and this is very well-written, in my opinion. As this series is only a duology, a lot of conflict and high stakes action occurs in this book. My heart was pounding in many places, and I couldn't finish fast enough! The scenes are engrossing and riveting and I was both hooked and terrified (terrified of what would happened if this happened/who might die/what if they got caught, etc.). O'Rourke did a great job with constructing the plot of this book!The ending is very satisfying, though it is not a happy-go-lucky ending. Everyone suffers somehow, most of all Del. But the ending is a good one, people. Trust me, it's a very satisfying ending - there's no way you can close this book and feel disappointed. This is definitely a series I'll want to reread in the future - if not immediately!What I Did Not Like:Not much that I didn't like, which always surprises me, when I can't think of something. Every book isn't perfect, but this one was quite amazing!Would I Recommend It:I highly recommend this duology. For one, it's only a duology (and there is a novella, Harmonic), so no more waiting. Two, the story is very intriguing and exciting. Three, the romance is beautiful and steamy at times. Four, the concept is super unique! The terminology I've not seen used in YA novels before, nor the musical basis to the parallel world theory (parallel worlds are not new to YA). I love how unique this series is!Rating:4 stars. A lovely conclusion to a fabulous duology! I'm so glad I decided to give Dissonance a shot (I don't usually like parallel worlds/alternate universes types of novels). This duology is definitely one of my favorites! I'll be pushing the series on everyone, just you wait and see.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3JVC156W1NU3K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=144246027X#wasThisHelpful","R3JVC156W1NU3K","A3KR1H0TMY05U4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3KR1H0TMY05U4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"There is an annual competition that allows PhD students to dance their research. The contestants, individually or in groups, present their research results in a choreography that gets evaluated by a jury. The first Dance Your PhD Contest, held in 2008, attracted significant interest from the media and on Youtube, and the number of applicants has been increasing ever since. Other Youtube videos extend a second lease of life to students dancing performances and staged choreographies inspired by scientific discoveries. In 1971, a football field at Stanford University became the scene of a large-scale molecular happening, in which more than one hundred performers staged the intricate molecular interactions involved in protein synthesis.These performances, of course, do not count as research, and they will not feature in a scientists resum. But anthropologist Natasha Myers takes them very seriously. In Rendering Life Molecular, she wants to expand what counts as science and science-making to include what she refers to as body-work or, in more technical terms, kinesthetic animations, haptic vision, molecular calisthenics, mimetic modeling, and other body experiments. She does so by paying attention to what otherwise may go unnoticed in scientific work: gestures and mimics, emotions and affects, metaphors and values, and other forms of life in the laboratory that are muted in other accounts of science-in-the-making.Bodies, play, and emotions have no proper place in a scientific lab. And yet, as one of Natasha Myers informants remarks, you cant learn something if you dont get your body involved. Touching, sensing, feeling, and knowing are entangled in laboratory research. Life science research is a full-bodied practice. The researchers moving bodies and their moving stories are integral to scientific enquiry. Lecturers encourage students in molecular biology to learn the fold of their molecule by heart, to trace the direction of each component by hand, and to be able to render it with their entire body. Researchers bodies become effective proxies for their molecules. Indeed, a cartoon reproduced by the author in her book opening features a male scientist twisting his body into the shape of a double helix, while his colleague sitting at his bench chides him: Very good, Michaelsyoure a DNA molecule. Now, get back to work.The most obvious sense that connects us to reality is seeing. And yet, seeing a molecule is not at all obvious. Protein molecules are so tiny that long waves of visible light pass right by them without registering their presence. The only way researchers can get a glimpse of their molecule is by transforming it into a crystal, collecting data on the position of each atom through a process known as X-ray diffraction, and working on the data to generate a model of the atomic configuration of the protein. Every step in this process is fraught with difficulties. Crystallographic techniques are far from foolproof, and almost every project is plagued by setbacks, failures, and detours. Not any crystal will do: viable protein crystals must be well-ordered to diffract X-rays. Protein crystals are not only hard to grow; they are also quite unstable and can disintegrate easily. Once crystallized, a molecule has to stand still through a kind of freeze-frame technique so the data can be collected.Once collected, the data has to fit into the model, which again involves many tweaking and adjusting. Molecule models are three-dimensional structures made up of thousands of atoms, and their configuration has to conform to the modelers intuition. Some models simply dont look right: they seem distorted, misfolded, and in pain; others look happy, relaxed, and well-folded. It takes a long time to develop the skill set required to feel the pain of a misshapen protein model. Tacit knowledge can only be acquired and communicated from body to body. Modelers have to exercise their synesthetic reason in an open-ended, improvisational, and intuitive mode. This process cannot be automated: it demands hands-on practice. This is why the laboratory retains the structure of the master-disciple relationship, with senior researchers cast in the role of the charismatic magician and PhD students playing the sorcerer-apprentice.Making crystallographic data visible in the form of electron density maps and molecular models allows the researcher to play with the data with the help of animated software. Three-dimensional models are essential visualization tools for teaching, learning, and research. But computers will never replace the feel for the molecule that patient work in the lab cultivates.  While today almost all crystal structures are built on-screen, physical models like the ones used in high school chemistry do retain their pedagogical value. Researchers can easily get lost in the map and forget the assumptions on which computer software are built. Leaders in the field are prompt to qualify the limits of the datathese are just models, and modelers must keep their interpretations open. Students are taught to distrust computer algorithms and to exercise expert judgment at every step of the model-building process.Protein crystallography is therefore more craft than science. The indirect nature of diffractive optics makes it necessary for modelers to get fully entangled with their instruments and materials as they rend imperceptible substances into visible and palpable forms. It is possible that a crystallographer will never find the perfect condition for a protein to crystallize; he or she may spend years in her PhD trying to set the conditions right. In one case, reported in a scientific paper, the researchers had to add one percent pickle juice ""from the Sweetand Snappy Vlassic brand"" to the crystallization mix. Experienced crystallographers regularly joke that protein crystallization requires ""voodoo magic. Some insist on playing techno music while they mix their biochemical media. Others have found that proteins will crystallize only if they are wearing their ""special sweater. Some even talk and sing to their crystal.  As Natasha Myers remarks, it seems in these contexts that magic, ritual, and superstition are not a 'threat' to science; rather, they are integral to its practice.""Laboratories are not just factories for the production of scientific facts; they are living spaces where practitioners engage the whole range of their human affects and senses. Myers focuses on one dimension of laboratory labor that is so often overlooked in accounts of the political economy of science. This is an attention to the affective labor involved in scientific research and training; a form of labor that is crucial to the work of producing and circulating valuable scientific facts. Affective labor is a concept developed by feminist scholars and political theorists to analyze forms of labor, such as nurture and care, which have historically been undervalued or otherwise made invisible. The laboratory researchers studied by Myers do not only take care of themselves and of others: they also cultivate a kind of ""care of the molecule"". They go to extraordinary lengths to ""keep their molecules happy"" and to nurture the perfect conditions for their protein to crystallize. A crystallographic model is not just ""matter of fact""; it is also a ""matter of care.This image of the laboratory as a nurturing and caring environment stands in stark contrast with the dominant view that emphasizes disembodied reasoning, competitive spirit, and economic rationality. Natasha Myers gives the example of the documentary Naturally Obsessed that documents how graduate students cultivate the ethos and habits they need to succeed in science. The story focuses on only one class of affects: competition, and an exclusive focus on result delivery. Winning the game in this rendering requires graduate students to solve the structure of a prized protein molecule before others beat them to it. In this context, remarks one student, one of the best thing that you can do as a scientist is suffer from obsessive-compulsive disorder. So that you become obsessed with a problem and cant stop working on it until you get to your answer. Indeed, as Myers notes, the figure of the obsessive-compulsive scientist is one whose ethos and habitus are perfectly tuned in to a neoliberal economy. As a recruitment tool for high school students, this documentary is itself a pedagogical device that can shape what its viewers come to think a life in science should be like.Natasha Myers wants to give a different image of science. Her book stems from a strong belief that there are other analytic frames and other ways of telling stories about the life sciences and lives in science. To use a clich, her depiction of science is more feminine, more attuned to sensations and affects, than the heroic masculine renderings of science-in-the-making. Her depiction of dancing molecules and epistemic choreographies is not fortuitous: she confesses that as a life-long dancer, my attentions were especially attuned to the relationship between movement and forms of knowing in science. She develops a new vocabulary to describe the role of the body in scientific work, turning tacit knowledge into explicit discourse. Rendering Life Molecular is also an epistemologically rich book, engaging in meaningful discussions with prominent authors in the field of science studies, such as Donna Haraway, Emily Martin, Lorraine Daston, and many others. Natasha Myers opens new venues for research: this is a book I will return to for close reading of chapters and added insights on what renders life molecular.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2P78P2VSETKZ9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0822358786#wasThisHelpful","R2P78P2VSETKZ9","A3IKQVN8N8AKRY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3IKQVN8N8AKRY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Camp David has become a shorthand for the summit that President Jimmy Carter convened in September 1978 between President Anwar Sadat of Egypt and Prime Minister Menachem Begin of Israel. Likewise, achieving a Camp David agreement has become synonymous with overcoming initial differences and reconciling opposing viewpoints through the sheer force of mediation and negotiation. Thirteen Days in September explains why this expression became reality. I am reviewing Lawrence Wrights book as part of a series on diplomatic negotiations, looking for clues on how to organize international conferences (see my previous entries here and here). This book doesnt deal with the form of the Camp David summit but with its substance: it is a kind of a Getting to Yes book, a How to Deal With Difficult People compendium, or a rewrite of Dale Carnegies How to Win Friends and Influence People. This being say, Thirteen Days in September does not take the form of a  case manual or a diplomatic textbook. It doesnt draw general lessons, and doesnt refer to other, Camp David-like experiences. A how to book or a self-help manual it certainly isnt.In fact, such a how-to book on negotiations already exists, and it was directly inspired by the Camp David episode. In the run-up to the summit, Cyrus Vance, himself a trained negotiator, asked his Harvard colleague Roger Fisher if he had any suggestion on how to handle the meetings dynamics. Fisher produced his last book, titled International Mediation: A Working Guide for the Practitioner, which he later transformed into a bestseller on negotiation techniques, Getting to YES, co-authored with William Ury. Members of the Harvard Negotiation Project, Fisher and Ury focused on the psychology of negotiation in their method, ""principled negotiation,"" finding acceptable solutions by determining which needs are fixed and which are flexible for negotiators. Giving such advice as separate the people from the problem, focus on interests, not positions, invent options for mutual gain"" and know your BATNA (Best Alternative To Negotiated Agreement), they insisted on trade-offs and mutual gains, on bargaining and win-win solutions.Negotiation theory assumes rational actors advancing their countrys national interest in an orderly fashion. But there was nothing rational about the actors at Camp David. They were full-blooded individuals, moved by passions and hatred, deeply held beliefs and sympathy. There even was a touch of insanity hanging in the air. Begin has had frequent bouts of depression and was constantly oscillating between exhilaration and despair. Sadat was unpredictable and was capable of strokes of genius as well as unmovable stubbornness. Even Carter, the cold-blooded engineer who liked to divide every problem into solvable parts, sometimes lost his temper and yelled at his guests in exasperated fashion. But perhaps the most deranged individual was the Egyptian delegate Hassan el-Tohamy, a former intelligence agent who also functioned as Sadats astrologer, court jester, and spiritual guru. According to Sadat, this Sufi mystic had something godly in him and he could see the unknown. He wold stand up at a dinner party and greet the Prophet Muhammad as if his ghost were physically present in the room. He constantly reported prophetic dreams or conversations he just had with angels. We all thought he was mad, Boutros-Ghali recalled. Worse, he would make erroneous reports to the leader, pretending an agreement to withdraw from occupied territories was at hand when in fact there was none. It is entirely possible that the Middle East peace process was set in motion by the misunderstanding of a madman, writes the author.Not only were there madmen in attendance: there were also terrorists at the table. As the saying goes, one mans terrorist is another mans freedom fighter, or a future head of state for that matter. As the author records, both Sadat and Begin had committed terrorist acts against the British in their struggle for national independence. In the words of Wright, they both had blood on their handsalthough it is not clear whether they themselves carried arms and planted bombs as opposed to masterminding attacks and terror acts. They had also spent long stretches in prison and in clandestinity, and were deeply schooled in the art of conspiracy. Begin, in particular, is portrayed as a political outcast who would had remained in the fringe of Israeli politics had he not been put center stage by the 1973 war launched by Sadat. Many Israelis considered him a crank, a fascist, or just an embarrassing reminder of the terrorist underground that stained the legend of the countrys glorious struggle for independence. Even Wright opines that the transformation of terrorism as a primarily local phenomenon into a global one came about in large part because of the success of [Begin's] tactics. He proved that, under the right circumstances, terror works. Many years later, American forces would find a copy of Begin's memoir ""The Revolt"" in the library of an al-Qaeda training camp. Osama bin Laden read Begin in an attempt to understand how a terrorist transformed himself into a statesman.The author frames the stakes raised by the threesome meeting in religious terms. Witness the opening sentence of the book: Three men, representing three religions, met for thirteen days at the presidential retreat of Camp David in order to solve a dispute that religion itself had largely caused. And Wright adds: The struggle for peace at Camp David is a testament to the enduring force of religion in modern life, as seen in its ability to mold history and in the difficulty of shedding the mythologies that continue to lure societies into conflict. But contrary to what Wright writes, these three men did not represent their religion in any way; nor did religion cause the Middle East quagmirepolitics did. This being said, it is true that religion added a complex dimension to the negotiation at Camp David.  Jimmy Carter, the Southern Baptist preacher, taught Sunday school every weekend from the age of eighteen on. As Wright reminds us, he had studied the Bible when he was a child, and the geography of ancient Palestine was more familiar to him than that of most of the United States. His decision to convene the summit despite the warning of his advisers and against his own political interest was religious in essence: he had come to believe that God wanted him to bring peace to the Middle East. In the book, he is often caught praying, while Sadat, also a deeply religious person, is portrayed as enjoying his nightcap of whisky.As Kissinger once remarked, great men are so rare that they take some time getting used to. The great foreign policy expert certainly took some time getting to Sadat: his first impression of the Egyptian president had been of a buffoon, am operatic figure. But after the Yom Kippur war Kissinger came to recognize Nassers instinctive genius for the bold stroke that could change history. Sadat had stunned Egypt by disposing of Nassers corrupt cronies and sending them to jail; then by expelling Soviet military advisers and reversing alliance to shift toward the US. He had then stunned the world by launching the Yom Kippur war in October 1973, the first time Arab armies were capable of inflicting serious losses to the Israelis on the battlefield; then by agreeing on a ceasefire while the Great Powers were on the brink of armed confrontation. His most stunning stroke of genius was his surprise visit to Israel and his speech at the Knesset. In political linguo, the unexpected visit of a statesman that turns the tables towards peaceful coexistence is called a Nixon in China moment. In all rigor, one should coin the adage that it takes a Sadat to talk to the Knesset. His speech was a mastery of rightful eloquence and uncompromising prose. Witness the opening: Let me tell you without the slightest hesitation that I have not come to you under this dome to make a request that your troops evacuate the occupied territories. Complete withdrawal from the Arab territories occupied after 1967 is a logical and undisputed necessity. Nobody should plead for that.Nassers insistence on complete withdrawal from these territories, including Arab Jerusalem, stands in stark contrast to Begins uncompromising stance on the issue: the West Bank, the Golan Heights, the Gaza Strip, and Sinai are all ours, was how is basic position could be summed up. During the discussions, he refused to even utter the name Palestinians for the reason that Jews are also Palestinians. He persisted in calling the West Bank by its biblical names, Judea and Samaria, appealing to Carters knowledge of the Scriptures to underline the claim that God had given the land to its Chosen People. He turned to rhetoric to point out that the formula legitimate rights is a pleonasm: either a right is legitimate, or it is not a right. At the end point, the summit came down to a single issue: the evacuation of the Sinai settlements, where Begin had vowed to spend his retirement.  All his arguments were justified by the goal of maintaining the security of Israel: Sinai had been a historic concourse for attacking armies; the Golan Heights had been the dominating redoubt for Syrian artillery; the West Bank was a hideout for terrorists. Why surrender any of it? Ignored in this reasoning, of course, were the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people, a formula Begin wouldnt even begin to hear.I mentioned by way of introduction that Camp David has become a generic expression. But the Camp David peace talks were a very specific event, one that doesnt lend itself to generalizations or applicable lessons. The main figures didnt play by the rule or apply a textbook approach to negotiation. They each came to the negotiating table with their own idiosyncrasies and personal histories. Carter thought he was on a mission from God and that, once they saw each others soul, his two guests would agree on a workable solution, with himself cast in the role of the facilitator. That illusion shattered within minutes of the first meeting of the three men. So Carter had to change his role to that of the coercer, someone who was willing to go beyond pleading and persuading to the point of issuing credible threats. The main threat, which was used repeatedly by the three men, was to leave Camp David and let the negotiation end inconclusively. But each character knew this would entail an enormous price, on a personal basis and at the level of their nation as well. Camp David also shows that, in the words of Boutros-Ghali, negotiating was more than sitting around a table: it was also a dialogue away from the table. The most meaningful exchange occurred on Day Six during a visit to the nearby Gettysburg National Military Park. Here the words of Abraham Lincoln echoed in each leaders mind, and reminded them of the enormous price wars extracted from nations.Lawrence Wright, the author of Thirteen Days in September, is a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist who specializes in international relations and Middle East issues. He doesnt express his opinions directly in the book, and never uses the word I. Some readers will try to guess his politics however, and may find him heavily biased against Menachem Begin. This negative bias may be due to the sources that he collected: memoirs, personal diaries, recollections, and interviews with key officials from the Carter administration as well as from Israel andless sofrom Egypt. Begin had few friends, even in his own camp, and his career after Camp David went downhill. Carter portrays him negatively in his diaries and in his memoirs. But in my opinion, if Wright has a bias, it may be due to his profession as a journalist and in his cultural background a an American. He adopts a can-do attitude attuned to Carters engineer mindset; he downplays the tragic dimension of life and the role of fate in conducting our destinies; despite his multiculturalist efforts, his misunderstanding of Islam stands in stark contrast to his familiarity with the Judeo-christian tradition; his taste for portraits and psychological analysis draws its tropes from US governments use of profiling that was exposed to the public during the WikiLeak scandal ; and his narrative mixing three strands of time seems straight out of an American novel. In other words, this is a piece of American journalism: other chroniclers steeped in a different professional or cultural tradition may have provided a very different narrative.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R12IO52HQV2KJD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0804170029#wasThisHelpful","R12IO52HQV2KJD","A3IKQVN8N8AKRY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3IKQVN8N8AKRY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Bretton Woods was the most important international gathering since the Paris Peace Conference of 1919. I read this book looking for clues on how to host international conferences: how to accommodate delegates, maintain protocol, overcome obstacles, build consensus, and reach a satisfying outcome. I was disappointed on that count. The Battle of Bretton Woods doesnt focus on the Bretton Woods conference per se. It is a work of intellectual history built around the two characters of John Maynard Keynes and Harry Dexter White. It describes the way these two Treasury officials negotiated the main financial issues facing the United States and the United Kingdom during World War II and immediately after: the Lend-Lease Act of 1941 granting the British access to war finance and equipment; the blueprints for a postwar monetary order that began circulating in 1942 and ultimately culminated in the adoption of the Articles of Agreement of the International Monetary Fund and the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development at Bretton Woods; the signing of the $4.4 billion Anglo-American Financial Agreement in December 1945; and the inaugural meeting of the IMF board of governors in Savannah, Georgia, on March 8, 1946. It mixes these elements of diplomatic history with personal aspects of the lives of the two main characters: Keyness inflated ego and lack of diplomatic acumen that resulted in missed opportunities for Great Britain; and Whites dual personality as the braintrust of the US Treasury and as a mole operating clandestinely for the Soviets.To be sure, there are some useful indications on the Bretton Woods conference itself. It took place in the Mount Washington Hotel in New Hampshire, a luxury resort with striking views of the White Mountains. The organization itself was a mess: everything is in a state of glorious confusion, commented British economist Lionel Robbins, who added: with all their virtues as techniciansand these are very greatthe Americans are not good organizers of international conferences. The conference took place in war time, and army bus and personnel brought the delegates in and out. Delegates were thrown out of the hotel on July 23 for fear they would reopen the discussion and have a closer look at the hastily agreed texts. The location itself owed a lot to domestic politics. US Treasury Secretary Henry Morgenthau wanted to court a local politician for future support of the agreement in the Senate, remembering the disastrous defeat of Wilsons League of Nations in Congress after World War I. The press was also in attendance, and Bretton Woods became one of the first international conferences to be covered live by the media. Most of the delegates came from Ministries of Finance or central banks, and true diplomatsthe ones hailing from Ministries of Foreign Affairswere a rare occurrence. The US Treasury Department had willingly kept the State Department out of the loop, and considered the only senior diplomat present, Undersecretary of State Dean Acheson, as one of them.The conference was only the tip of the iceberg: everything was set in advance, during the two years when plans were circulated and drafts were discussed. The invitations were sent to forty-four nations, but the United States ran the show from start to finish, and even British delegates were relegated to a secondary role. Keynes, who had termed the Reconstruction Bank scheme imagined by White the work of a lunatic,some sort of bad joke, was named chairman of the commission that drafted the Banks Articles of Agreement, while White himself dealt with the much more significant IMF. As for other nations, their input was limited to discussing the national quotas that would measure their relative power and influence at the boards of the two institutions or, in the case of the Cubans, to providing the cigars. Whites goal was to channel the energy, aims, ambitions, and vanities of the mass of delegates into meaningless debate. As an American organizer wily remarked, there should be just one general rule: that anybody can talk as long as he pleases, provided he doesnt say anything. To make things even safer, the session secretaries were all Americans, appointed by White, and it was they who wrote the official minutes of the committees. Some important remarks made during sessions disappeared from the draft minutes, while crucial provisions were introduced surreptitiously in the final text versions. As an example, Whites technicians strategically replaced gold with gold and dollars in the paper describing the foundations of the postwar monetary order, a crucial modification that Keynes discovered only after his departure from Bretton Woods.The result was, in Keyness words, the most monstrous monkey-house assembled for years. The distinguished Cambridge don liked that expression, and indeed often referred to non-Anglo-saxons as monkeys, with a special mention to the French which he utterly despised. But the monkey-king in this diplomatic jungle was certainly Keynes himself. Long before Paul Krugman and Thomas Piketty, Keynes was the first-ever international celebrity economist. He was surrounded by an aura of awe and admiration, and the printed media craved for his every declarations. In Benn Steils rendering, he had an effortless facility with words that might have made him a master diplomat, had he actually been more concerned with convincing opponents than with cornering them logically and humiliating them. The man is a menace for international relations, remarked fellow British economist James Meade, who nonetheless revered him. He would make aggressive jokes on lawyers in front of American lawyers, show his contempt for other delegates by displaying his immense intellectual superiority, and try to steal the show by pretending the outcomes of negotiations were all due to his influence while in fact they ran counter to his prescriptions. His last speech in Savannah, where he metaphorically summoned spirits and fairies to bestow the newborn institutions with their gifts, was taken as a personal attack by the American delegate: I do mind being called a fairy, he muttered to his aide.If a statesman is to be judged by his capacity to serve the national interest, Keynes failed miserably in his attempt at statesmanship. This is not to say that he didnt have Britains interest in mind. His visionary monetary schemes notwithstanding, he had ultimately come to the United States with the mission of conserving what he could of bankrupt Britains historic imperial prerogatives. As Schumpeter wrote, Keyness advice was in the first instance always English advice, born of English problems. Keynes was thoroughly British, and it was the British problems of his day that drove his theorizing: problems of deflation and depression, paying for war and surviving the perilous transition to peace. He had spent his career thinking about monetary issues as a way to preserve his countrys clout in the world. In particular, the shift of financial power from London to New York was a matter of constant concern for him. But he lacked the basic insight that the Americans did not share British national interests, and that they could even be rival powers on the international scene. Throughout the war, Keynes continuously overestimated American sympathies with Britain and underestimated the importance of public and congressional resistance to US aid or involvement. He thought of Bretton Woods as a battle of ideas, counting on his immense intellectual superiority to carry the day, whereas it was first and foremost a battle of power and influence, with the United States as the clear winner.Indeed, British and American interests were not identical, however much both peoples were dedicated to destroying Nazism. Henry White had a clear goal in Bretton Woods: to entrench the dollar as the worlds currency, and to make it as good as gold. He used the leverage provided by the Lend-Lease agreement and Britains quasi-bankrupt situation in order to put a permanent end to the pound sterlings international role. This required dismantling the structural supports of the British empire. In particular, Americans sought to put an end to imperial preference, by which Britain secured privileged trade access to the markets of its colonies and dominions. There was no room in the new order for the remnants of British imperial glory: the postwar world needed to be grounded in nondiscriminatory multilateral trade and full monetary convertibility. The Americans never deviated from their hard-line geopolitical terms. Many held no particular sympathy for the British, who had shamefully walked away from their Great War debt obligations, and who were trying to extend their Empires lease of life by credit. At Bretton Woods, we see American power in full swing, and in particular the role of the US Treasury as the economic arm of American foreign policy.Contrary to the myth, Bretton Woods did not provide the economic foundation for postwar prosperity and monetary stability. And it was not the cooperative, disinterested, forward-looking endeavor that people often have in mind when they stress the need for a new Bretton Woods. The Bretton Woods system didnt work the way it was supposed to. It was effective for only a brief period, and then not for the reason its authors had envisaged. It was not until 1961, fifteen years after the IMF was inaugurated, that the first nine European countries formally adopted the required provisions that their currencies be convertible into dollars. Even then, Bretton Woods was an ineffective and crisis-prone monetary system. It began experiencing potentially fatal difficulties as early as the late 1950s, and was only kept alive by a series of political fixes that made little long-term, macroeconomic sense. It could never have survived the globalization of finance and the removal of capital controls that began to take place in the 1970s. Indeed, it can be argued that the system was doomed the moment that it came into existence, and that the Bretton Woods agreements contained fatal flaws that could only lead to the abandon of gold convertibility.Not only was Bretton Woods a crisis-prone, unstable system: it was also a bad deal for Great Britain and, one could argue, for the United States and for the world as well. What Britain actually needed in 1944-45 was short-term financing at reasonable cost with few geopolitical strings attached, and possibly a lower exchange rate. There was evident hubris in the attempt to design a global monetary system, to be managed by an international body, at a time when the outcome of the war was not yet clear. Keynes and Whites ambition was to create a New Deal for a new world, but they lacked the political legitimacy and also the effective means to achieve such a grand plan. Another course of action was possible for the United Kingdom, one suggested by a British Treasury official after the facts: postpone the Grand Design negotiations, avoid irreversible decisions, try to buy time until you see how the new postwar world develops, and borrow your way out of the crisis by getting a commercial loan from Wall Street. Who at Bretton Woods would have thought that the British empire would unravel, the United States and the Soviet Union turn into arch-enemies, and the world divide into hostile camps just two years after the conference? There was no necessity to conclude Bretton Woods in a haste. Waiting for the San Francisco conference to address the issue  of money and finance jointly with the creation of the United Nations would have made the postwar institutional framework more coherent. The world would have avoided the dichotomy between the Bretton Woods institutions in Washington and the United Nations in New York, in which both seem to live on completely different planes.So are there practical lessons from Bretton Woods for statesmen and diplomats hosting international meetings, such as the Paris Conference on Climate Change that will take place in end-November and December 2015? First, as the previous attempt to tackle climate change at Copenhagen taught us, the summit itself is not the place where comprehensive negotiations should take place. Most items on the agenda should be solved beforehand, in preparatory meetings among experts or in a pre-summit rehearsal such as the UN General Assembly in New York. Second, organizers should make sure they keep a bone for the leaders and national delegates to chew, one that is easy enough to grasp and with a clear payoff in terms of national interest, such as the quota issue at Bretton Woods. Managing expectations and egos will always be a tricky issue, but one that diplomats are best equipped to handle. How to deal with the media is also a key issue, particularly in our age of instant communication and world broadcasting. Lastly, a modicum of modesty should be in order: the world is not going to be saved by international conferences, however successful they turn out to be. For Britain in 1944 and for the planet as a whole in 2015, buying time is always a sensible option.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2KYARXLQUHSGG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0691162379#wasThisHelpful","R2KYARXLQUHSGG","A3IKQVN8N8AKRY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3IKQVN8N8AKRY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As France prepares to host its largest international conference everthe Paris conference on climate change, or COP21--, I thought it might be wise to look at a previous event comparable in scale if not on substance: the high-level negotiations that took place in Paris during the first six months of 1919, as delegates from Allied countries gathered to give shape to the post-WWI world. This search for a precedent is quite natural: it is a standard move among students of international affairs and diplomats, who always look for relevant examples, models, and templates in order to understand and to shape the present. After all, many delegates in 1919 came to Paris with books devoted to the Congress of Vienna. The balance of power that Vienna created held for most of the nineteenth century. By contrast, the Paris conference, and the treaty of Versailles to which it led, only brought temporary peace, and was even accused of having planted the seeds of WWII.Richard Holbrooke, who masterminded the Dayton agreement and went on to tell the tale in To End a War, prefaced Margaret MacMillan's book for a reason: as a negotiation practitioner, he studied the Paris Peace Conference of 1919, as he did other international gatherings such as the Geneva talks that led to the end of the Vietnam war and in which he participated as a junior diplomat. This gave him practical insights to stage the Dayton negotiations that are the topic of his aforementioned book. Every detail mattered to him: the shape of the negotiating table (during the 1968 peace talks the Americans had wasted two months arguing over it with the North Vietnamese), the setting of the compound, the choice of audio channels for translation, the eating arrangements, etc. He may have borrowed from Paris in 1919 the recourse to ""proximity talks"", whereby the mediator moves between the different parties who rarely meet one another face-to-face. This negotiating technique was used for some sessions of the Paris peace conference, as chronicled by MacMillan.It is said that success is 10 percent talent, and 90 percent hard work. In international negotiations, much of the hard work occurs behind the scenes. Logistics plays a key part, although protocol agents and technicians are not often granted full credit for their contribution. Minor decisionsseating arrangements, the quality of the interpretation, the place where the delegations reside and the way they occupy their leisure timeall have important consequences over the outcome of a negotiation. The names of the treaties that stood up as products of the Paris Peace ConferenceVersailles, Trianon, St. Germain, Neuilly and Sevresall refer to posh places in the outskirts of Paris where meetings were gathered and documents were signed. These locations have kept their charm and distinctiveness to this day. They are certainly not the places that the French have in mind when they use the word la banlieue, although they are technically part of it.The reason Versailles was chosen as a location to sign the treaty with Germany was to wipe out the humiliation that had been imposed upon France by the Prussian victors in 1871. The signing ceremony itself proved a logistical conundrum. Each of the Great Powers was awarded sixty places in the Hall of Mirrors at the Versailles Palace. This gave rise to a hunt for tickets, some of them going at exorbitant prices on the black market. The press corps was also in attendance, and it was the first time a signing ceremony was filmed by cameras. Everything was conceived to humiliate the Germans. The train that brought them to France slowed down when it crossed the devastated battlefields where the war of trenches had been fought.  In Versailles, they were quarantined in the barracks where French leaders had stayed in 1871 while they negotiated with Bismarck. After one week, they were summoned to the Trianon Palace Hotel to be handed out the text of the treaty, with only a fortnight to take it or leave it. The terms were so harsh that even members of the British and the American delegations, including John Maynard Keynes, resigned in protest. At the gallerie des glaces, on June 28th, the two German delegates stood erect, heartsick, as if the hour of death had rang. An American compared the scene to a Roman triumph, with the defeated being dragged behind their conqueror's chariots.Even so, Margaret MacMillan makes the case that the Treaty of Versailles was not excessively harsh on Germany. It certainly didn't cause World War II. In Germany, the Diktat (dictated treaty) took the blame for all that was wrong with the economy: high prices, low wages, unemployment, taxes, inflation. But the reparations, which were set afterwards in 1921 and then continuously revised downward, were not a devastating blow: in the final reckoning, Germany paid less to the Allies than what France, with a much smaller economy, paid Germany after the Franco-Prussian War of 1870-71. The disarmament clauses didn't prevent the Weimar Republic and then the Third Reich to rearm on the sly. The war guilt clause, Article 231, which was denounced by German nationalists as the most shameful act of the peace of shame, was a standard clause that was also put in the treaties with Austria and Hungary, without becoming an issue.Other treaties negotiated during the Paris conference had more earth-shaking consequences. Empires disappeared, new nations were created, borders were redrawn, cities acquired special status. The treaty of St. Germain officially registered the breakup of the Habsburg Empire, recognizing the independence of Czechoslovakia, Poland, Hungary, and the Kingdom of the Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes (Yugoslavia) and ceding eastern Galicia, Trento, southern Tirol, Trieste, and Istria. It reduced Austria to a small state of 8 million people and allocated former non-German speaking territories to the new states of Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia. Under the treaty of Trianon, Hungary lost over two thirds of its territory to Yugoslavia, Romania and Czechslovakia. With the treaty of  Neuilly, Bulgaria lost about 10 percent of its land, including the southern Dobrudja and what it still had of western Thrace, along with its access to the Aegean. The treaty of Sevres abolished the Ottoman Empire and obliged Turkey to renounce all rights over Arab Asia and North Africa. Its Middle Eastern Territories were handed to British and the French as League of Nations mandate. Britain gained mandate of Iraq and Palestine. France gained mandate of Lebanon and Syria.In judging the performance of the peacemakers, a general law seems at work: the closer the territory, the more attention was paid to find workable solutions and equitable outcomes. The farther away from Paris (and from Western Europe), the more catastrophic the outcomes proved to be. The Great Leaders particularly botched their job when they dealt with non-European places, of which they knew little. Japan was allowed to pursue its land-grabbing policy in the Far East. In the Middle East, the seeds of future conflicts were sown, to which there seems to be no end in sight, even today. Even on the European continent, negotiators fell prey to national stereotypes and ethnic profiling. MacMillan reflects on their nineteenth-century preconceptions with a delight that shows these categories are still active in the twenty-first century: The Poles were dashing and brave, but quite unreasonable; the Rumanians charming and clever, but sadly devious; the Yugoslavs, well, rather Balkan. The Czechs were refreshingly Western.But even if Versailles and, to a letter extend, St. Germain, Trianon, Neuilly and Sevres are remembered as the outcomes of the peace negotiations, most of the action took place in Paris. This is where logistics comes in again, and what gives the French their main asset for hosting international conferences: Paris will always be Paris. Margaret MacMillan makes a great job of recreating the atmosphere that surrounded the delegates who took part in the negotiation: diplomats of course, but also outside experts such as intelligence officers (all the hotel rooms were rumored to be tapped), university professors whose expertise on regions and ethnicities was often kept idle, Wall Street bankers such as Thomas Lamont and Paul Baruch, journalists emboldened by Woodrow Wilson's point that open covenants of peace should be openly arrived at, and interlopers of various stripes who claimed to represent the interests of faraway nations and peoples. Almost exclusively men, they found in Paris a promiscuous atmosphere where many distractions were offered: the races at St. Cloud, excellent restaurants if you could afford the price, shows at the Opera, revues and cabarets, and ballroom dancing. As MacMillan notes coyly, attractive women had a wonderful time in Paris that year.Wherever the Paris Climat 2015 conference turns out to be a one-in-a-century event or a flop, there are some lessons to be learned from the six months that changed the world in Paris 1919. As Holbrooke notes in his foreword, flawed decisions can have terrible consequences, many of which haunt us to this day. Therefore, instead of playing God and taking part in the Creation, designers of a new international order should apply simple rules to limit the negative consequences of their acts: minimize regret, encourage reversibility, build in flexibility and adaptability, defer some decisions in time while front-loading others, go for low-hanging fruits and early harvests, etc. Most importantly, beware general principles, slogans and catchwords. Nowadays climate change negotiators have to grapple with the common but differentiated responsibility principle, which sheds more darkness than light.  In 1919, the buzzword was self-determination which was invoked like a mantra by all parties but offered little help in choosing between competing nationalisms. Of all the ideas Wilson brought to Europe, writes MacMillan, this concept of self-determination was, and has remained, one of the most controversial and opaque () Did he really intend that any people who called themselves a nation should have their own state? This interrogation is still valid today: with 16,000 existing ethnic groups (by some accounts), can one imagine a world with a similar number of independent polities?As for logistics, it is interesting to note that most of COP21 negotiations will take place in la banlieue: not the bourgeois cities of the south-west of Paris, where most of the post-WWI treaties were signed, but in the convention center of Le Bourget Airport, north-northeast of Paris, in the department of Seine-Saint-Denis. This will certainly contribute to the reshaping of the image of France abroad. In 1919, foreign delegates were impressed by Parisian insouciance, joie de vivre, and flirtatious promiscuity. For Puritan Americans whose country was entering Prohibition, the description of Parisian life brought back by delegates and journalists created dual reactions of attractions and repulsion. While a generation of rich American expatriates and bohemians settled in Paris to lead a life of sinful pleasure, others were confirmed in their isolationist tendencies by this image of decadent Old Europe. Similarly, Seine-Saint-Denis now stands in the mind of many Americans as synonymous with Muslim immigrants, derelict housing projects, urban riots, and the failure of the French republican model of integration. My sincere hope is that the success of the Paris Climat 2015 conference may eventually contribute to dispel such stereotypes and to give a more positive image of twenty-first-century France.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RDYMWKZC6CM3F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0375760520#wasThisHelpful","RDYMWKZC6CM3F","A3IKQVN8N8AKRY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3IKQVN8N8AKRY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Why didn't France plunge into terrorism in the early seventies when, at the same time, Italy, Germany, and Japan were shaken by the bomb attacks and political assassinations perpetuated by extreme left groups? What made France relatively immune to Euroterrorism, and how did French state institutions go through the Years of Lead unscattered? Why didn't the Gauche proltarienne and its armed wing emulate its comrades in arms from the Italian Brigate Rosse, the German Rote Armee Fraktion and Japan's Rengo Sekigun? The standard explanation--that the nations in question had been compromised by their fascist past--doesn't hold much sway. In his recent book on Maoist movements in France, Richard Wolin offer a competing explanation: France was comparatively spared by ultra-left terrorism because the French Maoists (who stood at the vanguard of the contestation movement) were intellectuals, because they were Normaliens (alumni from the Ecole Normale Suprieure) and because they were Jews. Again, I find these explanations unconvincing. I offer a third set of arguments: France overcame its radical surge because a Stalinist Communist Party and well-functioning Ideological State Apparatuses--the arch enemies of the gauchistes--actually won the day. This is a very different conclusion from what can be inferred from Wolin's book, which I nonetheless recommend.But first, let's review the arguments. Chroniclers of left-wing radicalism often argue that the sins of the fathers shall be visited upon the sons. The radical youth who fueled the contestation movement were in many respects seeking to win the antifascist struggle their parents' generation had lost, or to redeem their sense of self-respect after the complacency their elders had shown toward totalitarian regimes. This is why it is in Germany and in Italy (and also in Japan) that leftists crossed the line to engage in terrorist acts, whereas in France, despite gauchisme's popularity, similar tendencies were kept at bay. According to this line of reasoning, the repressed fascist past came back to haunt the present in the early seventies and influenced political perceptions in several crucial respects. It discouraged moderation and encouraged a culture of political extremism. It fed the belief that liberal institutions were chronically weak--hence, incapable of thwarting a fascist relapse. Italy's Red Brigades, Germany's Red Army Fraction, and Japan's United Red Army held the belief that bourgeois democracy and fascism were natural political bedfellows. Therefore, these groups adopted the strategy of attempting to ""unmask"" the fascist character of the state via violent provocations, which led to their criminalization and drift toward terrorism.This argument has several weaknesses. First, the call to subvert the powers that be, by any means necessary, was not limited to former fascist dictatorships. In fact, even in countries like the UK and the US with a rich democratic tradition and a proud history of antifascism, there were groups on the far left who called for the violent overthrow of the government. Revolution was in the air, echoed in the words of popular songs, and some people took these words seriously. The expression fascist pigs was coined and used generously around that time, and insults against capitalisms watchdogs in English-speaking countries matched in their imagination the lubric vipers and dactylographic hyenas used against their enemies by unreformed Communists on the European continent. Despite Maos contention that the wind from the east has triumphed over the wind from the west, the wind of revolt mostly blew from the west, and European student activists were certainly more influenced by the radicalism of US campuses and inner cities than by the obscure quotes from Chairman Maos Little Red Book.Second, it is wrong to oppose the French pristine past of antifascism to the tainted historical record of terrorist-prone nations. Although official history emphasizes the Rsistance on the homeland and the France libre led by de Gaulle in London, the reality is that the Vichy regime collaborated with Nazi Germany, going somewhat beyond the demands of the occupying forces. This collaboration was exposed by American historian Robert Paxton at about the same time student demonstrators were taking on French streets, and the leaders of the radical movement were very well aware of it. Hence their use and abuse of the fascist epithet, or their ill-fated comparison between police anti-riot brigades (the CRS) and SS troops. Although the Vichy syndrome prevented the public to recall the French government's active participation in the Holocaust, the generation of student activists were haunted by this repressed past. The campus radicals were acting out the fights against fascism that their elders had stayed clear from. This was also true for Jean-Paul Sartre, the prominent philosopher who was anxious not to repeat the political passivity he manifested during the Occupation and who therefore associated with the most radical of student leaders. If there was a return of the repressed, it took place in France and not in Germany, where the whole country bore the blame and atoned for Nazi crimes.Third, the argument that only countries tainted by their fascist past gave rise to ultra-left terrorism obfuscates the fact that France wasn't spared by the Euroterrorism wave. Action directe was a French revolutionary group which committed a series of assassinations and violent attacks in France between 1979 and 1987. They were inspired by a mix of Marxism-Leninism and anarchism with, for some of them, a direct link to Maoist cells. They were no less radical in their outlook, violent in their methods, and nihilistic in their aspirations than their partners in crime in other European countries. They were disbanded and their leaders put under arrest at the end of the eighties, after having orchestrated a series of assassinations and terror attacks. Although their actions were widely condemned, the French public shows a surprising complacency for the crimes and lifestyle of outlaws inspired by radical ideology. Jacques Mesrine, a hardcore criminal, courted the sympathy of the public in the late seventies by claiming that his crimes were politically motivated. The bloody runaway shoot-out of Florence Rey and Audry Maupin in 1994 caused the death of three policemen and a taxi driver, but the couple nonetheless became an icon of the counterculture because they had read the literature of the Situationistes.So the question really boils down to this: what prevented most radical militants to turn to terrorism as a continuation of their fight by any means necessary? Why were they extremists by words but not by deeds? It is here that Richard Wolins detailed history of the Maoist movement in France is useful, not for the answers that he brings, but for the picture that he provides. For him, May 1968 and the social upheavals that followed were a turning point in French social, political, and intellectual life. French Maoism, which spanned the years 1966-74, was a relatively minor episode in that story. Caught completely off-guard by the May uprising, the Maoist leadership elected to condemn it. They subsequently divided between a political avant-garde, advocating armed struggle and ""terroristic nihilism"", and a ""libidinal branch"", favoring ""Revolution now!"" and the politics of everyday life. For Wolin, the second movement had the most lasting consequences: ""just as in the nineteenth century the Industrial Revolution marked the entry of 'work' into the public sphere, May 1968 marked the entrance of 'everyday life'"". Colin credits May 1968 with operating a ""revolution in everyday life"" and with rediscovering the virtues of ""participatory politics"": ""the prior rigidity of social relations disappeared, symbolic hierarchies were loosened, a new humanitarian consciousness concerning civic responsibility for disenfranchised social groups emerged."" It is a political orientation that the author fully associates with: from an American academic perspective, the intellectual ebullience of Parisian life certainly seems attractive.According to Wolin, three factors prevented the Maoists to plunge into terrorism: their intellectualism, their elite upbringing, and their Jewish origins. ""When the chips were down, many militants found it difficult to simply jettison their training in the classic texts of French humanism and assume the role of urban guerrillas."" Some underwent the long march through the institutions and ultimately joined the Green and Socialist parties, or evenas with Philippe Sollers, from the literary group Tel Quelthe forces of conservation. The many Normaliens who formed the backbone of the movement considered their four-year stipend at the Ecole normale suprieure as a subsidy to engage in revolutionary activities. When they graduated from the ENS, they moved to more scholarly pursuits. Lastly, for several ex-gauchistes, reconnecting with their long-repressed Jewish origins became a means of providing meaning and orientation once the wave of left-wing revolutionary fervor had subsided. As with Benny Levy, founder of the Gauche proltarienne and secretary to Jean-Paul Sartre, their intellectual odyssey led them ""from Mao to Moses"", as they metamorphosed from ""Jewish radicals"" to ""radical Jews"". For intellectuals, Normaliens, and French Jews, the mechanism often was the same: ""from a social-psychological standpoint, Maoism allowed a gifted contingent of French youth to resolve problems of identity formation amid a turbulent and confusing era.""The picture Wolin draws, however, tells a different story. He begins his narrative with a showdown at Bruay-en-Artois where radical groups considered resorting to mob justice to avenge the rape and murder of a working familys daughter. Some advocated the formation of peoples tribunals to compensate the class bias of bourgeois justice. Others, including Michel Foucault, believed such trials represented too much of a formal constraint on the spontaneity of popular will, and favored direct action instead. Jean-Paul Sartre spilled oil over the fire by calling on the spirit of Robespierre who decreed that under revolutionary circumstances, terror was a manifestation of virtue. In fact, for Sartre, the revolutionaries of 1793 probably didnt kill enough, and modern communists needed to become more stalinist, not less.It is here that I would credit the two arch-enemies of the gauchistes, the Communist Party and the repressive state, with preventing the formation of a terrorist movement in France. Orthodox communists still attracted a good deal of popular support in France. For decades, the French proletariat's interests had been well served by the Parti communiste franais and its trade union allies. For the most part class conflict had been successfully institutionalized. This is why the Maoists' efforts to reach out to factory workers fell completely flat on the proletarians they were supposed to mobilize. Workers simply didn't pay attention when Jean-Paul Sartre and Simone de Beauvoir handed out La Cause du Peuple, the Maoists' newsletter, at the exit of Renault's factory, or when young intellectuals became etablis and abandoned their studies to work as blue-collar workers in industrial workshops.Lastly, France benefited from a well-functioning police and an efficient state apparatus. In May 1970, Interior minister Raymond Marcellin summarily banned the Gauche proltarienne and stomped on clandestine cells. Political militancy eventually landed dozens of Maoist activists in French prisons. Wolin sees this as an egregious mistake: it gave instant publicity to an ultra-minoritarian group and won then the support of prominent media figures and intellectuals, from Jean-Paul Sartre to Michel Foucault. In prison, the Maoist activists wasted no time and started investigating--that is, undertaking enquetes ontheir new surroundings. But it can also be argued that France's repressive state nipped in the bud cells that were comploting against society, and prevented the formation of a terrorist movement. This tradition of state surveillance and police control lives on. It certainly explains why France was relatively spared by Islamist terrorism despite having a large Muslim populationradical Islam and blind terror by Islamist militants is a cause that certainly attracts less sympathy among French intellectuals than the Maoists of yesterday.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2G34CFGZQ3U7U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0691129983#wasThisHelpful","R2G34CFGZQ3U7U","A3IKQVN8N8AKRY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3IKQVN8N8AKRY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Many extreme reactions to this book, as evidenced on this website, are in fact reactions to its title. For the lay Indian reader, especially for those who associate with Hindu nationalist ideology, Indian civilization is certainly not a myth. Pretending the contrary, or simply raising the question, as Sanjay Subrahmanyam does in his book's title, can only be perceived as a provocation or as an insult. These readers reaction is perfectly understandable: they reject the book wholeheartedly, and refuse to read any further. In order to give this book a chance, however, it may be well advised to move beyond the shock value of the title and to read it with an unjaundiced eye. In fact, Subrahmanyams book bears a different title in the French edition that I read. The French title and subtitle better reflect the content of the book: it offers Lecons indiennes by delineating the itineraries of a historian, listing four global locations: Delhi  Lisbonne  Paris  Los Angeles.It would be a pity if readers were misled by the title to reject the book without giving it a chance, or to hold a prejudiced view on Sanjay Subrahmanyans positions. For the author is, first and foremost, a historian, steeped in the methods of archival research and patient interpretation of facts. History is not intended to provoke, to enrage or to disturb, but to establish facts and offer reasoned interpretations. Is Indian Civilization a Myth? is intended to provide the general reader with the perspective of a professional historian, based on the tools of the trade but without the cumbersome apparatus of scholarly productions. It is defined by the author as a book without footnotes, written with the general public in mind and geared toward a mostly Indian audience, although these Indian lessons were also translated into French, as were all the other books written by Subrahmanyam.Some chapters reflect the authors engagement with history as a scholarly discipline, and allude to academic debates in which the fate of different schools is discussedsubaltern studies, cultural studies, global history, post-colonial theory. Other chapters collect book reviews or discussions on literature and testify to the authors long-standing interest in literary criticism. In these columns, first published in newspapers or magazines, Subrahmanyan doesnt hesitate to take a stand, which is often critical of the authors work under review. He also makes no secret of his political leaningsand here, the strong reactions of BJP readers appear somewhat justified, for the author has only contempt for the Hindutva ideology. A third set of chapters are essays in ego-history. There Subrahmanyam gives indications about his family background, his Delhi upbringing, and the various places and academic settings in which he has pursued his career.The opening chapter, eponymously bearing the books title, is considered the most offensive by readers who see the whole enterprise as an attack on Indian civilization. It is true that the author doesnt refrain from harshly criticizing the BJP ideology, deriding the Hindutva movement and turning into ridicule the followers of the RSS clad in khaki shorts. If a myth there is, it is to be found in their vision of India as a stable and pure entity that was corrupted by foreign invasions and Islamic domination but that will rise again by returning to its roots. It is in that sense that the Indian civilization heralded by Hindu nationalists and ideologues is a myth, a construct, a fabrication. It turns history on its head: it makes time flow from the present to the past, and brings into existence traditions that never existed but in the imagination of their inventors. It selects whatever sources it sees fit, and mostly relies on nineteenth-century categories brought forth by imperial England.It is against this vision of a closed and atemporal India that Subrahmanyam writes. The India he attempts to describe is not an essence, it is a process. It is not a rock or a land mass, it is a flowing river. It is not a closed fortress closed by walls; it is a crossroad, an open field, a meeting place. It is not the land where never the East and the West shall meet; it is a mix of Eastern and Western influences, of Southern and Northern traits, inextricably interwoven. The idea of purification and returning to roots is anathema to him. There is no passage to India: India itself is a passage, a gateway, a bridge. Indian civilization, like the West, is less a cultural area than an idea, an ideology, a myth. It is what people make of it. India is just like the knife from which one has changed the blade and then the handle: it stays the same by becoming different. And like a knife, it can be used as a weapon to exclude, to oppress, to negate.The market for India is also on the rise in the United States. New departments of Indian studies are being created in American universities, and Indian (female) professors specializing in postmodern studies or critical theory fit the hiring requisites of politically-correct academic committees. (The following message recently went viral on Twitter: She decided to teach postcolonial theory instead of seventeenth-century poetry. Because, you know, easier Said than Donne.) Subrahmanyam shows postcolonial studies for what they really are: an academic carnival, an attack on sense and decency, a license to kill any pretense to academic rigor. Worse, they lead to the marginalization of other strands of research, no less critical of colonialism, that suddenly find themselves excluded from the intellectual marketplace. Far from escaping from empire, postcolonial theory stays hostage to the culturalism and national narrative that it ostensibly denounces. It is an American product through and through.Meanwhile, studies on India made in India by Indian scholars have declined and have lost almost all academic visibility globally. They have fallen victim to the budget cuts in Indian universities and the passing fads on the global academic market. One consequence of this is that sources and archives in languages other than English are being neglected by the vast majority of researchers, resulting in a narrowing of the research scope. Even global historya recent fad that the author rejects, although he is often put into this categorycan be criticized for its monolingualism: globalization is seen exclusively through English sources, and through the prism and categories of the English language. How can one write a history of India, or survey Indian literature, without a familiarity with vernacular languages? These include Hindi and Bengali, of course, but also Dravidian languages such as Tamil and Telugu, as well as the languages in which sources are available: ancient languages and scripts now disappeared, such as Pali and Sanskrit, as well as the archives of the empires and colonial powers that intervened on the Indian subcontinent. Subrahmanyam, for one, studied extensively Portuguese sources, and published columns and articles in Tamil.Forming the second category regrouped in this volume, Subrahmanyams book reviews and essays on literature are distinctive for their negative tone. He displays the art of the savage critique, the vitriolic attack, the scathing review. He is brutally honest and straightforward. His targets include a roster of prominent Indian figures: Ramachandra Guha, the most popular historian of contemporary India: Ashis Nandi, a social scientist with a huge followership akin to that of a guru; Aravind Adiga, the recent winner of the Booker prize; and others. Even individuals which whom he feels close and shares basic values are not spared by his criticisms. He blames Martha Nussbaum for her narrow vision of the Indian intellectual landscape, which she reduces to the three figures of Tagore, Gandhi, and Nehru. He sums up his chapter on V. S. Naipaul with the title: Pride and Prejudice, the two traits that he sees define the Trinidad writers worldview. He highlights Gabriel Garcia Marquezs cult of his own personality and fascination for celebrity, which led him to associate with pop singer Shakira. Reviewing Rushdies Satanic Verses, he states that the pages on the birth of Islam, which caused so much outrage in the Muslim world and led to the fatwa condemning the author, are among the weakest and the most preposterous in the book. With a friend like this, who needs enemies?In addition to surveying history and reviewing books, Subrahmanyams collection of essays depicts his itinerary as an academic, from India to Portugal, France, and the United States. His description of the Delhi School of Economics, where he completed his undergraduate and graduate studies, is especially valuable. It was one of the high temples of social science in post-independence India, where economists would work side-by-side with anthropologists and historians. But even then, bright students would move to Oxford, Cambridge, or the US to complete their PhD studies. Subrahmanyam chose to stay, and to pursue his thesis in economic history after having received a sound training in economics. One of his junior teachers was Kaushik Basu, who is currently the chief economist at the World Bank and a prominent microeconomist. Subrahmanyam also spent almost a decade in Paris at the EHESS, the birthplace of the Ecole des Annales and a hotbed of academic creativity; but he confesses he was disappointed by its provincialism and its incapacity to follow the times. He was also somewhat disappointed by France, and writes his recollection of the time spent in Paris as an ambiguous Parisian who was at once fascinated and repelled by the Frenchs lack of civic sense and indulgence for ultra-left extremism. He would certainly find the extremism displayed by the reviews on this website equally repelling.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3KJ9QK1K62FQQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=8178243709#wasThisHelpful","R3KJ9QK1K62FQQ","A3IKQVN8N8AKRY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3IKQVN8N8AKRY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Have you ever been tempted to eavesdrop on a psychoanalyst's conversation? Not in a therapy session of course: these conversations are private, and they usually take the form of the patient talking and the analyst listening. But psychoanalysts also talk about their trade in professional associations, congress meetings, or interviews. This public discourse is what interests Kate Schechter in Illusions of a Future. As an anthropologist-in-training, she took as her dissertation topic the psychoanalytic community in Chicago, going through their local archives and interviewing key members. Combining ethnography, history, and theory, she went beyond participant observation and archival work: she herself underwent psychoanalytic training, and is presented on the book cover as being ""in the private practice of psychoanalysis and psychotherapy in Chicago."" According to Dr. Schechter (and here the title ""Dr."" refers to her PhD, not to her qualification as a medical doctor), there are three remarks that are often made by psychoanalysts when commenting on the activity of their peers. ""Where does she get all her analytic patients?"" ""It's not psychoanalysis."" ""It's all about the relationship."" Three mechanisms are at play in these remarks: envy, denial, fetishization. Let us consider each of them in turn.Psychoanalysts nowadays suffer from a bad case of patient envy. The majority of psychoanalysts in the United Statesand the Chicago practitioners are no exceptionhave only one or two patients in actual psychoanalysis. Some of them achieve to get a higher number of subjects in analysisdefined as a demanding regimen of intensive, four-times-a-week introspective sessions on the couch pursued over a period of several years. A lesser intensity and frequency means that a treatment is expressly not psychoanalysis but rather psychotherapy. Measured by that rigid standard, most psychoanalysts nowadays only have one or two analytic patients in tow, if any. The other patients who visit them are here for therapy or counseling. They don't sit on the couch, they don't consult three or four times a week, and the expect answers to their problems from their analyst, not just passive listening. But psychoanalysts don't think of themselves as therapists or counselors. They are in the business of getting analytic patientshence their envy for the analysts who ostensibly attract a higher number of analysands.So most of what psychoanalysts do is ""not psychoanalysis"". How today's psychoanalysts manage to maintain their professional identity while they cannot practice what they preach is the topic of Kate Schechter's ethnography. Finding, making, and keeping analytic patients when there are none has become an existential challenge for Chicago psychoanalysts. Some blame the patients themselves: ""people simply don't want to do the work anymore,"" says one. ""Psychoanalysis is too rigorous for people today; patients want a quick fix, they want symptom relief as opposed to enduring structural change,"" says another. Others blame the system: in the era of psychopharmaceuticals, managed care, and cognitive-behavioral therapy, psychoanalysts have to demonstrate value as defined by neoliberal medicine. After World War II, generous medical insurance plans and government programs funded psychoanalysis because it was the only treatment for anxiety and depression that was available. By the 1980s however, with costs in medicine exploding and numerous new and cost-effective pharmacological treatments of anxiety and depression emerging, the psychoanalytic talking-cure has come under attack as ineffective, unaccountable, and wasteful.Psychoanalysts overall take issue with the epistemic universe of managed care and evidence-based medicine. Historically, many psychoanalysts have viewed quantitative and behavioral research with disdain. They strongly reject the categories of the DSM-V, which explicitly excludes psychiatric notions based on Freudian theory. Nonetheless, psychoanalysts have to find ways to negotiate with the insurance companies and managed care organizations that will allow them to preserve their practices and their sense of autonomy. They report their cases using DSM diagnoses and CPT codes to keep records and submit to out-of-network benefits. Some analysts insist among one another that they are doing psychoanalysis but nonetheless code for psychotherapy because most insurance plans will cover psychotherapy (90801) but not psychoanalysis (90845). They use numbers to quantify the frequency and duration of analysis, basically responding to corporatized health care on the enemy's terms. Some even craft their defense using the audit practices and scientific methods of neoliberal medicine: ""We need to start speaking the language of evidence-based psychology,"" advocates one. Others remain strangely in between, tinkering with categories and practices, like this analyst who reports having ""four and a half"" patients under analysis.Psychoanalysts also have to grapple with issues of deskilling, feminization, and the lower status of mental health professions. One interviewee bemoans this loss of status: ""There's been an enormous change in the whole character of the profession. People used to wear ties. I think someone who is a doctor, someone who's seeing patients, should."" The fact is that being a medical doctor is no longer a prerequisite to become an analyst. From the late 1930s until a 1989 lawsuit, the psychoanalytic regulating body held firm to the view that psychoanalysis was a medical science and that only physicians should practice it. Now the profession is open to psychologists, social workers, group therapists, family councillors, and other kinds of care providers. The only requisite is that they follow a full analytic talking-cure provided by a training analystin fact, analysts-in-training may be the last patients willing to submit to the strict discipline of the traditional analytic cure. Once trained, these therapists offer various kinds of services, from child psychology to group therapy or marriage counseling. They develop these psychotherapeutic activities ""in a psychoanalytic way"", based on their training and understanding of the discipline, but for the purists and guardians of the profession, ""it's not psychoanalysis"".So let's sum up. A growing number of analytically-trained professionals compete for a dwindling number of patients ready to subscribe to the whole analytic course: four weekly sessions, the use of the couch, the interpretive resolution of a transference neurosis, a proper termination. Most psychoanalysts practice some kind of psychotherapy that is, by their own recognition, ""not psychoanalysis"". They envy those who are able to secure proper patients, and deny that their profession as a whole might be to blame. Another mechanism is at play here: the logic of the fetish, the denial of a feared absence through a replacement with a substitute presence. Fetishization takes the form of the emphasis on the importance of the relationship between the analyst and her patient. This personal relationship was deemed nonessential by the founding fathers of psychoanalysis. What mattered was ""transference"", that artificial illness whose resolution by interpretation led to psychoanalytic cure. The analyst's ostensibly technical work was reading and interpreting the transference neurosis. In more recent years however, the relationship itself has come to be seen by many psychoanalysts as curative.Kate Schechter shows that the opposition between these two logicsthe orthodoxy of transference, and the heterodoxy of the relationshipgoes back to the origins of the Chicago school of psychoanalysis. I will not try to summarize her history of the debates between the two ancestors, Lionel Blitzsten and Franz Alexander, as well as the constant infighting between their disciples and epigones. Based on archival work, her analysis straddles several disciplines: the sociology of the professions, the history of scientific knowledge, the anthropology of medical care, and psychoanalysis itself. This is not just local history: the Chicago school of psychoanalysis was the most important one west of New York City, and the quarrels between its founders echo wider debates in the discipline. But I found this historical part less interesting than the firsts chapters when the author eavesdrops on psychoanalysts bemoaning the lack of proper patients, the elusive nature of psychoanalysis, and the growing importance of the human relationship between analyst and patient.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RL83J5WJUXDZE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0822357216#wasThisHelpful","RL83J5WJUXDZE","A3IKQVN8N8AKRY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3IKQVN8N8AKRY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If we include Japanese sources, there is such an extensive literature on Japans economy and society that the bilingual observer is often at a loss. She can make this literature accessible to non-Japanese readersby translating, summarizing, contextualizing. Or she can collect her own primary dataespecially in the field of ethnography, where the main insights are supposed to originate from fieldwork. Anne Allison's book does both, but in an unsatisfactory manner. Its topicprecarity and precariousnessdoesn't lend itself easily to fieldwork. How do you observe a feeling, a mood, a sentiment, or a lack thereof? How do you assess the wayas Allison defines her topic ""relations with othersof care, belonging, recognitionare showing strain but also, in a few instances, getting reimagined and restitched in innovative new ways""? Having had limited time to conduct fieldwork, Allison had to rely on other people's observations: activists, commentators, social workers, or critics. But she fails to give proper credit to these domestic observers of precariousnessand in particular to build a theory informed by local categories and debates. Instead, she imports the latest fads in social critique and peppers them with Japanese terms to add local flavor, without engaging Japanese thought seriously.How do you observe precariousness? The answer, for anyone living in Japan, is pretty straightforward: open a newspaper, and you will read many accounts of life at the edge. The ""shakai"" (society) section of newspapers is full of reports on precarious employment (dispatch, contract, day labor), on elderly people living and dying alone (kodokushi), on young people withdrawing from society (hikikomori), on poverty gnawing at the life of the most vulnerable: single mothers, school dropouts, foreign workers, social outcasts, laid-out salarymen, etc. ""Life, tenuous and raw, disconnected from others and surviving or dying alone: such stories cycle through the news these days,"" remarks the author. Next to the serious reporting on social ills come the sensationalized news items making headlines: ""mothers beheaded, strangers killed, children abandoned, adults starved."" Japan is the country where social pathologies bear indigenous names: ""otaku"" live in a fantasy world of anime characters and online chatrooms; ""hikikomori"" retreat in the private space of their room, withdrawing from school or workplace and avoiding social contact; ""netto kafe nanmin"" are mainly flexible or irregular workers who, with unsteady paychecks and no job security, are unable to afford more permanent housing and dwell in PC cafes for a low fee.Likewise, there is not a lack of social commentary, of people analyzing these trends to draw general lessons or recommendations for Japan's future. According to observers, ""Japan is becoming an impoverished country, a society where hope has turned scarce and the future has become bleak or inconceivable altogether."" Precarity not only affects labor conditions but life as well: it is ""a state where one's human condition has become precarious as well."" There is a rich vocabulary that describes the difficulties of life (ikizurasa) in contemporary Japan: the insecurity (fuan, fuantei), dissatisfaction (fuman), the lack of a place or space where one feels comfortable and ""at home"" (ibasho ga nai), the connections (tsunagari) and sense of belonging disappearing from society (muen shakai), the poverty of human relations (ningenkankei no hinkon), the withering of social links (kizuna), the incapacity to achieve an ""ordinary lifestyle"" (hitonami no seikatsu), the absence of hope (kib ga nai), the despair (zetsub). For the Japanese, these terms are highly evocative, and together they paint a bleak picture of a society that has lost its balance. For non-Japanese speakers, the Japanese words add a new repertoire of social conditions that may help put their own society into perspective.Anne Allison uses several metaphors to describe the current state of Japan under precarity. The first is a bellicose one, a paradox in a country that has banned war in its constitution. Japan is a society at war with itself. More specifically, the country is at war with its own youths, sacrificing them as refugees. According to human rights activists, it is a war that the state is waging by endangering and not fulfilling its commitment to the peoplethat of ensuring a ""healthy and culturally basic existence"" that all citizens are entitled to under Article 25 of the Constitution. When the outside world is seen as a war zone, people take refuge at home or in an imaginary world. In 2007, the monthly magazine Ronza published an essay titled ""Kib wa sens"" (Hope is War), in which a young part-time worker described all the humiliations his generation had to endure and concluded by placing his hope in a nationalist war that would restore his sense of masculine dignity and pride. Nobody really advocates war and the return to militarism in Japan; but nationalism is clearly on the rise, and right-wing extremism has found in Internet forums and discussion channels a new venue to vent its regressive agenda. Social scientists describe this reaction as paranoid nationalism: ""when, feeling excluded from nation or community, one attempts, sometimes violently, to exclude others as well."" The most extreme form of this self-destructing drive is given in the random murder incidents by demented youths who kill passersby as a form of protest.The second metaphor that runs through the text is the idea of grief and mourning. Here the author draws from Judith Butler, the famous feminist scholar who, drawing herself from Jacques Derrida, has written about the grievability of all life and lives. As Butler writes, ""there can be no recognition of a person's life without an implicit understanding that the life is grievable, that it would be grieved if it were lost, and that this future anterior is installed as the condition of its life."" Without grievability, there is no life or, rather, there is something living that is other than life. But not all lives are equally grievable: when people live and die alone, nobody is there to register their death (as in the case of the ""missing centenarians"", who were found to be deceased and unreported by their families who kept the pension payments for themselves.) What counts and who counts as having a grievable life is increasingly dependent on economic calculation and state action. It is the prerogative of the modern state to ""make live and let die"" (Foucault), and never is this new biopolitical landscape more apparent than in the neoliberal injunction to pursue self-reliance, self-independence, and self-responsibility (jik sekinin) as a positive agenda.The third metaphor that creeps in the last chapter is the invasion of mud. The author was knee-deep in it when she volunteered to clean ditches in Ishinomaki after the earthquake and tsunami that hit the Thoku region on March 11th, 2011. As Allison aptly describes it, ""the tsunami rendered the entire northeast coastline a cesspool of waste: dead remains and dying life entwinedanimals, humans, boats, cars, oil, hours, vegetation, and belongings."" Cleaning up the mess was devoted to the Self-Defense Forceswhose members in uniform had never been so conspicuous in Japanese society, assisted by the US Armed Forces engaged in Operation Tomodachi and other, smaller contingents dispatched by friendly nations. Then a slew of NGOs, volunteers, and private cleanup operations (many of them employing precariat workers) took on the job in a great upsurge of solidarity. Cleaning the mud from homes and ditches, sweeping it from photographs and personal belongings, is described by the author as an exhilarating experience, a kind of return to a primal scene where social barriers disappear and a new sense of community emerges. This regression to an infantile stage of scatological pleasure is also a move away from the political. The author recognizes it herself: ""while tremendously moving, the work we do moves little in fact."" But the important thing is ""being there"": ""stress is placed on the immediacy of the action and on the ethics of care."" Riding a bus to Ishinomaki, an NGO team leader wondered why people made street protests against the government's nuclear policy: ""why not come here and shovel mud instead?""But there is a politics in shoveling mud, grieving lives, and opposing social warfare. Anne Allison never discusses her adherence to a progressive agenda broadly aligned with the Japanese left. The media she relies on (the Asahi newspaper, mostly), the intellectuals she quotes, the social activists she associates with, and the activities she participates in, are all identified with a segment of Japanese politics. Like it or not, this segment has been on the decline in Japan for the last two decades at least. The moment Allison did her fieldwork, which corresponded to the time politicians from the Democratic Party of Japan were in power, was only a parenthesis in an era dominated by the conservative Liberal-Democratic Party. Japanese conservatives of various stripes have themselves offered comments and remedies about the rise of precariousness and exclusion in contemporary Japan. These views fill the pages of right-wing magazines such as Shokun!, Seiron, Voice, or WiLL. Reflecting these views, which also find echoes among members of the precariat (remember the Ronza article praising war as a solution to poverty), would have provided ethnographic value: we don't need to be reminded about what people like us think. It would also have helped us understand the future: as mentioned, these people are winning the day in contemporary Japan.Indeed, the range of sources Allison uses and the scope of her fieldwork appear limited. Although the book claims to be based on participant observation, one has to wait until page 124 to begin to see real ethnographic work. And fieldwork is mostly limited to on-site interviews with well-known social activists: Yuasa Makoto, one of the leading figures advocating rights for precarious workers, dispatch workers, the homeless, and working poor; Amamiya Karin, a former suicidal freeter and author in her mid-thirties who dresses in goth; Genda Yji, the founder of ""hope studies"" (kibgaku) at Tokyo University; Tsukino Kji, a performer and founder of Kowaremono, a music band where each member self-identifies as having a handicap; etc. The Japanese books that are quotedand there are quite a few in the bibliographyare only scanned in a superficial way, and there are no close readings of key texts that would have given a conceptual framework to the topic at hand. Indeed, it is significant that when Allison needs theoretical references, she turns to English sources and authors like Judith Butler, Lauren Berlant, Michel Foucault, etc. There is a division of labor by which Japanese sources provide first-hand observation and commentary, but the real concept workthe theory of the theoryis done by Western authors. Allison quotes in passing a few Japanese philosophers who have tried to address issues of social justice and identity politics in innovative ways: Azuma Hiroshi, Asada Akira, Kayano Toshihito, and others. She could have relied more on them to provide a locally-grounded, theoretically relevant and ethnographically innovative account of the rise of precariousness in Japan.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3UBVMP0Q26R8K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0822355620#wasThisHelpful","R3UBVMP0Q26R8K","A3IKQVN8N8AKRY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3IKQVN8N8AKRY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Life has emerged as a key concept in anthropology. It is the central notion that defines the discipline in our present day and age. So was culture in the eighties, when the volume Writing Culture was published. Many scholars and graduate students took to this book and projected unto it their hopes and frustrations with a discipline many considered as tainted by its colonial past and epistemological present. This was before the culture wars that cultural studies helped ignite, and after counter-culture had denounced Americas pretension to hegemony. Titling a book Writing Culture and the Life of Anthropology, almost thirty years after Writing Culture had practically declared anthropology dead, is to proclaim that there is life after death. Or maybe resurrection: in the course of three decades, anthropology has reinvented itself in order to make itself relevant for a world that has shattered its historical certitudes.The return of the undead takes the form of a collection of essays, some reminiscent, others programmatic, others yet inward-looking and reflexive, written by some prominent figures in the discipline. Some of the contributors were ""present at the creation"": the two editors of Writing Culture, James Clifford and George Marcus, as well as Michael Fisher, contribute essays to this volume. Others were involved as graduate students who had to take a stand about the book in class discussions or job market interviewsas the editor recalls, ""you simply had to readand have an opinion aboutthe book unless you wanted to appear pathetically behind the times."" Some of the people involved in the WC debate back then were feeling hysterical. By contrast, as James Clifford comments, we are now ""feeling historical."" Writing Culture belongs to another era: ""there is no entry for globalization in the book's index. No Internet, no neoliberal, no postcolonial."" According to George Marcus, ""Writing Culture was an ambitious and much needed critique of anthropology by means of literary therapy."" It was ""perhaps the single most influential anthropology book in recent decades."" But the result of the ""linguistic turn"" was often ""self-indulgent, jargon-strewn texts that only the initiated could understand."" For many commentators, Writing Culture led to a dead end.So is anthropology dead? There is certainly an academic labor market crisis, coupled with a mutation in the publishing business. As noted in the introduction, ""the dearth of stable tenure-track positions has created a whole large class of subemployed adjuncts who suffer through bad pay, the slights of second-class university citizenship, and a demoralizing uncertainty about their future prospects."" Anthropologists are in no less pressure to publish  and even in our age of on-line journals or internet archives, publishing a book still stands as a requisite for getting tenure. An ethnography's typical print runs in a thousand copiesnot much, for a discipline whose ambition is not only to study mankind, but also to change it.  And yet ""the number of anthropology majors, Ph.D. students, and faculty have not declined but have grown some over the past decade."" The American Anthropological Association today has thirty-eight subsections and more than eleven thousand members, and it sponsors twenty-two scholarly journals. AAA meetings are a moment of collective effervescence quite similar to the potlatch gatherings of North-West American Indians as described by classical anthropologists: ""six thousand people united by a professional identity, but little else, come together for a frenzied few days of intense mutual activity.""Indeed, a case could be made that anthropologists never had it so good. As a recent blog entry in ""Living Anthropologically"" has argued, anthropology may be the worst major for your career, but the best major for taking over the world. It is now well known that President Obama's mother was a practicing anthropologist, and that she may have transmitted a certain worldview in her son's upbringing, a worldview best summed up by Margaret Mead's definition of the discipline: ""the purpose of anthropology is to make the world safe for human differences."" This particular quote was used by president Obama when he greeted President Ashram Ghani of Afghanistan, a card-carrying PhD anthropologist. Before becoming president, Ashram Ghani had worked in the World Bank, an institution now run by an anthropologist, Jim Yong Kim. Jim Kim was among the first enrollees of Harvard's experimental MD/PhD program in the social sciences, getting both an MD degree at Harvard Medical School and a PhD in the anthropology department. He then went on to create an NGO with another anthropologist, Paul Farmer, who has become a hero of sorts for his humanitarian work in Haiti. Before Piketty's Capital became a bestseller worldwide, an anthropology book by David Graeber, Debt: The First 5000 Years, provided a manifesto for the Occupy Wall Street crowds. Other recent bestsellers include The World Until Yesterday by Jared Diamond, who was originally trained in physiology but who poaches the anthropology field relentlessly in his writings.Anthropology, in short, is not an endangered genre. The essays collected in this volume all speak to the vitality of the discipline. Each will appeal to a different class of reader. As a self-taught amateur who reads anthropology as a way to get acquainted with mankind, I confess I remain impervious to some of the stylistic prowess displayed by some of the authors. The essay by Michael TaussigI have yet to complete reading a book by himseemed to me like a long rant inspired by the consumption of powdered coca leaves. It is bereft of all the traditional trappings of scholarship: there are no sections, no titles, no footnotes, and no bibliography. I couldn't help notice that the word ""F***"" appears three times in the book, and that there are nineteen occurrences of the word ""kinky"" in one single article (""queer"" gets several mentions as well, but one could argue it has become a scholarly notion.) Some entries are mere work in progress, like the ethnography of stone that hints at interesting developments in Chinese culture. Others present as heroic achievements what seems to me the standard use of widely available tools. Under the ""digital pen"" of some contributors, ""concept work amid data or as data"" means ""taking field notes"" or ""writing a research diary."" A ""draft"" becomes a ""prototype"", a website a ""curated archive"", a blog or a twitter account a way by which ""digital technology provides a means of continual reporting and engagement in relation to its granular, built publics along the way.""It is true that technology has changed the way anthropologists do business. Although fieldwork remains the hallmark of the profession, the ""field"" no longer seems far away at all in the age of Skype, Facebook, and the instant message. Ethnographers don't limit themselves to distant terrains: it is ""a brave new disciplinary world where just about anything anywhere has become fair ethnographic game."" Ethnographers no longer set tent in isolated communities: they follow the ebbs and flows of globalization, and engage multiple terrains and peoples to track life in an interconnected world. How, to take examples of recent monographs referred to in the introduction, ""does one do the ethnography of Internet chat rooms, social media, or dot-come dating? As with fieldwork, the very word ""ethnography"" seems dated. Are there still ethnos to graph about?"" After all, Orin Starr remarks, ""the very idea of writing, at least anything more than a text or tweet, can seem old-fashioned now in the age of multimedia, streaming video and the avalanche of other digitized communication."" And yet, ""as Jurassic a medium as print may be, the journal article and the book remain the gold standard for hiring and promotion."" The authors of Writing Culture were calling for new ways to experiment with forms and language. Now, as Orin Starn and Michael Fisher remark, they have to contend with the competition of nonfiction writers, novelists and moviemakers, who sometimes base their creation on extensive fieldwork but who succeed in establishing a better connexion with the public.Could anthropology one day turn into a new religion? After all, there are prophets, priests and shamans in this bookeach will be easily recognized. Writing Culture has acquired the status of a cult book or of sacred scriptures. Like the founders of any new creed, the promoters of ""postmodernism"" had to survive the routinization of charisma. There are chapels and churches, dogmas and rituals, anathema and exorcisms in the world of modern anthropology. What's more, the people being studied are no longer passive: they ""talk back"" to the anthropologist, and may incorporate some of her findings into their belief systems.Not all chapters of this book are equally memorable. My pick consists of three essays, which by themselves make this newly edited volume perhaps less epoch-making than the original Writing Culture, but nonetheless valuable. The first is the introduction by the editor, Orin Starn, who teaches at Duke University. It is a model of good humor and accessible tone, written in a light tone that nonetheless address deep questions. I like the part when he notes that ""one is more likely to run into an anteater at a shopping mall than a Republican anthropologist,"" or when he quotes Florida governor's harsh words about anthropologists ""as if we were just a grade above cockroaches or some other household pest."" As this introductory chapter is available on the publisher's website, I encourage readers to peruse it.The two other chapters that make this book worthwhile are the contributions by  Charles Piot and Anne Allison, also from Duke. Plot revisits the analysis of African kinship systems, with a twist: in contemporary Togo, the US visa lottery system has led to the creation of a cottage industry in fake marriages and invented relatives, reenacting as it were the ancient traditions of situated kinship, bridewealth transactions, and ""ghost marriage"" with a deceased relative. Although Charles Piot certainly didn't write it with this intention in mind, I recommend this chapter to consular officers in charge of visa procedures in West Africa and elsewhere: they will recognize some familiar figures, and may learn a few new tricks in the trade. As for Anne Allison, I may soon review her book on Precarious Japan, a deeply moving account of everyday life in the post-Fukushima era, which she here complements with ethnographic vignettes conveying messages of hope and resilience.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZ56WPZMM12P3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0822358735#wasThisHelpful","RZ56WPZMM12P3","A3IKQVN8N8AKRY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3IKQVN8N8AKRY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Paul Rabinow is responsible for putting Clifford Geertz into the doghouse, and for raising Michel Foucault to the pinnacle. I loathe him for the first achievement, and idolize him for the second. Assembling the Contemporary is a curious book that does both. The book is an assemblage of previously published articles dealing with the history of the discipline, philosophical essays about the late Michel Foucault, research notes drawn from Rabinow's work at a research center specializing in synthetic biology, documents describing an experimental graduate seminar, and a programmatic manifesto calling for an anthropology of the contemporary. For me, the part dealing with Rabinow's two teachers was the most revealing: it complements his already available commentary on Foucault, and develops a scathing critique of Geertz that was only hinted at in his former books. Indeed, one wonders why he chose to republish these materials, and particularly the two chapters (""Humanism as Nihilism"" and ""Chicken or Glass"") that are so offensive to his former thesis advisor.For people of my generation, Paul Rabinow is known for three books published in the early phase of his career: Reflections on Fieldwork in Morocco, a narrative of the author's coming-of-age as an ethnographer; and Michel Foucault: Beyond Structuralism and Hermeneutics, an introduction to the work of the French philosopher that he coauthored with Hubert Dreyfus, along with a hugely popular anthology of Foucault's work, The Foucault Reader. In his work on Foucault, Rabinow introduced the distinction between two moments in the development of his thought: from the archeology of knowledge to the genealogy of power. By the concept of archaeology, Foucault distanced himself from the classical history of ideas and looked at the formation of thought systems emerging from below, excavating them from the rubble of accumulated knowledge. Whereas epistemology investigates the truth-claims of scientific knowledge, archeology looks at its possibility of existence, its materiality as an event shaping subjects and informing practices. Foucault's second intellectual period is characterized by his increasing involvement in political struggles for rights (of prisoners; of immigrants; of minorities; etc.) and by his shift towards a genealogy of power/knowledge systems. The key concepts here are micro-physics of power, governmentality, apparatus, and disciplines.Reflections on Fieldwork in Morocco was written in the shadow of Clifford Geertz. Rabinow did his doctoral fieldwork in Sfrou, a Moroccan town that Geertz had selected as the camp base to conduct an extensive survey of life conditions in Third World nations. The photographer Paul Hyman was also part of the enterprise; and in ""Chicken or Glass: Between Clifford Geertz and Paul Hyman,"" Rabinow writes a devastating critique of the first under the guise of an homage to the second. He describes Geertz as ""an awkward human being who learned to use that awkwardness to his own continuing advantage."" He had an ""irritable personality,"" and was rarely available to his doctoral student, to whom he gave very little direction and advice. He had a very poor command of spoken Arabic, and very seldom engaged in the small talk and banter that the locals consider as a constitutive part of social life. ""That his accent was horrific was of minimal importance; that he was constitutionally allergic to chatter and impervious to palaver (no doubt in any language) constituted a telling diacritic of who he was and how he was perceived, as well as what he himself was able to perceive."" His conception of fieldwork was to summon his informants to his study room up a hill and to ask them ""how things were in the land below."" On the occasions when he mingled with the people, he was unable to read even a simple situation and could not tell whether a certain ritual was performed in relation to ""chicken"" or ""glass"", as the only word he understood from an informant's answer could have meant both.Rabinow makes frequent references to Nietzsche who, more than any author, has made a reputation of attacking his contemporaries. Indeed his aversion to his former thesis advisor is human, all too human. His grudge against Geertz was based on personal circumstances. His professor made him rewrite his thesis, reacting to a first draft by the succinct indication to ""keep going."" He didn't provide proper career support, agreeing only grudgingly to have him as his assistant at Princeton's Institute of Advanced Studieswhere Rabinow met with Pierre Bourdieuand undermining his book's proposal as he clearly didn't want to see it published. Ultimately, Reflections on Fieldwork in Morocco was rescued by Robert Bellah, who recommended the manuscript to a publisher and invited Rabinow to join the University of California at Berkeley, basically saving his career. Rabinow hints that something bad happened between Bellah and Geertz at the IAS. But whatever was the case, Robert Bellah held no rancor against Clifford Geertz, and even defended him posthumously after his influence had waned.On the other hand, Rabinow keeps a long memory of past wrongdoings, and eats his revenge cold over Geertz's dead body. The grievances he holds against his former professor are rather petty and shallow. The Geertzes refused to publish a chapter they had commissioned to Rabinow in a volume on Morocco, and did not send an explanatory letter to justify their rebuttal. When the graduate student in Sefrou was stuck in bed with fever, they didn't visit him, sending their maid to serve soup instead. Rabinow criticizes Geertz for the thing that he is most often credited with: his writerly skills. He refers to his ""involuted prose, devastatingly reviewed as a souffl that deflates if you stick a fork in it."" Perhaps the strongest indictment Rabinow makes of his former professor is when he states that Geertz ""was deeply anticommunist, supporting the American war effort in Southeast Asia."" But as readers of Reflections on Fieldwork will remember, Rabinow's anti-war sentiment came rather late. What is more, as Brian T. Edwards documents in Morocco Bound, he was blind to the social upheavals that were shaking Morocco's cities at the time of his fieldwork in Sfrou.""Strangely enough,"" notes Rabinow, ""at the height of their fame and productivity, neither Clifford Geertz nor Michel Foucault was in a position to direct graduate students."" Foucault was elevated to a teaching position at the Collge de France, a peculiar institution where anybody can attend lectures and there is no formal obligation imposed on the lecturer apart from performing on a weekly basis. Clifford Geertz was the first social scientist to hold a position at the Institute for Advanced Studies in Princeton, another rare institution where the pursuit of knowledge for its own sake is the ultimate raison dtre. According to Rabinow, he could have become the founder of a school and set new directions in cultural anthropology, as Pierre Bourdieudescribed as the ultimate career plannerencouraged him to do. But Geertz refused flatly: ""I am not a cruise director."" Consequently, writes Rabinow, ""his influence gradually waned within anthropology, and although he remained productive, he produced no major groundbreaking work there.""Foucault, for his part, grew increasingly uncomfortable with the gilded cage of the Collge de France. Invited to teach at Berkeley, he found in the San Francisco Bay Area satisfactions  that were not only intellectual. Faced with increasing demands to play a public role as an engaged intellectual, Foucault turned elsewhere, ""to practices of care of the self and truth speaking in the ancient world"" that form the material of his History of Sexuality. Frustrated with the Bibliothque de France, he shifted his routine to a Dominican library where all the primary texts in Greek and Latin that he was working on were readily available for his use. Berkeley provided him a venue in which he could examine his work from a different perspective and with a different ethos. Consequently, his last years were among the most productive in his career. His last courses at the Collge de France, which have only recently been published, set a new direction for philosophy, turning it into a critical and spiritual practice of transformation of the self and of others.This is the model Rabinow sets for himself as he attempts to build an anthropology of the contemporary. The book takes an experimental turn when its author describes attempts at reconstructing the graduate seminar, working his way around a biology research lab where he is more the participant than the observer, and designing various Web sites avenues for work at a collaborative level. He also refers to the contemporary art scene, where he detects the same bracketing of truth that he highlights among the founders of cultural anthropology. These experiments are, by his own account, more or less failures: running the ""labinar"" (as in lab plus seminar) demands a tremendous amount of time and energy; Rabinow ends up resigning from his managing position at SynBERC; and the Web sites are, well, just that: Web sites. Rabinow regrets that ""it is still nearly impossible to get tenure for a dynamic, multimedia, interactive project on the Web,"" and calls for modes of presenting research findings that are more diverse than the restricted range of types of articles and monographs. His book exemplifies this: it is written by several hands, mixes the genres and the themes, and tries to reflect the aesthetic quality of a collage.Above all, Rabinow thinks it is time ""to sacrifice the individualism as the subject position that has been at the core of anthropology's approach to research, publication, pedagogy, and, above all, thinking."" Looking back, he notes that ""it is quite remarkable that the history of anthropology has producedand thematized as exemplars for further researchso few examples of collective work."" For him, Clifford Geertz exemplifies these tendencies to escape from social responsibilitiesincluding teachingin order to cultivate literary style and authorship. But he seems to forget that Geertz, in his time, participated in massively collaborative work and himself initiated several collective endeavors. He received his PhD in Harvard's Department of Social Relations, a highly innovative place that placed cultural anthropology next to psychology and sociology, not next to the traditional partners of cultural anthropology: archeology and physical anthropology. His first long-term fieldwork in Java, together with his wife Hildred, was part of a large research program funded by the Ford Foundation and MIT that sent multi-disciplinary teams to study economic and social prospects in newly independent Thirld World nations. He himself took insights from and offered lessons to social psychology, political economy, sociology of religion, and even agronomy or development science. For all its claims, Rabinow's anthropology of the contemporary remains only programmatic, whereas Geertz's cultural anthropology has had a proven track record of collaborative work and cross-disciplinary fertilization.","2.0 out of 5 stars","May 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2978PN8UA7LK2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0226701700#wasThisHelpful","R2978PN8UA7LK2","A3IKQVN8N8AKRY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3IKQVN8N8AKRY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It's all in the title. UNSETTLING. INDIA. AFFECT. TEMPORALITY. TRANSNATIONALITY. The key concepts are all listed here, in a sequence that will be repeated over and over in the book, like a devotional mantra. It is, if you will, the anthropologist's ""Om mani padme hum"", the way she attains her own private nirvana. Purnima Mankekar's objective, as she states repeatedly, is to examine how India is constructed as well as unsettled as an archive of affect and temporality in contexts shaped by transnational public cultures and neoliberalism. Each word in this mission statement opens a particular space for ordering the observations that she gathered in the course of her fieldwork in India and in California. Indeed, the chapters of the book hold together by a thread, and this common thread is provided by the words listed in the book's title. So let me engage with them one by one, in no particular order of succession.TRANSNATIONALITY refers, first, to the two sites where the author conducted fieldwork, gathered observations, and interacted with her informants. The ethnographic material of which the book is composed was collected through the course of nearly two decades in various locations clustered around New Delhi and in the San Francisco Bay Area, where many immigrants from the South Asian subcontinent have settled. Transnationalism has been defined in anthropology as ""the process by which immigrants forge and sustain simultaneous multi-stranded social relations that link together their societies of origin and settlement."" Mankekar complicates this definition by noting that diasporic subjects often cannot be pinned down to one place of origin or to one settlement location, as they frequently move across borders and develop modes of identification that are not tied to territory. In addition, transnational imaginaries also affect non-migrants who can only dream of settling abroad but for whom the distant foreign is brought close to home by television programs or consumer culture.In a more restricted manner, transnationality applies to transnational public cultures as they are studied by the author: Bollywood movies, TV dramas, commodity consumption, ideologies of nationhood, discourses of morality, and fictive identities as in the call centers where young Indian operators impersonate the role of typical Americans. Mankekar treats transnational media as text to be subjected to textual analysis, but also as a practice to be experienced in tandem with her informants. She tells how she is able to break the ice with a busy IT executive by referring to a Bollywood drama, how she brings an Indonesia-born Sikh Indian-American to an old Raj Kapoor movie, or how she discusses gender roles and sexuality with lower-middle class and working-class informants in New Delhi based on TV serials and commercials. Public cultures are transnational because they address or interpellate a public wider than the national community; because they mobilize the forces of borderless capital and commodity fetishism; and because they often picture diasporic subjects while enabling men and women to acquire the capacity to imagine life in other places.The movies Mankekar discusses are known to many English-speaking audiences in India and abroad by their acronyms or abbreviated titles. ""DDLJ"" tells the story of young lovers straddling borders and communities to win parental approval to marry. ""K3G"" is about an adopted son expelled from his rich home for disobeying his fathers marriage injunction and then brought back into the family fold by his elder brother. ""Bunty and Babli"" is a road movie about two swindlers who escape from their small town by impersonating rich peoples identities. These stories resonate with the courting of nonresident Indians or NRIs by the Indian state appealing to their investments and skills (DDLJ); they espouse the ideology of Hindi nationalism by producing a fantasy of a reterritorialized Global India in which religious and other minorities are conspicuous by their absence (K3G); or they reflect the increased capacity to aspire of call center operators and other lower middle-class Indian who adopt new names and borrowed identities (B&B). Viewing these movies while reading the book in parallel provides the reader with a wonderful introduction to a fascinating cinematic genre.AFFECT is a category that is mobilized on different counts. It is a dimension of ethnographic fieldwork, on par with cultural sensitivity and theoretical foregrounding. As Mankekar notes, ""conducting ethnographic analysis is itself a deeply affective process and entails an engagement with the entire being of the ethnographer."" She situates her encounters with informants in their sensory and emotive contexts, providing notations on tastes, smells, likes and dislikes. ""India shopping"" in the ethnic grocery stores run by South Asians in the San Francisco Bay Area involves a whole range of affects, experienced by the author and her informants in intimate, embodied, and often visceral ways. They bring into play ""senses of touch, smell, sound, sight, and taste."" These stores provide spaces where community members gather and exchange news about community events, and where new arrivals can learn about neighborhoods, schools, and employment opportunities. They are also places where the community exercises its surveillance upon its members and sanctions ""loud"" or deviant behavior. All is by no means positive in the outlook and values of Indian Americans, or in the political orientation of citizens back home. In particular, the author develops strongly negative affects towards people who espouse the Hindutva nationalist ideology and who wield campaigns of ""aggressive national regeneration"" aimed at religious minorities or, more prosaically, against Valentine Day celebrations. The ethnographer's rapport with her informants is not always based on empathy and understanding.Affect is also part of a political economy of affective labor, affective capital, and affect circulation. Michael Hardt has noted that whole sectors of the economy are focused on the creation and manipulation of affects. In particular, affect is constitutive of forms of labor central to the global capitalist economy, as in the transnational service sector where India claims a distinctive competitive advantage. Elaborating the notion further in The Cultural Politics of Emotions, Sara Ahmed conceives of affect as a form of capital. Analogous to the production of surplus value in capitalism, affects assume value cumulatively through circulation. Affective economies are composed of affective investment, affective value, affective circulation, and affective regimes of production and consumption. Affect is distinct from feeling (the domain of individual subjectivity) and emotion (the domain of the linguistic). Affects are generative of subjectivityof action and agency, the capacity to act and be acted upon.Mankekar uses these theoretical insights in a fine-grained ethnography of call center operators in a New Delhi suburb. Call centers have become the most visible part of the business outsourcing industry and have been heralded by media pundits and globalists as proof that ""the world is (becoming) flat."" Mankekar demonstrates the value of ethnographic writing as opposed to media reporting. She describes affective labor as based on affective repertories  of courtesy, familiarity, friendliness, helpfulness, and, above all, caring. It is also based on the alienation of workers who refashion their only means of productiontheir own selves, their own bodiesthrough practices of impersonation and borrowed identities. As the two movie characters Bunty and Babli, call center agents become themselves by becoming others. Their aspirations to upward mobility, glamour, and success is also nurtured by transnational media: they are required to watch Hollywood films and episodes of US television shows such as Friends, and to use them as resources to acquire American accents, adopt American colloquialisms, and learn about the American way of life. They engage in virtual migration through IT-mediated work and cultivate lateral mobility by moving from one employer to the next. But the end of distance doesn't bring the end of place. The virtual migration of call center agents coexists with forms of emplacement and immobility (and in some cases, virtual incarceration) through technologies of regulation and surveillance.TEMPORALITY is the second repertory or archive mobilized, in conjunction with affect, to delineate the production and unsettling of transnational India. Describing the modern imagination as an expanded capacity to aspire, Arjun Appadurai suggested that we foreground aspiration in order to place futurity, rather than pastness, at the heart of our thinking about culture. Indian residents or diasporic subjects locate India not so much in the past as in the future. In this new regime of temporality, tradition emerges as an affective process that entails not so much the invocation of a past as the generation of a set of practices enabling subjects to imagine and embrace specific forms of futurity. Among diasporic Indians who carry India in their heart wherever they go, Indianness is not constructed as static or unchanging but instead is portable and flexible. Similarly, Hindu natinonalists experience nostalgia for the future: their longing for a glorified and mythic past combines with an aspiration to march toward a glowing future as moral subjects of Global India. In this sense, ""time has agency or, at the very least, a force of its own."" Time combines with affect to shape subject formation and social process.INDIA is constituted as an archive of affect and temporality by transnational public cultures. What ""India"" means is very different for each of her informants in New Delhi or in the San Francisco Bay area. Some subscribe to Hindu nationalist discourses of national purity, while others adhere to secularist conceptions of nationhood. Some insist on bounded territory and fixed identities, while others are engaged in transnational deterritorialization processes and multifaceted roles. Diaspora members carry India in their hearts wherever they go, while some individuals construct their own private India with disparate elements assembled through identity bricolage. Second-generation youth express their identity in terms of cultural difference:  for these transnational consumers of Bollywood musicals and ethnic productions, ""it's cool to be Indian now"". Food is of particular significance to communities that travel across transnational space. As a mother testifies, ""now that the kids are in school, they're forgetting their Gujarati. But the least I can do is to give them one Indian meal a day."" Some see India as a country of origin, while others identify it as the land of the future.UNSETTLING is a common analytic that hints at the subversive nature of academic writing, politically and culturally. The disciplines of gender studies, media studies, critical theory, or cultural studies are particularly unsettling in the sense that they introduce ambiguity and uncertainty where the dominant ideology tries to impose certitude and conformity. Like many cultural critics committed to a progressive agenda, Mankekar does not take categories for granted. She refuses to essentialize notions of nation, gender, class, or ethnicity, while at the same time recognizing their relevance for interpreting social processes of identity formation and collective mobilization. In particular, she unpacks and decanters the totalizing claims of nationhood. She shows that ""unsettlement is intrinsic to the production of India, such that Indian culture is conceptualized as chronically in flux, as always emergent."" India is unsettling as a nation: it challenges aspects of American identity, and is deemed particularly threatening to the self-representation of the US as a technological leader. Outsourcing service activities to India elicits reactions of rejection or even racist slurs, as when Americans realize they have been connected to a consumer service located in India. As the author notes, ""we rarely see the same virulence in discussions about outsourcing to Israel and Ireland.""Unsettling India is also part of a wider project of unsettling nations. India is not the only nation to be constituted and unsettled by regimes of affect and temporality. As Mankekar claims in her conclusion, ""I have wished to sketch the contours of a conceptual and political framework that may enable us to unsettle the exclusionary and violent claims of the US nation."" In post-September 11 America, fear and rage against people of South Asian and Middle Eastern origin, in particular those ""deemed to be Muslims"" (such as Sikh men wearing a turban) contribute to the  creation of a nation predicated on the marginalization and demonization of racial and cultural Others. This book is about unsettlement as an ethnographic strategy as well as an analytic. ""It is vulnerable to the irruption of surprises, emergences, and potentialities, and to the ineffable, the inarticulate, and the inscrutable."" Traditional conceptions of family, gender, or Indianness are displaced and unsettled by images of sensuality and erotic longing. Even the most conventional romance stories or the most obtuse nationalist discourse carry a twist, a fault line that opens them to the dimension of desire. It is the hero's respect for Indian women's sexual purity that makes DDLJ a truly erotic movie. The controversies surrounding Valentine Day in India underscore the greater visibility of romantic love and displays of affection between young men and women. India is constructed and unsettled in the same move. Mankekar revels in revealing these shifts and cracks in the fabric of social life.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2M5DM4SZ0E2TT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0822358360#wasThisHelpful","R2M5DM4SZ0E2TT","A3IKQVN8N8AKRY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3IKQVN8N8AKRY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Everett Zhang was conducting fieldwork in two Chinese hospitals, documenting the reasons why men sought medical help for sexual impotence, when Viagra was first introduced into China's market in 2000. He therefore had a unique perspective on what the media often referred to as the ""impotence epidemic"", designating both the increased social visibility of male sexual dysfunction and the growing number of patients seeking treatment in nanke (men's medicine) or urological hospital departments. At the time of Viagra's release, Pfizer, its manufacturer, envisaged a market of more than 100 million men as potential users of ""Weige"" (Great Brother) and hoped to turn China into its first consumer market in the world. Its sales projections were based on reasonable assumptions. The number of patients complaining from some degree of sexual impotence was clearly on the rise, reflecting demographic trends but also changing attitudes and values. There was a new openness in addressing sexual issues and a willingness by both men and women to experience sexually fulfilling lives, putting higher expectations on men's potency. Renewed attention to men's health issues since the 1980s had led to the creation of specialized units in both biomedical hospitals and TCM (traditional Chinese medicine) clinics. There was no real competitor to Pfizer's Viagra, as traditional herbal medicine or folk recipes clearly had less immediate effects in enabling sexual intercourse.And yet Viagra sold much less than expected. In hospitals and health clinics, Chinese patients were reluctant to accept a full prescription. Instead, they requested one or two single pills, as if to avoid dependence. The drug was expensively priced, and customers were unwilling to sacrifice other expenses to make room in their budget. In addition, Viagra did not substitute for traditional remedies, but rather developed in tandem with them as people switched between Viagra and herbal medicine, taking both for seemingly compelling reasons. Viagra addressed the issue of erectile dysfunction, and its bodily effects were clearly experienced by Chinese men who reacted to it in much the same way as male subjects elsewhere. But it did not bring an end to the ""impotence epidemic"", which continued to be framed as more than a health issue by the Chinese media. Viagra did not ""cure"" impotence or restored men's potency because it was unable to do so. Pfizer's projected sales figures had been based on false assumptions, and the Chinese market proved more resistant than initially envisaged.Zhang proposes a compelling theory of why it was so, thereby demonstrating the value of a fieldwork-based anthropological study as distinct from other types of scholarly explanations. In contrast to the dominant biomedical paradigm, he rejects the notion that male potency can be reduced to the simple ability to achieve an erection. Impotence is much more than a bodily dysfunction or a ""neuromuscular event"": witness, as Zhang did, the despair of men who complain of having lost their ""reason to live"", or the frustration of women who accuse their companion of having become ""less than a man"". But impotence is not only a metaphor, as some cultural critics would have it. Impotence is often presented as the symbol of a masculinity in crisis or as a sign of the ""end of men"" and the rise of women in postsocialist China. But these generalizations do not reflect the practical experiences of impotent men, nor do they explain why the demand for more and better sex resulted in anxiety for some men, leading to impotence. ""In fact, notes the author, none of the discussions surrounding Chinese masculine crises was either soundly conceptualized or empirically supported.""Zhang's fieldwork confirmed the rise of women's desire or increased people's longing to enjoy sex throughout their adult life, but did not go as far as to validate the claim of an ""impotence epidemic"" or to testify to a ""new type of impotence"". During the Maoist period, people were discouraged from seeing doctors about impotence, as sexuality was repressed and the desire for individual sexual pleasure was regarded as antithetical to the collective ethos of revolution. If anything, patients came to consultations to complain about nocturnal emissions (yijing), a complaint that more or less disappeared in the post-Maoist era. When men's health clinics or nanke departments emerged in the new era, they medicalized impotence and established it as a legitimate ""disease"" warranting medical attention. Private selves emerged when the overall ethos of sacrifice and asceticism gave way to the exaltation of romantic love and then to the justification of sexual desire and pleasure. But structural impediments to sexual desire did not disappear overnight, such as the physical separation of married couples and other constraints on intimacy induced by the danwei (work unit) and hukou (household registration) systems. Other biopolitical interventions created gaps between the revolutionary class and the outcast relatives of counter-revolutionaries, between the urban and the rural or, more recently, between the rich and the poor.The main value of the book lies in its rich collection of life stories and individual cases of men and women confronted with impotence. The amount of suffering accumulated under Maoist socialism is staggering. People interviewed in the course of this research retained collective memory of starvation during the Great Leap Famine, and feeling hungry was a common experience well into the sixties. Maoist China was a man-eat-man's world, where middle-aged men would snatch food from school children or steal from food stalls to assuage their hunger. It was also a time when children would denounce their parents for counterrevolutionary behavior, or would call their mother by their given name in a show of disrespect in order to draw a clear line between themselves and bad parents. Sexual misery and backwardness also provided a common background. Some of Zhang's interlocutors never touched a woman's hand until they were thirty years old; others confessed that the first time they saw a naked female body was when they saw a Western oil painting of a female body, or when they glimpsed scenes of a classical ballet in a movie. A nineteen years-old girl didn't understand the question when the doctor asked if she had begun lijia (menstruation) and thought lijia was a foreign word. Many persons consulting for impotence confess that they never had sexual intercourse or had tried to have sex once of twice but failed. Their conviction that they were impotent was based on very limited physical contact with women or was merely a product of their imagination.As Zhang argues convincingly, it takes two to tango; or in words borrowed from phenomenology, ""in the final analysis, curing impotence means building intercorporeal intimacy."" In paragraphs that could have been borrowed from Masters and Johnson, Zhang describes the various components of sexual intercorporeality: bodies need to be in contact, as in ""touching, kissing, licking, rubbing, and so on""; but they also need to be in sync, geared toward one another in a process of ""bodying forth""; and other sensory inputs (such as ""seeing, touching, and smelling the naked female body, tasting the tongue of the female, or hearing her scream"") may provide additional stimulus. Male impotence very often originates in the failure of one of these intercorporeal dimensions: lack of touching, as when the husband lies side by side to his wife, waiting to achieve an erection; ignorance of the most basic facts of life, due to the lack of sex education; and withdrawal from the sensory world that is symptomatic of a more serious loss of ""potency"" in life. As the author notes, with a good deal of common sense, ""women's involvement in managing impotence is not any less important  than men's, and, in fact, at times may be more important. Impotence, after all, is not only a neurovascular event affecting the individual male body. It is also a social, familial event and an intercorporeal, gendered event.""The Impotence Epidemic is not only ethnographically rich, it is also theoretically elaborate. Zhang received his PhD in anthropology from the University of California at Berkeley, in a department known for its emphasis on social and cultural theory. One of his teachers, Paul Rabinow, initiated generations of English-speaking students to the thought of French philosopher Michel Foucault. His thesis advisor, Arthur Kleinman, who teaches medical anthropology at Harvard, recently edited a book (reviewed here) about how anthropologists engage philosophy. Zhang confesses he took classes in philosophy, including one with John Searle, who involuntarily provided him with a way to think about erection (""Now I want to raise my right arm. Look, my right arm is up."") Throughout the book, he makes frequent references to Gilles Deleuze, Michel Foucault, Merleau-Ponty, and Heidegger, as well as to Freud and Lacan.Engaging the thought of these canonical authors can sometimes feel as intimidating as having sex for the first time. Zhang shows it doesn't have to be so. What is important is to build a rapport. Zhang graduated from his theory-heavy curriculum with a pragmatic mindset and a heavy dose of common sense. He uses what he can get from the theoretical toolbox, without forcing his erudition onto the reader. He is able to summarize complex reasoning in a few sentences, and to turn difficult words into useful tools. Sometimes only the title of a book or one single expression coined by one distinguished thinker can open up an evocative space and act as useful heuristic. Zhang refers to Deleuze and Gattari's A Thousand Plateaux to label his collection of life stories and medical cases as ""one thousand bodies of impotence."" Impotence is itself a kind of plateau, defined by Gregory Bateson as a force of continuous intensity without any orientation toward a culminating point or an external end. Throughout his book, Zhang provides succinct and transparent definitions of key concepts--Deleuze's assemblages, Bourdieu's habitus, Foucault's biopower, Merleau-Ponty's intercorporeality, Heidegger's being-in-the-world, etc. He then tests their validity by confronting them to his fieldwork observations, sometimes giving them a twist or new polish to make them fit with his ethnographic material. In many cases, theory is found lacking, and needs to be completed with the lessons learned from participatory observation.Zhang's two main sources of philosophical inspiration are Deleuze and Foucault. The first allows him to think about the impotence epidemic as a positive development that signals the rise of desire;  the second provides him with a method for investigating the cultivation of self in post-Maoist China. Criticizing Lacan's notion of desire as lack, Deleuze and Guattari introduce useful concepts to think about the production of desire or, as they say, ""desiring production"", which includes ""the desire to desire"". They describe the force of capitalism in terms of generating flows of production and desire, which are coded (restricted) and decoded (loosened) in a moral economy of desire. Their analysis focuses on the decoding phase that is the hallmark of capitalism, lessening restrictions on desire to create deterritorialized flows. Zhang prefers to focus on the ""recoding"" of flows of desire or ""reterritorialization"" as exemplified in the cultivation of life through an ethic of ""yangsheng"" which advocates preserving seminal essence. Sexual cultivation in contemporary China, like the ""care of the self"" in ancient Greece as studied by Foucault, is an ethical approach to coping with desire. Yangsheng involves everything from sleep to dietary regimens, bathing, one's temperament in response to changes in climate, qigong, walking, and the bedchamber arts. It is a way to regain potency over one's life. Foucault, in order to account for unreason and madness, chose to produce a history of reason in Western civilization. Similarly, studying impotence leads Zhang to delineate life's potency, a notion that goes well beyond the ability to achieve an erection.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R39U0MNYSA8AAF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0822358565#wasThisHelpful","R39U0MNYSA8AAF","A3IKQVN8N8AKRY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3IKQVN8N8AKRY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""Dazzling"" is a word that seems to come to mind when describing this book. It is used in a laudatory manner by the two academic luminaries who provided blurbs on the back cover. Rey Chow praises In the Place of Origins as ""a dazzling accomplishment"". For Gayatri Spivak , ""this is a text of dazzling instructive simplicity."" Well, I was more frazzled than dazzled by Rosalind Morris's book. And I failed to perceive its ""instructive simplicity"". To me, this was only a compendium of bewildering jargon, rambling descriptions, sloppy reasoning, and bad editing. It was ethnographically and theoretically uncouth. In fact, I couldn't make any sense out of it. I had to get back at my reading several times to complete the book, and I did it only for the purpose of writing a review on this website. In short, my advise to the potential reader is: spare yourself that trouble. Don't take pains to read it, for this was indeed a painful experience.Granted, the topic is interesting. Chiang Mai and northern Thailand are fascinating places, with a distinctive culture that mixes tradition with modernity. Mediums are part of the local landscape and, far from receding from the scene, they have benefited from a veritable explosion of magical practices. People turn to mediums and spirits for personal or professional purposes: for love and marriage, power and money, health and luck. Stereotypically, those seeking advice about love and beauty are young women, those wanting luck and physical prowess, young men. Business advice is as often the concern of middle-aged women as of men, but healing is a universal need. In the homes of mediums, one is apt to encounter bankers and real estate entrepreneurs, local politicians and mafia thugs, all coming for consultation and advice. Buddhist monks, who are considered capable of achieving magical powers through the study of texts and meditation practice, often deride mediums as charlatans. But clients tend to believe them because they have faith in the transformative powers of their predictions.The episodes of spirit possession are a frightening scene, replete with growls, convulsions, spasms, vomiting, spitting, and speaking in unfamiliar voices. The first experience of possession comes without warning, and is often likened to a kind of violation, a dispossession of self-knowledge and of memory. It often takes years for mediums to come to terms with their new identity, to domesticate the spirit that periodically takes hold of their  mind and body, and to channel the seizures towards professional ends. After each possession, the medium must be told what has happened, and he or she often asks what the spirit has said. Spirits are historical or legendary figures, and they transform the medium into the receptacle of their wisdom. Thus, when an illiterate woman is possessed by a Buddhist saint and enabled to write, entranced, in an old script, or when an uneducated medium is able to recite with perfection the verses of a Pali sutra that she cannot read, a miraculous aura surrounds her.Mediums acquire spirits over time, eventually being possessed by several discrete characters, most of whom are associated with a distinct epoch and a particular site of origin. The spirits who finally compose the miniature pantheon of one medium are all integrated with each other in an overarching hierarchy and with the spirits of other mediums in relation to whom they are also relatively positioned. Praise ceremonies assign each medium a definite place in the ritual hierarchy, with the hosts listed in the invitations in order of seniority. The performances of mediums are characterized by a profound concern with decorum, including period costumes signifying generic pastness and a proliferation of signifiers of invented tradition. Medias and the technologies of mass reproduction go hand in hand with the occult practices of mediumship, and many photographs or videos of medium performances circulate among the public. Rosalind Morris elaborates on the parallel between the medium and the media, between mediumship and the technologies of mass reproduction. ""Ultimately, it is this knowing capacity to look like an image, to be legible as a copy, that constitutes the radical newness of mediumship in the age of mechanical reproduction.""The argumentand the titleof the book are built on a simple tension between the past and the present, the origins and the locale. Spirit possession in northern Thailand or elsewhere has often been treated as a mode of ""presencing the past"". Spirits are historical figures summoned to weigh on the concerns of the present. In the context of this ethnography, northern Thailand has emerged as a sign of pastness in the national imaginary. ""Chiang Mai has become a fetish of the picturesque,"" writes the author, and Northerners have come ""to inhabit the delirium of the nation and to take on the function of signifying pastness."" The ancient kingdom of Lanna in particular has come to signify an anterior history that is both pre-Thai and proto-Thai. It was once a vassal state of Burma, and has been treated by the Siamese as a dependent locality subject to ""internal colonialism"". The tourism industry has also incited local affiliation and a production of local culture. Chiang Mai is ""a city in which the signs of antiquity are constantly being produced anew."" Pastness, and specifically northern pastness, has become an object of desire. Hence the proliferation of imitation antiques, period costumes, and ethno-tourism among hill tribe peoples in the surrounding mountainous areas. Even the local language or dialect has experienced a kind of revival.Rosalind Morris keeps coming back to the idea of origins, although she doesn't specify what she really means by that. Northern Thailand is seen as the nation's constitutive outside, a place of origins where the foundations of Thailand originated. Chiang Mai is located ""at the center of the periphery"", sitting at the margin of the nation-state and providing it with a token authenticity. Mediums claim a special connexion to original figures, heroes and deities who are part of the national narrative. Rites of possession hint at the origin of language, as they ""constantly reenacts the drama of language's origination."" Yet ""for every tale of origin, there is an encounter with the absence of origins."" Alterity lurks in the place of origins. Myths of origins often have heroes and founders of dynasties coming from outside and conquering the land. Foreign gods such as Shiva enter into the national pantheon. Many mediums are themselves of non-Thai, especially Chinese ethnicity. They use artifacts and magic formulas borrowed from tribes peoples and other minorities. Origins ""is experienced as a site of loss"", a place that is always already absent.The book is ostensibly based on field research in northern Thailand, although the context and duration of fieldwork is not specified. The author claims of having spoken to ""monks, mediums, flower vendors, teachers, students, maid, and taxi drivers"". But she says very little about the context of these conversations, how they were structured, and how she fit in the picture as a participant observer. She assumes heroic knowledge on the part of the ethnographer: commenting at length on a nineteenth-century love poem, she notes that reading this text properly requires skills in ""Pali, Sanskrit, Khmer, Mon, Burmese and Thai"", as well as extensive knowledge of the Buddhist literature. It also requires a good knowledge of Derrida and of deconstruction as it is practiced in comparative literature departments in the US. Elsewhere in the book, she peppers her observations with snippets from Freud, Heidegger, Benjamin, Adorno, Foucault, Baudrillard and Bourdieu. As she states in the first chapter, ""this book is informed by a belief that a post-structuralist valorization of difference and indeterminacy, as being at once the limit and the enabling condition of translation, is supported and even demanded by the reading of modern northern Thai texts."" In other terms, you won't be able to read her book if you haven't been through Post-Structuralist Theory 101. But even if you did, skip it.","2.0 out of 5 stars","March 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1J5HNREM8VKKW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0822325179#wasThisHelpful","R1J5HNREM8VKKW","A3IKQVN8N8AKRY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3IKQVN8N8AKRY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The participant observer is the one who spoils the fun. He or she comes up with questions and doubts at the moment when the public wants answers and certitudes. Participating and observing are often two irreconcilable tasks. The observer introduces a distance when participants want to adhere to the show, and creates distinctions when the group wants to feel as one. Despite the pretense to the contrary, the researcher cannot fully belong, cannot fully take part into the action. Even when he or she choses to live among the natives, the anthropologist reminds people that he or she retains other obligations and belongings. The anthropologist dwells in the village but belongs to academia. The group can never claim him or her as one of them, because both know that he or she will have to leave one day and that his or her stay is temporary. Anthropologists are those who write things down at the end of the day: their commitment goes to scholarship, and they are dedicated to writing a book or a monograph about their experience in the field. They maintain critical distance and cultivate abstract reasoning, using categories that are in essence different from the ones that people use to frame their own experience.Rachael Miyung Joo is the typical party spoiler. She is the only one who doesnt wear a red T-shirt when the Korean national team is playing and people are watching the football game retransmission. When her female roommates cry and go crazy to celebrate victory, she stands back and watches from a distance. She feels closer to a solitary male supporter who sheds tears of emotion at the beauty of the game than to the crowd of cheering girls and boys who have only limited knowledge of the game rules. of She bluntly confesses to her friends that she finds the players from the Italian team more attractive. She uses categories such as gender, race, and nationhood, and introduces critical distance with the immediacy of experience, when people around her just want to enjoy the fun and share the excitement. She highlights the constructed nature of national unity and the ambivalence of ethnic categories at the time when media coverage celebrates Korea as one and heralds the advent of global Koreanness. Whereas media attention focuses on female fans and their mild display of sex appeal, she brings in feminist theory to denounce the commodification of womens bodies and the prevalence of heterosexual norms.Rachael Miyung Joos fieldwork took place around the date of 2002, the year of the soccer World Cup tournament hosted jointly by South Korea and by Japan (the Japanese part is sorely lacking in the book). It is a two-sited ethnography, based on participant observation made in Seoul and in Los Angeles. In addition to soccer, Joo also documents other sports where Koreans fare particularly well: golf, where ethnic Koreans dominate the Ladies Profesionnal Golf Association, but also baseball, with the participation of ethnic Koreans in the Major League, and figure skating, dominated by multi-medalist Kim Yuna. Her ethnography uses analytical categories borrowed from philosophy, anthropology, gender studies, media studies, and critical theory. She draw from Althussers notion of ""interpellation"", which describes how individuals are hailed through ideology. For example, the South Korean state attempts to ""interpellate"" Koreans in the United States as overseas Koreansthat is, loyal Korean national subjects.She borrows from media studies the expression ""assemblage"", a combination of institutions, images, and people that constitute the genre of media sport. Appadurai's anthropology of the global provides her with the notion of ""diasporic public spheres"" that are constituted though collective and simultaneous engagements by subjects located in different spaces around the world. She offers her own concepts, such as ""intimate publics"", a notion that combines the individual sphere and the public realm, or ""everyday forms of self-fashioning"" that she observes in Seoul's streets. She elaborates on the notion of the transnational which is declined in all her books chapter headings: ""transnational media sport"", ""transnational athletes"", and ""transnational publics"". She defines ""multicultural nationalism"" as ""a culturalist notion of diversity that erase material differences and power inequalities between and among groups, as well as one that sees racial, national, and ethnic differences as essentially the same.""Her main study is on the 2002 FIFA World Cup. As she writes in the introduction, ""this month-long event was not primarily about sport per se; it was a great opportunity to celebrate with millions of others under the aegis of supporting the nation."" People knew they were participating in a historical event of global significance,  because this had happened before: the 1988 Olympic Games are still remembered as a turning point in Korean history. One generation had passed, democracy had settled, and Koreans were even more self-confident. They felt united as one, and gave unanimous support to their national team. Young women were particularly conspicuous: they wore the color of the national team, painted the national flag on their faces and bodies, and led the crowds who were chanting and partying in the streets. For the author, ""the sexual desire and excitement generated around Korean national athletes operate as allegories of desire for the Korean nation."" This desire for a fantasized Koreanness transcended borders: supporting the Korean team enabled Korean-Americans living in Los Angeles to articulate their ethnic identity and their relationship with the Korean nation.The female golfers who dominate the tournaments of the Ladies Professional Golf Association provide another interesting case study. According to the LPGA, 43 of 123 international players were South Korean as of July 2011. This list did not include Korean-born players who were naturalized US citizens or ethnic Koreans living abroad, including Michelle Wie or Christina Kim from the United States and Lydia Ko from New Zealand. Again, Joo sees hegemony at work in the way these female athletes represent ideas of gender, nation, and ethnicity. The sexuality of Korean female athletes is presented in contradictory ways as daughters to be protected within the Korean family and as hypersexualized Asian women to be marketed in transnational commercial contexts. As national icons, successful female golfers demonstrate how Koreans should adjust to the neoliberal contexts of a globalizing Korea. The whole nation rejoiced at the remarkable success of the golfer Se Ri Pak, who won two of the four major tournaments on the LPGA tour in her rookie year of 1998, while the nation was reeling from the trauma of the Asian financial crisis. She came to symbolize how South Korea might pull itself out of the crisis through global competitiveness, individual drive, and private capital.In South Korea, the dominant discussion of golfers assumes that their success is due to their talent, hard work, and the sacrifice of their families. Often families move from South Korea to the United States or Australia to raise their daughters in golf-centered environments, to send their children to golf academies, and to live in areas where golf can be played year-round. In media narrative, father and daughter must bond to fight competitors in a foreign land. The father comes to standing for the national interest as he protects the progeny of the ore an nation in foreign contexts and ensures its enduring success. Some commentators also assume that Korean women are naturally well suited to forms of sport that require extreme precision and concentration, such as archery, billiards, figure skating, and golf. Conversely, non-Korean media sometimes point out that Korean golfers display a robotic qualitythe idea that they lack emotion, creativity, and individuality. These cultural stereotypes are nothing new. During the Cold War, athletes from socialist countries were often stereotyped as collectivistic, militaristic, and emotionless. In the globalization age, Korean athletes are valorized as national heroes for disciplining their bodies, garnering global media attention, and demonstrating economic results. The female golfer also strengthens the capitalist ideologies of segmented labor markets that treat female labor as unskilled and subordinate.Much media attention in South Korea is directed at athletes who compete abroad. These nationals icons bring global visibility to the nation, helping Korean corporations to win brand name recognition and bringing national or ethnic pride . Athletes who play abroad represent the image of the newly globalized Korean subject who leaves the country to succeed yet continues to maintain a strong sense of Korean identity. Sport operates in the affective realms of mass media to intensify and embolden feelings of nationalism and competition. Sport events also create contexts for the production of powerful feelings of nationalism and ethnic identity by diasporic subjects. Male athletes are often presented as warriors for the nation within the context of international competition. During the 2012 London Olympics, following South Korea's victory of Japan, soccer player Park Jong-woo displayed a sign proclaiming Korean possession over the contested Eastern Sea island known as Dokdo to Koreans. As a consequence he was banned from the medal ceremony and unlike his other 17 teammates he did not receive a bronze medal for his performance. In recent years, the competition between Kim Yuna and her Japanese rival Asada Mao was staged as a nationalist revenge of Korea against her former colonial ruler.Joo also shows the role that Korean media sport plays in shaping ideas of Korea and Koreanness for Korean Americans. Spectators who watch Korean athletes playing within US-centered sporting leagues are exposed to ideologies of ethnicity and nationalism. In the American context, a shift towards transnationalism as distinct from multiculturalism has tended to maintain the national distinctiveness of players, so that South Korean and other Asian athletes are characterized primarily as foreign nationals. As athletes themselves may work to diminish the significance of their own ethnic or national differences, corporate interests in sport often exploit these difference to market players of color to a racially segmented consumer market. In line with the racial presentation of Asian Americans as a model minority, Asian/American athletes are praised for assimilating within the context of US sport by being ""team"" players, behaving as obedient students of their coaches and agents, and avoiding negative or excessive attention on their personal lives.Athletes who enter the United States often become symbols of the American dream of immigrants and those who remain in their homelands. For the sport industry, foreign athletes also function as a conduit through which entire national markets might develop. The idea that players from abroad come with an entire nation of viewers is enthusiastically mentioned by commentators and sports writers. The Korean and Korean American fan base in baseball or in golf has increased considerably with the entry of Korean nationals into Major League Baseball and the LPGA. Clearly, disparities exist between South Korean and Korean American audiences, and national locations make a considerable difference in the ways that athletes are understood. In Korea, Korean American athletes were considered to be overseas KoreansKoreans in a foreign land. In America, events such as the 2002 World Cup contributed to activate a sense of Koreanness among Korean Americans. Many members of the Korean diaspora in the United States maintain active material, psychological, and emotional connections to Korea. With the emergence of Korean players in professional sport, Korean Americans began to feel a new sense of ethnic pride and transnational belonging.In Los Angeles' Koreatown, large crowds gathered to watch football games on large screens and cheered with thousands of others as fans did in Seoul. They engaged in simultaneous acts of media consumption across geographic and national boundaries. Although Latinos were also present in the Koreatown crowds, the uniformity of public support for the Korean team precluded the possibility of expressing a preference for another team or acting outside of the scripted behaviors of the event. On the day of the Germany-Korea semifinal, even Latino TV anchors wore the ""Be the Reds"" shirts in solidarity with the Korean fans. This stood in sharp contrast to the 1992 Los Angeles uprising, where shops run by ethnic Koreans were take as targets by African Americans and other ethnic groups. Korean media in both the United States and South Korea widely hailed this event as a major coming of age in the Korean American community. Of course, there is a certain irony that the mainstreaming of Korea America into American society constituted Korean Americans as a group of supporters of the Korean national team. They were fundamentally depicted as essentially Korean nationals on US soil.This irony is not lost on the author. True to her vocation as a party spoiler, she points out the ambiguities and ambivalence of media sport events. Her whole book is written against the enthusiasm of sport fandom and the collective emotions of the crowd. She continuously warns against the immediacy of adhering to collective events, which are always not far from mass hysteria and totalitarian regimentation. Behind the exhilarating feelings of joy and empowerment, she detects nationalistic hubris, sexual exploitation, and cultural hegemony. Her book is written against her own feelings and proclivities: she confesses that she, too, enjoyed the mass mobilization and national exhilaration. It is only after the facts, when she went back to graduate school and was exposed to a heavy dose of critical theory, that she took a negative view on what she had first experienced in blissful ignorance.The only time when she detects a political potential in mass events is when they fit her ideological agenda. She therefore supports the mass protests that took place in 2002 in the wake of the ""tank incident"" in which two young schoolgirls were run over by a US Army vehicle, or in 2008 when the Lee Myung-bak administration decided to lift the ban on the import of US beef. These large-scale protests recalled the ""affective memories"" and participation rituals that were first experienced during the 2020 World Cup events. It doesnt matter that these mass rallies had strong nationalistic undertones and a marked anti-American posture: for the author, this is a natural response to decades of what she calls US hegemony (not noticing the fact that her brand of cultural studies also participates in this hegemony). Visiting Seoul in 2008, she felt at home joining the demonstrations calling for the resignation of the newly-elected president and which gathered a motley crew of ""gay and lesbian organizations, immigrant rights groups, Buddhist nuns and monks, Christian organizations, labor unions, well-established non-profit groups, and citizen consumer groups, among many others.""

"When it comes to foreign affairs, business consultants are not in a position of strength. They face powerful rivals in the collective body of diplomats, whose job it is to report on a country's political situation and to offer clues as to where it might be heading. Diplomats do not only write and observe: they act in an official capacity, conveying messages or taking part in negotiations. They represent their sending state, provide protection to its nationals, and pursue the national interest by promoting peaceful relations between countries. They have a monopoly on these activities, which gives them a decisive edge when they conduct policy analysis or strategic forecasting. By contrast, consultants can only position themselves on niche markets. They can act as brokers or fixers in the sectors where public office intersects with private interests. They can provide information and commentary on a marketplace already crowded with academics and media pundits. Or they can get contracts from international organizations and foreign office departments who often hire outside experts for defined tasks.There is a domain however where private consultants have an edge over diplomats: they can compete in the marketplace for information and ideas. Diplomats are unaccountable to the outside public: they keep their cables secret, and only occasional leaks reveal the extent of their expertise. They transmit their correspondence to a small number of decision-makers, and they don't attempt to broaden their readership or to appeal to the media. Their goal is to be read by the right persons at the right time, not by the greatest number on the marketplace. By contrast, consultants use engaging rhetoric and marketing tools to peddle their intellectual production to people who are willing to pay for it. Their output has to be shaped in attractive forms that fit the needs of their clients. Hence the popularity of rankings and indexes, of early warning systems and macro trends, of quantitative estimates and alternative scenarios.The Eurasia Group is generally recognized to be the first political risk consultancy to systematically bring political science as a discipline to Wall Street. Its president, Ian Bremmer, should also be credited for bringing management tools to foreign policymaking. He uses the methods and tactics of the consulting industry in which he operates to address a wide audience of business executives, financial analysts, and policymakers. One of these standard tools is packaging a body of research with a catchy designation, and launching it on the market with great fanfare. Every two years or so a new concept is brought to the market in the form of a new book accompanied by a media campaign. I have already commented (here) on the G-Zero, which was the flavor of the year in 2012. Let me go back to an earlier entry, the J Curve, which was originally published in 2006 but which somehow survived product obsolescence and is still sometimes referred to in the media.The idea behind the J curve is very simple. The stability of a country is a function of its political openness. Openness increases as you move from west to east, while political stability increases as you move from south to north. This function is J-shaped: it gets worse before it gets better. Developing countries become less stable before they become more so. According to Ian Bremmer, the least open regimes (like North Korea) tend to be more stable than those undergoing a transition to openness which are least stable (like Iraq), while those that are most open are also the most stable (like the US). The stability of a country is defined as its ability to survive political shocks, or its capacity to avoid producing them. On the left side of the curve, stability depends on individual leaders--Stalin, Mao, Kim Jong-il. On the right side, it depends on institutions--democratic elections, checks and balances, civil society. There are no shortcuts from left to right because authoritarian elites cannot be quickly replaced with institutions whose legitimacy is widely accepted. The bottom of the curve represents a danger zone: with stability at rock bottom, a country becomes a failed state and, in the most extreme cases, simply ceases to exist. A country can avoid this precipice by moving back to the left size of the curve toward more authoritarianism. Or its leaders can use political capital to bring about reform and move toward the right side.The shape of the curve contains several important political messages. First, closed regimes--North Korea, say, or Cuba--are often more stable than partially open countries. The belief that such regimes need only a small shock to cause their implosion is probably wishful thinking. Contrary to most predictions, North Korea and Cuba survived leader succession, the end of the Cold War, and sustained economic sanctions by the US. Second, to move from being a closed regime to an open one, a country ""must go through a transitional period of dangerous instability"" that may require its leaders to spend huge amounts of political capital with no guarantee of success. Third, for a country on the closed-but-stable left side of the J curve, it is far easier to increase stability by becoming more closed and authoritarian than by embracing openness. It is faster and easier to close a country than to open it. It takes a lot more than money to build stability. One crucial ingredient is political capital, which makes a government legitimate, but which often runs in short supply.The J curve was designed as a tool for supporting decision-making by international policymakers and investors. ""As a model of political risk, the J curve can help us predict how states will respond to political and economic shocks,"" advertises the author. In theory, the two dimensions of stability and openness are quantifiable, and analysts can chart the position of a country along the curve. The shape of the curve also depends on external and domestic factors: shocks can make it move upward or downward, or make its slope more or less curved. The book doesn't attempt to put numbers behind these ideas, but it indicates that the two dimensions of the graph, openness and stability, could be easily quantified. Openness is defined as ""a measure of the extent to which a nation is in harmony with the crosscurrents of globalization--the process by which people, ideas, information, goods and services cross international borders."" But it also refers to the flow of information and ideas within a country's borders, making it congruent with the ""open society"" as defined by Karl Popper. Stability can be appraised by a measure of political risk, like the Global Political Risk Index developed by the Eurasia Group.The J curve provides a simple model to assist countries in their transition from authoritarian and opaque to democratic and transparent. Yet Ian Bremmer argues that the lessons of the curve have been consistently ignored by policymakers, and particularly by the Bush administration. It applied a sticks-and-carrots approach to regimes like North Korea, without realizing that isolating Pyongyang only serves the interest of the regime, which pursues stability through closure to the outside world. Pariah states--Bremmer lists North Korea, but also Burma, Belarus, Zimbabwe--are stable precisely because they are closed. The survival of these authoritarian states depends on maintaining the walls that insulate their peoples from the rest of the world. Imposing sanctions that reduce openness--to flows of information, to trade, to capital movements, to travels abroad--has the opposite of the intended effects, he argues. Better to let goods and ideas flow, which will ultimately erode the power base of the regime.This prediction is based on a strong postulate. ""If half the people of North Korea saw twenty minutes of CNN (or of Al Jazeera for that matter), they would realize how egregiously their government lies to them about life beyond the walls. That realization could provoke widespread social upheaval."" Here, in my opinion, lies a big flaw in the reasoning: Bremmer doesn't take into account the power of perceptions, imaginaries and cognitive lenses, which can distort the way information is processed by individuals. Here is an example: North Korean refugees who have suffered the hardships of the regime are often startled when they hear references to the ""North Korean famine"". For them, the period of general economic crisis that North Korea endured from 1994 to 1998 is referred to as the ""Arduous March"". Famine is something that happens in underdeveloped countries in Africa, not in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.Beyond this criticism, there is something egregious in the belief that a simple curve can describe the evolution of political regimes from closeness to openness. How to help turn authoritarian regimes into stable, open democracies is arguably the world's most pressing political challenge. It requires complex analytical tools, not quick-fix solutions. I don't think you can provide a model of how the world is working in the matter of just a few paragraphs. If Ian Bremmer really had a theory, he should have expanded it. Theoretical considerations should have taken at least half the book. Similarly, describing a country's political history and strategic outlook in only a few pages, as the author does in twelve case studies covering countries from all over the map, doesn't do justice to the cases at hand. Like the J-shaped curve, it gives the illusion of mastery but doesn't substitute to the nitty-gritty analysis that real expertise requires. Of course, you cannot ask too much from a popular essay aimed at a nonspecialist readership. But then, there are issues that are better left to the specialists.","2.0 out of 5 stars","February 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3DBAEICMOCRRR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0743274725#wasThisHelpful","R3DBAEICMOCRRR","A3IKQVN8N8AKRY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3IKQVN8N8AKRY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I wrote a somewhat lengthy review of the previous edition of The Two Koreas--""Can the division between the two Koreas long endure?"", available here. I read the third revised and updated edition, published in 2014, to refresh my knowledge of the history of inter-Korean relations and to get a briefing on the new developments that have occurred in the twelve years since Don Oberdorfer finished updating the previous version. I was disappointed by what I read. Part of it was due to the way the update was conducted and the new chapters were added; but my disappointment also came from the perception of flaws and defects in the original version that I had glossed over in my first reading. To put it succinctly, this new edition does not seize the opportunity to revise the previous version in a significant manner; it adds three new chapters that are partly incoherent with the previous ones; and it does not bridge the distance between investigative journalism and historical scholarship. Let me elaborate on these three points.A systematic tracking of the modifications between the 2001 and the 2014 editions reveals few significant differences in the first sixteen chapters covering the period between 1971 and 2000. Some sentences are deleted, others are added, words are changed, in what amount to a work of light editing. Despite the claim to the contrary, no real effort was made to update the earlier version in light of new information on old events. But in the meanwhile access to new documents from the time, written or oral testimonies of key players, and advance in scholarship should have allowed a more in-depth revision. The only significant additions are drawn from a couple of papers written at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars. They provide some limited insights on important episodes: Chinese efforts to deal with Pyongyang immediately after the Kissinger visit in 1971; evidence from Russian and Hungarian archives on North Korea's early nuclear program; Kim Il Sung's views on Vietnam as reported by Chinese officials who visited Pyongyang at the end of the Vietnam war; or a long cable to Berlin by the GDR embassy reporting the ""poplar tree axe murder incident"" in August 1976.But these additions amount to no more than a few lines here and there, and they do not change the narrative in any significant way. Conversely, some episodes are shortened or deleted, such as the attempt by South Korea's leaders to buy favors by handing sealed envelopes with thousands of dollars to a White House aide, who later complained through the embassy in Seoul. ""Miss Kim"", the North Korean spy who cast a spell on Oberdorfer when he interviewed her in Seoul under custody, is now only referred to as ""Kim"". As the endnotes show, there has been very little additions of new sources and documents, and virtually no new interviews or testimonies, between the two editions. The references, who were at the cutting edge of investigative journalism when the book was first published in 1997, therefore seem old and outdated some eighteen years later. In particular, over the past decade there has been an explosion of Chinese scholarship, based on access to previously unavailable sources and on renewed perspectives, that have shed new light on the relationship between the PRC and the DPRK. Whereas Westerners often describe this relationship by using the ""lips and teeth"" comparison, a North Korean diplomat was maybe more accurate when he complained in the late 1990 that the Chinese treat the North like ""dirt between their toes"". But the account written by Oberdorfer and edited by Carlin seems frozen in time, as if providing a definitive recording of history.The main difference between the two editions is, of course, the adding of three new chapters covering the period from 2001 to 2013. This part was drafted by Robert Carlin, who is described earlier in the book as ""the State Department's senior North Korea watcher, who had spent more than twenty years listening for nuances in North Korean statements."" Carlin is quite unlike Oberdorfer, and the comparison between the two parts of the book highlights their differences. Oberdorfer, who wrote for the Washington Post for twenty-five years, is the typical foreign correspondent, a larger-than-life character who doesn't hesitate to highlight his own role in the narrative. Based in Tokyo and then New York, he made regular visits to Seoul. He was there at important junctures, such as the press conference where president Park Chung-hee nearly escaped death and his wife was assassinated. By contrast, Robert Carlin was an analyst operating from a desk in Washington and didn't feel the pulse of Korean politics, although he made several visits to Pyongyang as part of expert teams assessing the nuclear program. Whereas Oberdorfer frequently used the first person, Carlin's involvement in events is handled in the third person.Most importantly, Oberdorfer had access to top officials, including successive presidents of the Republic of Korea and foreign ministers, whom he met for exclusive interviews as a news reporter and then for researching the book. His acknowledgment section reads like a Who's who in Washington and in South Korea, and also includes lists of contacts in North Korea, in China, in Russia, in Japan and in Europe. He conducted more than 450 interviews for collecting background information, and had access to many archives and declassified documents. His endnotes list these sources and contacts in a comprehensive way, and are an invaluable tool for people researching the topic. Carlin's endnotes are more succinct. They do not refer to diplomatic archives or personal interviews, and the publications that are listed are exclusively in English. They include the memoirs of the main players in the Bush administration: Bush himself, but also Cheney, Rumsfeld, Rice, Bolton (for whom ""Surrender is not an Option""), Pitchard (who wrote a vitriolic charge against what he labeled ""Failed Diplomacy"") and Victor Cha (whose book on ""The Impossible State"" has been described as ""530 pages of whitewash"" by a reviewer).Oberdorfer was entitled to his opinions. So is Carlin, but in a different way. He was a public servant during most of the period he describes, and is therefore subject to rules of confidentiality and non-disclosure. He was not a political appointee, and had to work under a policy line that he didn't approve. The harsh judgment that he exerts on the Bush administration is shared by many observers (a C-SPAN survey of presidential historians recently deemed it one of the ten worst in American history), but he is not the person most entitled to deliver it. He refers repeatedly to the deleterious climate in Washington that prevented addressing the North Korean question in a rational and dispassionate manner, but he does not even attempt to describe the personal or institutional rivalries between (and within) the White House, the State Department, the Pentagon, and the intelligence community. He charges that the Bush administration had no serious plan for what to do apart from ""ABC"" (Anything but Clinton), but he refers to several strategic assessments who proposed to chart a new course in policymaking. Perhaps his most acerbic critique is formulated by North Korean diplomats when they criticized their American counterparts after a catastrophic meeting: ""They were diplomats, but they wouldn't even discuss things,"" they complained. ""They just repeated the same thing over and over.""Rereading The Two Koreas also made me reassess the whole book. What I had first praised as excellent investigative journalism now appears to me as poor historical scholarship. First, the book lacks depth in the sense that it doesn't locate recent events in the wider course of history. There is no attempt to justify the starting date of 1971, and the closing date is so arbitrary that successive editions had to postpone it indefinitely. References to Korean culture are nowhere to be found, and the facts on record could have easily taken place in another civilization. Either the authors have only limited knowledge of Korean history and culture, or they do not deem it relevant for analyzing recent events. Second, their research in Korean materials is non-existent. Considering the closed nature of the Pyongyang regime, it is understandable that they could not check facts and collect opinions based on North Korean sources. But the Republic of Korea is an open democracy with a vibrant press and a solid academic sector. Its diplomatic records are available for all researchers to see. As in other countries, retiring politicians usually publish lengthy memoirs that are full of contextual information and personal recollections. It is a pity that all these sources and viewpoints have not been exploited. They are the bread and butter of serious history writing.The contrast between the absence of any Korean memoirs and the reference to all the books written by the Bush administration decision-makers suggests another critique: this book is overly centered on the United States. I have pointed in my previous review the lack of reference to Europe, which can be understandable considering the geographic distance and shallow involvement of European powers in the Peninsula question. At least Oberdorfer was able to get glimpses into the DPRK regime based on East Germany's archives. But he and his coauthor should have tried to get more perspectives from Beijing, Tokyo, Moscow, not to mention Seoul itself. In this journalistic narrative, the author often shares the limelight but Koreans lack agency, and other countries only feature as a sideshow. The Two Koreas portrays Korea as viewed from afar, and more specifically from Washington, at a time when getting local perspectives has never been so essential. The successive editions of the book give it an aura of legitimacy and make it pass as the definitive history of inter-Korean relations. But publications are subject to the law of diminishing returns. Three editions of the same book was at least one too many.","2.0 out of 5 stars","February 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3SCGVV0DS9909/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0465031234#wasThisHelpful","R3SCGVV0DS9909","A3IKQVN8N8AKRY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3IKQVN8N8AKRY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I remember reading a magazine article about an MBA student who was doing an internship in a large Korean company. He became so frustrated with the vagueness of his job assignment and the apparent absurdity of business practices that one day he went berserk: he took the elevator to the top floor and demanded he meet the chairman to have a personal conversation with him. He was so full of himself as an elite student from a top US business school that he couldn't accept being reduced to the role of a decorative potiche. No doubt influenced by the popular books about the Japanese corporation or kaisha, he conceived his internship as an initiation into the Oriental way of doing business, and was eager to learn the secrets that a large and successful conglomerate was bound to conceal. Or perhaps he viewed his experience as a kind of video game, where you have to explore dungeons and accumulate experience points before confronting the arch-villain.Although he was the holder of a Wharton MBA degree, in addition to his PhD in anthropology, Roger Janelli took on his fieldwork in a Korean conglomerate with a different mindset, and drew different lessons from his nine month long experience as an office worker. His experience was no less frustrating: he had the endorsement of the CEO to conduct participatory observation, but his assignment was ill-defined, and his position within the internal hierarchy somewhat ambiguous. He was asked to conduct English conversation classes and to help with translating texts into proper English. His desk was aligned next to the one of a section chief, but his company name card designated him as a ""researcher"", and his seniority made it difficult to engage with ordinary office workers on an equalitarian basis. He resented the social distance: he felt closer to the plight of the young office workers than to the concerns of management, but the bureaucratic setting precluded the possibility of establishing equal relationships. Office ladies, in particular, were strictly off limits, and he couldn't interact with them. But even with male white-collar workers and middle managers, it was difficult to establish a rapport.Fieldwork in a corporate context proved harder to do than the ethnography of a Korean village he had conducted more than a decade before. People at first were more forthcoming, and his inception followed the script that large companies have in place for receiving newcomers and integrating them into the organization. It is easier to pitch tent in a corporate office, especially if you have the blessing of the CEO, than to negotiate access into a closely-knit community. But companies do not have rules or procedures for hosting a resident anthropologist and accommodating for participant observation. It is harder to take part in everyday rituals, collect myths and observe social interactions in a corporate context than in a well-defined, isolated community. Most office life is boring, and people have little time to talk to a foreigner with only a modest command of Korean. In addition, Janelli realized that many managers spoke less frankly in public about their personal circumstances or views than did most villagers, academics, or members of the Korean middle class that he had encountered before. Some of them were afraid to talk; others could not hide anti-American sentiment; others yet were driven by interest, and saw no personal gain from talking to a stranger.It was also difficult to pass through some social barriers because of what he describes as his ""ineptness as a corporate citizen"". As his ethnography makes it clear, he came to espouse a liberal, pro-labor, progressive agenda that stood at variance with the interests of management. His strong sympathy went to the white-collar office workers and the junior managers who provided him with most of his information. But he also acknowledged his obligation to the owners of the company, without whose permission his fieldwork would not have been possible. He therefore abstained from advocating the progressive values that he held dear, and from making public his liberal political opinions. On some occasions, he even found himself defending and thereby contributing to the legitimacy of practices that younger men condemned. He also faced dilemmas balancing the requests of a descriptive ethnography with his attempt to address theoretical issues.His first intention when beginning fieldwork was to apply the knowledge acquired in his village ethnography in order to demonstrate the prevalence of Korean cultural traits and traditions in a corporate context. There were precedents for this endeavor. Analysts have described the Japanese corporation or ""kaisha"" as the reincarnation of the ""ie"" or household tradition, with the emphasis on filial piety and group behavior over individual self-interest. Similarly, historians have sought to demonstrate continuities between modern Korean bureaucratic behavior and that of the Choson dynasty. Many cultural traits have been put under the label of Confucianism, and used to explain economic or social outcomes. Confucianism was once considered (by Max Weber, among others) running counter to the spirit of capitalism and as being therefore detrimental to long-term economic development. The success of the Asian dragons led social scientists to reassess their views, and to consider the coexistence of various strands of capitalism.More generally, any deviation from the model of anglo-saxon corporate behavior was commonly seen as the result of tradition, culture, social structure, or other non-economic factors. But as Janelly soon discovered, pre-industrial Korean culture is not really relevant for understanding the Korean corporation. Modern Korean managerial practices could not be seen as the deterministic outcome of cultural traits that individuals carried with them to the company. The model of filial piety, or the emphasis on family-like solidarity, though often espoused in company ideology, can not be grafted onto the manager-subordinate relationship. Kinship relations, lineage management, or village solidarity that Janelli had studied at close range in his community studies, did not match the realities of corporate life.If anything, the modern institutions of the school, the university, the army, and of urban life in general, provided a more pervasive influence on corporate practices. In particular, army service seemed to have had a high impact on office life, with the ingrained habits of obedience, the rigid ranking system, and the unified chain of command. Whereas the company claimed that relations between superiors and subordinates were family-like, younger office workers viewed them critically as militaristic. Thus army experience could foster both subordination and resistance. Similarly, a university experience provided young recruits with a repertoire of obedience and deference to elders or sonbae, but it also exposed students to critical views of the chaebol, the Korean economy, and the international world order. As these examples ilustrate, neither traditional practices nor modern social institutions were shaping the Korean corporation in unilateral ways. There was no cultural determinism.Nor was there economic determinism, in the sense that the economic model of Korean capitalism did not shape the mindsets and social practices of Korean white-collar workers. The political economy was mediated by perceptions and beliefs. Janelli envisages three kinds of explanations of the Korean miracle--neoclassical, statist, and world-system theories--and shows that each paradigm is reflected in everyday conversations about the role of the market, the nature of state intervention in the economy, the equity of income distribution, the power of trade partners, and a multitude of other issues. These interpretations of the political economy of Korea were used as rhetorical arguments or moral repertoires to support or undermine managerial ideologies and state-led policies. The role of chaebols, or large conglomerates, elicited contrasted reactions. Some saw them at the vanguard of the national economy and credited them with contributing to the expansion of South Korea's GDP, creating job opportunities, enlarging exports, and enhancing national prestige through the export of automobiles and other relatively sophisticated goods. Others voiced criticism, pointing the chaebol's close ties with the government, the profits they drew from real estate speculation, the concentration of ownership in the hands of the founder and his family, and the repressive labor practices aimed at containing wage increases and labor unionism.The chaebol that Janelli studied showed ""an embarrassment of ideological riches"". Managerial ideology emphasized national welfare, harmony and unity, productivity and quality, sacrifice and service, technological innovation, as well as sincerity, diligence, and other moral qualities. Corporate governance was characterized by the low level of credibility of financial statements, a complacent board of directors, the staged nature of stockholders' meetings, and the enduring control by the owners-managers. Managers did not hesitate to use scolding tones and yell at their subordinates in weekly meetings when they would review past performance and pass on instructions. Office workers responded with strategies of passive resistance, surreptitious opposition, criticism and complaint. The long hours, the tedium of the work, constant management supervision, the harsh scolding and the strict hierarchy were particularly resented. Many new hires found company life so demoralizing that they resigned after only a few months. But open conflict was rare, and harmony by artifice prevailed between superiors and subordinates and among corporate divisions.Like a good dish, a book needs to be cooked for a right period of time, not too short but not too long either. This book has been too long in the making, and shows some signs of overcooking. To be sure, the length of the fieldwork on which it is based--nine months and a half--and the delay between the end of fieldwork and the completion of the manuscript--five years--are totally within the reach of standard anthropological practice. In a way, the author's long exposure to Korea and Korean studies was fortunate. He was reasonably conversant in Korean and, with the help of his wife Dawnhee Yim, he was able to exploit a long bibliography of scholarly references as well as newspaper articles and company documents in Korean. His fieldwork in a Korean village and his prior experience in an academic setting helped him in many ways. But his many references to theory and his borrowings from well-known authors (Bourdieu, Wallerstein, Giddens, Foucault, Rorty...) obfuscated his description of concrete events and social relationships. He could have written an equally meaningful monograph without making the theoretical apparatus so conspicuous.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2BNST4I60FBSR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0804725241#wasThisHelpful","R2BNST4I60FBSR","A3IKQVN8N8AKRY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3IKQVN8N8AKRY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Anthropology provides, among other things, a sense of locality. When you read a memorable ethnography, the spaces and places of the book become etched in your memory. After finishing the work, you might say, I feel like I was there. And yet the relationship between anthropology and space has been largely neglected in the theoretical literature. It is often limited to the notion of the terrain where fieldwork takes place, or to the symbolic categories by which space gets ordered and compartmented (as in Bourdieu's description of the Kabyle house). The geographic area where the ethnographer engages in participant observationthe village, the city ward, the factory workshop, the service areais often taken for granted. The location is described at the outset, often in the introductory chapter, but only figures as a stage where the action takes place rather than as a central character in the play.A recent tendency among anthropologists has been to abstract themselves from spatial boundaries, and to develop multi-sited ethnographies that are considered better adapted to our globalizing present. They sample situated encounters and follow transnational flows without strict commitment to terrain and fieldwork. Even when they stick to one location and emphasize the role of being there, ethnographers seldom expound on the idea that space and social interactions are symbiotic, and that, to put it in Henri Lefebvres terms, space is constituted through and constitutive of social relations and material social practices. Or as Lara Deeb and Mona Harb put it by introducing the notion of the Islamic milieu, the milieu is continually reconstructed and reproduced by various actors, as opposed to being either an existential state or merely a context in which people live. It combines notions of locality, morality, political sectarianism, and the everyday life.Reading Leisurely Islam made me feel like I was sitting in a Beirut caf. The analysis presented in the book emphasises lived space, highlighting the everyday ways that people experience the city through leisure. Patrons in a caf include people of different ages, styles, dress, and behavior; they study, flirt, chat, make out, laugh, hold business meetings, show off their clothes and accessories, eat and drink, and check out the other customers. As the author describe it, in our visits, we frequently saw men smoking argileh and discussing business matters, women talking over coffee, mixed-gender groups of students working on their laptops, and couples conversing intimately behind columns or in secluded corners. The introductory chapter begins with a long description of people moving in and out of a caf as in a fast-forward movie, with faces and bodies seen in accelerated motion, and sketches of lives that briefly appear on the screen. Then the authors shift to slow motion, taking close-ups of characters and recording their views regarding Islam, morality, and leisure.Describing a Beirut caf, or projecting oneself in such a place, exposes both the writer and the reader to the temptation of exoticism and the pitfalls of Orientalism. Beirut has long been described as the Paris of the Orient, and cafs form a traditional part of the urban landscape. In Orientalist discourse, locations often take the place of a social reality, obfuscating the social hierarchies and erasing the diversity of political expression. The Arab street has become such a common clich that even journalists avoid the expression when they describe urban upheavals or recent social movements taking place in the wake of the Arab springs. The way the two authors avoid the trap of Orientalism is, first and foremost, by situating the Orient. Their fieldwork took place in Dahiya, the southern suburb of Beirut inhabited by over a half-million people, mainly Shi'i Muslims. The leisure culture is relatively new there. And it has to accommodate with the strict moral rules of Shi'a Islam, as carried forth by religious scholars and by the Hizbullah party that dominates this section of Lebanese politics.Beirut is notorious as a sectarian city geographically divided into territorial enclaves affiliated with sectarian groups and their respective political movements. Dahia is thus commonly described as the Hizbullah stronghold, a Shi'a ghetto or the heart of the Resistance against Israeli invasion and occupation. Some of the book's descriptions validate these claims.  The portrait of Sayyid Hassan Nasrallay, Hizbullah's leader, is on display everywhere. Cafs and restaurants air Hizbullah's radio station al-Nour and its TV channel al-Nawar. Young men wear Hizbullah paraphernalia or religiously oriented accessories like miniature Qu'rans, and they worship the martyrs of the Resistance. The party, which is still on the United States' terrorist organization watchlist but nonetheless operates as a legitimate political party in Lebanese politics, sponsors many social activities, including youth clubs, cultural foundations, and neighborhood watch groups notifying the local authorities about improper activities taking place at local cafs. The party's explicit investment in culture both provides alternative cultural options for people and promotes a particular lifestyle based on specific moral ideas accompanied by political allegiance to the Resistance. Even Shi'i Muslims who are not Hizbullah members and disagree with the party's religious ideologies feel a sense of belonging to a broader Hizbullah community that has come to stand for the whole Shi'a minority.But Lara Deeb and Mona Harb show that Dahia is much more diverse than its description as a Hizbullah ghetto would suggest. Dahia is close to the Maronite-majority neighborhood of Hadath controlled by the Free Patriotic Movement political party led by Michel Haoun and allied with the Hizbullah in the March 8 Movement opposed to the March 14 Coalition led by Rafic Hariri before his assassination in February 2005. Young Shi'i Muslims hang out with their Christian allies and go to the same cafs and discos, provided they do not serve alcohol and keep acceptable standards of men-women relations. Every Shi'i family includes a Marxist uncle who supports various leftist secular organizations, or members who give their allegiance to Amal, a Shi'a militia which also took part in the struggle against Israeli occupation but that stands at loggerheads with Hizbullah. Despite the party's best efforts, Hizbullah doesn't have a monopoly on constructing the Islamic milieu. The Islamic vanguard generation born before 1970 keeps an ethos inspired by the struggle against Israel and rigorous adherence to Islamic strictures, but their children are more easygoing and want to enjoy life while taking Islamic morality as a given. It is on this young generation of more or less pious Shi'i Muslims that this book focuses, describing how they negotiate complex and competing sets of moral norms in their daily leisure activities.Paradoxically, by opening up to the cultural sphere, the Hizbullah has legitimized a realm of new possibilities and become one cultural stakeholder among many. As the authors describe, there are myriad possibilities for Islam and leisure to come together. Young Shi'i Muslims sense of proper behavior is best described as situational morality, flexible and malleable, open to negotiation and compromise. Religious rules have welded into social norms, such as not shaking hands between persons of the opposite sex or, for women, wearing the hijab. Young men use pick-up lines such as can I ask your father the permission to go out with you?, or can I visit you at your parents' place?In South Beirut as elsewhere, boys will be boys and girls just wanna have fun. They are looking for a good time, but they want to have it the Islamic way. Leisure has to be made Sharia-compatible, especially in the context of Lebanon where there are many competing religious authorities that allow people to pick and choose those fatwas that fit their own notion of proper behavior. In South Beirut, young Shi'a Muslims are less transgressive than Iranian youths, due to the fact that there is little formal regulation of morality, multiple sectarian authorities compete, and youths are policing themselves for moral behavior. Symetrically, being a Muslim in South Beirut can be fun. Faith and leisure can be brought together, and there are many ways to bring Islam within the precinct of youth cultureincluding the emo-hijab style, which the authors describe as a sort of Muslim goth meets Flashdance aesthetics. Islam as it is practiced by these more or less pious Shii Muslims is a religion that says yes to life, not a life-negating or otherworldly set of beliefs.From Charles Baudelaire to Walter Benjamin, cafs have long been associated with modernity. Leisurely Islam reminds us that there is not only one way to be modern, and that alternative modernities may coexist in identical or neighboring locations. At a time when Shi'a Islam is ofren associated with a culture of death or an ethos opposed to life and its pleasures, this book reminds us that young, more or less pious Shi'a Muslims also know how to have a good time. It confirms and complements other ethnographic studies based on Iran that show a profound generational gap between edonistic youths and their revolutionary elders. By describing a generation of more or less pious youths who take piety as normative while looking to consume multiple moral and geographic options in their leisure practices, Lara Deeb and Mona Harb bring Shi'a Islam within the purview of modernity and decenter our vision of Beirut as a cosmopolitan and multicultural site.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R39MQJXBD41ATW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0691153663#wasThisHelpful","R39MQJXBD41ATW","A3IKQVN8N8AKRY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3IKQVN8N8AKRY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Historians of a Marxist or structuralist bent have often described Asian societies as static and backward as opposed to the dynamism and advanced nature of European societies. Using notions such as the Asiatic mode of production, or referring to Oriental despotism, they have tended to overlook the changing nature of ruling powers in Asia. The Asia they describe appears as stuck in time, forever repeating the same cycle of conquests and retreats, of mastery and submission. Asia no longer seems able to claim history or to capture the spirit of the time. Located where the sun rises, the Orient embodies the dawn of civilization, but cannot represent its future. A similar argument posits Asia as the continent of empires, and divides its civilizations between two kinds of political entities: land-based empires relying on irrigation agriculture  and controlling vast swathes of lands, and smaller coastal states drawing their resources from commerce and based on the control of trade routes.Traditional histography likewise explains the decline of the Portuguese seaborne empire in Asia by its pre-modern, pre-capitalist nature. The Portuguese state was medieval by nature and thus of limited efficiency in pursuing military expansion and commercial mercantilism. It was spread too thin over a huge area of land and water, and lacked the technological know-how or administrative skills to rule and control such a vast empire. There was no strict separation between the state and the private sector, and no separation between civil and military administration. Aristocratic rulers and condottieri relied on foot soldiers and trusted merchants who stayed loyal to them because money and perks, in a vertical relationship of vassalage. They were moved by the drive for plunder and accumulation, not by the quest for profit and rational exploitation. By contrast, the chartered companies of the Netherlands (the VOC) and of Great Britain (the East India Company) are seen as the embodiment of the rationality and efficiency of modern capitalism.A contrarian interpretation posits the Portuguese empire as thoroughly modern, even as a precursor of our post-modern present. It relied on networks, nodes and flows, not on strongholds and fixed structures. Its political units were the trading post and the entrepot city, not the imperial capital or the garrison state. It wouldn't be too far-fetched to see in the Portuguese empire the first embodiment of Deleuze and Gattari's rhizomatic state, or of Hart and Negri's multitude. The purpose of the colonial rule was to control flows and capture rents, not to conquer territory and amass resources. The first globalization of seafaring exploration and spice trade prefigures our present globalization of cyberspace expansion and financial flows. Then as now, territorial conquest was not an end in itself, rather power was to be acquired by controlling choke points and extracting rents from the activities most affected by the removal of borders. Authority established itself by negotiation and compromise as much as by armed constraint.These views, not meaningless by themselves, lack something otherwise essential: a sense of history. Attention to detail and adherence to sources is what matters to the historian. To the view of a seamless past and static structures, the historian substitutes periods and turning points. The Asian continent and maritime space that the Portuguese started to explore in 1500 were different from the one in which they had settled in 1600, or that saw their retreat and decline in 1700. Oriental despotism was not always despotic, and the Asiatic mode of production allowed for many variants and institutions that prefigure capitalism. The opposition between agrarian continental empires and merchant coastal states doesn't stand for the whole period, and is undermined by the mixed nature of maritime empires (the thalassophobia of the Ming, the Moghul and the Safavides was much exagerated) and of landed trading posts (Ormuz or Malacca relied on a vast hinterland).Sanjay Subrahmanyam pokes several holes into the interpretation that sees the Portuguese empire as a medieval remnant that had to give way to the pre-capitalist enterprises of the Netherlands and of Great Britain. The VOC and the East India Company were no more rational, and no less dependent on the state, that the Estado da ndia. The Dutch themselves as portrayed by historian Simon Schama were less thrifty and frugal than described by the proponents of the Protestant ethic of capitalism. The Portuguese did retreat from Asia after 1610, but they remained dominant in Brazil and in the Southern Atlantic, and therefore a general explanation has to account for these diverging outcomes. Likewise, it makes no sense to contrast a medieval Portugal and a modern Netherlands. Both were the product of their times, and operated within a set of political and economic constraints. As for the postmodern interpretation that sees in Goa the precursor of the deterritorialized city at the intersection of flows and networks, it exposes itself to the charge of anachronism: history doesn't repeat itself, and the first globalization is very different by its nature from the current wave of globalization.So before the American century, or prior to the Asia Pacific era, we are reminded that there was a first wave of globalization and that it originated from the Iberian peninsula. The Spanish conquest of America, its settlement in the Philippines, the Portuguese presence on the coasts of Africa, of India and the Far East occurred at a time when France was still torn by its wars of religion, when England was marred in internal strife, and when the first colonists were just settling in North America. Many factors lead the historian to situate the emergence of this first world economy between the years 1570 and 1640: the establishment of regular maritime liaisons between Europe and Asia, often via Africa and America; the global circulation of gold and silver, and the arbitrage trade generated by price discrepancies; the high demand for foreign products such as spices or silk and cotton textiles; the mixing of populations and cultures between Europe and Asia and the reactions of conversion or rejection generated by these contacts.There was a time when Portugal was at the center of a world economy, and it therefore fully deserves a larger place in European textbooks than the mere mention of Vasco de Gama and his discovery of India. But it makes no sense to substitute Eurocentrism with a different kind of ethnocentrism centered on the Iberian peninsula. If the sixteenth century is to be seen as the century of Spain and Portugal, it appears so from a European perspective, but it could well be seen as the century of Asia. This book's most basic contribution is to decenter our gaze and to allow us to view the Portuguese empire in Asia from the perspective of Asian shores, and not only from the banks of the Tage. Asia's history (or America's for that matter) doesn't begin with the arrival of caravels from Europe. Peoples of Asia were the heirs of ancient civilizations and very long histories that were not interrupted by the arrival of Europeans. In 1570, less than 20 000 Portuguese had settled in Asia. Asia can no longer be seen as a mere stage for Europe's intrusion: it followed its own rhythm, influenced the colonial presence with indigenous strategies, and exerted its influence over European history in return.It doesn't mean that Subrahmanyam substitutes the colonial gaze with the perspective of the colonized, or that he shifts the center of attention from Lisbon to Goa. He is not interested in political correctness, and doesn't privilege the viewpoint of the subaltern, because for this period at least the subaltern cannot speak. One of the book's main contribution is to let the archives speak, and to allow the reader to hear the voices and testimonies from a distant past. Archival documents are presented in true historical fashion, situated in their context and interpreted through analytical lenses. Besides Portuguese and Dutch sources, Subrahmanyam also quotes excerpts from the Kitab-i Bahriye from the Ottoman admiral Piri Reis, or from the Yuehchien pien from Wang Lin-hsiang. Asian sources often fill the gaps and silences of European archives with useful facts and interpretations from Asian voices. Such an endeavor requires extensive language skills as well as a mastery of various historiographical traditions. What Subrahmanyam offers is a new synthesis on an important topic as well as an introduction to the emerging field of globalized history.The sixteenth century was the time of the first mtissages and saw the emergence of a world economy matched by a world culture and society. In contrast to the case of America's conquest by Spaniard and Portuguese conquistadors, Asia provides food for thought for those interested in the connection or the closure of cultures. It shows how strategies of Westernization and conversion to Catholicism had to face the adverse realities of hostile cultures and geographical dispersion, even if the history of the Paravas communities in the coastal areas of southern India or the Christian experiment in Japan (with more than 300 000 converts before the Tokugawa Bakufu) offer testimonies of the permeability of cultures. The Estado da ndia, and the Portuguese presence in Asia, was in fact limited to niches and enclaves. Goa, Cochin, Macao or Nagasaki were outposts or intermediary spaces were ethnies, religions and lifestyles would come in contact and influence each other. But beyond these trading posts, in the vast hinterland of continents and empires, the European influence waned, and local traditions claimed their authority.As he states in his foreword to the 2012 edition, Subrahmaniam eschews political correctness.  He doesn't distribute blame or exert judgment on the European colonial enterprise, and doesn't stand in favor or against the Portuguese empire. His use of Asian archives is not intended to provide a voice to the subaltern, but to provide the reader with a richer sense of history. At a time when cultural studies are all the rage, and when the length of interpretation is inversely proportional to the volume of consulted archives, Subrahmanyam reconciles us with economical and social approaches to history. He stands in the tradition of the Ecole des Annales (with frequent references to French historian Jean Aubin), and enriches his text with numerous charts and figures. He allows us to envisage the history of empires in other terms than only conquest and resistance or submission. The world of fidalgos and cavaleiros, of casados and cristos novos, of castios and arrenegados all come to life in these rich pages of monumental erudition and intelligent synthesis.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R190DPXRJ1YEGS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0470672919#wasThisHelpful","R190DPXRJ1YEGS","A3IKQVN8N8AKRY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3IKQVN8N8AKRY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A modern composer wrote an opera titled Einstein on the Beach. Haruki Murakami, the Japanese novelist, published Kafka on the Shore, in 2002. The modern philosopher also goes to the beach, walks on the seashore, and wonders. Is there something beyond the horizon? How can one respond to its call, to its promise? According to Bertrand Westphal, these questions are thoroughly modern. They mark the West's entry into modernity, which he sees as the beginning of a catastrophe of immense proportions. In his reconstruction of the Western gaze from the seashore, the horizon begets dreams of cupidity, and cupidity begets the violence of conquests. ""From the moment one started to consider the fabulous horizon seen from a beach, one began to turn a page in the great book of the history of mentalities."" The view of the horizon as seen from a beach has a different effect on the postmodern philosopher. It evokes literary texts, theoretical considerations, and intertextuality. The call of the open sea prompted the author to come back to a task he had left unfinished and to offer a second book of geocriticism, a method of literary analysis that takes the study of geographic space as its core practice.What is geocriticism? And what brings the literary critic to the beach? The answer to that second question is easy. Upon completing his previous book, Bertrand Westphal thought he had said all he had to say about space and its literary uses. He then responded to an invitation to spend a six-month sabbatical at the University of Valencia, one of Spain's oldest universities, conveniently located on the east coast of the Iberian Peninsula, with some of Europe's most beautiful sandy beaches. Being an academic and a literary critic, Westphal didn't only work on his suntan. He brought Dante to the beach, and meditated on the Supreme Poet's consideration of seashores and horizon lines. He also visited medieval cathedrals and Roman villas, scrutinized Portulan charts and other navigational maps kept in university libraries, and read or reread texts ancient and modern. He then concluded he had enough material for a new book, and this is how The Plausible World was conceived.But this is a book of literary criticism, not of balneal metaphysics. Geocriticism is based on three theoretical concepts: spatio-temporality, referentiality, and transgressivity. The idea that space and time form a continuum (space-time) is a tenet of modern physics. In the field of literary theory, geocriticism is an interdisciplinary method of literary analysis that focuses not only on such temporal data as relations between the life and times of the author (as in biographical criticism), the history of the text (as in textual criticism), or the story (as studied by narratology), but also on spatial data. The text refers to a geographical space that can be found in reality, but also in the realm of the imaginary. Indeed, the distinction between real and imaginary space is not clear-cut, and a locality transposed into literature (such as Italo Svevo's Trieste, or Fernando Pessoa's Lisbon) irrevocably marks our perception of reality with a literary component. Lastly, Westphal affirms the transgressive nature of geocriticism by drawing on postmodern authors (Deleuze and Guattari, Michel Foucault, Giorgio Agamben) and by referring to texts and events outside the Western canon.As Westphal reminds us, maps were not always oriented toward the north. The medieval ""T-O"" maps had two rivers forming a T separating three continents disposed in a circle, with the Orient as the upper half-circle and Jerusalem in the middle. The Tabula Peutingeriana, drawn in the fourth century, described the Roman empire as projected on a scroll and insisted on roads and toponymy. Such maps were meant to be read aloud and memorized, not just looked at and referred to. The Chinese pictured the world as a square or a rectangle, not a circle. Arab mapmakers such as al-Idrissi, author of a 1154 world map, would put the south on top and the Mecca at the center. It is only in the eighteenth century that the northern orientation of world maps was definitively confirmed. And only in recent decades did modern world maps based on new projection techniques replace the Mercator projection, in which Greenland was larger than Africa, Scandinavia as big as the Indian subcontinent, and with Europe and North America forming the dominant land mass.Cultural analysis of geography often refers to the ""Omphalos syndrome"", the propensity of peoples and nations to put themselves at the center of the known world. This syndrome manifests itself both in the drawing of maps, with the North on top and the dominant polity at the center, and in the planning of cities, where a central milestone often imitates the Omphalos that the Greeks put near the Oracle in Delphi and that they saw as the center of the world. Geography is a political science, and maps reflect a worldview or philosophy as much as actual knowledge and scientific imaging. Westphal tracks the utterances of the Omphalos in Greek mythology and history, highlighting the fact that the world's umbilicus is often slightly decentered from its central position in ancient texts, from Homer to Plutarch. In modern maps as well, there is always a blurring of fixed boundaries and stable meanings. Maps are texts, and as Derrida has taught us, texts are fraught with ambiguities and contradictions. Like in deconstruction, there is always a margin for interpretation. One cannot settle an argument with maps; if anything, drawing maps generates new claims and rivalries.Very often, geographical knowledge did not originate in travels and observation, but in myth and religion. Our geography is still steeped in Greek myths. Heroes of Greek mythology gave their names to continents (Europe, Asia, Oceania), to oceans (the Atlantic) or to vast landmasses (Amazonia). The Argonauts' travels, or Ulysses' odyssey, have shaped our sense of space and our expectation of an unknown world lying beyond the horizon. Before explorers pushed the boundaries of the known world to its limits, it was not the geographical position of a location that would determine its place on the map, but its importance and meaning in biblical or classical texts. Some cities, like Babylon, were put haphazardly on the map because their existence had been recorded in the Scriptures. Other places were pure fictions, like the fantastic chimeras and imaginary beasts that adorned the margins of ancient maps: land and cities without mooring or attachment, that nevertheless survived as floating signifiers on various parts of the geographical imagination.Such was the island of Tabropane that was rumored since Alexander's conquests to lie south of the Indian subcontinent and that mapmakers situated in various locations before the island of Ceylon, or modern Sri Lanka, was actually located. It was a place that existed only in literature. For Petrarch, Tabropane was the name of an ideal polity where the king was chosen on the basis of his virtue, not according to blood ties. In Cervantes' Don Quichotte, the glorious Hidalgo watches on the horizon the armies of prince Alifanfaron from Trabopane fighting against the king of Garamantes. Some people located Tabropane near Babylon, others in India, others yet in Sumatra. Another geographical fiction was the kingdom of Prester John, which fueled the imagination of generations of crusaders and adventurers. The space of imagination was projected onto the geographical map. The existence of Australia (the possibility of an island) was conjectured long before it was discovered. Fiction was ahead of reality, and explorers merely confirmed what poets had been dreaming all along.The description of the last virgin lands and the filling of blanks on the map marked the entry into a finite world, the culmination of a process that started with the Renaissance and the discovery of the New World. Westphal uses the expression ""mtrise du monde"" to refer both to the world's mastery (matrise) through exploration and conquest and its scaling (based on geometry) along lines and parallels, latitudes and longitudes. Maps and mapmaking were an instrument of the colonial intrusion. Again, the ""Omphalos syndrome"" operated in full swing. Lands occupied from times immemorial were ""discovered"" and colonized, borders were drawn and toponyms imposed. ""How many civilizations and peoples disappeared from the map solely to satisfy the Omphalos syndrome that plages the West,"" writes Westphal emphatically.Although Westphal quotes many authors, from Paul Zumthor to Augustin Berque, from Michel Serres to Guattari and Deleuze, perhaps the writer who exerted the strongest influence on his writing was the Italian philosopher Giorgio Agamben. Westphal borrows from him a taste for metaphors, a wide range of references that include Church fathers as well as medieval thinkers from the Muslim world, and references to ancient myths that help him decipher our present. Most of all, he takes from Agamben an apocalyptic view of modernity that uses hyperbolic rhetoric and messianic tones to herald the end of history and the blurring of moral categories. Whereas Agamben sees bare life and the state of exception as culminating in totalitarianism and the Nazi camps, Westphal goes back to the origins of modern times and sees in colonization (starting with the Canary islands in 1402) the crucible in which our present originated (""without colonialism, there is no modernity""). This cataclysmic eschatology is sketched right from the opening of the book, in an introduction that mixes allusions to Nietzsche (human, too human; the eternal feminine) and quotations from Adorno. It is pursued with frequent references to Dante's inferno, which can be read as an apt metaphor of our descent into modernity.In this context, references to beach tourism and to other elements of popular culture (soccer; movies; contemporary fictions) do not depart from this postapocalyptic vision, but add to it a postmodern ring that squares well with the author's professed relativism (""Reality and fiction, objectivity and imagination, are relative notions. As relative as viewpoints""). Indeed, as Westphal underscores, maps and map-making are in vogue in contemporary texts, and they provide a postmodern metaphor attuned to our times of geopolitical anxieties and bordered identities. From cognitive maps to roadmaps, maps are all over the map, and they also feature prominently in contemporary classic novels such as Thomas Pynchon's Mason & Dixon or Ba Gonzlez's Mapmakers' Opera. Westphal often refers to what he refers to as ""postcolonial literature"", for which maps and the drawing of borders is an existential issue. His many references to non-Western geographers and explorers, from the Malinke emperor Abou Bakari II to the Chinese admiral Zheng He, also serve to contest the primacy of the West in our conceptions of literary space.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3HB06AE1NVA7R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1137364580#wasThisHelpful","R3HB06AE1NVA7R","A3IKQVN8N8AKRY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3IKQVN8N8AKRY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"There is a Chinese proverb that says, ""When the sage points out to the moon, the fool looks at the finger."" In true Maoist fashion, we should reverse the saying, and swap the roles between the fool and the sage. It is the fool who is pointing at the moon, and his pointed finger needs close examination. The moon, in this example, represents global power status, and the fool's finger stands for David Shambaugh's botched attempt to assess China's growing international footprint.In China Goes Global, Shambaugh expounds on the idea that China is not significantly influencing world affairs and that it remains a partial power - as opposed to a true global superpower like the United States, which sets the norm of what nascent powers like China should aspire to become. In field after field of global activity, China is compared to the standard set by the US, and fails the test by a wide margin. In multilateral diplomacy, contribution to global public goods, global business and investment, ODA policy, culture and soft power, security and military affairs, the conclusion remains the same: China ""punches below its weight"", is ""not carrying proportionate international responsibility"", and remains ""a partial power"".  Even economically - the one area where one would expect China to be a global trendsetter - we find that China's impact is much more shallow than anticipated. Shambaugh concedes that ""only in some sectors does China actually exercise global influence: global trade patterns, global energy and commodity markets, the global tourism industry, global sales of luxury goods, global real estate purchases, and cyber hacking.""Throughout the book, China's outward performance is evaluated on a scale and according to criteria dictated by the dominant power. Indeed, there a subtle irony at work in China's vying for international status: China aspires to be a global player, but the rules of the game are set in a way that protects the incumbents against outside competition. The international rankings, the evaluation benchmarks, the concepts used to discuss global influence all incorporate subtle biases and in-built preferences that tilt the playing field toward one camp at the expense of the other. Nowhere does the author envisage that the rules of the game may evolve and be changed when a new set of players enter the fray, or that they may begin to play an entirely different game. The assumption is that America's approach of pursuing a broad base of influence continues to be effective, and that it shows the direction others should follow to claim a similar degree of influence for themselves.Nowhere is this more evident than in the discussion on soft power. The concept has been espoused enthusiastically by Chinese scholars and policymakers. Everybody laments China's lack of soft power, explains this deficit by cultural, economical, or political arguments, and offers recipes on how to build it. But as Shambaugh reminds his readers, Joseph Nye's concept of soft power is ""largely about the capacity of a society to attract others, rather than a government to persuade others."" As a consequence, Beijing's effort at seeking influence through public diplomacy and cultural presence is useless, and may even be counterproductive. Soft power, like good taste or proper manners, is ""not something that can be bought with money or built with investment."" It is the code of honor that incumbent powers post against the new rich in order to limit access to the club.Soft power exerts a subtle form of cultural hegemony, defined as the diffusion of values that ensure the social reproduction of the ruling elite. By putting soft power outside the purview of government policy and squarely on the side of civil society, Joseph Nye and his epigones merely reproduce an American model in which the promotion of cultural assets is carried out by the private sector, with minimal state intervention. Looking at cultural policies throughout the world, this model is the exception rather than the norm. The ""cultural exception"" touted by French politicians only states a ""new normal"": massive public involvement in the promotion of culture, language and values that are competing for a place in the battle of ideas.One strength of the book is that it quotes many Chinese scholars and politicians, and attributes the ideas expressed to their original author. Many Chinese experts thus emphasize that China still hasn't achieved global preeminence, and that it may be set on a different course than previous patterns of hegemony. For instance, vice foreign minister Cui Tiankai states that ""China's position is far behind the United States. We are not a peer of the United States... We have no intention to compete for global leadership."" Or a MOFA official: ""We are not very good at public diplomacy, of telling our positions to the world. It is important to tell the world what we are doing, but we don't know how to tell our story effectively."" Or Yuan Xuetong, from Tsinghua university: ""China is not prepared for world leadership."" Indeed, these positions are expounded in the White Paper on Peaceful Development published in 2011, and from which the author draws a few excerpts. ""China's peaceful development has broken away from the traditional pattern where a rising power was bound to seek hegemony.""  ""For China, the most populous country, to run itself well is the most important fulfillment of its international responsibility.""What are we to make of such quotes? First, and this should have been underscored more forcefully by the author, China is in a league of her own as a 1.3 billion-strong developing country. Unilaterally, China makes an important contribution to global governance by effectively governing itself. On global health issues for instance, China has an important role to play merely by maintaining a careful watch over transmittable diseases at home, and by publicizing the results. Having lifted 660 million people out of poverty since 1981, China's contribution to global development dwarfs all the achievement publicized by the aid community. China's adoption of world standards such as trade rules or corporate governance principles makes them truly universal, and Beijing's participation in global forums like the G20 increase their legitimacy and representativeness.As effective as China becomes in ""telling its own story"", its image will always be shaped by outside perceptions. Chinese experts' modesty in assessing their country's outward performance may be seen as a cultural trait. Confucian scholars value humility and self-restraint, and are educated in the virtues of collective endeavors. Instead of taking pride in their past achievements, they emphasize the part of the journey that remains to be travelled.  But their lack of pretention can also be construed as a ploy to hide China's underlying strength and to bid time in their strategy for global preeminence. Conversely, when a Chinese representative brags about his country's performance and others' failures (as became more common after the financial crisis and global economic slowdown), outsiders are the first to denounce his arrogance. Indeed, Shambaugh popularizes the notion that, beginning in mid 2009 and lasting through the end of 2010, Beijing moved to a more assertive stance on the regional and world stage. The idea that 2010 represented a turning point known as the ""year of assertiveness"" was recently debunked by Harvard scholar Alastair Iain Johnston, who showed that this misperception was largely a reflect of punditry and the blogosphere's new importance in foreign policy debates.According to one American scholar quoted by Shambaugh, China needs a foreign policy `reset'. But looking at the way things go, it is the whole international system that needs a reset. To make such a claim turns one into what Shambaugh labels a revisionist, as opposed to a supporter of the status quo. But the status quo is simply not viable and cannot endure. Consider the following:. A world where Chinese consumers enjoy the same lifestyle as Americans would need two extra planets to sustain itself. Natural resources are not inexhaustible, and carbon emissions cannot be doubled without causing massive damage to the planet.. The international system was never bipolar; it was divided into two camps. To have two or more powers pursuing a strategy of global influence makes the system highly unstable. To provide some degree of stability and predictability, the system must coalesce around one equilibrium.. The theory of power transition, whereby a rising power inevitably challenges the incumbent, cannot hold in an age of nuclear weapons and global interconnectedness. If China and the United States enter into conflict with each other, it will be over regional issues like Taiwan or North Korea, and not because of a contest for world supremacy.When the fool points to the moon, the sage looks at the finger, shrugs his shoulders, and invents a telescope. China is a game-changer, and its entry into the field is changing the rules by which the game is played. To assess China's global presence by existing standards and criteria is to miss the mark by a wide margin.

"Recently Hashimoto Toru, mayor of Osaka and president of Japan's Restoration Party, caused outrage when he declared that Japan's wartime use of comfort women was ""understandable"", implying that when male soldiers are at war, organized efforts to provide women to satisfy their lust are natural, and that the practice has been adopted by many countries. He further undermined his credibility by saying that U.S. soldiers on Okinawa should use the island's ""adult entertainment industry"" in order to reduce incidences of sexual assault on local women. Facing domestic and international uproar, he retracted the second comment and formulated an apology to the American people and to the U.S. military. But he stuck to his first comment on comfort women, claiming he had been misunderstood and that other countries were also guilty of sexual abuses during wartime. He called the use of comfort women, many of whom were recruited in Japanese-ruled Korea, ""an inexcusable act that violated the dignity and human rights of the women"".To the Japanese public, these comments brought up memories from a not so distant past. They echoed the decision taken by the first postwar cabinet, immediately after Japan's surrender, to provide sexual services to the US Occupation Forces through a system of administered prostitution. The Japanese officials hoped that special comfort women would provide an outlet for the occupiers' sexuality, help to prevent mixed blood, and serve as a buffer between ""good"" Japanese women and GIs. Similar plans were also proposed by German officials managing the postwar transition, only to be turned down by American commanders, who unsuccessfully tried to apply a strict policy of non-fraternization between U.S. soldiers and German male and female nationals. Likewise, during the Korean War, the Korean government reinvigorated the Japanese institution of ""comfort stations"" to serve Allied Forces and Korean soldiers in the name of protecting respectable women and rewarding soldiers for their sacrifice. These unsavory episodes belong to an immediate postwar or a wartime context; but despite the official ban on prostitution, the institution of camptown prostitution or ""adult entertainment"" has accompanied the U.S. military presence abroad throughout the years.Regardless of what Osaka's mayor has said, or meant to say, there is a genuine need for an open debate on the side effects of large military deployments overseas and on official attitudes regarding the sexual demands of male soldiers. These public attitudes are fraught with ambiguities and contradictions. On the one side, the U.S. military, and many host country governments, maintain a prohibition on prostitution and punish it with variable sanctions. On the other hand, they tolerate and even regulate the presence of camptown prostitution, registering sex workers and imposing medical visits in order to limit the spread of venereal diseases. While modern rest-and-relaxation (R&R) facilities and adult entertainment may not always involve paid sex, the presence of transnational sex workers with little legal protection raises the issue of transborder human trafficking, which the U.S. strongly condemns. At a time when U.S. policymakers are debating the future shape of the global network of military bases, the new global posture, which emphasizes mobile forces sent on short-term deployments without families, has far-reaching implications for gender and sexual relations with host societies.The essays collected by Maria Hhn and Seungsook Moon in this volume are not limited to the issue of prostitution - although the book cover makes the theme quite explicit. Written with a historical perspective, and using the lenses of gender and postcolonial studies, they illustrate the various aspects of the politics of gender, sexuality, race, and class that are constitutive of the maintenance of America's military presence in its main postwar locales: West Germany, Japan and Okinawa, and South Korea (with an additional essay on Abu Ghraib). The authors insist that this global network of military bases constitutes what can only be described as an empire: indeed, ""the debate is focused not on whether the United States is an empire at all but on what kind of empire it is."" The absence of formal colonies and the reliance on bilateral or multilateral security arrangements and Status of Forces Agreements (SOFAs) obfuscate the deep power imbalances between the imperial power and its military projection outposts, creating a relationship that the authors frame in neocolonial terms.By focusing on the social and cultural impacts of the United States' military presence overseas, the authors' ambition is to ""make visible this unprecedented empire of bases"". The U.S. military empire has bearing not only on the lives of soldiers and their families, but also on the lives of camptown workers, who cater to their needs, and on residents of local host communities, who have to deal with the economic, social, and cultural consequences of their presence. America's global military footprint is ubiquitous. During the Cold War, some 500,000 soldiers, as well as tens of thousands of civilian employees and hundreds of thousands of family dependents, were stationed overseas. Most Americans would be stunned to hear that the United States now maintains military bases in more than 150 countries. In the Middle East, it has kept a substantial military presence in Bahrain and Turkey for more than fifty years. To provide housing and training facilities for its personnel, the U.S. military controls almost 29 million acres of territory. And the SOFA agreements cover relations with host countries in minute detail, granting legal privileges to American servicemen that are deeply resented by local citizens.According to the volume editors, ""the U.S. military displayed a colonial perception that women of occupied territories in Korea, Japan, and Germany should be sexually available for GIs, just as colonized women of color had been available to European colonialists."" Within the context of these three countries, nowhere was the neocolonial character of the U.S. presence more evident than in South Korea. Clustered in Kyonggi Province and around Seoul, camptowns became a virtually colonized space where Korean sovereignty was suspended and replaced by the U.S. military authorities. The clubs and bars catering to GIs were legally off-limits to Korean nationals (except for registered hostesses and sex workers). After the Korean War, liaisons between GIs and Korean women often took the form of concubinage, a practice developed in European colonies whereby a white man and a local woman would cohabit outside the respectability of marriage and dissolve their relation upon the white man's departure. Although the U.S. now maintains a zero-tolerance policy with regard to human trafficking and prostitution, many Filipinas or Russian camptown women fall prey to similar arrangements with American soldiers, and are left raising children alone because their GI boyfriends or husbands have returned to the United States. Foreign migrant workers continue to be subjected to abuse and violence, and the exploitative working conditions maintained by business owners and managers often comes close to the trafficking in persons that the U.S. State Department so vehemently condemns.For Seungsook Moon, the U.S.-Korean SOFA has remained far more unequal than comparable agreements in Japan, Germany, or other NATO countries: ""under the SOFA, Korean citizens are virtually colonial subjects in their own territory."" The U.S. military bases ""have enjoyed extraterritoriality, marking them virtually as U.S. territories where Korean sovereignty ends."" She analyzes the presence within U.S. Army ranks of KATUSAs, or young Korean conscripts who serve as augmentation troops in support functions. This institution, ""which resembles nineteenth-century European colonial military arrangements with native soldiers,"" was created during the Korean War to compensate for dire manpower shortages. Nowadays KATUSAs often come from privileged social backgrounds and, unlike other Korean conscripts, they benefit from more lax discipline and better infrastructure in an English-speaking environment. While KATUSA service remains the most popular form of military service among Korean conscripts, they often resent the menial work and sense of superiority of their American colleagues. As analyzed by the author, the nonfictional and fictional accounts produced by KATUSAs about their experience of serving in the U.S. military reveal criticism of arrogant male GIs and fantasies about sexual encounters with white female GIs. Young Korean men also resent the predatory attitude of white male soldiers towards Korean female college students, who are often seen visiting military bases or going out with GIs.The chapters about Japan also highlight the hidden social costs, the unequal power relations, but also the transformative and sometimes even the emancipating aspects of America's military presence. The United States stations the bulk of its forces on the island of Okinawa, a former colony of Japan, whose inhabitants were regarded as second-class members of the nation. The institution of military prostitution has now disappeared, and the ""pan-pan girls"" of occupied Japan are a distant memory, but sexual or romantic entanglements around U.S. bases have not ceased. Okinawan women who date or marry U.S. military men are often the target of local scorn and ostracism. They occupy a hybrid space or liminal status in the Okinawan and U.S. military communities. Although social, racial, and cultural hierarchies are also present among the members of a Japanese Wives Club described by one contributor, Japanese women who marry American GIs feel most at home not in the United States or in their local communities, but in the extraterritorial spaces that the military housing areas provide. Residing in the hybrid spaces created in and around U.S. military bases, local nationals are able to challenge existing hierarchical social relations of race, gender, sexuality, and class in their own societies. These same challenges of class and gender boundaries are also expressed by the young Okinawans practicing for eisa, a traditional dance performed each summer during Obon, the festival of the dead. Formerly practiced by young warriors of noble ancestry, eisa now provides working-class Okinawans, male and female, the occasion to transcend the history of double colonization and contemporary lives dominated by the overwhelming U.S. military presence. Beautifully written and deeply evocative, the text on the eisa dance enchants the reader with a literary interlude, while building on what Ann Laura Stoler has called ""the affective grid of colonial politics"".Germany provides an interesting counterpoint to the studies of South Korea and Japan. The narrative about the U.S. occupation and military presence is sharply divided along gender and generational lines. To the men who fought in the Wehrmacht or were enrolled in the Hitlerjugend, the widespread sexual and romantic fraternization between German women and U.S. soldiers came as a shock. A particularly misogynist joke during the bitter occupation years lamented that ""German men fought for six years, while German women fought for only five minutes."" Those same men later held deep skepticism about the fighting spirit of their American allies against the Soviet threat. The relaxed attitude of GIs who strolled in German communities, hands in pocket and chewing gum, stood in sharp contrast with the tightness and discipline that Germans educated in the Prussian tradition had come to equate with ""manliness"". But this new masculine casualness had opposite effects on the younger generation, who eagerly adopted the clothing habits and musical tastes of their American role models. During the Vietnam War, as they learned about the civil rights movement, German students reached out to African-American soldiers in order to fuel dissent in army ranks and encourage desertion. The racial crisis in the U.S. military was addressed very differently in West Germany, where it led to the adoption of sweeping measures to eradicate discrimination, and in South Korea, where it was framed as a dispute about access to local women. By exposing U.S. servicemen and their families to different racial and gender roles, the overseas military presence also had effects in changing social relations back home.Over There is a fine volume of advanced scholarship that breaks new ground and explores an issue that has garnered strikingly limited attention from scholars working outside the narrow circle of strategic studies and military history. The decision by the editors to frame the U.S. military presence overseas in imperial and neocolonial terms will not convince all readers. Some of the chapters are avowedly militant in style, and breach the sharp line between academic scholarship and social activism. But the combination of gender studies and a postcolonial perspective sheds light on an important aspect of America's global military shadow. Referring in particular to Ann Stoler's work, the editors argue that ""social relations of gender and sexuality figure into the working of an imperial power not as a peripheral issue but as a constitutive aspect of producing and maintaining the boundary between the colonizer and the colonized."" A debate on the gender and sexual aspects of America's military empire is long overdue.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 6, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2PGEBIB6TU4DJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0822348276#wasThisHelpful","R2PGEBIB6TU4DJ","A3IKQVN8N8AKRY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3IKQVN8N8AKRY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In a press interview, Paul Rabinow made a rather harsh comment about his former mentor Clifford Geertz. ""He was mapping out a theory of culture,"" he said of the author of The Interpretation of Cultures. ""Then in the 70's the guy just imploded. He mysteriously stopped in his tracks."" Paul Rabinow is the anthropologist who kept on running. Trained in the classical mold of participant observation in a distant terrain, he subverted the model by turning his ethnography of a Moroccan town into an introvert Reflection on Fieldwork in Morocco. When other anthropologists were turning to campus politics and post-modern deconstruction, he made a foray into contemporary philosophy and, together with Hubert Dreyfus, he wrote the definitive reader on Michel Foucault. He then went on to chair the anthropology department at UC Berkeley, a hotbed of creativity and scholarly advance.Even within anthropology, it is difficult to pin Rabinow into one category. He made major contributions to post-colonial studies by analyzing - in French Modern: Norms and Forms of the Social Environment - how urban planning and spatial control of populations in Morocco were turned into laboratories of modernity. Since the 1990s, his research concentrates on the social study of science and technology, but he also contributes to methodological debates about the future of anthropology. Contrary to the claim made about Clifford Geertz, he doesn't rest on his accumulated intellectual capital. He even took a class in molecular biology to keep abreast of the developments in the discipline he was observing. No one can predict what his next intellectual challenge will be.French DNA, which was published in 1999, mixes several strands of literature. It is based on ethnographic fieldwork in a French genomics research centre, the CEPH, whose director agreed to have his in-house anthropologist, or rather, as he put it, his ""philosophical observer"". Part of the research is archival work, tracking how this French lab won the race to map the human genome using innovative collaborative methods and flexible organization. Rabinow also documented the ""contaminated blood affair"" that put the French system of blood transfusion to a test and ended in a much-publicized judicial trial. During his research stay at CEPH, the anthropologist was also able to observe firsthand a corporate crisis, when the proposed alliance with an American start-up deeply divided the executive team and caused the French government to intervene in order to protect ""French DNA"".The book goes beyond the social study of science and moves into the terrain of cultural critique. French DNA is as much about France as it is about DNA. The book's gallery of characters include a Nobel prize winner who generously gives his proceeds to establish a first-rate research center; a public utilities employee whose son is suffering from a rare degenerative disease and who organizes a public campaign to finance genomics research; a dynamic and visionary research director who hires an American public relations firm to advertize the success of his research center in decoding the human genome; various researchers who do much infighting and political wrestling; a young bureaucrat hailing from the Ecole Nationale d'Administration who suspects the anthropologist to be on the CIA's payroll; etc.In a society marked by its school elitism and social stratification, Rabinow notes that the majority of CEPH's scientists and technicians have not been recruited from France's elite institutions, which gives the research center an entrepreneurial spirit. Another characteristic noted by the author is that many of his characters are Jewish ""pieds noirs"", originating from French North Africa. Indeed, Rabinow's own Jewish origins is mentioned as a factor that contributed to his admission into the closed circle of genomics research. Although the CEPH is a private foundation, political bickering and administrative fiat play a big role in the unfolding story: ""it is not much of an exaggeration to say that everything passes through the state in France.""Consequently, as the main characters soon find out, ""getting involved with the privatization of research, especially in alliance with the Americans, is treacherous terrain."" The American biotech start-up that is approached by CEPH's director has as its goal the identification and patenting, for its exclusive profit, of the genes for diabetes and other diseases using the collected data from French patients. The CEPH's blood database is based on a close partnership with patient associations, and blood comes from free donation by the public: therefore, the DNA that will be used in research should be considered as ""French"", and protected accordingly.More specifically, as noted by the author, in France ""blood"" is a thing that is juridically ""hors du commerce"", something that can neither be freely sold nor exchanged. The United States and France have quite different systems for collecting and distributing blood, that most symbolic and sacred of substances. In France, the collection of blood falls into the domain of the gift, of benevolent gesture, of solidarity. But blood products are part of a huge international trade in medical supplies, and they are fully commercialized. The distinction can be quite confusing. Is albumin, for instance, a thing to be bought and sold? The answer is `yes' when it is extracted from the placenta and `no' when its source is blood.Albumin changes legal status depending on whether it is taken from a person (through her blood) or from a thing (the leftover placenta). The distinction between persons and things is in line with Roman law, for which those things that could be physically separated from the body fell neatly into two categories, both exempt from civil law: ""nuisances or burials"". The codes of hygiene (and public health) and mortuary practices of religion (or the Republic) took care of these polluted and sacred things. Today, the situation is not so simple: ""separable, exchangeable and reincorporable body parts (or parts of parts) confuse and confound the previous legal framework."" Artifacts like blood or DNA exist in a kind of legal limbo - a situation that evokes the ""purgatory"" mentioned in the book's title. Indeed, Rabinow is startled to recognize in the arguments put forward by scientists at CEPH ""aspects of the imaginary, vocabulary, and - in an altered manner - even the conceptual concerns first articulated seven hundred years ago with the emergence of the zone of purgatory in Western Christianity.""In the US, the author's research was funded by a portion of the genome research budget that was specifically allocated to social, ethical, and legal issues, making it ""the largest ethics project in history."" In France, the National Ethics Committee, formed by a decree of President Franois Mitterrand in 1983, enjoys the same authority that the Catholic Church had at the time it proposed the notion of purgatory to bolster its monopoly on salvation goods. Another characteristics of the French ethics committee is the predominance of psychoanalysts and psychoanalytic discourse in its workings. As noted by Rabinow, since the committee speaks in universals, it tends to elide the status of its own particularity: ""French bioethics discourse and institutions, although cast as universals, are only one mode among others of problematizing the issues addressed.""Paul Rabinow's book not only breaks new grounds at the interface between science and society; it is also quite experimental in style. It mixes theoretical developments and detailed descriptions with field notes and journal entries, giving to the whole the quality of a collage. Rabinow entered the field with little preconceived ideas about the topics he would cover; his approach to fieldwork was open-ended and opportunistic. As he notes, ""an experimental mode of enquiry is one where one confronts a problem whose answer is not known in advance rather than already having answers and then seeking a problem."" As a result, ""French DNA contains no totalities, formal systems, encompassing fields, epochs, worldviews, universal subjects. Nor does it even contain Theory in the traditional sense of the term that would make the empirical material into a case study, an example, a testing ground.""But of course, even if Theory is not what the author is after, he nonetheless displays his long-standing interest for French intellectual productions and familiarity with academic references. He engages in a dialogue with French historians Jacques Le Goff and Michel Vovelle on the history of purgatory. He borrows from Michel de Certeau the notion of a ""practiced site"" (un lieu pratiqu), and expands on the concepts of ""form"" and ""assemblage"" that he introduced in his previous books (""from time to time, and always in time, new forms emerge that catalyze previously existing actors, things, temporalities, or specialities into a new mode of existence, a new assemblage""). He pays tribute to Michel Foucault, while noting that his concepts of biopower and biopolitics were conceived to describe the genealogy of disciplinary power in the eighteenth and nineteenth century, and that they cannot be projected onto the twenty-first century without adaptation. He uses Giorgio Agamben with caution, drawing on his distinction between ""bios"" and ""zoe"" while refusing to see in the Holocaust the apocalyptic truth of biopower. While constantly renewing himself, Rabinow is forever complementing fieldwork with conceptual labor, as he expands the frontiers of the discipline.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 29, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RACDRMQP4G1G2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0226701506#wasThisHelpful","RACDRMQP4G1G2","A3IKQVN8N8AKRY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3IKQVN8N8AKRY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Recently Fleur Pellerin, a junior Cabinet member of the French government led by president Franois Hollande, made her first visit to Korea. To the French, she is known as an elite public servant-turned-politician and put in charge of the digital economy and entrepreneurship portfolio, and also as the only minister with an Asian face. In Korea she is known as ""one of us"" or a ""blood relative"", and during her business trip to Seoul she was welcomed as if she was the homecoming queen. She had a chat with president Park Geun-hye, and featured in many television shows and media articles. Her first name, Fleur (""flower""), led to a crazed ""Fleur-mania"", and her Korean name, Kim Jong-suk, was also made public.Like about 12 000 French citizen and 160 000 persons worldwide, Fleur Pellerin is a Korean adoptee. She left Korea when she was six months old, never met her biological parents again, and knows next to nothing about her birth country. For Koreans, she is the poor immigrant who made it abroad, and on top of that in a country known for its high culture and glamour - the conclusion of Korean TV dramas usually has the heartbroken heroin go to France to ""refashion herself"". But she also reminds Koreans of darker times, and of a phenomenon of transnational adoption that many feel awkward about. Not so long ago, the nation's pride in hosting the 1988 Summer Olympics was bruised by reports in the American press asserting that children constituted Korea's ""largest export"". Reaching out to adopted Koreans abroad, incorporating them in the community of overseas Koreans, and heralding their success was therefore a way for the Korean public to turn a sore spot into a matter of pride and celebration.As Elena Kim reminds her readers in her ethnography of adopted Korean communities, Korean adoptees came to the West in distinct waves. First came the war orphans and mixed-blood children of US soldiers and Korean women. Then, in the 1960s and 1970s, American and West European families adopted the offsprings of single mothers or poor households who were convinced to relinquish their newborn baby in exchange of a hefty sum. Today, nearly all the children adopted overseas are infants born to unwed mothers in their late teens and early twenties. Meanwhile, the Koreans adopted in the past decades have become adults in their country of adoption, and today form a global community composed of subsets of regional and online groups with distinct histories and concerns. Internet and globalization have brought them together, and many are claiming voice and agency as a particular public with shared experience and common bonds.The propinquity of money and children in transnational adoption and the attendant suspicion of human trafficking have made Korea's overseas adoption program a target of criticism throughout its history. It has been argued that orphanages (which were largely funded by Western relief organizations), and, later, state-subsidized adoption agencies, functioned as a surrogate welfare system and a conduit for foreign exchange. It has been further advanced that Korea's international adoption system not only retarded the development of domestic adoption and child welfare policies, but also provided a quick-fix solution that has been complicit in the social disenfranchisement of Korean women. Today South Korea has the lowest birth rate in the world, with fast increasing numbers of abortion and divorce. The ""problem"" of adoption (ibyang munje) has become a matter of public debate in which adult Korean adoptees and Korean birth mothers of an earlier period increasingly have a say.What is unique about Korea's adoption program? First, conventional wisdom in South Korea and in the Western countries to which adoptees are sent blames the persistence of Confucian family values and preoccupations with patrilineal bloodlines for the reluctance among Koreans to adopt ""their children"". This is changing fast, with placement agencies now under the obligation to encourage domestic adoption first and famous media figures making a public gesture of adopting their own children. Second, the Korean state has so far failed to promote extended models of family arrangements, provide adequate financial support for single mothers, or tackle the problem of inadequate sex education. Adult adoptees such as Fleur Pellerin and lesser-known figures could help challenge dominant representations and policy outcomes, especially when they come from Europe, where the social security system is well developed and recomposed families are almost becoming the norm. Third, the long shadow of stigma associated with unwed motherhood in Korea is slowly eroding as Korean society enters a phase of globalized modernity.But the most distinctive feature of Korea's adoption program is that it came first, and therefore became the template for subsequent programs. Korean adoptees represented a ""social experiment"", the outcomes of which were subject to intense scrutiny and debate since the practice began in the mid-1950s. Korean adoptions, determined to be largely successful by social workers and academic experts, expanded dramatically in the 1970s and paved the way for subsequent waves of adoptions of children from the developing world into white Western homes. By the 1970s, largely due to the success of the Korean model, transnational adoption became an institutionalized social welfare practice into many nations and a naturalized ""choice"" for individuals in the United States or in Europe. As Elena Kim notes, the adoption model is built upon the archetypal figure of the orphan who is construed as the ultimate figure of global humanitarianism, permitting Americans in particular to ""save"" children who are themselves often victims of American foreign policy decisions.Not all adoptees were raised in wealthy, happy families with caring surrogate parents. Some experienced hardships and rejection by siblings and relatives; a significant number faced racism and bigotry at school or in their community; and most of them had to cope with the awkward feeling of being ""yellow outside, white inside"". Adoption is based on separation, and the traumatic scene of abandonment sometimes lingers. According to adoption specialists, loss and grief are inescapable aspects of the adoption experience for all members involved in an adoption. Adoptees and their relatives construct ""what if"" scenarios and ""phantom lives"" of what they would have become if they had stayed in Korea. Some adopted Koreans dream of a more authentic self in their birth country, while foster parents or agency workers sometimes construct cautionary tales about girls being forced into prostitution or reduced to a dehumanized treatment. For the most politically oriented adoptees, crafting a germane public discourse for discussing the politics of adoption is a difficult process. Typically, the adoptee can only feel gratitude and indebtedness for having been given ""life"" and ""opportunity"" through inclusion in the bourgeois nuclear family, and more complex feelings of ambivalence, mourning, or resentment are suppressed, condemned as ungrateful, or pathologized.Faced with the taboos and emotionally charged issues that adoption raises, some adoptees simply choose to ignore their roots and go on with their lives. Others, increasingly, go on a quest for origins to discover the country of their birth and, for some of them, to try to meet with their biological parents. Since 2012, adopted Koreans can choose for double citizenship, or they can apply for a visa that allows them to live and work in Korea. But language and, sometimes, prejudices, remain a problem and put a barrier between them and the rest of the population. A social event known as The Gathering allows them to get together and share experience. Meeting other adoptees can feel like rediscovering one's lost tribe: ""None of us had real peer groups growing up,"" notes one adoptee. ""When we found each other, it was an electric thing."" Self-exploration through shared storytelling is central to adoptee social practices and can be seen as a performative negotiation of self and world. The misadjustment or lack of fit with dominant national, ethnic, and cultural models forms the basis for creating a space where, as more than one adoptee has stated, ""there's less explaining to do"".Adopted Territories is a work of cultural anthropology that comes loaded with theoretical concepts and abstract discussions. For Elena Kim, drawing on social theorists such as Judith Butler and Aihwa Ong, adoption blurs and unsettles the categories of race, nation, and family. Not unlike the forms of gay and lesbian kinship identified by queer theory, adoptees' experiences with nonnormative family forms lay the ground for alternative forms of personhood and kinship, contributing to the production of a shared global imaginary that has taken on transnational dimensions. ""Adoptee kinship"" is defined as ""a form of solidarity based upon radical contingency rather than biologically rooted certitudes"". From this perspective, kinship is not a preexisting truth that is discovered or found, but rather a set of relationships actively created out of social practice and cultural representation. It is a model of kinship that is not exclusive but additive, transnational, and expansive. ""Public intimacy"", another oxymoron, designates the potential sites of identification and association that extend beyond the biological family, thereby producing new kinds of identities and intimate relations.The notion of ""counterpublic"", a term coined by Nancy Fraser in her critique of Habermas' model of the public sphere, ""highlights the fact that the adoptee social imaginary exists in diacritical relation to dominant publics - whether in the United States, Europe, South Korea, or an increasingly transnational public sphere."" The adoptee counterpublic is organized around a discursive process of identity construction in which adoptees endeavor to define themselves as a group that is distinct from others yet exists in relation to the wider public. By coining the notion of ""contingent essentialism"", the author points to the fact that ""adoptee identity is at once essentialized as something natural and also construed as something cultural and socially constructed."" Contingent essentialism is distinct from the biologism or genetic essentialism that characterizes much of the public discourse about adoptees and their ""real"" origins, identities, or families. Elena Kim defines ""adopted territories"" as ""networks of adoptees and their activities, situated in a range of virtual and actual locations, that comprise the transnational Korean adoptee counterpublic.""Borrowed from Judith Butler, the notion of ""constitutive outside"" points to the legal fiction of the orphan that leaves behind an excess of relationship, which ""enchains"" the child givers and recipients and ""haunts"" adoptee subjectivities. ""Adoption not only makes children into orphans, but, over time, also produces missing persons,"" writes Elena Kim, who illustrates her writing with artworks from internationally adopted artists. The book cover, a community artwork conceived by artist and activist Leanne Leith, features numbered tags bearing travel certificates delivered by the Republic of Korea, each tag representing one South Korean gone missing through international adoption. Much as the abstract conceptualizations, the live testimonies of adoptees and art pictures displayed in the book illustrate the potent message of longing and belonging that addresses a constitutive dimension of our shared humanity. Korean adoptees or not, ""we all negotiate contingencies of personhood out of insufficient and mutable categories of the biological and the social.""","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 9, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2V1RISGLJK7KM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0822346958#wasThisHelpful","R2V1RISGLJK7KM","A3IKQVN8N8AKRY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3IKQVN8N8AKRY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Nikolas Rose and Joelle Abi-Rached conclude the appendix section of their book by stating ""[their] belief in the possibilities of critical and affirmative dialogue, and [their] wish to avoid the many simplistic stereotypes that can be found in much critical writing on neuroscience from the side of the social sciences."" These stereotypes waived on the new brain sciences by social scientists is that neurobiologists consider the human brain in isolation from its social milieu; that they use simplistic brain imaging techniques or animal models to infer conclusions based on dubious assumptions; and that their claims to improve mental capabilities or cure brain dysfunctions have repeatedly been proven wrong. Some critics even link modern practices to a shameful past of eugenics and lobotomies, and warn against a future when power will be exerted through the management of our brains. All seem to agree that advances in the understanding of the human brain have implications that are nothing short of revolutionary: the brain holds the key to who we are - as individuals, as societies, as species -, and the prefix neuro- is being affixed to a wide spectrum of disciplines and policies ranging from child rearing to behavioral change.To these hyperbolic claims and stark condemnations, the authors prefer to substitute a close analysis of what brain scientists actually do. They note that ""despite all the grand promises and expectations generated by neuro-entrepreneurs, we cannot know for certain whether any lasting new bodies of expertise will emerge, nor can we foretell the role of neurobiology in the government of conduct across the next decades."" Historically there have always been close linkages between the way in which human beings are understood by authorities and the way they are governed. The knowledge/power nexus is therefore not alien to strategies being deployed in the emerging field of biopolitics. The emergence of a neuromolecular vision of the brain is opening new avenues for research, and is already seized upon in socio-political debates. Beyond the laboratory and the clinic, a new kind of expertise is mobilized in order to understand and intervene in human conduct. But, as the authors repeatedly state, ""neurobiological conceptions of personhood are not effacing other conceptions of who we are as human beings, notably those derived from psychology."" It is too early to tell whether the neuromolecular gaze will create a new episteme that will transform our vision of mind and grey matter, brain and the body. After all, the neurosciences are only fifty years old. The authors dates the appearance of their research object to 1962, with the conjunction of three intertwining pathways running through the study of the nervous system, through brain research and through the treatment of insanity.This being said, there is much scope for critical analysis and for cultural investigation of the burgeoning brain sciences. New technologies of visualization (CT scans, MRI technology) have sometimes substituted for epistemological thinking: as one author active in the field put it, ""just because you're imaging the brain doesn't mean you can stop using your head."" Brain imaging has given birth to a whole ""industry of visualization"": ""we find papers relating changes in brain activity to responses to art in general and to the work of specific painters; to response to music and to specific composers or performers; papers discussing the neurocognitive processes of religious leaders; studies of brain activation related to the use of language, metaphor, or responses to various novelists."" As the authors remind us, the study of mind processes and brain anatomy has often been the domain of pseudo-science and quackery, from Charcot's staged demonstrations of hysteria to Franz Joseph Gall's craniology. Similarly, a chapter titled ""What's Wrong With Their Mice?"" demonstrates that there is indeed something wrong with the animal models used by brain scientists - mouse reaction in a setup experiment is a constructed artifact that teaches us nothing about human behavior.The book addresses the reader at a fairly technical level. Most of the research surveyed in the various chapters is very recent, with many papers published in the past ten years. The abbreviation list contains specialized entries such as MAOA (monoamine oxidase A) and SSRI (selective serotonin receptor inhibitor). If you don't know your dopamine from your adrenaline, or your serotonin from your melatonin, you may have a hard time understanding some parts of the text. And even if you do (after all, neurotransmitters have entered the common vocabulary, and are often referred to in popular science writing), you may need some kind of tutorial as how these chemicals operate in the brain, and how they are linked to some brain dysfunctions. Even at that basic level of knowledge, I was surprised to read that ""the monoamine hypothesis of depression, and the dopamine hypothesis of schizophrenia ... have proven mistaken, perhaps fundamentally wrong."" This, at least, requires some explanation; none is offered. These hypotheses are described as the ""two founding myths of psychopharmacology"", implying perhaps that drug companies had a stake in popularizing these theories in order to support the marketing of their treatments.So Neuro is not a science book or a manual, although it addresses scientific questions. Likewise, it is not a philosophy book, but it deals with philosophical issues - do we have brains like we have other organs, or do brains define who we are and what we think? Is consciousness the master in its own house, or are we driven by unconscious neurobiological processes? When we think we are making a choice, hasn't our brain in fact already made that choice? Is there a real world out there, or are our perceptions a fantasy that coincides with reality? Isn't defining true madness the sure sign of madness itself? Are developments in the neurosciences transforming our conceptions of what it means to be a human being? References to philosophy are woven into the text. Readers familiar with Canadian philosopher Ian Hacking will recognize his style of reasoning: close readings of scientific texts; epistemological expressions such as ""truth claims"", ""regimes of truth"", or ""truth-making""; references to hotly contested social issues, with a sharp refusal to take sides; etc.One can also detect the influence of Michel Foucault throughout the book. Concepts and expressions such as the ""government of the mind"", the ""conduct of conducts"", and the ""clinical gaze"" are borrowed from Foucault's approach and they echo the many essays he inspired in the social sciences. In fact, Foucault stands more as a cultural horizon or a suffused presence than as a specific reference. Only his book on The Birth of the Clinic is discussed in some detail as being about the formation of a particular clinical gaze which occurred in Europe in the early nineteenth century and that is now extended to the consideration of the mind itself. But Foucaultian concepts are used without specific quotation or attribution, illustrating the extent to which they now form an epistemological base shared by many researchers in the human and social sciences.Rather than slavishly discussing Foucault's concepts and reproducing excerpts from anthologies, as so many authors do to demonstrate their theoretical deftness, Rose and Abi-Rached go back to the source of Foucault's inspiration: to his teacher and dissertation chair George Canguilhem, whose work is only partly available in English but who is considered as the founding figure of the philosophy of science in France. In writing the history of a particular discipline, Canguilhem warned about ""viewing the past from the perspective of its own regime of truth"". He insisted that one could not abstract a living being from its social and material environment: ""the relations between the living and the milieu as they are studied experimentally, objectively, are among all possible relations, those that make the least sense biologically; they are pathological relations."" And he completed: ""the study of such biological materials, whose elements are a given, is literally the study of an artifact."" Many basic distinctions in the social studies of science - between man and animal, living beings and artifacts, nature and the laboratory, the normal and the pathological...- go back to Canguilhem, and have colonized the social sciences through the indirect mediation of Foucault. In quoting Canguilhem in abundance, in a field of study where the newest reference often renders older sources obsolete, Rose and Abi-Rached connect the most recent advances in the social studies of science to their epistemological base.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 26, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RC8HV58QZUMWL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0691149615#wasThisHelpful","RC8HV58QZUMWL","A3IKQVN8N8AKRY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3IKQVN8N8AKRY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"John Maynard Keynes has famously commented at the end of The General Theory that ""practical men, who believe themselves to be quite exempt from any intellectual influences, are usually the slaves of some defunct economist.""  And he went on to remark: ""I am sure that the power of vested interests is vastly exaggerated compared with the gradual encroachment of ideas."" Angus Burgin's book is the history of the gradual encroachment of a particular idea: the notion of laissez-faire, or the belief in the power of the market to allocate resources efficiently and to achieve optimal outcomes, without any form of state intervention.In another famous essay published in 1924, Keynes had proclaimed The End of Laissez-Faire.  Indeed, this French expression best characterizes the context of 19th century liberalism, and more particularly the works of French authors like Jean-Baptiste Say or Frdric Bastiat. Their brand of liberalism or libralisme  la franaise (""laissez faire, laissez passer les marchandises"") exerted only limited traction over the history of economic ideas, but the expression stayed as a rallying cry for liberals and their modern neoliberal epigones. How this idea of laissez-faire was reappraised by a cadre of economists and public intellectuals, first grudgingly in the midst of the Great Depression, then wholeheartedly in the postwar era, forms the story of The Great Persuasion.Labeling this great persuasion, putting a name on these ideas, has always been an issue. In his 1924 lecture, Keynes noted that ""the phrase laissez-faire is not to be found in the works of Adam Smith, of Ricardo, or of Malthus."" Friedrich Hayek, who stood at the other end of the economics spectrum, pointed out that terms like 'liberalism' or 'democracy', 'capitalism' or 'socialism', hold a different meaning today than in the pre-war or immediate post-war period. The word 'libertarian' was unfamiliar to most founders of the Mont Plerin Society, and they were almost unanimous in their rejection of 'conservatism', which they associated with the preservation of the status quo they sought to overcome. The term 'neoconservatism' didn't appear on the map until the late twentieth century, and designated a political current rather than an economic persuasion. Perhaps the term that best characterizes Hayek, Friedman, and their epigones is 'neoliberal'. First used as a derogatory label, it was adopted as a self-description by some, but not all, proponents of unhindered free markets.The reason the main figures of the neoliberal creed could not agree on a label is that they disagreed on the content of their doctrine. The `neoliberalism' that became paradigmatic in the Anglo-American policy arena in the 1970s and 1980s looked very different from the `neoliberalism' of the late 1930s and 1940s. The founders who gathered for the initial meeting at Mont Plerin in 1947 held diverse views. Most, if not all, repudiated historical laissez-faire and called for an organized and constructive liberalism that validated certain modes of government intervention. In The Road to Serfdom, which he dedicated to ""socialists of all parties"", Friedrich Hayek supported a role for the government in counteracting the business cycle, constructing new infrastructure, regulating a broad range of business activities, and administering extensive social insurance guarantees. Some of his colleagues delivered an assault on large corporations or formulated a critique of abstract and unhindered competition. Moral philosophers believed that capitalism was living off the accumulated moral capital of social doctrines that it had since supplanted, and called for a liberalism that emphasized the ethical rather than merely the economic satisfaction of the citizen.By contrast, the second decade of the Mont Plerin Society was marked by a narrowing of horizons and the accretion of certainties. Individuals whose methodologies, assumptions, and goals diverged most explicitely from the emerging paradigm were cast off or took their distances. In Bertrand de Jouvenel's terms, the organization had succumbed to ""ideological passion,"" and as a result had transitioned from ""a free company of people who think together with some initial basis of agreement"" into ""a team of fighters."" Milton Friedman was the chief fighter and he emerged as the leading advocate of free-market economics on the public scene. As Burgin notes, ""Friedman built his professional and public career on the advocacy of positions that ran contrary to received opinion, and he endured the resulting controversies to find himself regaled with private wealth, academic honors, and lasting political recognition."" The universality of Friedman's belief in the efficacy of free markets exceeded even that of the nineteenth-century theorists of laissez-faire whose legacy Hayek had spent the postwar years working to overcome. He deliberately cultivated the persona of a contrarian gadfly in the venues of public debates, and never shied way from an intellectual opponent or buttressed his positions in the sake of compromise.In addition to Hayek and Friedman, Burgin puts the spotlight on intellectual figures who are generally ignored by histories of neoliberalism but who helped shape the movement in its past and present forms. Louis Rougier, a philosophy professor at the University of Besanon, gathered the first collection of twenty-six individuals in a conference held in Paris in 1938, but was later discredited by his association with the Vichy government. Walter Lippmann, the American publicist, wrote the enormously influential Principles of the Good Society in 1937, before distancing himself from a movement that he found too sectarian or too conservative for his taste. Wilhelm Rpke was a founding member of the German journal Ordo that went on to have a broad influence on German's postwar economic doctrines, known as ordoliberalism. Albert Hunold was a Swiss businessman of little intellectual importance but who exerted leadership of the society until 1962, when he resigned by claiming that the society had ""lost its soul"".It is rare to find a book that addresses an issue relevant to the public at large, while adding something original to the scholarly literature on a particular topic. The reviews in the Wall Street Journal and other media outlet bear witness to the fact that The Great Persuasion addresses not only a public of professional historians and social scientists, but is also of broader policy relevance. It should appeal to anyone interested in contemporary debates about the role that the state and markets should play in the economy - arguably the most important theme in policy discussions. On the other hand, The Great Persuasion is a scholar's book, apparently trimmed down and edited from a PhD thesis, and with all the markers of academic respectability - the footnotes, the archive collections, the strict neutrality in tone and restrained ambition in scope. Burgin is very clear on where his scholarly contribution resides. He situates his book within the existing literature, noting the remarkable advances in historiography over the past decade.His book fills several gaps in the existing research and offers an original contribution to the field of intellectual history. He is the first to present the creation and early history of the Mt. Plerin Society based on archival records of the society and on the correspondence and collected papers of its main protagonists. He provides the first academically sound intellectual biography of Milton Friedman, developed in the last two chapters of the book. His approach is also innovative: it shifts the focus from individuals to networks, and from the US or Western Europe to the Atlantic world. He puts the history of economics back into the history of ideas, claiming that ""the problems of economics cannot easily be severed from the problems of philosophy."" He gives a different picture of the Mt. Plerin Society than the usual clichs identifying it with the hotbed of ultra-liberalism. In fact, Burgin writes, ""an exploration of the rhetoric of the society's members in its early years reveals a movement far less doctrinaire than the conventional narrative would indicate.""In writing archive-based history, it is often difficult to find the right distance between minute detail and the broad sweep, and not to be bogged down in petty distinctions and curiosa. Again, Burgin achieves a fine balancing act between these two polarities. His quotes from private correspondence or oral histories are always illustrative. They add a unique perspective to a narrative that is as nuanced as it is coherent and demonstrative. True, the author made choices, and delved on some episodes in abundant detail while leaving other developments out of the picture. It may be said that the author spent too much time on the ""Hunold affair"", which had its origin in petty interpersonal disputes that are of little relevance to the broader narrative. But this episode was an important moment in the transfer of influence within the society from Europe to the United States, and from the cultured polymaths to the professional economists. As Burgin writes, ""after Hunold and a bloc of sympathizers resigned their memberships, the society adopted a narrower identity, intellectually and institutionally dominated by Anglo-Americans, unapologetically oriented toward technical economics, and inhospitable to those who did not subscribe to the near-universal preferability of free markets to the alternatives.""On the other hand, the influence of Austrian economics is often acknowledged but, apart from Hayek, representatives of this school are not presented in detail. In particular, Ludwig von Mises would have deserved a detailed portrait instead of the passing mentions at several junctures of the text. The author notes that ""Mises's refusal to compromise his `pure' version of liberalism left him engaged in ever fewer dialogues, and made it impossible for him to find an academic position commensurate with his professional prestige after he fled Switzerland for the United States."" In other words, although Burgin is more nuanced, Mises was the black sheep of the movement, a doomsayer whose radical provocations were considered as voodoo economics by the profession - but, as Friedman (who was no less extreme) acknowledged, ""every society needs a few kooks"".In writing the definitive history of the Mont Plerin Society, Angus Burgin achieves a triple balancing act. He finds the right distance between academic research and broader intellectual relevance, between the detailed account and the big picture, and between hagiography and critique. As other reviewers have pointed out, Burgin is an academic, not an ideologue, and his book keeps the strict neutrality of a detached observer. He believes in the power of ideas, but it is difficult to guess whether he espouses or opposes the ideas he is exposing. ""To what extent do we wish to make ours a market-centered world?"", he asks in the closing paragraph, while leaving the question open. His only personal belief expressed in the text is that, ""for better or for worse, we now live in an era in which economists have become our most influential philosophers, and when decisions made or advised by economist technocrats have broad and palpable influence on the practice of our everyday lives."" Maybe the role of the historian is to reclaim the influence of these worldly philosophers, and to lay bare the moral arguments that sustain the economist profession's various persuasions.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 12, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2WRY33S4X4YI0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0674058135#wasThisHelpful","R2WRY33S4X4YI0","A3IKQVN8N8AKRY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3IKQVN8N8AKRY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"French Theory was originally published in France in 2003. I find it ironic that this book is now published in the US in an English language translation, and even more so that it is read by its American readers as an introduction to ""French Theory"". This was never the intention of the author. Franois Cusset does not provide a summary, an abstract or a survey of the thoughts of Foucault, Derrida, Deleuze, & Co. In fact, he derides the US propensity to engage with a philosopher's work through readers' digests, surveys or anthologies, instead of reading his books in their original form. In addition, he is critical of the very notion of ""French Theory"", which he uses in English and writes in italics. He shows that this expression is an American invention, and that the authors subsumed under this term share little in common apart from their surprising fortune on US campuses since the beginning of the 1980s.The original intention of the book was to introduce to the French public the enthusiastic reception, the unexpected developments and the violent controversies taking place in US academia and originating in the ideas of a cohort of French thinkers (all male) - Barthes, Foucault, Derrida, Deleuze, Gattari, Lyotard, Baudrillard, with occasional references to a few women - Hlne  Cixous, Luce Irigaray, and Julia Kristeva. These avant-garde philosophers had their heyday in France in the turbulent 1970s, but had since lost most of their shine. They were never really considered as representatives of ""French thought"" in the first place - they held marginal positions in academia, and did not write in the tradition of Cartesian thinking often identified as the hallmark of the French mindset. Their success in the US came therefore as a complete surprise to the general French public, which was from time to time informed of the controversies these thinkers elicited in the Anglo-Saxon world, from the vitriolic attacks against deconstruction to the Sokal hoax, but who could not really understand what that was all about.The French are usually proud of their good reputation abroad. From gourmet food to artsy movies, they think French products are simply ""ze best"" in the world, and they are not surprised when some foreign critics confirm them in their delusion of grandeur. But, until Franois Cusset's book at least, French Theory did not register on their cognitive map, and only a few cognoscenti identified it as an export product. The reasons were twofold. The first is a kind of cultural isolation denounced by the author as provincialism: translations of American thinkers who made use of French Theory were few, and the French were not really aware of the debates surrounding Cultural Studies, identity politics, and minority rights that were shaking the US since the 1980s. The second reason is intellectual repression: according to Franois Cusset, the ebullient seventies were followed in France by the slumbering eighties, and the radical thinkers under consideration were sidelined by an ideological backlash held under the banner of abstract humanism, social conformism and political centrism.The result after 2000 was a return of the repressed: French theories, which had acquired new potency through their American exile, came back with a vengeance, and they were offered by part of the political left as a cure for French social ills. Franois Cusset shares this general orientation: from gay rights to affirmative action to political correctness, he thinks France could do well to adopt the new script developed on US campuses, and to rekindle the flame of intellectual radicalism that had dwindled in France after the death of its main intellectual figures. But his political agenda only comes up in the conclusion of the book. Meanwhile, his main goal is to help the French reader understand the American context in which these French intellectuals' ideas acquired a new lease of life.As a result, the American reader of the translated edition will not find descriptions of the French intellectual landscape and, apart from a few fragments and keywords, the body of texts and doctrines corralled into the circle of  ""French Theory"" will not be presented. The book is wholly centered on the US, and more specifically on American universities' literary departments and on the urban cultural scene. Some of the descriptions of collegiate culture (the frat houses, the diploma ceremonies) that have no equivalent in France will be familiar to every American reader, and some chapters will read like unnecessary digressions. But there is always a value in discovering one's own country through the lenses offered by a foreigner. After all, Tocqueville is still read today because, by explaining America's democracy to his French contemporaries, he gave Americans a perspective on their own country that many find valid and informative up to this day.Of course, Franois Cusset is no Tocqueville - he associates the renewal of Tocquevillian studies in France after the 1980s to a neo-conservative turn. But he knows the US very well - he served several years as a cultural attach in New York - and he will even be able to teach American critics a thing or two - on surrealism and its role in the birth of abstract expressionism, or on the contemporary New York art scene sampling and recycling theoretical formulations. More to the point, he brings to the US a perspective that has been muted from the public debate - witness, as he notes, the absence of really ambitious books of political analysis on the eve of recent presidential elections. To use a metaphor, the chattering classes in America are conversing among themselves, but they don't notice that the room is filled with only elephants and donkeys, Republicans and Democrats, and that there is no place for any other political animal.This is why, after all, American readers will learn a lot from following these French monkey-kings through their American journey. Beyond the unifying banner, they will discover that there were major differences and often violent oppositions between the producers of French Theory. Derrida made himself famous by attacking Foucault's reading of Descartes in Madness and Civilization. Baudrillard wrote an essay titled ""To Forget Foucault"", to which Foucault replied that his problem was rather to remember Baudrillard. Whereas, to a certain extend, Derrida, Foucault and Deleuze were recognized by their academic peers and integrated into the academic mainstream, Baudrillard was treated in France as an intellectual nobody: as Cusset notes, not a single monography has been published on his work , whereas in the US he has been the topic of several studies, surveys and anthologies.Foucault and Deleuze's interest for counterculture is well known. Conversely, the influence that French Theory exerted on countercultural expressions is less documented. A French professor at Columbia, Sylvre Lotringer, played the go-between by organizing mass events gathering French theorists and avant-garde artists or punk musicians. Baudrillard's Simulacra and Simulation was brandished by New York gallery directors or post-modern architects and even featured in the hip movie The Matrix. College students with a rebellious intellect put theory texts to new uses, quoting them in fanzines or websites and cultivating an alternative lifestyle based on Foucault's or Deleuze's prescriptions. The ""Marx boy"" gave way to the ""schizo kid"" of Deleuze and Guattari's Anti-Oedipus, and canonical texts acquired the status of Bildungstheorie, playing a part in the formation of tormented identities. Moving into the 1990s and 2000s, French Theory mixed with cyberculture and found its way in technological artifacts, from cyborgs and Sci-Fi narratives to electronic music and sampling. Beyond counterculture, French Theory's influence has extended to mainstream cultural productions. The word ""deconstruction"" is used by magazine writers or features in TV spots; the hand gesture putting a sentence between quotation mark has diffused from the lecture hall to restaurant conversations; and French Theory has suffused into campus life, with the new norms of political correctness and identity politics.Even though they evolved on the margin of the academic establishment, French theorists in France were acknowledged as philosophers, and were firmly rooted in their discipline. It is therefore surprising to see them belong to literature departments in American universities, not to mention the new disciplines such as cultural studies, film studies, gender studies, or theological studies, for which until very recently there was no real equivalent in France. No wonder American philosophers look at their literary colleagues and their theoretical pretense with feelings ranging from amusement and condescension to irritation and scorn.  The way French texts were decontextualized by American critics led to new and interesting developments. The work of translation is never neutral. By moving from one intellectual context to another, these ""travelling theories"" lost some of their political potency but also acquired new meaning and power. Deconstruction, post-structuralism, and French Theory are therefore, to a large extent, American inventions. For Franois Cusset, it is time they come home to roost, in order to breathe some fresh air into an intellectual landscape that has become a desert of the real.A last note on translation. I read French Theory in the original French. I cannot assess the quality of the English translation, but I can testify that Franois Cusset writes beautifully and with great clarity, explaining difficult ideas in simple terms without losing accuracy and relevance. I invite readers who have some knowledge of French to engage with this book, and with French Theory in general, in the original language.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 11, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RTXGVMNCLHHMF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=081664733X#wasThisHelpful","RTXGVMNCLHHMF","A3IKQVN8N8AKRY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3IKQVN8N8AKRY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Offspring of Empire traces the origins of Korean capitalism through the history of a large-scale industrial enterprise, the Kyongsong Spinning and Weaving Company or Kyongbang. In the introduction, the author notes that the interest in South Korea development has grown much more rapidly in the last twenty years than the broader field of Korean studies. As a result, the empirical base of English-language works for developing theories or narratives of Korea's industrial emergence remains thin, and many books rely on ideological misconceptions or factual errors. This book's first objective is to strengthen the historical knowledge base in the study of Korean capitalism through a contribution to business history. Its second goal is to set the histographical record straight and to correct some of the myths or false beliefs regarding capitalist development in Korea.One such myth was that capitalism predates Japanese colonization and is discernible in ""sprouts"" burgeoning during the Yi dynasty that would have flowered even without foreign disruption. Prior to the forced opening of the country in 1879 and its annexation by Japan in 1910, Korea indeed witnessed the rise of a new merchant class oriented toward the market, some of them beginning to invest their profits in the production process itself. Some scholars have suggested that many of the key elements in the process of development toward Western industrial capitalism first delineated by Marx and Weber could be found simultaneously in traditional Korea in embryonic form. But in spite of the enthusiasm of Korean scholars for the topic, the actual evidence presented thus far does not suggest a scale of commercialization in Yi Korea comparable, for example, to that seen in Tokugawa Japan, let alone in preindustrial Europe. In any case, the merchants and landlords who benefited from the opening of the country after 1876 mostly invested the proceeds of the rice trade back into land or real estate. The Koch'ang Kims, whose rise to eminence as industrial entrepreneurs during the colonial period is the main focus of this book, belong to a different era, when Korea was fully under the yoke of Japanese imperialism.Another myth is that some industrial groups that developed after 1919 remained free of Japanese interference and developed their activities based on homegrown capital, technology, and labor. The Kyongbang textile group is a key example in this argument. Not only was Kyongbang the first Korean-owned and managed large-scale industrial enterprise in the country's history; its growth and expansion during the colonial period was short of remarkable. The managers of Kyongbang liked to stress the Korean character of the company and, from the beginning, they made use of nationalist themes in their advertising. In a period when the national movement was severely repressed and the Koreans hung to their identity, buying textiles from Kyongbang was a patriotic thing to do. Kyongbang became a prime example of homegrown capitalist development. The majority of its shareholders were Koreans. So were its managers, its employees, and the bulk of its customers. The myth of Korean ""national capital"" also holds that Kyongbang relied entirely on Korean technology for its operation and development.Of course, it wasn't true. In addition to relying on basic Japanese machinery, the company also depended on Japan for nearly all of its accessories and spare parts. Its technicians were sent to Japan for on-the-job training, and a few Japanese managers made coordination easier with Japanese suppliers and clients. Kyongbang depended on Japan not only for capital and technologies, but also for raw materials and markets secured by Japan's military expansion on the Asian continent. The cloth produced in Korea was distributed by a Japanese trading company, C. Itoh, with a vast network of subsidiaries in the empire. Even the preference of Korean consumers for national products could not be taken for granted. Although Kyongbang's cloth was somewhat less expensive, at first many Korean consumers preferred Japanese products that offered better quality and a famous brand name.The corporate history of the Kyongsong Spinning and Weaving Company illustrates the high level of dependency of the Korean colonial periphery from the Japanese imperial center. Stemming from a Kaesong merchant family, the founders, the two Kim brothers, had been born and raised after the opening of the ports in 1876 and at a time when Japanese influence was reaching its preannexation peak. They seem to have been generally sympathetic to the goals of the Enlightenment party, which in many ways looked to Meiji Japan as a model for Korean national development. Historians have shown that much of what the Koreans came to consider ""modern"" between 1876 and 1919 was actually to a large extent Japanese in origin. Western civilization filtered through a Meiji or Taish prism. The two brothers studied at Waseda and Kyoto Imperial university, and came back to Korea in order to participate in the modernization of their country by applying the knowledge and methods learned in Japan.Originally the colonial government established in Seoul in 1910 had adopted a policy of maintaining Korea as a simple agricultural colony and market for Japanese manufactured products, including cotton textiles. In 1919 however, there was a change in colonial policy. On the economic side, the First World War vastly expanded the demand for Japanese manufactured goods and created a wealth of surplus industrial capital that needed to be invested. Tariffs between Korea and Japan were abolished, permitting the free flow into Korea of the Japanese capital goods so essential to the establishment of modern machine factories. On the political front, the Korean March First Movement of 1919 sent a signal to colonial authorities about the need for reforms. While the Government-General after 1919 never hesitated to apply force whenever other means of persuasion failed, the basic method of rule, at least in regard to the bourgeoisie, shifted from coercive to a more subtle strategy of co-optation.As a result, the 1920s and 1930s saw the emergence of an industrial bourgeoisie that used opportunities provided by colonial authorities in order to accumulate wealth and power. The Japanese authorities were anxious to cultivate this Korean business elite whose class interests were in harmony with Japanese imperial goals. In its early years of existence, Kyongbang benefited from government protection and subsidies to help it survive the competition from Japanese imports. The government also channelled cheap loans through the Bank of Chsen and the Chsen Industrial Bank. Even with official help, the company operated at a loss until 1925, and its financial position wasn't stabilized until the 1930s. The blurring of public and private spheres that was manifest in Kaesong's financial structure could also be seen in the actual management of the company. Corporate policy was largely an extension of official industrial policy. Kyongbang was, in all but name, a quasi-governmental company, privately owned, to be sure, but with a financial and management structure intimately linked to the colonial state.Kyongbang depended on Japan not only for capital and technologies, but also for raw materials and markets secured by Japan's military expansion on the Asian continent. Japan maintained a hierarchical division of labor within the empire. In general, Japan was to be the producer of the sophisticated manufactured goods that required advanced technology, Manchurian and later China were to furnish many of the industrial raw materials, and Korea was to specialize in basic, unsophisticated industries requiring unskilled or semiskilled labor. As peripheral areas in the Japanese empire populated mainly by poor people with simple tastes, Manchuria and inland China were ideal markets for colonial Korea's manufactured goods, especially textiles. Dependency on China as a source of raw cotton clearly gave Kyongbang a vested interest in Japanese militarism on the continent and strengthened the company's ties to the imperial system as a whole. Likewise, the marketing of its goods in mainland China led Kyongbang into active collaboration with Japanese imperialism and greatly increased the company's tangible stake in the perpetuation of the empire. Last but not least, the Japanese imperial army soon became a captive customer with immense resources and an insatiable appetite for uniforms and fabrics. The company's net profit from the war were considerable.In addition to the opportunities afforded by the new market, the subjugation of Manchuria offered Koreans a certain psychological satisfaction that made Japanese control of Korea itself more palatable. Simply put, Manchukuo gave Koreans the opportunity to engage in the same kind of economic exploitation of the Chinese that Koreans had been suffering under the Japanese since 1905. Examples of this ""surrogate imperialism"" are to be found in the factories that Kyongbang opened on Manchurian territory, where it followed a deliberate policy of hiring only Korean labor. Both in Manchuria and in Korea, labor conditions made working at Kyongbang a ""living hell"". The vast majority of workers were poor, unmarried peasant girls in their early to late teens. Kyongbang girls were paid at most only about one-half the corresponding rate in Japan. Korean labor was not merely cheap; it was also bereft of any political or legal protection. Strikes in prewar Korea were frequent and often violent, and the Korean capitalist elite came to rely heavily on the support and intervention of the Japanese police to maintain the status quo. In the late 1930s, Korean capitalists even cooperated with the Government-General in its implementation of a ruthless wartime policy of assimilation that aimed at the virtual eradication of Korean culture. In Kyongbang, Japanese became the language of all the company's official records, and Japanese-language classes for the employees were established inside the company itself.Colonialism, for better or for worse, was both the catalyst and the cradle of industrial development in Korea. The model of Korean capitalism was less Japanese than Korean-colonial in character; Japanese colonialism, and the particular form that such colonialism took in Korea, gave rise to patterns of industrial development on the peninsula that were distinctively different from those in Japan itself. Imperialism provided the original impetus for the development of Korean capitalism. The Japanese in Korea were actually both agents of socioeconomic change and oppressors at one and the same time. The colonial Korean bourgeoisie sided with the imperial regime and its collaboration prevented it from achieving a position of ideological leadership in Korean society. By 1945, it had become a class in conflict with its own society on ideological as well as material grounds. It was therefore under the aegis of this authoritarian system - essentially a military dictatorship operating through a civilian bureaucracy - that Korean capitalism experienced its first surge of growth between 1919 and 1945. Democratic politics had no part whatsoever in the functioning of the system. By the end of the colonial period, dictatorship had become not only a comfortable political mode for the accumulation of capital, but a political prerequisite for Korean economic elite's survival in the midst of widespread economic and nationalist discontent.Apart from casting a light on the origins of Korea's postwar development, Carter Eckert's Offspring of Empire invites the reader to ponder more contemporary concerns. One is tempted to draw a parallel between the working conditions in the Kyongbang industrial complex and the busy sweatshops of Factory China. Of course, China's recent economic growth doesn't take place under colonial conditions, and foreign capital does not hold the same sway as imperial power. We cannot substitute foreign multinationals for Japanese imperialists, and China's authoritarian regime for Korea's or Manchukuo's puppet state. But just as the colonial origins of Korean capitalism ""locked in"" an authoritarian model of political governance that lasted until the democratization wave in the 1980s, so is Chinese development constrained by the nature of the regime and the overwhelming share of foreign capital that has transformed China into the ""factory of the world"". To acknowledge that industrial development finds its origins in specific regimes of production and governance is then to suggest that its initial conditions will have long-lasting social and political consequences. We are all, in a way, the offsprings of empires.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 7, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/ROARTG1PCOVSY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0295975334#wasThisHelpful","ROARTG1PCOVSY","A3IKQVN8N8AKRY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3IKQVN8N8AKRY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It is easy to dismiss the concept of soft power. The word ""soft"" has featured in the rhetoric of diplomacy for a long time, but not always with a positive ring. Soft means weak, and no regional or world power wants to appear as being so. Before the First World War, the Austro-Hungarian Empire was considered the soft belly of Europe. Wilson Churchill modified its location when he proposed to attack Nazi Germany through Europe's soft underbelly, Italy. In the US, Theodore Roosevelt's foreign policy towards the hemisphere was to ""speak softly, but carry a big stick"", illustrating how soft words can combine with hard power to reach policy objectives. In the 1950s, accusations of ""being soft on China"" could mean political death or administrative sidelining. In military statecraft, detecting a country's soft spots can help target hard attacks or intrusions. When hard bargains and tough negotiations are made, nobody wants to appear as being soft.To be soft nowadays carries a more positive meaning. Hard power is deemed unacceptable in a business environment. Managers are enjoined to use motivation rather than constraint, to convince rather than to coerce. In the computer industry, software, not hardware, is where big bucks can be made. Governments steering the economy favour a soft landing over a hard crash, and loosen monetary policy to extend soft credit to the private sector. Poor countries can always count on soft loans from the World Bank or international donors. In international law, soft law is ubiquitous, and there aren't any hard laws anymore. Soft is beautiful, soft is cool: Japan's Growth National Cool has been proposed as a measure of the country's influence among manga fans and other pop culture enthusiasts.Enter soft power, the expression first coined by Joseph Nye in 1990. As Craig Hayden describes in his book, part of the success of the concept of soft power among commentators and practitioners comes from that it is a ""malleable signifier of political action"". It is a catch-all term, easy to understand and to adapt into foreign languages, which may adopt the English denomination without translation (even the French, who are usually ticklish about the use of English words, have adopted the expression unchanged). Within diplomacy, it can be used as an advocacy tool to gather support and legitimacy for a range of programs, which otherwise go under the categories of public diplomacy, strategic communication, influence, international broadcasting, cultural diplomacy, nation branding, and outreach. Soft power fits well with the rise of nonstate actors in international relations and with the growing importance of transnational flows of culture and ideas. It is, in a word, a global idea, attuned to our age of globalization and internet connectivity.Yet there is more to soft power than meets the eye. Soft power needs to be ""unpacked"". It contains assumptions about how influence works, and implies a rudimentary model of domestic power dynamics and of communication effects. It has sparked a lively debate among scholars over its meaning and impact, leading to further refinement and transformation. Some commentators have underscored its ideological underpinnings: it remains grounded in the U.S. experience, and more specifically to the post-Cold War context in which it was first articulated.  Others have proposed competing or complementary notions: Joseph Nye himself, who favours simple words designed for a general audience, has of late advocated the need to deploy ""smart"" power through the combination of hard and soft elements. But soft power is not just an American catch-word: it has grown beyond its domestic origins, and its enduring usage shows it can be adapted to many local needs.For Craig Hayden, who writes in the constructivist tradition of international relations academic research , soft power is what people make of it. It has to be understood in practice, both by describing its mechanisms and by attending to its uses in distinct national contexts. Key to the functioning of soft power is the process of conversion, defined by Nye as ""getting from resources to behavioral outcomes"". But the notions of resources and outcomes are themselves fraught with difficulties. Rather than this mechanical framework, Hayden proposes to interpret soft power as a rhetoric--as how people do things with words. More specifically, soft power is best understood as a concept policymakers and commentators use to inform the crafting of strategies and policies in international relations. And its meaning varies along the different national contexts and rhetorical strategies in which it is mobilized.Hayden's survey of the ""indigenization of soft power"" begins with Japan and its recent embrace of pop culture as a vehicle for nation-branding and influence. The concept of soft power suits Japan's status as a country that is constitutionally unable to carry out any international responsibilities involving military power, but willing to actively contribute to international goals such as peace, development, and human security. The concept of soft power has also been used to represent the power of Japanese culture overseas, also known as ""Cool Japan"". New public diplomacy programs focusing on manga and anime use various subcultures as a major asset for Japan's international relations, although what remains distinctly Japanese in popular entertainment products is often dubious. By promoting internationalization and brand building, public diplomacy also reveals concern over the management of effects of global exposure on the domestic population and on the economy as a whole. There are also critical Japanese perspectives on soft power. In a well publicised column, Kazuo Ogoura, president of the Japan Foundation, has warned the public about the use of the concept as a strategic justification for cultural diplomacy. Highlighting the ""soft"" persuasion exerted by the US to authorize the deployment of a multinational force in Iraq without a resolution from the UN, he concludes that ""soft power as an actual political theory is loaded with ideology and riddled with contradiction and hypocrisy.""The concept of soft power has also been the subject of considerable debate among Chinese academics and policymakers.  While the increase in culture-related exports and the growing attractiveness of Chinese language education have exposed China to a global market for cultural products, the preponderant view of communication to foreign publics is still conditioned by an extensive history of domestic control over information flows and propaganda campaigns. China's efforts to cultivate soft power reflect a strategic awareness that cultural assets and public diplomacy initiatives are crucial to the larger effort of managing China's rise. The creation of Confucius Institutes, the support to public media outlets such as Xinhua or CCTV, or global media spectacles like the 2008 Olympic  Games and the 2010 World Expo in Shanghai all contribute to China's ""charm offensive"" that aims at converting cultural strength into policy influence. Yet what soft power means in Nye's terms of resources and behavioural outcomes remains unsettled in internal Chinese treatments of the subject. For example, despite of the tremendous growth of the Chinese economy, there is a marked reluctance to promote its own model of economic development - the so-called ""Beijing Consensus"". For Joseph Nye, China's soft power is limited by its own action as an authoritarian regime, and its strategy to cultivate a positive image may ultimately be self-defeating.Although the concept of soft power originated in the US, it has not been embraced wholesomely in US strategic discourse, and it is rarely presented as an objective in public diplomacy initiatives. American public diplomacy comprises an extensive legacy of international broadcasting programs, cultural and educational exchanges, and a variety of information programs designed to inform, educate, and influence foreign audiences. Craig Hayden focuses on the recent shift toward technological interventions that aim at facilitating the ability of foreign publics to communicate, as opposed to the transmission of specific messages or content. For US public diplomacy strategists, the medium is the message: Google, Facebook, and other technology platforms convey an intrinsic argument about the values of openness, free speech, and democratic accountability. Yet the use of information networks by terrorist groups demonstrates that technology is a double-edged sword. With concepts such as ""transformational diplomacy"", ""twenty-first-century statecraft"" and ""public diplomacy 2.0"", the domain of public diplomacy appears in transition, and remains fraught with unresolved tensions. Written as a scholarly contribution, The Rhetoric of Soft Power allows us to map these contradictions and to put them in their global context.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 23, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RGWFOBSA7E1PV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0739142593#wasThisHelpful","RGWFOBSA7E1PV","A3IKQVN8N8AKRY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3IKQVN8N8AKRY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In a famous essay setting out the field, LSE economist Lionel Robbins explicitly recognized that, to use Marshall Sahlins' expression, ""the genesis of Economics was the economics of Genesis"". ""We have been turned out of Paradise,"" Robbins wrote, ""we have neither eternal life nor unlimited means of satisfaction. Everywhere we turn, if we choose one thing we must relinquish others which, in different circumstances, we would wish not to have relinquished. Scarcity of means to satisfy given ends is an almost ubiquitous condition of human behavior."" He went on to define economics as ""the science which studies human behaviour as a relationship between ends and scarce means which have alternative uses.""If mankind after the Fall provided neoclassical writers with a metaphor to introduce their discipline, the island world of Daniel Defoe's Robinson Crusoe offered another image to explore the outcome of the rational pursuit of self-interest by economic man. The individual as isolated hunter and fisherman, with which economics textbooks usually began, provided an easy target for Karl Marx's Outline of the Critique of Political Economy. ""Production by an isolated individual outside society--a rare exception which may well occur when a civilized person in whom the social forces are already dynamically present is cast by accident into the wilderness--is as much of an absurdity as is the development of language without individuals living together and talking to each other."" According to Marx, the human being is in the most literal sense a political animal, a ""zoon politikon"" to use the Greek expression, and not the Homo aeconomicus that economists bent on Latin and math formulae would have us believe.Economics 101 no longer starts with a formal definition of economics (do physicists define physics?), and Robinsonades are no longer in fashion--although many imaginary figures in game theory are still called Adam. But economics teachers introducing the discipline to college students sometimes give the first chapter of Marshall Sahlins' Stone-Age Economics as a reading assignment. The class discussion usually begins with the opposition between Homo aeconomicus and the primitive tribesmen as described by Sahlins. Then, having reviewed the anthropologist's argument, students are asked to offer competing explanations of the hunter-gatherer's behaviour based on standard economic rationality. The class reading may be the only exposure that economists may have with social anthropology; and the discussion may only confirm them in their belief that anthropologists really obfuscate an argument that can easily be won on economics's own terms.So let's start with Marshall Sahlins' own version of the ""uneconomic man"". The Original Affluent Society, as the first chapter is titled, starts with the most deprived and destitute specimen of humankind: the Bushmen of the Kalahari desert and the Aboriginal natives of Australia. Their societies are characterized by ""affluence without abundance"", or frugality amid plenty. These hunter-gatherers' material needs are easily fulfilled. The natural resources which they use to craft their tools and clothing--stones, bones, wood, skin--""lay in abundance around them"". Their nomadic lifestyle prevents them to accumulate possessions: ""of the hunter it is truly said that his wealth is a burden."" They only accumulate what they can carry along with them. As Sahlins notes, ""this modesty of material requirements is institutionalized: it becomes a positive cultural fact, expressed in a variety of economic arrangements."" They make a virtue out of necessity: ""want not, lack not"". Bushmen don't cling to their possessions: as the first European explorers remarked, ""they do not know how to take care of their belongings."" They give away or discard things easily.Nor is their life spent in an endless quest for subsistence. Social scientists have measured the time these hunters and gatherers spend in their various occupations. A surprising result is that they work considerably less than we do. Collecting food occupies them for no more than four or five hours a day. They spend the rest of their time chatting, resting, and day-dreaming. These results have been reproduced for other primitive societies in the Amazon or the Congo forest. These are the time-and-motion studies of anthropology. Other studies have described their dietary arrangement, which was found to be remarkably diversified and healthy. Food resources are both varied and abundant. When they think they have gathered enough food, these tribesmen simply stop and move to leisurely occupations. Why would they collect more than they can consume? They don't perceive the need to store food and accumulate reserves, because ""nature has, so to speak, done considerable storage of her own."" As Sahlins notes, ""they are not worried by what the morrow may bring, because as far as they are concerned it will bring more of the same."" Nature gives them each day their daily bread, and does not lead them into temptation.Marshall Sahlins therefore subverts the vision commonly shared about primitive societies. They are not subsistence economies, living on a hand-to-mouth basis and in a state of mere survival, but economies of abundance, where work occupies only a modicum of the day. These are the facts which anthropology brings to the table. But the description of the original affluent society can lend itself to several competing explanations. One is offered by Pierre Clastres in the preface to the French edition of Sahlins' book. For Clastres, the primitive community aspires to autonomy. Its members want to stay masters of their destiny; they don't want to depend on other groups for their living. Their refusal to accumulate surplus and produce more than they need is not the result of carelessness or fatalism: it stems from their desire to protect their freedom. It is true that they can enter into complex relations of exchange and gifts with other groups. But commerce between primitive tribes or islanders has nothing to do with international trade. It follows another logic, as Marcel Mauss masterfully demonstrated in his Essay on Gift, and where the imperative to give is balanced by the obligation to receive and to give back in return.The same attachment to autonomy and freedom prevents the emergence within the group of hierarchies and classes. The chief or ""big man"" is not a political leader in the strict sense of the word. He has no power to give orders and lead his people into doing things they do not want to do. His only privilege is to make speeches and to gain prestige through his generosity and selflessness. Everything he owns, he redistributes to the group, who is more than eager to benefit from his prodigality. As the French poet La Fontaine once remarked, ""all flatterers live at the expense of those who listen to them"". Pierre Clastres therefore bends Sahlins' argument into a political theory of society: the primitive society is a society that works against the state, and primitive economics is a wholly political affair. Clastres applies the notion of rationality not to persons but to systems: primitive societies ""choose"" not to accumulate surplus or devote power to the chief. They make the right decisions subjected to their objective of long-term survival. Or, as Jared Diamond put it in a provocative essay, perhaps inventing agriculture wasn't such a good idea: in fact, it may turn out to be ""the worst mistake in the history of the human race.""Even if the group makes the right decisions to preserve its autonomy and freedom, it doesn't follow that the individual follows the model of the economic man. For Clastres, the primitive man is not an entrepreneur or a profit maximizer because he is not interested in profit. He doesn't produce more than what is needed, not because he can't, but because he doesn't want to. In some parts of his text, Sahlins subscribes to this argument; but in other parts he doesn't, as when he notes that a ""complex and subtle economic calculus seems to be at play"" in the decision not to accumulate food: ""the advantages of food storage should be considered against the diminishing returns to collection within the compass of a confined locale.""And indeed, Sahlins' descriptions of the primitive economy can easily be reconciled with neoclassical economics. Introducing transaction costs, information asymmetries, search costs, and the lack of insurance markets will usually do the trick. Economists from the Chicago School have specialized in this line of reasoning. Gary Becker, George Stigler, and their disciples have thus discussed the marital arrangements of primitive societies, including polygamy and brideprice, from an economic standpoint, or have adopted a rational actor model to shed light on communal land rights, gifts exchanges, and structures of authority in a nonmodern setting.  Their work gave rise to what was referred to as the substantivism vs. formalism debate in the 1960s. Anthropologists from the formalist school (and their colleagues in economics) showed that a utilitarian framework could be a means of describing a nonmarket institutional context. For substantivists, the economy is an instituted process, embedded into the social fabric, and the approach of nonmarket economies should be resolutely anti-utilitarian.So where does Marshall Sahlins stand in this debate? The fact is that Stone-Age Economics contains an eclectic mlange of formalism, substantivism, and structuralism. Whereas economic students rarely go beyond the first chapter, other parts of the book develop different arguments that are not always consistent or well organized. The ""Domestic Mode of Production"" draws heavily on Marxist anthropology as developed by Emmanuel Terray and Claude Meillassoux; the ""Chayanov Rule"" (the more household relatives each worker has to support, the more work each worker does) unearths the studies of an obscure Soviet agrarian economist; and a long chapter on ""The Spirit of the Gift"" offers a running commentary of Marcel Mauss' famous essay. In his last chapter, Sahlins confesses a ""crass ignorance"" of economics, by which he means neoclassical economics. His constant references to Marx proves that his perception of the discipline is heavily biased toward the anthropological school of thought that tried to adapt a Marxist framework to its terrains.But the author of Das Kapital is not the only Marx that Marshall Sahlins' text conjures. With its constant quips and traits of humor, Stone-Age Economics stands between Karl and Groucho Marx, or evoques the hilarious comedy film in which a Coca-Cola bottle thrown out from a plane disturbs the life of tribesmen from the Kalahari. In The Gods Must Be Crazy, the hero, a Bushman from the San ethnic group, goes on a journey to the end of the earth to get rid of the glass bottle apparently sent by the gods and that has brought misery to his people, exposing them to envy, anger, and frustration by their discovery of the hitherto unknown phenomenon of property. Similarly, Sahlins concludes his introduction by enjoining us to ""cultivate our gardens, waiting to see if the gods will shower rain or, like those of certain New Guinea tribes, just urinate upon us.""","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 17, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3V000AE3DDV3B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0202010996#wasThisHelpful","R3V000AE3DDV3B","A3IKQVN8N8AKRY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3IKQVN8N8AKRY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The flap cover summary states that this book will provide ""an indispensable guide to those who want to understand how to operate successfully in the shadow of the Oval Office."" Similarly, Richard Holbrooke endorses the book as ""essential reading for the new administration."" Daadler and Destler's Profiles of the National Security Advisers and the Presidents They Served is thus presented as a how-to book, a manual for statecraft that will provide a job description for those who intend to fill the White House's posting. They list the qualities presidents should look for when choosing their close diplomatic adviser. They make a ranking of past national security advisers according to influence, administrative efficiency, and overall performance. The primary target of the book therefore seems to be foreign policy operatives and Washington insiders. Based on historical records and personal recollections by the main protagonists who tried to distill the lessons from their experience, it provides a unique perspective on American diplomacy by people who played a central role in shaping policy decisions and determining outcomes.Oddly as it sounds, I would also recommend this book to people involved in business policy and human resource management. There is a strong case to be made that history books offer better lessons and insights to business executives than management textbooks. For a start, they are better written, and they offer a more gripping narrative. The retention rate of hearing about a good story will always be better than going through a shopping list of dos and don'ts. People generally feel more passionate about politics and international events than about the business pages of their newspaper. History involves larger-than-life characters and puts into view the most salient aspects of human nature. Management often shuns the emotional aspects of human behavior and focuses on the rational side. But companies, like countries and polities, are driven by deeply felt emotions such as love, ambition, and greed. Politics puts the human nature back into view, and reconciles us with our inner selves.On a more practical side, historians get access to archival records, key testimonies, and contrasting viewpoints. Management scholars, for their part, are often denied access to the inner working of corporations, and have to rely on dry financial statements or meaningless questionnaires. The corporation is a black box, and drastically filters the flow of information that trickles out of it. News and communiqus are carefully drafted for public relations purposes. Corporate lore and business cases are of little relevance for those unconnected to a particular workplace. By contrast, the U.S. government is a city built upon a hill, and the White House is a house of glass whose processes and records are made fully transparent. Political scientists and historians will always have an edge over management scholars in terms of access to information, contextualization of public events, and relevance of their research output for the public at large. Bureaucracies often draw lessons from the corporate world and try to adapt models developed by management specialists. Conversely, private sector managers can also learn from the experience of policymakers, and governmental decision-making on foreign affairs issues provides what can be characterized as the epitome of decision.Like business strategy, effective foreign policymaking is defined by people, process, and purpose. Attention to people means more than filling a job description. There has to be a good fit between the president and his national security adviser. The most famous pairs in the White House--Kennedy and Bundy, Nixon and Kissinger, Carter and Brzezinski, Bush Sr. and Scowcroft, Clinton and Sandy Berger, Bush Jr. and Condi Rice--illustrate this necessary convergence of character and compatibility of style. The NSC adviser serves at the pleasure of the president. He is the first to brief him in the morning, the closest at hand when crisis situations arise. They are bound to operate in a compatible way.What works with one president does not necessarily suit another. The same McGeorge Bundy who meshed so well with president Kennedy was clearly out of sync with his successor, and he left to be replaced by Walt Rostow, who had a better relationship with Johnson. Richard Nixon and Henry Kissinger also shared many proclivities. Both were foreign policy aficionados, eager to put their stamp on the world. They had a similar realist view of how the world operated, one in which power and its balance between states was of primary importance. Both harbored secret anxieties and deep insecurities that made their combination ultimately destructive. Sometimes, as in the Carter-Brzezinski combination, a relationship flourishes because of differences. Brzezinski strived on conflict; Carter was at heart a conciliator. Similarly, Bush and Rice had little in common, but they proved remarkably compatible.Beyond personal fit between the president and his adviser, White House officials need to build a good team spirit, both within the NSC staff and with the other cabinet secretaries. This was not always the case. Kissinger famously left the state secretary out of the loop in his secret dealings with China. Brzezinski's views on critical issues, notably on how to deal with the Soviet Union, often clashed with those of Cyrus Vance, Carter's secretary of state. Being generally the most hard-line of senior administration players, Brzezinski actively and visibly sought to ""toughen"" policies. Other tensions within the national security team were manifested in Caspar Weinberger's debilitating feud with George Shultz under Reagan, or Colin Powell's powerlessness against the combination of Rumsfeld and Cheney's war planning. As Nixon once complained, ""it would be goddam easy to run this office if you didn't have to deal with people."" Team spirit and employee morale were not a priority for all national security advisers: witness the joke which pretended that ""working for Kissinger was like being a mushroom: because you are kept in the dark all the time, because you get a lot of s*** dumped on you, and, in the end, you get canned.""Putting in place an effective policy process is a crucial responsibility of any NSC adviser. Kennedy and McGeorge Bundy originated the three defining features of the function: the adviser's handling of the president's day-to-day foreign affairs business; the staff recruited among the best experts to serve the current administration; and the setting of a Situation Room with access to diplomatic cables and security information in real time. Kissinger added to it the secrecy in all political undertakings and the relentless cultivation of the press. After Kissinger, all agreed that the national security adviser's role was not a ""policy-making job"": it was to ""facilitate the process of decision-making"".According to Brent Scowcroft, who wrote the definitive manual on the subject following the Iran-Contras investigation, the adviser should focus on coordination while the secretary of state (and other cabinet members) focus on implementation and operations. There is an inherent tension between the role of policy coordinator and that of senior adviser to the president: ""It is always more exciting to be the adviser, but if you are not the honest broker, you don't have the confidence of the other members of the NSC."" To ensure fairness, the adviser's activities as policy spokesman needed to be curtailed: he had to cultivate, in Anthony Lake's words, a ""passion for anonymity"".Often described as best performer in the job which he held twice, Brent Scowcroft had a winning formula for effectiveness that was picked up by his successors and that consisted of three elements: first, gain the confidence of colleagues; second, run a transparent and collegial process; and third, secure power through proximity with the president. Remarkably, Scowcroft's influence did not so much diminish as augment that of James Baker, and he was able to avoid the usual conflicts of policy and power. Scowcroft might see the president more than anyone else, but everyone could count on having their views reflected during the decision process. In the words of one of his aides, ""the work-to-bulls*** ratio was better in this administration than any other, and less of your calories went into the bureaucratic game.""Of course, national security advisers can only be as effective and successful as presidents enable them to be. For the Scowcroft model to work, you needed an active president, who was deeply familiar with and interested in the world. This brings us to the third element of effective management: purpose and leadership. As the book makes it clear, this leadership was not always effectively displayed. There were a series of policy blunders which originated in the NSC and were not effectively corrected by the adviser. The Bay of Pigs fiasco was ""one of history's few pure failures,"" a result of poor planning and preparation. On the positive side, it led to a far better, more structured decision process when Kennedy faced a graver challenge in the Cuban missile crisis eighteen month later. Even more egregious was the secret diversion of funds to the Nicaraguan Contras by John Poindexter under Reagan. Similarly, Condoleeza Rice was too close to George W. Bush to act as effective counterweight by asking questions, probing assumptions, and challenging conclusions.Filling the NSC adviser slot does not leave room for error. Daadler and Destler's book offer a careful manual on how to constitute a national security team and make it effective, with obvious implications for policy-making and the pursuit of the national interest. The job of national security adviser is simply too important to be left to chance. The nation cannot afford inexperience or incompetence in this particular position. The consequence can quite literally be catastrophic--like the Iran-Contra scandal that nearly destroyed the Reagan presidency. As mentioned earlier, there are also more general lessons to be learned for people involved in building teams and managing projects. There also, executive search and staffing decisions should not be left to chance. Job descriptions should not be considered in isolation from, but as a combination of, talents and personal traits as well as ""people skills"". The management team is more than an addition of individuals, and each brings a distinctive contribution to the group dynamic. People need to be made compatible, mesh nicely within organizational structures, and operate in sync.Great combinations that worked in the past can provide models for future endeavors. The lessons of these models should be reflected upon and distilled within the organization. Teams also need to learn from their errors, and to correct behavior on a short feedback loop. People issues should not be considered in isolation, but should be linked to process and to purpose. A great personal relationship or ebullient team spirit cannot compensate for poor process management or a lack of strategic direction. When looking for role models and practical lessons, managers should look beyond the narrow scope of the business world and broaden their compass to include national leaders and policymakers. Conversely, statesmen and senior officials should not overlook management issues, and should engage in staffing decisions in a principled way. In the Shadow of the Oval Office will help them to do so.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 2, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RXTJWV62M8JN2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1416553193#wasThisHelpful","RXTJWV62M8JN2","A3IKQVN8N8AKRY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3IKQVN8N8AKRY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book is an act of piracy. In The Pirate Organization, two young French scholars are assaulting the fortress of Harvard Business School and its publishing house, HBR Press, and they are claiming victory over it. These two filibusters are planting the black flag of `French theory' and `critical studies' over the dominion of business books and management studies.  Drawing from radical authors, like French philosophers Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari, or German critic Peter Sloterdijk, they are implanting the critique of capitalism right at the heart of the capitalist temple. They launch their attack from a top European business school, HEC, which they use as a black ship to subvert and hijack management education. MBA students and business executives, whose ambition is to conquer blue oceans and to become masters and commanders of their own ship, will learn the deeds and battles of famous sea scoundrels, such as Barberousse or Francis Drake, as well as the exploits of their modern successors, pirate radio operators and computer hackers. They will be exposed to a radical critique of capitalism, without being served the usual anticapitalist dogma.  They will be turned into modern pirates, ready to join new types of organizations--pirate organizations.Discussing the nature of capitalism is generally considered off-limits by management scholars. They work from within the system, and are not inclined to bite the hand that feeds them. They leave radical critique and contestation to their colleagues in the humanities, who are free to rehash their pet authors, from Marx to Freud to the latest French philosopher that happens to be  la mode. Even when they belong to the same universities, business schools and humanities departments live in two different worlds, and their teaching staff rarely meet outside the precinct of the cafeteria. But business academics--and business executives--need to study what happens at the fringes of capitalism. True, most of the critics out there belong to the lunatic fringe, and trying to make sense of their intellectual production is a sure recipe for headaches and mental haze. Reading French theory is a bit like listening to experimental rock. There is a lot of noise and confusion, but it makes you think and see things differently. Durand and Vergne's book illustrate this point perfectly. It mixes post-modern theorizing with avant-garde music, in the form of a math-rock composition available on a companion website that users are free to modify and remix to their whim.How could a two-volume essay titled Capitalism and Schizophrenia be a source of inspiration for management scholars? Durand and Vergne draw several ideas from Deleuze and Gattari's iconoclastic brand of philosophy. The first is that capitalism cannot be conceived of independently from the notion of state sovereignty, as it appears in 17th century Europe. To put it in simple terms, capitalism doesn't oppose the state: it is the state. As the authors write, ""without the state, capitalism would not exist. Consequently, the suggestion that we need ""more state"" or ""more government"" to compensate for the drawbacks of capitalism appears misleading at best. Similarly, anarcho-capitalism, or the suggestion that capitalist societies would be better off without the state, is a contradiction in terms."" This collusion with the state makes capitalism a bit schizophrenic. When the Pentagon tracks hackers, it is to offer them a job. The kings of France and England opposed to the Spanish Armada used to do the same with sea pirates, granting them letters of marque and turning them into ""corsairs"" (or privateers). Capitalism thrives on contradiction. It will not disappear due to a crisis, financial or otherwise. But nor can we be assured that it will exist forever. Like the state, it may whither from our horizon, and be replaced by other organizational forms.The second idea the authors derive from Deleuze and Guattari is the notion that monopoly power is an indispensable attribute of the capitalist state. As they note, ""looking back at capitalism's history, we observe a recurrent pattern: sovereign states rely on monopolistic organizations -- from the East India companies on the high seas, to AT&T in the early age of cyberspace -- to conquer new territories and regulate them."" The notion that capitalism thrives on competition obfuscates the fact that the rules of competition are set by an entity in possession of a monopoly of rule-making. The discovery of new territory is swiftly followed by a process of codification whereby the state redefines the norms of competition and legitimate ownership. Entire territories are remapped according to the sovereign's will; capitalistic flows are recoded to suit the needs of those holding the reins of power. The state is engaged in a twin process of deterritorialization, making people, goods, and capital flow and circulate easily, without attachment to any particular place, and of reterritorialization, which maps and imposes norms upon the new territories of capitalism. Each process of territorialization and normalization produces its lot of outcasts, abnormals and renegades.For Deleuze and Guattari, the schizophrenic stands at the outskirt of capitalism. He is the ultimate renegade, an agent of deterritorialization that makes every desire ebb and flow freely within a body without organs. Moving from schizoanalysis to management, Durand and Lavergne propose the pirate organization as the ""necessary renegade"", the ""accursed share"" of capitalism. Pirates operate on the most deterritorialized fringes of capitalism--the uncharted areas wherein sovereign states have yet to reach a consensus regarding what constitutes legitimate ownership and control of territory. The high seas in the 17th century, the airwaves in the early 20th century, cyberspace in the internet age, DNA sequencing and space exploration in a not-too-distant future are all gray areas where pirate organizations proliferate. These are the uncharted territories where pirate organizations and sovereign states struggle over norm definition. Like genetic mutations, pirate organizations introduce alternative codes and principles into the fabric of capitalism.The publication of The Pirate Organization by a famous publishing house specializing in business books is a testimony to the evolution of management studies in Europe and in the U.S. French management scholars were long divided over how to deal with the dominant norms of the discipline as set in the U.S. business school system. Should they publish in English or in French? Should they try to get access to the most prestigious journals and academic conferences, or create their own reviews and parallel circuits? Should they remain true to their European heritage, which had always given more weight to critical perspectives and alternative viewpoints, or should they jettison social critique and espouse Anglo-Saxon pragmatism? Should they treat management as a social science, with established norms of rigor and scientificity, or more like a social practice, akin to the clinical approach of the physician or the Socratic inquiry of the philosopher? Should they churn out well-rounded managers with the professional skills of a social engineer, or formatted MBAs who are able to apply the same standardized methods to all business situations?French business schools like Insead or HEC gave a simple answer to these questions. Their goal was to look and act like Harvard Business School or other top U.S. schools, and to keep only minor differences like the one-year MBA (as opposed to two years in the U.S.) or the Grande Ecole system (recruiting students right after their B.A.). In order to improve their position in international rankings, they had to hire PhD's and increase their research output. Faculty members were encouraged to publish in the best journals, and to seek out positions of responsibility in academic societies based in the U.S. The French management scholar became indistinguishable from his foreign equivalent, except perhaps for the slight accent and taste for good food. And French business schools climbed into the rankings, developing partnerships and alliances with their American counterparts on an equal footing.Having succeeded in reaching the top, French business schools and management scholars are now able to shape and influence the norms in the field. They do so in several directions. One is to reconnect management studies with other social sciences, and in particular with the disciplines that take a critical perspective on capitalism. Another is to pay attention to emerging organizational forms and alternative models that do not conform to the usual business template. Rodolphe Durand and Jean-Philippe Vergne's research illustrates this point. Their previous publications have focused on French haute cuisine and starred restaurants, or on the construction of legitimacy among global arms producers. The French business school in which they teach, HEC, now offers a curriculum track on alternative management techniques, exposing students to multidisciplinary approaches and practical experience in the non-profit sector. Studying The Pirate Organization will equip the reader with a different perspective on firms and collectives operating at the margin of the system, whose skirmishes and radical challenges may define the future frontiers of capitalism.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 27, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RXV5MFRFZQ3CH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1422183181#wasThisHelpful","RXV5MFRFZQ3CH","A3IKQVN8N8AKRY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3IKQVN8N8AKRY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Oddly enough, James Mann's short bio on the opening page of The Rebellion of Ronald Reagan mentions that ""his tennis remains mediocre."" Perhaps; but what the author lacks in tennis skills, he compensates in intellectual brilliance. To use the court tennis metaphor, Mann knows how to pick a partner; how to deliver a series of aces; and how to play the game by alternating short volleys and hard baseline shots. His book is as entertaining as a Roland Garros final. The endgame he describes--how Ronald Reagan singlehandedly inflected the course of history by reorienting US's relationship with the Soviet Union--concludes with the referee proclaiming the end of the Cold War: game, set, match. And the winner of the tournament is not the one you would expect, although the two opponents are commended for their fair play and elegant gamesmanship.James Mann devoted his other books to the US-China relationship and to foreign policy-making at the White House (from The Vulcans to The Obamians). These were interventions into contemporary public debates and pressing political issues, for which the dust of history hasn't yet settled. By contrast, The Rebellion of Ronald Reagan is a history book, written after the main character passed away, and based on archival work and oral history recollection. But it is written with the style and alacrity of a media reportage, and it includes many of the skills and techniques that the author used in his previous books. James Mann conducted interviews with more than one hundred key players and witnesses, including former heads of states and White House staff. He did extended fact-checking, requesting some pieces of archival evidence obtained under the Freedom of Information Act. And he structured his narrative around symbolic junctures: Nixon's stealth visit to the White House in April 1987; Reagan's consultations with an informal adviser on Russian affairs; the Berlin speech pronounced in front of the Brandenburg Gate; and the summitry that cemented the relationship between Reagan and Gorbachev.As the author notes, he is ""always astonished to discover how interviews produce more information, more detail, and more insight than is on the historical record."" It doesn't mean he buys at face value everything his interlocutors recollect from their memory. Testimonies should be taken with a pinch of salt. For instance, former secretary of state George Shultz declared in an interview to the author that he didn't recall opposing to the inclusion of the famous line: ""Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall!"" in the speech that Regan pronounced on June 12, 1987, standing in front of the Brandenburg Gate and the Berlin Wall. In his memoirs, he did not mention the speech at all. The speech nonetheless became an enduring symbol of the Reagan presidency. It captured everything Reagan stood for: his optimism; his belief in the transformational power of freedom; and his unwillingness to accept the permanence of the East-West divide.The speechwriter of the Berlin speech, who meticulously collected background material and included direct observations and quotes in his draft, similarly testified that State Department officials had warned him to stay away from the subject of the Berlin Wall. In fact, the Berlin embassy's competing draft did include reference to the wall and called it to be destroyed, although not as a direct appeal to the Soviet leader. Reagan famous exhortation to ""tear down this wall"" was, until the very last moment, the object of an epic struggle within the administration, pitting Reagan's domestic advisers and speechwriters against his foreign policy teams. In the end, history remembered only this single sentence, and completely forgot the ""Berlin Initiative"" that, in the eyes of the State Department, was the most substantive part of the address.Allying the skills of the historian with the curiosity of the journalist, James Mann had the simple but powerful idea of checking into Reagan's schedule of meetings in the Oval Office. This is how he measured the influence of an unlikely adviser on Russian affairs, who spoke to the president on more than twenty occasions. Suzanne Massie, a Russian-speaking, fifty-year old woman who wrote sentimental essays about the Russian soul, wasn't part of the foreign policy establishment. But she had the ear of the president, who liked her informal style and who used her for back-channel diplomacy missions. What Massie knew, and CIA experts on the Soviet Union didn't, was how to tell a story. She imparted on him her fascination for a timeless Russia, whose culture and religious traditions were still alive below the Soviet veneer.As James Mann portrayed him, Reagan was a rebel with a cause. What he rebelled against was the forces and ideas that had made the Cold War seem endless and untractable. He believed in the better angels of our nature, and was willing to bet on the reformist orientation of Gorbachev by offering the breathing space he needed to fend off his opponents. The Cold War, in Reagan's terms, was not primarily a foreign-policy struggle, but a moral one. By contrast, Nixon and Kissinger shared a basic ""realpolitik"" approach to diplomacy, centered on the national interest and the balance of powers. Die-hard conservatives, for their part, believed in the intrinsic evil of the Soviet system, and warned that Gorbachev represented merely a new face for the same old totalitarian policies. At critical junctures during his second term, Mann shows both the political right and the foreign-policy realists were against Reagan.The personal element also stands out in this biography. One point is of particular interest to this reviewer: foreign languages. The Great Communicator was a master of the spoken word, but he wasn't known for his fluency in languages other than English. He seemed to hold a particular grudge against French words. Under his leadership, the White House replaced ""communiqus"" with ""agreed statements,"" and ""tte--tte meetings"" with ""one-on-ones"". The word ""dtente"", or the policy to seek accommodation with the Soviet, elicited a strong reaction, both because Reagan opposed the notion but also perhaps because he found the French word obscure and conceited. ""Dtente--isn't that what a farmer has with his turkey--before Thanksgiving?"" he concluded a radio fireside chat. His speechwriters somehow shared this anti-gallic bias: under their pen, the phrase ""fait accompli"" was once turned into a kind of Greek cheese: ""feta compli"".German had more favour with the US president. He once greeted the Berlin mayor with the words: ""Haben Sie einen Streichholz"" (the German for: ""Do you have a match?""), a phrase he had learned from a German actress during his days in Hollywood. He burst into laughter when he discovered that the German words for entrance and exit were ""Einfahrt"" and ""Ausfahrt""--this became the source for a series of ""fahrt"" jokes. His Berlin speech, pronounced in June 12, 1987, was carefully drafted. Reagan avoided repeating Kennedy's famous ""Ich bin ein Berliner,"" introducing instead an English paraphrase: ""Every man is a Berliner."" But his speech included several expressions in German: from the word ""Wirtschaftswunder,"" or economic miracle, to the expression ""Es gibt nur ein Berlin,"" and to a reference to a Marlene Dietrich's song: ""Ich hab' noch einen Koffer in Berlin.""But perhaps Reagan's most-often used foreign expression was the Russian: ""Doveryai no proveryai"", meaning: ""trust, but verify"". He learned it from his informal advisor on Russian affairs, Suzanne Massie, and kept repeating it at every occasion, to Gorbachev's considerable annoyance. Gorbachev got used to Reagan's proclivities and, knowing his evangelical penchants, even served him a quotation from the Bible during their first meeting, which made his interlocutor attempt to appeal for his religious soul--in fact, the Soviet leader was not religious, and was startled when the U.S. president attempted to convince him of the existence of God.Reagan did not memorize any other Russian phrase, except maybe for the words ""glasnost"" and ""perestroika"". But he had a collection of Soviet jokes, which he brought about during informal conversations or even at summit meetings, causing consternation among his aides. Here is a good one: it is the story of the Moscow resident who purchased a car and was told by the salesman that it would be ready on a specific date a quarter century later. ""Morning or afternoon?"" the customer asked. ""Why does it matter for a date so far away?"" the salesman wondered. ""Because the plumber is coming in the morning."" In repeating these old jokes, without glossing over Reagan's political aloofness and immature pranks, James Mann gives a human face to the fortieth president.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 12, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3UU7BJQ56B3SE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0045EPD2C#wasThisHelpful","R3UU7BJQ56B3SE","A3IKQVN8N8AKRY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3IKQVN8N8AKRY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Carl Friedrich Gauss and Vilfredo Pareto both gave their name to a statistical distribution. The Gaussian distribution, or bell curve (also known as the normal distribution,) reaches its peak at zero and quickly falls off towards plus or minus infinity. The Pareto distribution, sometimes referred to as a fat tail, heavy tail, or long tail, is an inverted J-shaped curve that approaches the vertical axis and more or less parallels the horizontal axis, converging only slowly towards zero. The normal distribution is widely used in statistics and in the social sciences, where it provides a simple and workable model for a wide variety of phenomena. For example, Adolphe Quetelet observed in the nineteenth century that the size of young men measured for conscription followed a normal curve; he then collected data on many other traits that were normally distributed, and applied his theory of the ""normal man"" to psychological and moral matters as well. More recently, Charles Murray wrote a controversial book titled The Bell Curve that showed IQ scores in a population following a bell-shaped normal distribution.The Pareto distribution, which is mathematically less tractable, also coincides with many social and economic phenomena. Originally used by Pareto to describe the allocation of wealth among individuals in a given country, it also applies to the size of cities, the occurrence of words in a text, the value of oil reserves in oil fields, or several stylized facts in finance. Indeed, ""fat tails"" have become a widely used concept on financial markets, where several popular authors (from Benot Mandelbrot to Nassim Taleb) have pointed to their many applications. Analysts who use standard statistical techniques based on the normal distribution typically downplay the risk of catastrophic events or ""black swans"", which ""fatten"" the tail of the distribution curve. In The Fat Tail: The Power of Political Knowledge for Strategic Investing, political scientists Ian Bremmer and Preaton Keat go beyond the field of finance to promote the integration of social and political factors in risk analysis and strategic planning.So The Fat Tail was already taken as the title of a bestseller book, and technology analyst Chris Anderson had to find another catchword to describe a similarly shaped curve. The rare events which fatten and lengthen the tail of his distribution are not catastrophes or unpredictable occurrences, but sell figures of rare-to-find items or niche markets that were not formerly tended by traditional distributors. Online distribution has brought these non-hit products into the ambit of commerce. The digitalization of music and, now, of books, has further increased the sale of relatively obscure or outmoded material, pushing marginal production and distribution costs virtually to zero. In the end, everything that can be transformed from an atom to a bit, will be. The result, Anderson argues, will be a profound change in our popular culture. The niche, the obscure, and the sub-genre will gain ground at the expense of the hit, and the top dogs of mass culture will have to give way to the underdog, who will be able to find and even produce her own content.The book grew out of an article in Wired, which attracted considerable interest and convinced the author to couch his idea in more detail. It is not merely an extended magazine article, and there are few lengths or repetitions. The presentation follows a logical path. It opens with the opposition between blockbusters and niche markets, then details the concept of the Long Tail and its emergence along with e-commerce and digital content. It provides a simple theory of Long Tail markets (""make it, get it out there, and help me find it""), introduces a few original concepts (""filters"", ""Pro-Am"" as in professionals and amateurs, the ""Short Head"") and borrows other notions from standard economics (inventory costs, network effects, price differentiation). It closes by describing the new era of unprecedented choice unleashed by the Internet, and offers a few lessons for managers and entrepreneurs.The book doesn't fit squarely into the popular economics category or the management book corner. Although Anderson emphasizes his data analysis and links with academic research teams, he skips the technical parts and doesn't address methodological issues. He makes little reference to standard economics, maybe because, as he underscores, economics has so far been concerned with relative scarcity, whereas The Long Tail heralds the entry into an age of abundance and unlimited supply. Anderson confesses he didn't have access to Amazon sales data: in fact, Amazon's statistics are one of the industry's best kept secret, although researchers were able to reconstruct some series through reverse-engineering. Conversely, most of the hard data offered by the book relies on the music downloads of a single company--Rhapsody--that became completely overshadowed by iTunes. The Long Tail doesn't offer new management tools or business lessons from corporate tycoons; rather, it presents some evolutions brought about by new technology and innovative business models by grouping them under a single catchphrase.The author doesn't claim credit for creating the concept: Jeff Bezos did, when he established the Amazon portal in 1994, and Google CEO Eric Schmidt similarly made the notion a central tenet of his business strategy. The idea hit a cord with web entrepreneurs because it provided a simple way to explain a corporate strategy to business investors who were willing to buy into the narrative of unlimited growth potential. Chris Anderson provides an interesting story of the foundation of Amazon.com, explaining how Jeff Bezos went from identifying a business opportunity to building a corporate empire out of it. Asked by his hedge fund manager to find Internet business opportunities, the young Bezos made a list of all the things that were sold remotely. Apparel was number one, but ""you didn't want to do apparel, even though it was the best category, because apparel you could do very effectively through catalogues and through stores."" Books were at the bottom of the list, but they had many things to speak for them: the potential demand for published books vastly exceeded the storage capacity of brick-and-mortar retail or the size of mailing listings; each book was identified by an ISBN code, which saved data in a time of sparse capacity; and their distribution was handled by just two wholesalers, which had warehouses strategically placed around the country to serve any needs.Interestingly, The Long Tail doesn't belong to the long tail of published books: as a bestseller, it achieved massive sales figures, and featured in the peak part of the distribution. Books that aim for the stars and target the mass market tend to have different characteristics than long tail sellers. They use simple language and colloquialisms. They are focussed on a single idea, which provides a lense to interpret a wide variety of phenomena. Their title offers a catchphrase that aims at entering into everyday language (from ""black swans"" to ""tipping points""). They use cross-reference to other popular books, in the hope of joining the bandwagon and achieving similar bestseller status. Among the books quoted or summarized by The Long Tail are the following blockbusters: Fooled by Randomness, The Black Swan, The Wisdom of Crowds, The Rise of the Creative Class, and Republic.com. The book visibly positions itself alongside this cohort of ""short head"" hits.Last, Chris Anderson used marketing ploys and viral techniques to increase his sales and impact. Following his Wired article, he published a blog and gave many lectures with the same catchphrase title, creating a core follower group and a spirit of expectation. He made sure the corporate examples he gave were congruent with his approach, and gained a lavish endorsement by Google's CEO. The publication followed the usual pattern of hardcover, paperback, bargain price, updated edition, as well as Audiobook and e-book declinations. The conclusion of The Long Tail opened the way for his next hit, which focuses on 3D printing and custom manufacturing. These marketing tricks are usually lost on me. I tend to shun bestsellers, and I do not belong to the technology savvy. But I was seduced by the firesale price of my second-hand copy, and devoted a couple of hours to its reading. I was not disappointed, nor was I enthralled by it: hence the three stars.","3.0 out of 5 stars","December 7, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2VP0Z12WBHA35/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001PTG4BO#wasThisHelpful","R2VP0Z12WBHA35","A3IKQVN8N8AKRY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3IKQVN8N8AKRY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"History as a discipline is rooted in its social and institutional context. The kind of history we make depends on the personal orientation of the historian, the public he addresses, and the situation in which this communication takes place. It is therefore appropriate to situate E. H. Carr's popular essay within the time and place in which it was written.What is History? was delivered in 1961 as the George Macaulay Trevelyan's lecture at the University of Cambridge. It is an exercise directed toward students, but it can also be read as part of a running discussion with other historians and philosophers who expressed their own views about the topic and, as an entry into a popular series, as an essay written with a view to posterity. The moment when it was originally written illustrates what Peter Novick, a historian of the American historical profession, has labelled the ""objectivist synthesis,"" taking its distance both with original objectivism and with historical relativism. Published as a mass market paperback, it was deemed worthy of a second edition in 1987, but the author didn't have time to rewrite the material and adapt his historiography to a thoroughly different context. It is therefore a book that bears the mark of its time. It should be read in parallel with other classics such as Collingwood's The Idea of History, Marc Bloch's The Historian's Craft, or more recent entries such as John Lewis Gaddis's The Landscape of History or Antoine Prost's Twelve Lessons on History.These essays are often offered as mandatory readings in introductory course for university students choosing a history major. They offer a privileged moment when a distinguished member of the profession exposes the founding myths of the discipline, its code of behaviour, and its most basic assumptions. The genre to which E. H. Carr's essay belongs should be clearly distinguished from contributions to the philosophy of history, or from scholarly works on epistemology. Historians very often emphasize their practical skills and concrete orientation, comparing their profession to that of the craftsman who uses his hands and tools as opposed to the abstract rhetoric and high intellect of philosophers. At the outset of his book, Carr states that he ""shall not embark on a philosophical discussion of the nature of our knowledge of the past."" Of course, this is precisely what he does, providing philosophy on the sly while denying for himself the knowledge or experience of a philosopher.The historian enters his profession through several ordeals and rites of passage: a broad education that includes antiquity and other periods of Western history but very few references to non-Western civilizations; the plunge into the archives that differentiates the true historian from the armchair theorist or essayist; the footnotes and bibliography of a dissertation that concentrates on a narrow topic with only a light conceptual apparatus; the pursuit of intellectual fame with the textbooks and popular essays that address a broader audience; etc. In the training of students, a brief excursion into philosophy might be ventured, but delving too much into the topic is deemed unnecessary. Philosophy is considered off limits for the historian-apprentice, and only learned elders can venture in the realm of high theory. Introductory courses such as this essay are therefore meant to provide the aspiring historian with the intellectual luggage that will equip him for the rest of his career. It is, if you wish, the ""Philosophy 101"" course or the ""Philosophy for Dummies"" book intended to equip future historians with a veneer of culture about timeless issues that are deemed relevant for his trade. What is History? revisits the most basic tropes and oppositions of intellectual enquiry: facts vs. interpretation, man vs. society, hard science vs. social sciences, causation vs. randomness, determinism vs. free will, the great man vs. the faceless crowd, progress vs. decline of civilizations, impartiality vs. value judgements, conservatism vs. progressivism, etc.Though all historians, indeed all learned persons, have views on these general issues, their considerations are rarely fully articulated. Even more rarely are they the fruit of systematic thought, which requires knowledge of philosophy and familiarity with the epistemology of other social sciences. Very few historians have any philosophical training, or even inclination. Historiography, or the history of how history is written, also has few specialists, although historians are more inclined to offer their views on the subject. The often-quoted injunction by Leopold von Ranke to tell ""what actually happened"" (wie es eigentlich gewesen) is generally misconstrued as a recommendation to consider ""facts, all the facts, and nothing but the facts"". This is a myth, based on a misreading of Ranke's thinking: the German historian never proposed to exclude values and interpretation from the writing of history, and the German word ""eigentlich"" should rather be translated as ""essentially"", the aim being to show ""what essentially happened"", or ""what happened in essence"". Ranke went on to write that the historian must seek the ""Holy hieroglyph"" that is God's hand in history, keeping an ""eye for the universal"" whilst taking ""pleasure in the particular"".A similar myth posits that relativism begets chaos and anarchy. If there is no absolute truth and every narrative varies according to differences in perception and consideration, then ""anything goes"", and relativism means the end of any serious scientific enquiry. This is how historians offer a trivial caricature of relativism in order to protect their discipline from serious consideration of alternative viewpoints, including those from women and minorities. In fact, some disciplines, from particle physics to anthropology, thrive on relativism, and use it as their cornerstone. The vision proposed by E. H. Carr, who proposes a middle ground between objectivism and relativism, is therefore based on a misconstruction of both terms. He offers a mild relativism, or principled objectivism, that reflects his positions as a liberal progressive--influenced in part by his study of Soviet Russia, he believes in state interventionism and the planned economy.  But his sympathy for progressive causes has limits: he never considers that the historian who writes history could be a she, and what is now called the gender perspective is conspicuously absent.As befits the genre, What is History? is full of programmatic statements, general maxims, and memorable quotes. Each could be given as a topic for a class essay or a group discussion, and they can be considered in isolation from historiography proper or from references to the history of ideas. Following is an anthology of such statements. ""It used to be said that facts speak for themselves. This is, of course, untrue. The facts speak only when the historian calls on them: it is he who decides to which facts to give the floor, and in what order or context."" ""Great history is written precisely when the historian's vision of the past is illuminated by insights into the problems of the present."" ""The past is intelligible to us only in the light of the present, and we can fully understand the present only in the light of the past."" ""The historian is not really interested in the unique, but in what is general in the unique."" ""The beliefs which we hold and the standards of judgement which we set up are part of history, and are as much subject to historical investigation as any other aspect of human behaviour."" ""History properly so-called can be written only by those who find and accept a sense of direction in history itself. The belief that we have come from somewhere is closely linked with the belief that we are going somewhere.""E. H. Carr also has a knack for vivid metaphors and earthly comparisons that reinforce the view of the historian as craftsman. His writing style evokes the fish-and-chips stalls and the dark ale of English pubs more than the formal atmosphere of the dining hall or the lecture amphitheatre. Here are a couple of quotes. ""To praise a historian for his accuracy is like praising an architect for using well-seasoned timber or properly mixed concrete in his building."" ""The facts are available to the historian in documents, inscriptions and so one, like fish on the fishmonger's slab. The historian collects them, takes them home, and cooks and serves them in whatever style appeals to him."" But following a running metaphor, the author offers a second version: ""The facts are really not at all like fish on the fishmonger's slab. They are like fish swimming about in a vast and sometimes inaccessible ocean; and what the historian catches will depend, partly on chance, but mainly on what part of the ocean he chooses to fish in and what tackle he chooses to use.""As mentioned, E. H. Carr should not be read in isolation, but as an entry in a series composed of similar essays. The author refers to the works or various historians and philosophers, such as R. G. Collingwood or Hugh Trevor-Roper, and he mildly pokes fun at other distinguished professors with whom he disagrees, from Karl Popper to Isaiah Berlin. Indeed, there is a suspicion of personal antagonism, or perhaps of Cambridge vs. Oxford rivalry, in the way he subjects Sir Isaiah Berlin to a series of attacks and criticisms. This is done in a gentlemanly manner where fair play combines with tongue-in-cheek humour. Speaking of Berlin's criticism of determinism, he remarks: ""It is perhaps unfair to hold Sir Isaiah responsible for his disciples. Even when he talks nonsense, he earns our indulgence by talking it in an engaging and attractive way. The disciples repeat the nonsense, and fail to make it attractive."" E. H. Carr is the quintessential Cambridge don, with the rhetorical technique, the soft eloquence, and the gentle humour that belong to his kin. Whether he gives a proper answer to the question: ""What is History?"" is another matter.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 21, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1EN77KZV2AIEM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0140135847#wasThisHelpful","R1EN77KZV2AIEM","A3IKQVN8N8AKRY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3IKQVN8N8AKRY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Freud had a complex relationship with women. He thought they lacked something, a je-ne-sais-quoi that was the obscure object of their desire. He called this lack: the phallus, and the drive that it generated: penis envy. It didn't dawn on him that women could be perfectly happy with their body, and that they did not envy something that could be found elsewhere. He had trouble accepting the obvious: a girl's genitalia is different from a boy's; her sexual organs are differently configurated. He made up complex stories and referred to ancient myths to come to terms with this simple fact of life.The story starts with boys and it is quite simple. Boy wants to sleep with mother but father stands in the way. He dreams of killing father, but is afraid that father will cut off his tiny weenie. He therefore develops a superego that will take on the role of father and will order what he can or cannot do. Fine so far, but what about girls? Does girl want to sleep with father and kill mother, as Jung proposed with his Electra complex? For Freud, things couldn't be so simple. For one thing, women could not be afraid to lose what they didn't have, and the fear of castration couldn't work with them: if anything, it is women who menaced men with the threat of castration. Second, Freud also thought women lacked moral character and he linked this deficit to the formation of their superego, which originates in the oedipal phase. The superego cannot take the place of father, because girl doesn't want to kill father: she wants to sleep with him.This is where the tiny weenie comes into play.  For Freud, men were superior to women because they had one, whereas women's inferiority came from their lack of it--actually, they had something that looked vaguely similar, called the clitoris, but it was so tiny that it was barely worth mentioning. Consequently, women envied men and their penis and cast a castrating threat over them. In the original story, girl wants to sleep with father, but she also wants to receive from him what she doesn't have. So here, in a kind of magical trick, the baby takes the place of the phallus, and girl receives it from father. Voila! Some additional remarks by the founder of psychoanalysis posit that shame is a typically feminine sentiment because women are ashamed of their genital deficiency, and that plaiting and weaving, the only inventions in the history of mankind that originated with women, was an imitation of nature that causes the growth of pubic hair to conceal the genitals.If phallocracy refers to a system dominated by the phallus, and in which the male sex is thought superior, then Freud fully deserved the name of phallocrat. Prejudices against women were quite common in his time and social environment. But Freud's relationship with women was not simply the reflect of his time: they were tainted by personal proclivities and obsessions, which he projected upon his system. Indeed, psychoanalysis--the discipline that he created, and which he compared to Galileo's heliocentrism or to Darwin's origins of species--can be thought of as a projection of Freud's personal fantasies and phantasms, as an autobiographical novel that he tried to impose on his contemporaries and successors, indeed to the whole of mankind. Freud was delusional, and we are left to deal with the remains of his dreams and prejudices.Sarah Kofman's The Enigma of Woman does not start with such premises, but reaches them in her conclusions. Her enquiry on the place of woman in Freud's writing concentrates on one particular text: Sigmund Freud's lecture on Womanhood (Die Weiblichkeit), pronounced in 1932 before an audience of male and female psychoanalysts. The first address of the lecture, ""Ladies and gentlemen,"" underscores the fact that this lecture on women is also addressed to women, to which the lecturer would deliver the truth of their own nature. In order to assuage the shock he was about to deliver, and to prevent criticism, he stressed that he based his conclusions on observations collected mostly by female analysts: for him, as for most men, women's sexuality was a dark continent.  He expected some resistance, of course, but he had an answer for that as well. People resist being told an uncomfortable truth, and this denial is itself the proof that the truth hits the nail. Women or feminists who oppose Freud's conception of the superego are themselves the thralls of their superego, which dictates their own denial. This is how a system achieves closure and transforms even rebuttals and refutations into supportive arguments.Freud begins with the observation that examination of the effects of sexual development in early childhood ""leads us into dark regions where there are as yet no sign-posts."" He then asks himself rhetorically why he doesn't wait until he has proof, and observes that ""formerly, I was never one of those who are unable to hold back what seems to be a new discovery until it has been either confirmed or corrected."" Referring to the Latin lyric poet Horace, who enjoined to let literary compositions be kept from the public eye for nine years at least, Freud mentions that two of his most famous works, his Interpretation of Dreams and Dora's Case, were delayed from publication for four or five years. This remark is not missed on Sarah Kofman, who notes that Freud had a tendency to delay important decisions. He differed his wedding for five years, he waited five years before taking his medical exams, and he set the five year period as the length of the talking cure with the patients he felt the most attached with. What Kofman doesn't point out is that Horace's remark applied to literary works, whereas Freud saw himself as a man of science, basing his theories on observations and not on speculations.Sarah Kofman is not the first scholar to offer a feminist reading of Freud's texts on women. Another French author, Luce Iragaray, saw in Freud's lecture the reflection of male chauvinism and oppression over women. Sarah Kofman's perspective differs from what she introduces as ""the war of the sexes"". For her, Freud's views are not only skewed by his own biases as a man, but are a reflection of his personal fantasies, of his paranoia. Freud had a phobia as regard women's genital parts: he compared the vagina to a gaping hole, a sore abscess full of liquids and suppuration. Like the head of Medusa in the Greek mythology, it would petrify any man who gazed at it. Freud also had an Oedipus complex--it may not be the case of every man, but it certainly applied to him. His incestuous drive wasn't limited to his mother. As a patriarch, he ruled over all the women in his household, and kept his wife, his sister-in-law, and his daughters, in a kind of sexual bondage. He forced his last born daughter, Anna, to confess on her most intimate fantasies, and had her deliver on his behalf the lecture On Womanhood that was so offensive to women.In addition to its close reading of the 1932 lecture, The Enigma of Woman refers to several texts in which Freud raises the issue of woman's psychology and anatomy. The book is not an easy read. It is dedicated to Kofman's students at La Sorbonne, Geneva and Berkeley, and it may first have been delivered in lecture mode. Like a lesson in a classroom, it requires prior reading of the class assignment, and should be studied in parallel with the original texts. Indeed, the reader will need to refer to Freud's lecture on Womanhood not only in its translation, but also in the original German. For Kofman, many mistakes or misperceptions of Freud's conception of women originate from mistranslations and textual errors. In particular, Luce Iragaray got many points wrong because she relied on a poor translation of Freud's work. In restoring the original text, Kofman claims to uncover the real and uncensored Freud--with all his contradictions, biases, and dirty little secrets.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 11, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1OTDTPTRY2LEA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0801498988#wasThisHelpful","R1OTDTPTRY2LEA","A3IKQVN8N8AKRY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3IKQVN8N8AKRY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As a faithful customer who devotes a substantial part of his purchasing power to buying books online, I thought I should get in more familiar terms with the story of Amazon.com. I had Robert Spector's book in my personal library for quite a while, in a section devoted to management books that I only seldom visit. To speak frankly, I have a grudge against business books. I loathe their poor writing style, their self-assertive cockiness, and their debilitating features like diagrams, bullet points, and end-of-chapter summaries. They take their readers for half-wits, and are usually written by people who are not worth better. The same applies to self-help books and how-to manuals: a famous collection even targets `dummies' as its avowed public, and feels unabashed about it.My personal likings and scholarly upbringing leads me to favor books that are intellectually challenging, as opposed to books written for the intellectually challenged. I find more valuable insights and general lessons in history books or classical novels than in the series that advertise their practical relevance and direct usefulness. But dealing with business and economic issues in my real life, I consider it my duty to expose myself from time to time to recent management thinking, or to learn about business ventures and companies that I am too lazy to read about in the business section of my morning newspaper. I read business books as a reminder that business matters, and that we cannot lead our lives only according to esoteric thinking and other intellectual pursuits.I have to confess that reading Amazon.com was not a life-transforming experience, but it was no drudgery either. For one thing, it contains no management terms or business school gobblespeak that so often obfuscate meaning and go against any notion of proper writing style. It is a who-did-what-when-and-why story of the company founded in 1994 by Jeff Bezos, as told by a journalist who made serious background information-gathering and fact-checking, and who writes in an engaging style. It ends in the year 2000, and leaves the rest of the story to a book sequel that remains to be written. People interested in establishing an e-commerce company or involved in online retailing may find applicable lessons for their trade, and company executives in general may consider it an inspiring and uplifting story. As for me, I read it as an account of the early years of the Internet age and as a portrait of one of the new economy's most charismatic figures.Jeff Bezos walks through life with a view to the legend. Ever since the beginning of the company, he masterfully played the public relation tune. According to Spector, ""the selling of Jeff Bezos was another essential element of the Amazon.com strategic plan."" He understood ""the value of creating an entrepreneurial mythology that fed into the mystique"". Episodes of the golden legend are the cross-country road trip from New York to Seattle, the creation of the company in a downtown garage, the CEO's office desk made of a house's door, etc. These details are mentioned in virtually every media profile, and they are carefully recorded and checked in the book. Youthful anecdotes are made relevant to the rest of the narrative by underscoring the hero's precociousness and technological savvy: dismantling his crib with a screwdriver as a toddler; rigging an electric alarm to keep his younger siblings out of his room; transforming the family garage into a lab for science projects--his mother, who also took part in the building of the myth, comments wryly: ""his projects became more complex with age but unfortunately the garage never got any bigger.""The journalist gives a rationale for his voyeuristic account into his hero's personal life: ""At the risk of reading too much into how the events of Jeff Bezos's youth influenced the creation of Amazon.com, it's obvious that he displayed evidence of success at an early age, and continually added to that evidence as he walked through the door of the corporate world."" Similarly, he introduces his first jobs in a tech firm and on Wall Street by underscoring that ""Every move Jeff Bezos made in his professional career--every bit of experience and knowledge he gained--was a building block in the eventual creation of Amazon.com.""Although the book's hero declined to participate in the project and did not respond to the author's inquiries, we get a fair amount of details about Amazon's early story and the choice that were to determine its future. Robert Spector also spares the reader no detail about Jeff Bezos's favorite books (science books and Sci-fi), his spending patterns (he bought a zero-gravity chess set at a Russian space auction), and his sleeping habits (he needs a full eight-hours sleep). His laid-back, self-deprecating humor is illustrated by many quips. Asked by a journalist if price comparators worry him, he answers that yes, it's a concern, but ""it's a concern the way that gravity is a concern for Boeing."" Another memorable quote: ""The landscape of people who do new things and expect them to be profitable quickly is littered with corpses."" Or the following: ""When people ask me if our consumers are loyal. I say, `Absolutely, right up to the second that somebody else offers them a better service.'""Also Bezos uses the expression `category-formation time' a lot, meaning that you had better get your act together very fast because the choices we make now will determine our future.  He favors science metaphors: he compared the state of the Internet in 1996 to the first 10 seconds after the Big Bang, where there is still ""a huge amount to come."" Confronted with the exponential growth figures in web usage, he comments: ""things don't grow this fast outside of petri dishes."" This image of nerdiness also belongs to the Bezos mystique, and is carefully constructed through quotes and anecdotes. We are even introduced to his rare, two-inch-thick Swiss Army knife complete with unusual features such as a fish scaler, mini-screwdriver to repair sunglasses, and a tiny ballpoint pen.Like Immanuel Kant, Jeff Bezos runs his life by the clock, and proceeds everything according to plan. The book describes how he methodically went about figuring out ""what business to get into, where he was going to do it, and how he was going to convince others to buy into his vision."" His decision to move into e-commerce and sell books on the Internet was a result of a carefully planned combination of market study, investor's acumen, and personal equation. He applies a `regret-minimizing framework' to his most important life choices, meaning that ""if you feel you will one day regret not taking a chance, then you take that chance."" As a bachelor, he also optimized the dating process by putting in place a `women flow' system, as investment bankers do with `deal flows'.Also the choice of his company name was not made in reference to mythology or to the ""A to Z"" logo smile: Bezos simply perused the entire ""A"" section of the dictionary because the company would then be listed on top of the alphabet list (another well-placed if unsuccessful entry was the Dutch ""Aard""). What mattered were not only the first letters in the company's name, but also the last characters. Amazon.com was one of the first enterprises to include the ""dot-com"" suffix into its branding. And a dot-com it certainly was: its share price went skyrocketing during the bubble era, and it was widely considered in a category of its own.  ""Going on Amazon"" became synonymous with buying a book online. Bezos resented his company being referred as ""the Wal-Mart of the Web"" because, as he told Fortune magazine, ""the company is not trying to be the `Anything' of the Web. We're genetically pioneers..."" This did not prevent Barnes & Noble to raise legal charges against Amazon.com for falsely claiming in its ads and on its website to be ""Earth's Biggest Bookstore,"" when in fact Amazon.com was ""not a bookstore at all, but merely a book broker.""Much of what we take for granted in online shopping and web design is the result of carefully planned decisions, technological constraints, or trial-and-error. Bezos and Amazon.com took a systematic approach to every step in the process of buying a book on its website. The company is considered the first Internet retailer to divide the buying procedure into a series of specific steps, to literally number each step, and to guide the customer through it. The online buying process that is commonplace today was revolutionary in its simplicity when it was first introduced in 1995. Even so, people were reluctant to give their credit card number online, and many transactions were set by phone. Amazon even tried to patent its shopping basket and one-click button.The most interesting part in the book was, for me at least, the few excerpts in which the author explains how Amazon.com made a difference in people's lives. As an early editor recalls, ""People would email us about how their world had widened through being able to order books through the Internet."" I certainly feel that way. More than any other website or computer application, Amazon.com changed my life. It opened worlds of wisdom, created propitious encounters, and made life-long learning a reality. Through book reading and review writing, I taught myself English, or at least I transformed a distant second language used only in the classroom into a familiar medium practiced daily. I kept a log trace of my past readings and couched my impressions or reading notes in an accessible format. I got in touch with other reviewers, and exchanged reading lists or editorial comments. For that, Jeff Bezos and colleagues, I am thankful.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 5, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2U7AFHOSZ1A2K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0066620414#wasThisHelpful","R2U7AFHOSZ1A2K","A3IKQVN8N8AKRY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3IKQVN8N8AKRY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The way Leo Strauss is read in France and in the French-speaking world differs from his reception in the United States. Americans read his books as an introduction to classical political philosophy. They see him more as a commentator of great texts or as a historian of ideas than as a philosopher in his own right. Strauss himself made the distinction between `scholars' and `great thinkers', and he placed himself squarely into the first category. If American commentators acknowledge his distinct contribution to the world of ideas, it is to discuss his teaching's political underpinnings, with sterile references to his alleged influence over the neoconservative agenda. Only rarely do they refer to his early texts on medieval Jewish and Muslim philosophers. Or if they do, it is to lock him up in a communitarian cage, and to consider that he was ""dj Jew all over again.""French philosophers discovered Strauss's works in several waves. The German refugee was in familiar terms with Alexandre Kojve, Alexandre Koyr, and Raymond Aron. He shared with them the same philosophical references and intellectual horizon. But the French translations of his essays came rather late, and they were discussed in conjunction with other authors such as Hannah Arendt and Carl Schmitt, in what amounted to a renaissance of political philosophy in France. Consequently, French commentators are more ready to engage Strauss as an original thinker and, looking for entry points into his work, to find common threads and patterns of ideas that unify his thinking into a coherent whole.Daniel Tanguay, a Canadian academic who writes in the tradition of French or continental philosophy, is inclined to see a constant motive in Strauss' work, which needs to be read between the lines and below the veneer of commentary, as Strauss himself thought we should read the classics of political philosophy. But, like Poe's stolen letter, the main message or code that allows the reader to grasp Strauss's work as a coherent whole needs not be hidden from sight or buried in a secret place: it is placed in evidence for all people to see. As Strauss wrote in Thoughts on Machiavelli, ""the problem inherent in the surface of things, and only in the surface of things, is the heart of things.""Reading Strauss on the surface provides the reader with several tropes: the Ancients versus the Moderns, the opposition between natural right and history, the esoteric art of writing, the incompatible claims of Jerusalem and Athens to our allegiance.  Daniel Tanguay's angle into Strauss's work is provided by the recognition that the theologico-political problem has always been the dominant theme of his enquiries. The young Strauss was already obsessed by God and politics, or rather by the compatibility between divine revelation and human law. He felt that one should either be ""the philosopher open to the challenge of theology, or the theologian open to the challenge of philosophy.""His early foray into political theology--a commentary of Spinoza's Tractacus Theologico-Politicus--arose in the context of the debates surrounding zionism and assimilation into German society in the 1920s. But much more was at stake than the fate of Jewish identity and of religious affiliation in a secular democracy. As a representative thinker of the Enlightenment, Spinoza's goal was to protect reason against the dark forces of religion, tradition, and superstition. But Strauss was not satisfied with the rationalist approach, against which he waived the charge of historicism. Had divine revelation really been refuted and superseded by modern philosophy? What if reason itself was resting on an act of faith, a will to make sense of the unfamiliar that was no less arbitrary than the belief in the truths of God's revelation?To pursue the inquiry further, he found it necessary to go back in time to the point where the conflict between religious orthodoxy and rational reasoning first emerged. He therefore turned to the ""Medieval Enlightenment"" of Jewish and Muslim thinkers like Maimonides, Averroes and al-Farabi, with the hope of discovering ""new, unheard-of, ultra-modern ideas"". This detour through medieval lights allowed him to revisit the stage where the Renaissance and the Enlightenment were first imagined, and also to find the missing link connecting modern political thought--Hobbes and Machiavelli--to the classical political philosophy of Aristotle and Plato.Strauss's reading of Farabi and other contemporaries also led to his discovery of the ""esoteric art of writing"". In questioning established opinions, or in investigating the principles of morality, medieval and antiquity philosophers found it necessary to convey their messages in an oblique manner, so as to escape the threat of the Inquisition or comparably obtuse tribunals. Philosophy in Muslim and Jewish traditional cultures had a more precarious statute than in the Christian world: Christian theology had integrated the teachings and methods of philosophy at an early stage, whereas for the other religions of the Book the pursuit of philosophy had to be justified before the Law. Paradoxically, this precarious positioning led to a flowering of philosophy--and of poetry--that had no equivalent in Christianity. Whereas the Church submitted philosophical inquiry to strict ecclesiastical control, Jewish and Muslim philosophers were free to pursue their art in a detached and private manner, just like the Greeks had done in Socrates's time.Strauss's close reading of Farabi and of the Muslim Aristotelians allows us to mention in passing a recent controversy that has caused quite a stir in French intellectual circles. In a provocative essay published in 2008, Sylvain Gouguenheim took the opposite view from traditional historiography that considers Muslim thinkers as key transmitters between the ancient Greek heritage and the Christian West. Farabi, Avicennes and Averroes, it is argued, had only a superficial knowledge of Plato and Aristotle, which they could access only through translations made by Syriac Christians. In any case, they had little influence over the rediscovery by late Medieval Christians of their Greek roots, from which they had never been completely cut off in the first place.These historical musings led to an outcry by French historians and philosophers, who wrote volumes of commentary to denounce the methodological shortcomings and ideological biases of Gouguenheim's claim. They would have been perceived as equally strange and ludicrous by Leo Strauss, who insisted he came to Plato through Farabi, and to Farabi through Maimonides. It is a historical fact that while Muslim Aristotelians had access to the whole corpus of classical political philosophy, Christian Europe wrote many commentaries on Aristotle's Politics but did not know Plato's Laws or The Republic until the fifteenth century. For Strauss, the `Farabian turn' is a restoration of Socratic wisdom: Farabi and Maimonides are true disciples of Plato. They rediscovered the original meaning of Socratic dialogues over and beyond the interpretations of Aristotelians and Neoplatonicians.Daniel Tanguay's book is not an intellectual biography in the strict sense of the word. There are no references to Strauss' life events, and the text only deals with the development of his thinking. It concentrates on his earlier writings, and leaves a large part of the Straussian corpus out of its scope. But the portrait that emerges from this intellectual journey is compelling. Far from limiting himself to commentary and teaching, Strauss wrestled with the most fundamental questions in philosophy. The theologico-political problem, as he named it, is the most challenging question a person can face, and Strauss addressed it head-on, without bias or roundabouts. If `great thinkers' are defined by their ability to address the great questions facing mankind while `scholars' only limit themselves to commentary, Leo Strauss may well belong to the first category.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 4, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1WBF3ZJPKL9Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0300172109#wasThisHelpful","R1WBF3ZJPKL9Z","A3IKQVN8N8AKRY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3IKQVN8N8AKRY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Chinese education system is often criticized for its emphasis on rote learning. Students are taught to memorize long lists of Chinese characters, historical milestones, and scientific axioms. They are crammed for university exams that request them to reproduce acquired knowledge, not to solve new problems or express original thoughts. Such system, it is said, stifles creativity and innovation. It may correspond to the needs of an economy in catch-up mode, but becomes unadapted to the age of the knowledge economy, when firms stand at the technology frontier. There, individuals must develop their own thinking, which is best done in a democratic regime that imposes no constraint on individual thought.Such criticism of an education overloading the mind with useless pieces of information has a long history. During the French Renaissance, Franois Rabelais described how his hero Gargantua was taught by his tutor Holofernes to memorize the most abstruse doctrines and treatises. The upshot, wrote Rabelais ironically, was that though Gargantua could indeed repeat the books he had learned ""backward by heart"" and ""became as wise as any man baked in an oven,"" when one wanted intelligent commentary from him ""it was no more possible to draw a word from him than a fart from a dead donkey.""Throughout the ages, the Jesuits were undoubtedly the world's champions in the art of memory. Ignatius Loyola, the founder of the Jesuit order, instructed that students ""should commit to memory what their masters have assigned."" Building from a medieval tradition drawing its roots back to antiquity, Jesuit teachers taught how to build for each class assignment or speech a memory palace: a mental construct based on real or imaginary architecture, where each room or piece of furniture corresponds to an item to memorize. In the sixteenth century, the Jesuits attempted to sell this memory art to the Chinese literati in order to demonstrate the superiority of the Christian faith. And their chief sales representative was Matteo Ricci, a man who committed himself to learn classical Chinese and adopt Chinese customs while pursuing missionary work from 1582 to 1610. It is the life of this Jesuit missionary and the nature of his skills that The Memory Palace of Matteo Ricci allows us to revisit.By impressing the Chinese with his memory skills, Ricci hoped to interest them in his culture; through interesting them in his culture he hoped to draw them to an interest in his God. In addition, his memory allowed him to translate and print various books, treatises, and maps that he had been holding in his mind, and therefore substitute to the lack of printed material from Europe. Ricci's ability at a late point in his life to memorize rapidly lists of four or five hundred Chinese ideographs might have been due in large part to the techniques he learned from his teachers in the Jesuit colleges of Macerata and then Rome. The nature of his mnemonic skills ensured that when he had to start learning Chinese, on his arrival in Macao in 1582, and despite what he described by his ""old age"" (he was forty-one), far from being dismayed by the difficulty of the language he was excited, almost triumphant at what he called the ""leap"" he had made. It was easy for someone well trained in mnemonic art to make each ideograph into a memory image. But it took him more than twelve years to reach the point at which he had learned enough Chinese by his methods and discipline so that he was ready to explain those methods in Chinese to a well-disposed public.The Latin humanist and Stoic writers he had been raised on, such as Cicero, Pliny, Quintilian and Seneca, all provided fine example of extraordinary memory talent. Seneca could remember two thousand names in sequence or two hundred random lines of verse. Julius Caesar could, in Pliny's words, ""dictate or listen simultaneously, dictating to his secretaries four letters at once on his important affairs--or, if otherwise unoccupied, seven letters at once."" If one is to believe Quintilian, Theodectes had the ability to recall any number of poems after a single reading, and Charmadas could remember the entire contents of the books in the libraries he visited. Mithridates could speak the languages of the twenty-two countries he ruled. Cyrus knew the names of all the soldiers in his army of hundreds of thousands of men. Pyrrhus's envoy to Rome, Cineas, remembered the names and faces of the thousands of officials he met there. Lucius Scipio could name all the citizens of Rome, and Themistocles all the citizens of Athens. There may be a slight exaggeration in the record of such ancient deeds and performances. But they set the standard to which students schooled in the classical tradition aspired.The Memory Palace of Matteo Ricci is a rather unique narrative, unlike most biographies or historical accounts. One has to get used to the very peculiar narrative style. The mode of presentation is innovative, provocative even, and sometimes stretches the mind too far, as when one has to remember past events or characters that featured in previous chapters, or places that are only described through light paint brushes. The book is not a conventional history of the life of Matteo Ricci, nor an exposition of his Treatise of Mnemonic Arts or of his Storia dell' Introduzione del Christianesimo in Cina. It is not organized in chronological order or around geographic descriptions. Rather it draws its inspiration from visual images and Chinese ideographs that Matteo Ricci himself used in order to communicate the Christian faith to the Chinese. Four Chinese characters and four woodblock images taken from the New or the Old Testament provide the frame for each chapter and thematize its content.The Chinese ideograph for war, pronounced wu, introduces a presentation of war-torn Italy at the time of Ricci's youth, which contrasts to peaceful China in the late sixteenth and early seventeenth century. There, Ricci sees the lack of military preparedness as a sign of weakness (""both in outward appearance and in their inner hearts they are just like women. If one shows them one's teeth they will humble themselves."") But even in China violence lurks in every corner: one Jesuit in Canton is tortured to death, and Ricci's residence in Shaozhou is attacked by mobs. In the next chapter, the image of the apostle Peter floundering in the Sea of Galilee and reaching out Jesus's hand precedes the evocation of sea travels at the age of the Portuguese maritime empire, and the narration of Ricci's journey from his native Italy to Mozambique, and then on to Goa, to Malacca, and finally to Macao. Ricci changed residence several times, and usually travelled by river boat, with the occasional accident or shipwreck. The character ""yao"", which combines two characters meaning ""west"" and ""woman"", is remembered by the mnemonic ""a woman from the Xixia, which is Muslim (or huihui)"". This introduces a discussion on religious intolerance in Counter-Reformation Europe and of religious pluralism in China, with its Muslim population in the West and its pocket of Jewish and Christian minorities dating back from ancient times. Being presented with a portrait of Ricci and other Jesuits in Peking (they were not allowed to meet him in person), the Chinese emperor said dismissively: ""They are huihui"".And so one with the following chapters, organized loosely around themes and images without much concern for chronology or internal coherence. Meant to facilitate memorizing and to structure rhetorical discourse, this narrative ploy is more evocative than logical, and leaves the reader in a rather confused state of mind. Nevertheless, this unconventional biography succeeds in drawing parallels between sixteenth century's Europe and China, and in recreating the various locations that Ricci inhabited. The book is open to the realm of fiction and sometimes acquires a dreamlike character, as when Ricci has vision of the Lord instructing him to ""Go forward to that city"", meaning the imperial capital of Beijing. For the missionary had his eyes on the supreme prize, the coronation of a life's worth: the conversion of the Ming emperor, which he dreams of achieving in the delirium that seizes him on his deathbed.In the end, we are left to consider whether Matteo Ricci's mental constructions still have a place in our hearts, or whether we should espouse Rabelais's iconoclastic laughter at what amounts to little more than a donkey's fart. Memory nowadays seems in short supply: we have delegated much of it to technology, and devote most of the rest to trivia. Technology has brought ""brains in our pockets,"" as a German rock band from the 1980s used to sing. We live in an age of hard disk drives and infinite memory storage--indeed, the memory palace of the scholastics is not unlike the memory disk partitioning used to initialize a computer disk. Today what really matters is not the ability to memorize things, but the capacity to select what should be memorized. It is here that the lessons taught by the Jesuits acquire a new significance: when things are in perpetual motion and technology transforms our world at an unprecedented fast pace, isn't the true wisdom to be found in the cultivation of things past, and in the ability to remember what truly matters? It is a lesson that the Chinese should well consider, and that we ought not forget as well.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 3, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1TUQ46X1OQ30/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0140080988#wasThisHelpful","R1TUQ46X1OQ30","A3IKQVN8N8AKRY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3IKQVN8N8AKRY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Optimists and pessimists take opposite views on globalization. The first ones believe international trade and investment will spread wealth and prosperity across the globe, and make revenues converge to a higher level. The second ones denounce a race to the bottom that benefits only a handful and makes the rest poorer while destroying communities and the environment. But both camps assume that global market forces make economies converge toward a single world standard, and that globalization radically constraints national policy choices. For happy globalists or gloomy anti-globalizers, there is only one way, one single road to heaven or to hell.How We Compete challenges this basic assumption. Based on five years of research (from 1999 to 2004) covering 500 companies on three continents, the book demonstrates that the global economy leaves us with many choices, and that different brands of capitalism may coexist and thrive. More provocatively, Suzanne Berger and her team argue that no sector is doomed to extinction in advanced economies. This was not a preordained conclusion, but the result of patient research. In the course of their study, they found prosperous companies in high tech or low tech, in capital-intensive or labor-based activities, in fast-moving sectors or craft activities that have not changed over centuries. They did not find evidence of a race to the bottom in terms of wage and labor conditions or of environmental standards. In particular, they found that offshoring or outsourcing production abroad is not a fatality, and that manufacturing or ""making things"" has a future even in advanced economies based on knowledge and services. They conclude that market pressure and economic convergence alone do not force a single model unto corporations or economies.Some basic definitions may be in order. By delocalization, we usually mean the shift of an activity formerly hosted in an advanced economy to a new location offering lower wages and other cost advantages. We take delocalization and offshoring as broadly synonyms, although delocalization mostly refers to the production process while offshoring also includes the relocation of services such as accounting. Subcontracting refers to the relationship where one contractor, the principal, requests another independent entity, the subcontractor, to undertake part of the business process in accordance with the principal contractor's specifications. Outsourcing or contracting out are broadly similar to subcontracting, without the vertical relationship implied in the latter. Another important pair of concepts is fragmentation and modularity. The former refers to the vertical division of labor by which different stages of the production process are carried out in specialized plants linked by production networks spanning countries and continents. Modularity originally refers to an engineering technique that builds larger systems by combining smaller subsystems produced by various contractors. The concept of modularity has evolved from an initial focus on product design, followed by a broadening to the level of the organization, and finally to the level of industries or sectors.Management scholars trace back the concept of modularity to IBM's experiment with system architecture in the 1960s. But modularity in the IT sector really took off in the 1990s, with new CAD and CAM software that made possible collaboration across distance and between firms. The rise of modularity lead to a soul-searching phase among Japanese firms and stimulated research by Japanese scholars who now stand at the forefront of the discipline. The iPod is the most successful example of modularization, followed by the iPad and the successive generations of iPhones. Simply put, the question raised by the Japanese was: Why Apple and not Sony? Why the firm that invented the Walkman in the 1980s did not come along with the string of iProducts that Apple has been churning at a velocious pace? Beyond this lurks a more troubling question: could the same fate await Toyota or Matsushita in the hands of Chinese competitors?Computers, domestic appliances and even cars can now be produced by taking parts and systems off the shelf and assembling them into a low-price, medium-quality, high-volume alternative to the standard goods produced by integrated firms. Even core activities such as R&D and product development or marketing and design can now be outsourced, allowing a firm to concentrate only on those segments of the value chain where she outperforms her competitors. In the twenty-first century, ideas may be bought off the shelf, and recombining activities along the supply chain may be a new source of competitive advantage. The traditional product life-cycle first identified by Raymond Vernon disappears: new innovative products may be brought directly to the world market and introduced for mass consumption at a low price.According to Suzanne Berger, there are broadly three models of industrial organization. First, the hollowed-out firm such as Dell or Nike contracts out everything but a handful of activities on which its competitive advantage is based.  This model relies on supply chains that now span the whole world and fragment the production process into interconnected parts. It rests on the maintenance of an open trade system that allows for the division of labor and the specialization of economies along their comparative advantage. The hollowed-out or fragmented model gives rise to fears of deindustrialization and the loss of competence that arises from contracting out manufacturing processes through technology transfers. The second model is the vertically integrated firm. Groups like Samsung, Intel or Toshiba design, build and market their own products, band are reluctant to contract out parts of the value chain. When they expand abroad, they tend to build their own factories and facilities or they bring along their subcontractors with them. In contrast to old conglomerates, they stick to their own knitting and concentrate on their core business. But they have a broad view of the industry in which they operate, and they refuse to limit their role to simply sticking a label on a product manufactured by others.There is yet a third model of industrial organization that is neither the lean firm nor the integrated multinational: called the cluster economy, it is composed of scores of small and medium-sized enterprises that specialize in a narrow branch and thrive in a dense ecosystem. The Silicon Valley, the technology parks in Taiwan, or the biotech corridor around Boston are familiar examples of this model. But the cluster economy also exists in traditional sectors like the specialized production networks of Northern Italy. The coexistence of these three production models demonstrates that technology is not destiny: technology has not forced firms into adopting a single organizational form or converging toward a single model. But it has made these transformations possible, and it has opened up the range of choices available.How We Compete can be located at the intersection between three disciplines: management, political economy, and economics. The book resonates with the dominant paradigm in business studies, which traces its roots to Edith Penrose's The Theory of the Firm. According to the so-called resource-based view of the firm, what makes a company beat the competition is the set of core competencies or resources that cannot be copied or duplicated. Modularity and globalization have boosted this competitive focus: now a firm has to concentrate on those segments of the value chain where she beats her competitors, and leave the rest to outsourcing. There is however some value in keeping some organizational slack and integrated functions, which may be redeployed into new competitive products and processes.Suzanne Berger's book is also cognizant with the political economy approach subsumed under the heading of Varieties of Capitalism, or VoC, to borrow the title of a programmatic book published by Peter A. Hall and David Soskice in 2001. How We Compete shares with this approach the strong focus on institutions and the ambition to draw practical lessons applicable not only to firms, but also to governments and policymakers. Contrary to this framework however, no nation is characterized by a single model. Rather, production systems emerge from dynamic trajectories in which firms' characteristics are nurtured and strengthened. Last, although it does not refer to recent economic literature, the book echoes the results of modern trade theory that emphasizes firm heterogeneity and differences in productivity. These new models relax the assumption, standard in neo-classical economics, that firms all stand at the technology frontier and can be subsumed under a single production function. New databases also allow economists to document the fragmentation of production and the rise of production networks. The lines separating economics, management and political science are therefore not so clear cut, and recent research such as this book make contributions relevant to various fields.A last word on the edition. I read the book in the French translation published as a mass market paperback in 2006. The French title, Made in Monde, is a mix of French and English that refers to a previous book written by the same MIT research team, Made in America, also published in a French translation under the same title. A significant number of American management books get published in France, as the French traditionally buy few books written in English (online shopping has changed that a bit). The translation of these books is often very poor, as it is difficult for colloquialisms and everyday expressions to cross language borders. Partly as a result of this poor writing style, the language spoken by French business executives is a poor mix of French and English, known as Franglais (Frenglish) or globish, which weakens meaning and reduces communication to its barest essentials. This loss of expressive power leads in turn to a paucity of substance and even to a loss of soul, or to a dilution of the French spirit into an amorphous blather. This is why many French intellectuals, who cherish clarity of expression and intellectual rectitude, turn against globalization and resent American culture's imperialism.I mention all this because the book by Suzanne Berger and her coauthors is surprisingly well translated, which turns its French edition into a pleasant read. Laurent Bury, the French translator, stays close to the original text, but offers felicitous expressions and an engaging style. My personal wish is that this skillful translation and broad readership orientation of How We Compete will help the French public reconcile with globalization and the many benefits that openness entails.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 2, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R182GXPE3VAQGH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385513593#wasThisHelpful","R182GXPE3VAQGH","A3IKQVN8N8AKRY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3IKQVN8N8AKRY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In Romance and the ""Yellow Peril"", Gina Marchetti focuses on the construction of interracial sex and romance in a sample of Hollywood movies covering more than a half-century of productions, from early silent films to more recent blockbusters. Each chapter takes up one narrative pattern commonly found in Hollywood fiction--rape and the lynching mob, female rapture and captivity, Madame Butterfly in her many reincarnations, the myth of the white knight saviour, the parallel pair of lovers with opposed fates, etc.--and uses a sampling of one, two, or three films to look closely at the discursive strategies Hollywood employs in these tales of interracial romance.By looking at these narratives critically, a picture can begin to emerge of the way in which Hollywood sets norms and breaks taboos, offers forbidden pleasures, and maintains unequal racial, gender and class hierarchies. The analysis goes beyond the mere denunciation of racial prejudice to reveal an ambivalence in most stories or aesthetics that allows for a number of potentially subversive readings. As Marchetti states, ""Perhaps one reason for the staying power of these narratives can be found in their ability to voice resistance, to allow for at least a moment the possibility that women may be right to demand independent thought and action, that other races may not be inferior, that other ways of life may have a right to exist."" These moments of undecidability and contradiction open the space for deconstruction and critique, offering viewers a number of interpretive positions.In the 1950s, US military personel stationed in Japan were distributed pamphlets with titles like ""Things You Are Required to Know Before Marrying Orientals"" and ""But Will Your Family Accept Her?"" Hollywood movies, always quick to pick up social issues and turn them into stories and glamour, addressed the issue of interracial sexuality and used melodrama and romance to plead for intercultural understanding. But they did so in a deeply ambiguous and contradictory manner. The sources of this ambiguity were threefold. First, interracial relations were eroticized and projected onto a sentimental plane. Second, the liberal call for racial tolerance obfuscated a conservative vision of gender relations and power structures. Third, racial stereotypes surfaced behind the veneer of openness and inclusiveness. Following Gina Marchetti, let's review these three dimensions of eroticism, gender, and race in her sample of Hollywood movies.For Hollywood, the exotic has always rhymed with the erotic. Hollywood used the lure of the Orient to titillate and sexually arouse male viewers, as in the poster of the movie Sayonara starring Marlon Brando and Japanese actress Miiko Taka that serves as the cover picture of this book. As the poster illustrates, Hollywood offered the provocative possibility of a meeting of Asia and America within the sexual realm. One of the enduring aspects of the Western vision of Asia involves the Orient's supposedly intrinsic seductiveness. Associated with material opulence, moral laxity, sensuality, cultural decadence, and exotic beauty, this seductiveness implies a peculiar spiritual danger and often hidden threat for the Westerner. Mata Hari usually hides a dagger in her garter, and the sexual permissiveness that US soldiers and expat workers may experience in Asian cities poses a threat to the functioning of the bourgeois family back home.In interracial tales of seduction, the attractions of Asian sexuality are often offset by an inevitable tragic ending. The Asian seductress or seducer generally dies, and the moral lapse of the Westerner finds some suitable expiation. Indeed, because the heroine or male figure is punished by death for any taboos she or he may have broken, these films are often more open in their exploration and expression of female sexuality. The tragic end of Madame Butterfly or similar characters also conjures up ambivalent feelings among those viewers who see in her fate not the justified consequence of miscegenation but the unfair sacrifice of a woman's desire. In more recent stories love may triumph over social stigma, but each narrative upholds that stigma by exacting a price for criticizing accepted social practices. In more general terms, Hollywood pays tribute to the all-compassing nature of heterosexual romantic love, but also suggests other attachments and longings that do not fit squarely into this mold.Hollywood's vision of the Orient is heavily gendered: stories generally favour romances involving white males and Asian females. Although most movies call for racial tolerance and appear to condemn racism, they never question the racial hierarchy that makes Asian women available to white males but preclude the possibility of a union between white women and Asian men. Their happy ending upholds the right of the white hero to tear the heroine away from her own culture and independent lifestyle. The conception of Asian feminity as alluring, provocative, and mysterious as well as passive, yielding, and vulnerable reinforce traditional notions of masculinity that appear to be challenged at home. Romantic love across the ethnic divide promises spiritual transcendence and intercultural harmony while actually delivering female passivity, domesticity, and a rationalization of women's subservient role. Indeed, by playing the Caucasian woman off against the Asian woman, Hollywood can affirm male identity against the threat of the Western ""new"" woman, empowered by an emerging feminism and increased access to positions of independence and leadership within society. Thus films made in the postwar period can uphold both the gender and racial status quo by depicting Asian women as more truly ""feminine"" than Western women, who are perceived as having sacrificed their feminity and as posing a threat to traditional conceptions of masculinity. Only in Asia can the Western man find ""true"" love.The film advertised on the book cover illustrates this point. The hero, played by Marlon Brando, leaves his American fiance for a Japanese actress playing in an all-female musical company, while she develops a platonic interest for a Kabuki actor. Secondary characters and subplots also feature love triangles and opposite fates. As the author shows, if Sayonara is about racial tolerance and understanding, it is also about keeping women in their ""place"" as wives and mothers. Here the conservative treatment of gender stands as a correction to the film's more liberal treatment of race. If Sayonara questions national and racial boundaries on one level, it also affirms and solidifies very conservative notions of gender identity and sexuality on another. Also Sayonara seems to be saying that just as it is natural for men to love and dominate passive women, it is natural for America to take a similar dominant posture toward Japan. Although mildly broached at the film's outset, questions surrounding both male and military prerogatives are eventually put to rest, and white, male, American hegemony is ultimately upheld.In Madame Butterfly, a Japanese girl believes in the marriage of convenience that a US naval officer has contracted with her, waits faithfully for his return after he leaves, then sacrifices herself when he comes back to Japan with his new American wife, leaving behind a son to be adopted by the couple. The tale offers an ambivalence that may account for its enduring success. On one hand, it may portray men as insensitive brutes and cowards, who apply double standards and do not have the courage to honour their commitments. On the other hand, it is only through total submission to men and complete faith in their superiority that women can fulfil themselves and express a ""genuine"" feminity. Although the male hero may be insensitive and unfair, the Butterfly's suicide legitimizes his authority, allowing the heroine to martyr herself for the continuing domination of the West. Still on another level, the tragic romance can be viewed as a tale of pure and unconditional love, and its aesthetics has often been appropriated by gay persons who may project their own readings and interpretations.Although there are early cases of openly racist films, such as DeMille's The Cheat or Griffith's Birth of a Nation, Hollywood movies usually attempt to make a case for racial tolerance and respect for foreign cultures. However, underneath their plea for racial harmony and compassion for lovers torn between two cultures, the underlying subtext is most often exclusionist and prejudiced. One therefore needs to go beyond the mere identification of stereotype in order to find the conservative and reactionary elements within the liberal project itself. This racial confusion is particularly visible in stories which break the usual gender pattern and feature a sexual or romantic entanglement between an Asian man and a Western woman. Early stories of rapture and captivity expose Anglo-American women to a ""fate worse than death""--be it rape, forced marriage, or prostitution--and severely punish them for straying from male authority. In more modern scenarios, Asian or Eurasian males are pictured as asexual ennuch figures or as troubled masculinities.Very often, Hollywood used Asians or Asian-Americans as signifiers of racial otherness to avoid the more traumatic and conflictual racial relations between blacks and whites. Stories of interracial romance deal with that fundamental contradiction within the American psyche between the liberal ideology of the ""melting pot"" and the conservative insistence on a homogeneous, white, Anglo-Saxon American identity. Just as Asian women embodied a model of ""true"" feminity that was proposed as an example to Anglo-Saxon women, Asians or Asian-American characters offer a model of assimilation to mainstream America that stand in sharp contrast with the more problematic integration of other minorities.Firmly anchored in feminist theory, this book demonstrates that Hollywood's representation of Asia has more to do with the definition of American identity than with any attempt to understand other cultures. The reader will thus learn little about China, Japan, or Vietnam by reading the chapters or viewing the films under consideration. Indeed, Gina Marchetti insists that she is not an Asia specialist, and that her involvement with Asian cultures came almost by chance. But Hollywood has the power to produce images and stories that shape our perception of global realities. By returning this mirror onto ourselves, we will learn a lot about our tacit assumptions, our implicit values, and our unconscious longings.Despite the author's cultural deftness, however, one cannot avoid a sensation of incompleteness and aporia at the end of the book. Gina Marchetti's ambition to contribute, through media critique, to ""the dismantling of the existing inequitable social order"" seems to me the epitome of the white savior myth she otherwise denounces. Her call to listen to alternative voices and especially to Asian cinema obfuscates the fact that Hollywood has become a master in incorporating alternative viewpoints and minority perspectives. Besides, as viewed from a less militant perspective, a feminist critic would have put more emphasis on the playful dimension of eroticism: the role-playing, the ambivalence, the game of seduction are also part of these romance stories, and one need not see the sectarian devil in all romantic details.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 24, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RFI6559K5XHVN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0520084950#wasThisHelpful","RFI6559K5XHVN","A3IKQVN8N8AKRY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3IKQVN8N8AKRY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The author lists various academic positions, as well as journalistic experience, in the short biography on the flip cover, and his book is endorsed by famous academics such as Eric Hobsbawm and Niall Ferguson. But this is misleading. For Martin Jacques is not an academic. He is a journalist through and through, and his book lacks the rigor and intellectual discipline that are to be expected from a scholarly work. Now I don't deny there are also interesting books written by journalists. Media people are in contact with people from very different walks of life, and can reflect diverse opinions and viewpoints. They are often better placed than academics to feel the spirit of the times, and they sometimes have the power to shape and influence public debates through timely and influential essays. In sum, there is much to be commended in journalism, and we would certainly be left with a poorer vision of the world without it. But as with academic work, there is good journalism and bad journalism. When China Rules the World belongs to the second category. Let me explain why.First, the least you can expect from a journalist is to get his facts rights. I claim no special expertise on China, and I was thus not able to check the author's facts and figures--although I have learned to take Chinese statistics with a pinch of salt, and economic projections based on ongoing trends with a heavy dose of skepticism. But the least I can tell about his chapter on Japan is that he gets it wrong, wrong, wrong.  He draws most of his information on Japan's cultural distinctiveness from Ruth Benedict, an American anthropologist who took part in wartime propaganda and published a book on Japan in 1947 without having set foot on its shores. Similarly, his analysis of the Japanese political system relies on a single book written in the 1980s by a Dutch journalist who could neither speak nor read Japanese. Now seriously, who would trust a similar book written on the United States or a European country based on such dubious research? This is not for lack of material about Japan available in English. Scores of books have been written by anthropologists and political scientists who not only get their facts right, but also provide original perspectives on Japan.  Martin Jacques does not refer to them: he prefers to stick to outmoded clichs and fabricated lies.Arguably, this is not a book about Japan, and the author could be forgiven for relying on sloppy research in one chapter of a book that concentrates on China. But his mishandling of Japan matters: for he uses Japan as the template by which he assesses China's rise and challenge to the West. For example, based on Karel van Wolferen's book, he makes the claim that Japan is not a real democracy, that it is ruled by bureaucrats, and that it presents the appearance of a multiparty parliamentary system in which the Diet holds no power and only one party really matters. (How ironic: the year When China Rules was published was precisely when this party was ousted from power by the main opposition party.) In doing so, the author advocates a policy of benign neglect toward Chinese authoritarianism: according to Jacques, the Chinese Communist party is not so much different from the Japanese LDP, and we should consider the one-party state system with the same leniency that we applied to postwar Japan.One may agree or disagree with Martin Jacques' opinions and personal values. Indeed, he is free to espouse the party line and to play the sycophant to the Chinese regime. But a book of independent journalism should keep a critical distance over the issues it addresses and offer a perspective that is different from the dominant doxa. By contrast, When China Rules sounds and reads like the chit-chat of the chattering classes who have a vested interest in inflating the China boom. No effort is made to put things into perspective: to recall, for instance, that China's GDP per head is still one tenth of Japan's; that America's military budget exceeds the total military expenditures of all other countries; that the United States have never reneged on a security commitment to an ally; or that Japan is deemed as the country exerting the most positive influence in world opinion surveys. The notion that Japan could also aspire to regional leadership is not even mentioned, let alone discussed.I don't mean to imply that When China Rules the World is completely off the mark. In a way, it is an important book, which raises important issues. The rise of China to regional ascendancy and worldwide influence; the economic advantages reaped by latecomers in the process of catching up; the distinctive traits of East Asian modernities and their challenge to Western norms and values; the impact of cultural change on fragmented societies and ethnicities; etc.: these are all valid questions that need to be addressed. But When China Rules does it in a deeply flawed way, reflecting cultural prejudices and ideological biases. Most annoyingly, Martin Jacques claims to be the first to raise these issues when in fact they have been discussed for decades in the academic literature, in a principled and argumented way that sorely lacks in this book. Journalists ignore academic scholarship at their peril. By shunning what sociologists, anthropologists, and area study specialists have been debating for decades, the author deprives himself of powerful tools that could have helped him address these complex and multifaceted issues.Nowhere is this neglect of the existing academic literature more damaging than on its treatment of race. Martin Jacques is right to point out this is a sensitive issue that people are reluctant to address but that nonetheless shapes their behavior and values in a pervasive manner. Indeed, this is what academics working in anthropology or cultural studies departments have been saying all along. Together with gender, racial identities have dominated academic debates for the past thirty years. But Martin Jacques' analysis of race in the Chinese context rests on a single author, Frank Diktter, as well as an unpublished dissertation and a couple of journal articles. Indeed, more than scholarly work, his analysis of race in the Chinese context relies on hearsay, conversations with students, and readings from the press or from internet forums.The result is that Martin Jacques treads in this sensitive terrain with the clumsiness of an elephant in a china shop. He postulates a hierarchy of races or a feeling of superiority among ethnic Chinese that does not allow for multiple identities or the plasticity of ethnicity. For instance, he does not mention, let alone explain the fact that the number of people claiming Manchu ancestry has been continuously on the rise in China, whereas the Manchu language was extinct and descendants of the banner people only a handful some fifty years ago. Many other examples could be given: the attractiveness of Canadian citizenship for Hong Kong residents; the prestige of a US university diploma that goes much beyond prospective employment; the emergence of an ethnic identity in Taiwan; the heavily gendered perception of race among mixed couples: all these facts and stories point toward subtler theories and more nuanced explanations than the simplistic chromatic scale that postulates that, for the Chinese, ""black is repellent, yellow is undesirable and white is good.""Similarly, the issue of contested modernity is an important one, but one that doe not lend itself easily to simplistic treatment and broad generalizations.  Who would disagree with Jacques's claim that we are witnessing the birth of a world of multiple and competing modernities, one in which emerging nations do not necessarily converge toward a universal model best achieved by the United States or other Western countries? In fact, the reverse hypothesis--that the developing countries would increasingly come to resemble the developed world--was a central tenet of the modernization theory, which was very influential in American scholarship in the 1950s and early 1960s, but which has come under heavy criticism ever since. What has Martin Jacques been reading in the meanwhile? A cursory glimpse at the anthropology literature would have familiarized him with attempts to provincialize Europe, to give voice to the subaltern, or to trace the postcolonial predicament.Keynes once famously declared that ""even the most practical man of affairs is usually in the thrall of the ideas of some long-dead economist."" Likewise, every culturalist that offers a clich is a prisoner to the opinions of long-dead anthropologists. These worn-out tropes include the opposition between shame and guilt societies, the notion that the individual does not exist in cultures where the group predominates, or that women are a tool of exchange between clans. These are not necessarily false assumptions, but ones that need to be substantiated and enriched by more modern anthropological perspectives. These are the kinds of insights one expects from an academic writing for the general public; but this perspective is sorely lacking in this journalistic account of China's challenge to the West.","2.0 out of 5 stars","August 4, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1GRU2SNW4JYB4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1594201854#wasThisHelpful","R1GRU2SNW4JYB4","A3IKQVN8N8AKRY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3IKQVN8N8AKRY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Donald Rumsfeld once famously made the distinction between the ""known knowns"" and the ""known unknowns"". The later expression provided the title for his memoirs. He could have added the two categories of the ""unknown knowns""--things you know without knowing it-- and the ""unknown unknowns""--things that you do not know that you don't know. These seemingly paradoxical expressions will serve me as guiding posts for reviewing Aaron Friedberg's A Contest for Supremacy, which focuses on the nascent struggle between China and America for regional preeminence and ascendancy in East Asia.Usually a scholar working on strategic issues makes the case that his domain of specialization is the most important in the world, bar none. Not so with Professor Friedberg. Although the book's flip cover makes the bold statement that ""as the twenty-first century unfolds, the United States faces no task more important than managing our mixed, complex, uncertain, and potentially unstable relationship with China,"" this should not be read as a vindication of the author's line of expertise. For Aaron Friedberg is not a China scholar. As he makes it clear, he is no ""card-carrying member of the China-watching fraternity"". Precisely because of this, he is able to give a fresh look at a subject that has occupied him fully for the previous five years, and which he has been considering ""for a good deal longer than that"" (no doubt his stint in government as deputy assistant for national security in the office of Vice President Dick Cheney has sensitized him to the importance of the Sino-American relationship, arguably the most strategic bilateral relation in the world). He came to study China because he deemed the topic was important, indeed vital; not the other way around. As he states, ""the truth is that China is too important to be left to the China hands"". For him, China was a known unknown: an issue he knew was important, but on which he had to invest considerable intellectual resources before he could get a grip on it. It was also an unknown known: an issue known by scholars but, precisely because of this, about which must remained unknown.Before turning to China, Friedberg had been an academic historian working on international relations. His first book focused on Britain's relative decline at the turn of the twentieth century, and his second addressed America's anti-statism and its cold war grand strategy. As mentioned, his two years' term in government gave him a hands-on experience on international security issues. These previous achievements framed the way he approached the topic of A Contest for Supremacy. Had America entered a period of relative decline and was it, as Great Britain one hundred years before, about to pass on the baton to the world's ascending power? Or was it about to launch a new cold war strategy in order to protect its leadership? Indeed, did the United States have a grand strategy that could respond to the Chinese leadership's own plans and long-term objectives? And did Chinese leaders pursue long-term goals, or were they just opportunistically clinging to power by riding the wave of economic growth? These are the known unknowns in the Rumsfeld's sense of the word: the questions one needs to address in order to get a clearer view of an important international topic.A valid standard for evaluating a scholarly work is to determine its use of primary sources and, based on these, its contribution to the existing literature. Measured by this yardstick, Friedberg's contribution is meager. It is not null however: Friedberg does exploit primary sources and archival records dating back from the United States' first period of strategic alignment with China under the leadership of president Richard Nixon and of his diplomatic adviser Henry Kissinger. This period is a ""known known"": the ""Nixon in China"" defining moment has been the subject of many books, not to mention a Hollywood movie and a music opera. As for Kissinger, the scholar-turned-politician-turned-sage has written extensively on his exchanges with Chinese leaders, spanning half a century from his first meeting with Zhou Enlai in 1971 up to his interactions with present leadership. Historians can however always look at the past with new research questions, or exploit previously overlooked material. There are nuggets of unknown to be found in the most known and visited historical episodes.The main research question Friedberg addresses through archival work is a strategic one: in the context of their newly concluded partnership with China, what would the United States have done in the case of a Sino-Soviet armed conflict? Looking at the archival record, Friedberg uncovers a striking proposal by Nixon and his national security adviser to provide ""some significant assistance"" and take ""whatever measures were necessary"" to prevent an attack on Chinese territory. Kissinger was seemingly serious in his overtures to the Chinese, which illustrate his taste for secret diplomatic channels and his realist, almost cynical mindset. But in the end, the Chinese responded evasively, and the easing of cold war relations put these plans on the shelf. Besides, as the author notes, ""whether or not Congress and the American public would have been willing to support such action is also open to question."" Contrary to Kissinger's secret schemes, ""ideological factors, disapproval of China's domestic political institutions, distrust of its totalitarian leaders, and sympathy for anti-Communist Taiwan helped prevent the formation of a true Sino-American strategic alliance during the closing decades of the Cold War.""But valuable as it is, historical storytelling is not the main contribution of A Contest for Supremacy. Turning to political science, the author tries to identify the strategic goals and long-term objectives of the current Chinese leadership, so as to explain their behavior and mode of interaction with the United States. Whereas he based his analysis of America's foreign policy on scholarly assessment and primary sources, he was not able to do the same for China, due in part to the language barrier, but most importantly because the decision proceedings of the Chinese state apparatus are not made public. Here the historian and the political scientist are limited to hypotheses and conjectures. There are many things that we do not know about China's foreign policy. As Wilson Churchill famously said about Russian diplomacy, it is ""a riddle, wrapped in a mystery, inside an enigma"". In other words, China's long-term objectives are unknown unknowns. We cannot know them for sure, due to the secretive and deceptive nature of the Chinese regime. We cannot even be sure of their existence, as Chinese leaders may disagree among themselves, or may not have reached decisive conclusions. Indeed, as the author notes, ""the current regime does not appear to have a universally shared definition of its preferred objective, a timetable for achieving it, or even a fully articulated strategy for doing so."" Finally, we cannot be sure that those hypothetical goals will remain as they are, as regime change may give rise to an entirely different paradigm.In light of all these complexities, any analysis of China's long-term objectives cannot help but rest on inference and speculation, and its conclusions should therefore be treated with appropriate skepticism. Bearing these caveats in mind, and to structure the research process, the author develops a three-pronged strategy. First, he bases his analysis on observed patterns of behavior: he recalls the initiatives and reactions of Chinese leaders to recent events, combined with what we know about the handling of international relations by ascending powers. In particular, he refers to Samuel Huntington's insight that since the start of the nineteenth century, all emergent great powers have behaved in a similarly assertive and often disruptive fashion, and to his prediction that China would most probably move in the same direction. Of course, as Friedberg is wont to note, ""just because other powers have acted in certain ways does not necessarily means that China will do the same."" But if the behavior of other countries in similar situations is any guide, there is good reason to expect that China's ambition will grow as its power expands.The second research strategy used by the author is done through a survey of the opinions and analysis expressed in a large sample of Chinese academic journals and periodicals, accessible in English translation through the Open Source Center, a US government website. These opinions are not taken at face value: they may not reflect the thinking of the Chinese leadership, or they may even have been formulated in order to misguide the public and to deceive foreign watchers. But here Friedberg submits his sample of texts to the sieve of a simple method of interpretation: if some of the arguments to be found in the open literature are hardly bland or reassuring, then there is reason to believe that ""even tougher, more aggressive (and possibly more influential) opinions are expressed within the confines of the Chinese system"". Similarly, provocative jokes or attempts at humor submitted by Chinese officials in the course of casual conversations may be more revealing than public speeches or repetitions of the official party line.The third strategy for interpreting Chinese goals and objectives is to use what we know about the Chinese way of thinking in a sparse and reasoned manner. Friedberg points out that ""China's leaders are the inheritors of a tradition of statecraft that has been in the making for thousands of years."" For him, this tradition is a known unknown: he does not pretend to have special insights into China's strategic thought as expressed in the Seven Military Classics or the Thirty-Six Stratagems. Nor does he refer to the ""Middle Kingdom"" mentality, the tributary system or other supposed remnants of China's imperial past that feature so prominently in Kissinger's recent book On China. In fact, we have no evidence that China's current leadership refer to such Weltanschauung or are directly influenced by it. Mao Zedong fancied himself as a scholar and read widely. Zhou Enlai liked to quote proverbs and write poetry. By contrast, China's contemporary leaders are engineers, and we may suppose they are too busy to read the classics or entertain cultural pursuits. But it would be equally preposterous to suppose that they are not influenced by what Friedberg describes as ""the deep accumulated bedrock of conservative Chinese realism"", or to assume that Chinese officials could be converted overnight to Western neo-liberal thinking. Quoting Friedberg: ""To believe that more, higher level talks will persuade Beijing to see things Washington's way, accept its rules, and follow its lead, even as China's power grows and its options expand, is either naive or condescending, and quite possibly both.""Usually academics working on international relations divide themselves between the two schools of neo-realism and neo-liberalism, with constructivism as a third emergent paradigm. Professor Friedberg does not fit nicely into this distinction. He is more preoccupied with ""hard power""--defined as ""the capacity to coerce, deter, defend and destroy""--than with the wishy-washy aspects of public diplomacy--although he pays due attention to ""soft power"" or the capacity to shape expectations and influence behavior. He has little patience for the arguments of the ""Shanghai Coalition"" (to use the derogatory expression of one former Sate Department official) who derive personal and professional benefits from promoting friendship with China. He is critical of the neo-liberal or constructivist argument stating that engaging China in international regimes and treating it as a ""responsible stakeholder"" could somehow nudge its leadership into a more conciliatory behavior on issues of nuclear proliferation, support of rogue states, or arms control. But he also distances himself from self-styled ""realists"" who assert that China's strategic objectives derive from its national interest irrespective of the nature of the regime, and that the interests of a democratic China would not be much different from those of today's authoritarian state. As we saw, the figure of Henry Kissinger, the archbishop of realpolitik, comes out severely bruised from the author's historical account.Aaron Friedberg subscribes to the formulation that ""stripped of its diplomatic niceties, the ultimate aim of the American strategy is to hasten a revolution, albeit a peaceful one, that will sweep away China's one party authoritarian state and leave a liberal democracy in its place."" Similarly, he posits that ""China seeks to displace the United States as the dominant player in Est Asia, and perhaps to extrude it from the region altogether, while at the same time avoiding a potentially disastrous direct confrontation."" In the long run, he believes that only one factor, the possible political liberalization of China, has the potential to push the relationship decisively toward a stable and lasting peace. Over a long-term horizon, he believes ""the United States can learn to live with a democratic China as he preponderant power in East Asia, much as Great Britain came to accept America as the dominant power in the Western Hemisphere."" But in the meanwhile, as regards US-China relations, ""things may get worse before they get better"".  As ""prudent planners hope for the best but prepare for the worst,"" the United States should revert to a more confrontational relation by adopting a policy of ""balanced engagement"" that sounds definitely more hawkish than the current one.Could Aaron Friedberg then be labeled a neoconservative? Several hints point toward this conclusion. He published his original essay on the strategic rivalry between China and the United States in Commentary, the arch-neocon journal of choice. His book comes with an endorsement by Robert Kagan, a prominent figure in the neoconservative constellation. Professor Friedberg shares with other neoconservatives several traits and sources of inspiration that can be traced back to Leo Strauss and to  Albert Wohlstetter, Paul Wolfowitz's professor at the University of Chicago. Among these traits, one can mention the sense of moral clarity that sheds light on political debates, the personal hostility to the figure of Henry Kissinger and to the realpolitik that he embodied, the talent for polemics and the tendency to play whack-a-mole with competing arguments, the knack for the definitive formula expressed with succinct aplomb, the notion that rivalry between great powers are rooted in ideological differences as much as in the stubborn realities of power politics, and the insistence that the nature of the regime defines the orientation of its foreign policy as well as its capacity for deception. But in the end, the author's arguments cannot be easily dismissed using invectives and labels, and categorizing Aaron Friedberg as a neocon adds little to the debate, as neoconservatism has never defined a scholarly posture.Finally, reading A Contest for Supremacy made me reassess the legacy of Samuel Huntington, the author of The Clash of Civilizations and the Remaking of the World Order, who passed away in 2002. I think that many misperceptions Huntington's thesis elicited was due to the fact that critics insisted on the first part of the book's title, pointing out that civilizations were not destined to clash and may not even exist as delineated by Huntington in the first place. But critics who took the pain to read the book mostly overlooked the other part of its title, which occupies a substantial part of the argument and which relates to the redefinition of the international order in a new post-cold war world. Huntington's book, published in 1996, also suffered from the proximity of the events of September 11, 2001, and of the ""global war on terrorism"" that ensued. In any case, Aaron Friedberg pays due tribute to Samuel Huntington and to another figure of the foreign policy establishment, Andrew W. Marshall, to both of whom the book is dedicated--as ""teachers, mentors, exemplars"". His hommage invites us to revisit the thesis of the remaking of the world order prophesized by Samuel Huntington, or at least to pay serious consideration to an argument which is more complex than the simplistic thesis of a clash of civilizations to which he has become identified. This will be the final ""unknown known"" pointed out by this book review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 4, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3N0A6830HF9ST/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0393068285#wasThisHelpful","R3N0A6830HF9ST","A3IKQVN8N8AKRY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3IKQVN8N8AKRY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There are few Japanese citizens who have gained international stature. Sadako Ogata is one of them. A former high commissioner for refugees who recently retired from her position as head of Japan's international cooperation agency, she achieved recognition through personal dedication and commitment, not through government sponsorship or patronage. She set an example for others to follow, especially for Japanese women who tend to have more international exposure than Japanese  men and who aspire to make a contribution to world peace and development. Sadako Ogata is not the typical Japanese woman as pictured by clichs and stereotypes. An independent woman with a dream of her own, she is the opposite of submissive, subservient, or subaltern. She gives a human face to the concept of human security that Japan has been promoting as a basis for humanitarian intervention and development assistance. When it comes to refugee protection, she talks the talk and walks the walk. She did not hesitate to make her opinions known to her boss, the UN secretary-general, or to challenge the policy stance of senior members of the UN Security Council, including the US.Mrs Ogata's career is a testimony to the effectiveness of women empowerment through affirmative action. She set foot on the first step of the UN ladder thanks to a government policy negotiated with women's organizations at the time of Japan's entry into the United Nations in 1956. Japan's delegation to the UN General Assembly was to include a woman, and she was drawn to the position from her career in academia when there was an opening in 1968. Later on, and after several postings in the UN system, she became Japan's candidate to the seat of UN high commissioner for refugees, no doubt partly because the Japanese government thought that presenting a woman would increase its chance to win the job over fierce competition. The fact that Japan was a big financial contributor to the UN system also gave weight to her candidature. But Sadako Ogata made sure she never became a woman alibi or a pawn in Japan's campaign for international recognition. She proved by example that a woman could be as hard working, strong willing, and straight talking as a man in a world dominated by big egos and power brokers. In her effort to protect refugees everywhere, she made efforts to keep an equal stand between all actors and to constructively engage host countries, including nationalist Serbia and islamist Iran. And her personal recommendation to the Japanese government was not to limit itself to checkbook diplomacy but to provide boots on the ground, as when a contingent of Japanese self-defense forces was dispatched to eastern Zaire in 1994 to alleviate the Rwandan refugee crisis.Mrs Ogata began her tenure at UNHCR in February 1991, in the midst of the first Gulf war. She terminated it in December 2000 with a sense of mission accomplished, although by its nature her business could only be left unfinished. On her fourth week in the job, she had to face three emergency situations. There was a sudden increase in the number of Kurdish refugees fleeing to Iran and Turkey; Ethiopians and Somalis were suddenly put on the move by an approaching famine and internal strife in Somalia; and large numbers of Albanians on boats crossed the Adriatic sea to Italy. This flurry of activity only set the stage for the following decade: the ten years that she spent with refugees marked a period of continuous humanitarian crisis. In her memoirs, published in 2005, Mrs Ogata focuses on four such crisis situations: the Kurdish exodus and repatriation in northern Iraq; the difficult task of protecting refugees in the Balkan wars; the intertwined tragedies of the Great Lakes region in Africa; and the long-standing issue of Afghan refugees, which remained her biggest unfinished work as high commissioner. In each case study, she addresses the strategic interests of the main players involved; the changing procedures of refugee protection; the expanding partnership with the military and with development agencies who were not used to work with humanitarian actors; and the challenge of repatriation, reintegration and reconstruction in the context of post-conflict state building.The Kurdish refugee crisis that affected northern Iraq and its neighbors in the aftermath of the Gulf war set the stage for the post-cold war period of the 1990s and led to many new developments in refugee protection operations. Televised images of desperate Kurds fleeing persecution by entering the Iraqi-Kurdish mountain range rallied international public opinion and pressed coalition governments for quick action. Their solution was to bring back the Kurds from the border mountains in Turkey to the plateau of northern Iraq and to establish a safe haven of refugee camps inside their country, a policy backed by a UN Security Council resolution and acquiesced by the Iraqi government, who preferred a UN presence to the prolonged stationing of coalition forces. The operation represented a major deviation from the traditional practice of ensuring refugee protection in countries of asylum, blurring the distinction between refugees and internally displaced persons. It occasioned the start of military involvement in humanitarian emergencies, with varying implications that required careful scrutiny. It added the concepts of safe havens and secure corridors to the humanitarian toolbox. And it concluded with a massive repatriation campaign orchestrated by UNHCR that was unprecedented in scale and scope.Underlying the success of the Kurdish refugees operation was an alignment in the strategic orientation of coalition forces, neighboring countries, Iraqi authorities, and the refugees themselves, who all shared the need to find practical solutions while preserving their interests. By contrast, in the humanitarian crisis situations that evolved in the Balkans and in the Great Lakes region of Africa, no comparable strategic action emerged on the basis of the convergence of interest among various contenders. In Bosnia, UNHCR was virtually left alone to lead the massive humanitarian intervention, serving as a ""fig leaf"" to cover the reality of strategic inaction. It was forced to condone the policy of ethnic cleansing that forced people to turn into refugees. The UN was seen by Serbian leaders as partial to the conflict, and UN personnels were the target of harassment, arbitrary arrest, or worse. The Srebrenica enclave made a mockery of the concept of safe areas when its inhabitants were crushed by Serbian forces right in front of hapless UN soldiers. The repatriation campaign was unable to reverse the policy of ethnic cleansing, as refugees returned only in areas dominated by their ethnicity and very few minority returns occurred. Again, UNHCR broke new ground with the design of reconciliation and community-building projects, such as interentity bus lines, priority assistance to municipalities committed to a policy of open cities, women's job training, and ""imagine coexistence"" workshops in divided communities.Compared to the Balkan drama, the internal wars and cross-border conflicts in the Great Lakes region have the character of a tragedy of gigantic proportion. UN's failure to act during the Rwandan genocide and the protection extended to Hutu criminals afterward left the new authorities in Kigali with a profound sense of betrayal and mistrust toward the international community. Following the Gersony report that exposed cases of human right abuse by the RPF, Rwanda's president Bizimungu accused UNHCR staff of ""a malicious campaign to stop refugees from returning"" and suggested humanitarian actors had ""private interests"" to protect their jobs by keeping refugees in the camps. Within these camps, political leaders and Hutu militias that had perpetrated genocide killings recreated administrative structures, levied tax to fund their attacks against Rwandese territory, and prevented refugees from returning home. Two influential NGOs withdrew from the camps in protest of their militarization. War eventually spread in former Zaire and refugees were dispersed, some of them returning, others fleeing farther west into Zaire or in neighboring countries. The human toll was enormous, estimates of the ""missing refugees"" population being itself subject to an absurd number game. UN's search and rescue operation for the lost refugees was distracted by ""search and destroy"" attacks by Kabila-led Alliance forces whenever Hutu refugees came out of their hiding in the forest. The transition from war to peace proved elusive, and the constant flow of refugees, militias and armies permanently destroyed the fragile ethnic mix in the region.During its long period of war and oppression, Afghanistan produced the largest and the longest refugee exodus in the world. Before the September 11 attacks brought the Taliban's regime to international opinion's attention, Afghanistan was a forgotten country, and its refugees dependent on continued UNHCR support. The Taliban themselves were largely a product of refugee status, many of them raised and indoctrinated in Pakistan's border region before their successful military campaign against corrupt warlords. Sadako Ogata did not hesitate to dialogue with Taliban leaders in order to find solutions to the refugee problem. As she notes, ""I had learned that historically major political concessions resulted from bringing to the negotiating table hard-line leaders belonging to bad regimes."" She continued to deal with Afghanistan after she left UNHCR in 2000 and was appointed as Japan's special representative on Afghan reconstruction. In recognition of her leadership, the comprehensive area development program sponsored by Japan became identified as the Ogata Initiative.The UNHCR's core mission is to provide effective protection to refugees and find durable solutions to their problems. But as Mrs Ogata insisted time and again in various settings and to diverse publics, ""there are no humanitarian solutions to humanitarian problems."" To be more specific, humanitarian problems might be best addressed by humanitarian action, but it could not substitute for the necessary exercise of political will to solve the underlying causes of the conflicts. For the sake of refugee protection, Mrs Ogata was ready to walk the extra mile and she did not refrain from doing what others were not ready or not prepared to do. But she also expected other major actors to play their part and not dodge over their duties. In particular, she held the UN Security Council and its members accountable for their key duty to provide peace and security. As humanitarian problems became legitimate political issues, the Security Council invited her twice every year when the situation in the Balkans and of the Great Lakes region gained central attention in world politics. She also held regular consultations with the White House, the State Department, and Congress over issues of pressing concern. She recalls insisting to Secretary Albright that what UNHCR and the world needed was an 800 telephone number that would respond immediately to requests for dealing with crises.In the course of her duties, Sadako Ogata relied on a cadre of able UN workers and interacted with prominent individuals from various countries. They are not portrayed in detail, but their names and deeds are worth remembering. UN officials include Sergio Vieira de Mello, then assistant high commissioner, whose tragic death as UN representative in Iraq was a huge setback in the reconstruction process; Lakhdar Brahimi, UN special representative for Afghanistan, whose report on peace operations was strongly welcomed by the humanitarian community; Sadruddin Aga Khan and Thorvald Stoltenberg, two predecessors in the high commissioner position who remained active throughout the period; and Soren Petersen-Jessen and Filippo Grandi, Mrs Ogata's two successive chefs de cabinet. World leaders and government ministers that she met regularly are too numerous to recall. But special mention should be given to Ashraf Ghani, the American-educated development economist with World Bank experience who led donor coordination and reconstruction efforts in Afghanistan; and Aloysi Inyumba, the young and resourceful minister for women who later chaired the Rwandan commission on national unity and reconciliation. As Mrs Ogata recalls in her farewell speech to UNHCR, friends that you meet in difficult times are friends for life, and she did indeed develop exceptional friendships along her bumpy road as high commissioner for refugees.Finally, I would be remiss if I did not mention minor squibbles I have with some parts in the book. The first is the way she depicts France's role before, during and after the Rwandan genocide, still a sensitive issue in my country of birth and residence. I don't mean to imply that France doesn't bear a share of responsibility in the tragic course of events that led to the slaughtering of 800 000 innocent people. But to depict, as she does, France's involvement in the Great lakes region as a result of a proxy rivalry with Anglo-saxon countries, or to pinpoint France's support of Mobutu's Zaire while ignoring the involvement of other powers, seems to me a little simplistic. The second reservation I have has to do with the mostly uncritical, even laudatory stance adopted toward the US. This is in part due to the time period under consideration: obviously Mrs Ogata bears more sympathy with Bill Clinton's internationalist stance than with the going it alone course that George W. Bush was to take in the following decade. There may also be a personal equation at play: Mrs Ogata spent time in the US as a child following her father's diplomatic posting in Washington, DC, and she later went on to study at Georgetown and at UC Berkeley. She is obviously at ease mingling with US leaders or academics. But the US did not always fulfill its role as a protector of refugees, and its support to the UN system was always more lukewarm than the multilateralist policy adopted by Japan and by European countries like France, Germany or the UK.The third, more general critique I might formulate stems from her depiction of the US as a benevolent hegemon. The last decade of the twentieth century may well be remembered as the time when the world turned multipolar. But other great powers such as China, India, Brazil, or South Africa, not to mention the European Union, are largely absent from the narrative. By contrast, Japan gets a positive if only secondary role, and Sadako Ogata gives a useful account of some aspects of its foreign policy. Whether due to her power to influence decision-makers in her country of origin, her role as a spokesperson for Japan's international role, or simply the congruence of interests and values between herself and officials in Tokyo, Japanese government initiatives often seemed aligned with those of the high commissioner for refugees, and Japan did indeed play an active role in humanitarian issues. Japan's international contribution to world peace and development assistance in a multipolar world might inspire and encourage other powers with similar roles and ambitions, such as Canada, Australia, Brazil or South Africa; and Sadako Ogata's personal example as an independent and committed woman may set a role model for other women to follow.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 4, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1079L0F76TR2X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0393929221#wasThisHelpful","R1079L0F76TR2X","A3IKQVN8N8AKRY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3IKQVN8N8AKRY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""In the past decade, notes Zizek in his introduction to Organs Without Bodies, Deleuze emerged as the central reference of contemporary philosophy: notions like 'resisting multitude,' 'nomadic subjectivity,' the 'anti-Oedipal' critique of psychoanalysis, and so on are the common currency of today's academia--not to mention the fact that Deleuze more and more serves as the theoretical foundation of today's anti-globalist Left and its resistance to capitalism."" The paradoxical result of such Deleuzianism is that ""while masquerading as radical chic, [it] effectively transforms Deleuze into an ideologist of today's 'digital capitalism'.""For Zizek, ""there is another Deleuze, much closer to psychoanalysis and Hegel, a Deleuze whose consequences are much more shattering."" The proper Deleuze is that of the great early monographs, the key ones being Difference and Repetition and The Logic of Sense, as well as his later two-volume study on cinema. This series of works is to be distinguished from the books Deleuze and Guattari cowrote, A Thousand Plateaus, Anti-Oedipus and What Is Philosophy?, which dominate Deleuze's reception in English-speaking academe and present a sanitized, politically correct version of his philosophy. For Zizek, this political Deleuze is a fake, not least because of his rejection of Freud and Lacan: ""What Deleuze presents as 'Oedipus' is a rather ridiculous simplification, if not an outright falsification, of Lacan's position."" Deleuze and Guattari's criticism of fascism also ""indulge in a true interpretive delirium of hasty generalizations"". In denouncing ""the fascism in us all, in our heads and in our everyday behavior"", to quote Foucault's famous preface to Anti-Oedipus, they ""distract us from the positivity of fascism's actual ideological functioning, which is one of superego obscene enjoyment"".For Zizek, saving Deleuze from himself involves distancing Deleuze from the pernicious influence of Felix Guattari, and emphasizing what, in himself, is more than himself: ""What we are reproaching Deleuze is that he is not Deleuzian enough."" Paradoxically, while the ""guattarized"" Deleuze immediately lends himself to political interpretations, the ""true"" Deleuze is indifferent to politics. Whereas the ontology of productive Becoming that characterize the first Deleuze ""clearly leads to the Leftist topic of the self-organization of the multitude of molecular groups that resist and undermine the molar, totalizing system of power,"" the other ontology, that of the sterility of the Sense-Event, appears ""apolitical"". ""However, asks Zizek, what if this other ontology also involves a political logic and practice of its own, of which Deleuze himself was unaware? What if there is another Deleuzian politics to be discovered here?"" And ""What if the domain of politics is inherently `sterile', the domain of pseudo causes, a theater of shadows, but nonetheless crucial in transforming reality?""There are basically two ways to uncover this Deleuzian Deleuze and to bring to the fore the radical potential of his (non-)politics. The first is to repeat Deleuze, following the paradox that ""something truly new can only emerge through repetition"". What is to be repeated is not the letter of Deleuze, remaining within the horizon of his conceptual field, but his 'spirit', the creative impulse that he himself betrayed by not being ""Deleuzian enough"". For Zizek, ""It is not only that one can remain really faithful to an author by way of betraying him (the actual letter of his thought); at a more radical level, the inverse statement holds even more, namely, one can only truly betray an author by way of repeating him, by way of remaining faithful to the core of his thought"".The second way to remain faithful to Deleuze through betraying him is to read Deleuze through Hegel and Lacan. No matter that Deleuze explicitly rejected Hegel and found many things to criticize in Freud's legacy as revived by Lacan. For Zizek, Deleuze's injunction to ""forget Hegel"" conceals a disavowed affinity. Deleuze perceives Hegel as the philosopher who `filled in' the gaps of the Kantian system and passed from Kant's openness and indeterminacy to the notion's complete actualization. ""What, however, if Hegel does not add any positive content to Kant, does not fill in the gaps--what if he just accomplishes a shift of perspective in and through which the problem already appears as its own solution?"" This is, according to Zizek, the true meaning of the Hegelian reconciliation: ""It is not that the tension is magically resolved and the opposites are reconciled. The only shift that effectively occurs is subjective, the shift of our perspective (i.e., all of a sudden, we become aware that what previously appeared as conflict already is reconciliation).""I have only a faint acquaintance with Deleuze, and politically I find myself at great odds with Zizek's forays into social critique. There are statements in the book which are meant to shock or provoke the reader and which I found unnecessarily distasteful and outrageous. But reading Organs Without Body was an instructive experience on how to interpret an author through the lenses of another. I hope to be able to come to Deleuze with a fresh angle.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 15, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2F9MZA81R48B9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0415519047#wasThisHelpful","R2F9MZA81R48B9","A3IKQVN8N8AKRY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3IKQVN8N8AKRY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Elisabeth Roudinesco is the self-proclaimed guardian of the psychoanalytic temple in France. She patrols the Freudian field, and falls down on any intruder who trespasses without authorization. She uses anathema to disparage those who cast a doubt on the therapeutic effects of psychoanalysis, or point toward the inconsistencies of some of Freud's interpreters. Attempts to submit psychiatric treatment to the rigorous tests of scientific evaluation are dismissed as a ploy waved by big pharma firms in cahoots with the medical establishment and bent on transforming free-thinking individuals into submissive consumers. Those who stand at the other end of the intellectual spectrum are the targets of personal attacks: they are said to develop a ""philosophy of submission,"" an ""ideology of expertise,"" and to be motivated by hatred, jealousy, and resentment.For her, Freud was a radical thinker whose revolutionary potential was fully revealed only when his thought was combined with the Marxist tradition and transformed into a powerful mix turned toward contestation and subversion. France was the country where this combination between Marx and Freud took place, and the philosophers who stood at the vanguard of this conjunction are the heroes of Philosophy in Turbulent Times. Canguilhem, Sartre, Foucault, Althusser, Deleuze, and Derrida: they have few things in common, except perhaps their support for various left-wing causes and their personal involvement with psychic disorders and psychoanalysis. They do not really form a generation: the first two reached intellectual maturity before the war, whereas the others were mostly active in the tumultuous decades of the sixties and seventies. Roudinesco's privilege was to know most of them on a personal basis--as student, colleague, commentator, or fan. Her specific angle is to connect them to the Freudian legacy, providing a fresh perspective on aspects of their doctrines or lives that are usually overlooked by critics and biographers.Georges Canguilhem, the first figure, is the less well known of the six philosophers, but his influence on French postwar thinking was pervasive. A philosopher of science, he wrote a hefty volume on The Normal and the Pathological, containing famous nuggets that are often quoted in isolation: ""Action is always the daughter of rigor before being the sister of the dream;"" ""Pathological phenomena are identical to normal ones, with only a quantifiable variation of degree;"" ""It is the abnormal which arouses theoretical interest in the normal. Norms are recognized as such only through infractions;"" ""Physiology is the science of the stabilized forms of life;"" ""Mathematics are the sensible form of a conscious dream."" Canguilhem is also the author of a moving eulogy of his friend Jean Cavailles, whose death in the hands of the Nazis interrupted a promising debut in the same discipline.Himself a resistant, Canguilhem notes that philosophers who put at the center of their system the abstract notions of the concept, of knowledge and of structure, paid the heaviest price in the fight against totalitarianism during Nazi occupation, whereas the philosophers of existence and the subject, despite all their talk about political engagement, were passive bystanders during the same period. The reception of Husserl's phenomenology in France cuts across this divide between a philosophy of the subject, popularized by existentialism, and a philosophy of the concept, with figures like Canguilhem and Koyre. For Canguilhem, as well as for his student Michel Foucault, there is an internal coherence between the fight for freedom and the philosophy of the concept: both are unconditional commitments and aim at the establishment of a superior order, for which one must be ready to pay the price.Sartre is the intellectual giant of France's twentieth century, the towering figure who ruled over at least three generations of philosopher apprentices and who defined the figure of the committed intellectual. His contributions to philosophy, to literary criticism, to the novel and to theater won him huge popular success and lasting fame. Less well known is the fact that he wrote a script for a movie on Sigmund Freud that was to de directed by John Huston and to feature Marilyn Monroe. The manuscript, published posthumously, gives Roudinesco the opportunity to survey Sartre's complex relation to Freud and to psychoanalysis. This relation went through different phases. First, Sartre categorically rejected the Freudian conception of the unconscious and put in its place the notion of individual freedom, of intentionality, and of bad faith. In the same vein, he rejected Freudian therapy in favour of an ""existential"" psychoanalysis that would place at its center the radical singularity of a consciousness free of any determinant. He later applied this method of analysis to himself in his autobiographical The Words (""I have no Superego"") and to Flaubert in his monumental The Family Idiot (""Madame Bovary, c'est moi""). Sartre then had a radical period when he espoused Freudo-Marxism. The two disciplines were seen as tools for emancipation and radical change--changing the self, changing society. Dialectic materialism on one side and psychoanalysis on the other could connect in the figure of the revolutionary hero, who sacrificed the self to the collective.The movie script on Sigmund Freud that Sartre wrote in 1958 was only published after his death, but it shows yet another turn in Sartre's interpretation of Freud. In fin-de-sicle Vienna, young women suffering from hysteria, such as Anna O., were blaming their father or other adults for having sexually abused them. These repressed memories of past traumas resurfaced when they were put on the couch of the analyst. For Freud, this simply couldn't be true: the unconscious was here at work, with its complex mechanisms of phantasm, of projection and of transference. In his script, Sartre focuses on this moment when Freud solves the enigma of hysteria's sexual origin. The sexual causes of trauma are real, but they did not need to have happened, for they belong to another scene that parallels reality with the logic of dreams and imagination. Anna O., the hysterical woman to whom Freud owes his discovery, was to be played by Marilyn Monroe. But the actress, under the influence of doctors and pills, refused the role and sank into depression. And the movie as imagined by Sartre never saw the day: his collaboration with John Houston ended abruptly after a dramatic confrontation at the moviemaker's home in Ireland. But the clash of egos between the two giants, the American director and the French thinker, provides a fascinating tale of cultural chasm that could itself be made into a movie.If Sartre was the embodiment of the universal intellectual, Michel Foucault claimed for himself the role of the specific intellectual, intervening in targeted domains and points of concentration where knowledge and power are shaping new forms of social struggles: the hospital, the asylum, the prison, the university, the feminist movement, minority rights, etc. Madness and Civilization, which was first published in 1961, was Foucault's first major work and it eloquently and stylishly established the main themes of his later works: power, knowledge, confinement, and the genealogical method. Foucault's sense of timing was impeccable: the political winds of change were just then starting to evince a tectonic shift of philosophical and critical thought. The deconstruction of the notion of mental illness and the contestation of the normalizing powers of psychiatry met with the positions of the antipsychiatry movement, which was experimenting new forms of therapy inspired in part by Sartre's existentialism.Born out of a doctoral dissertation Foucault drafted while teaching French in Uppsala, drawing from the rich collection of French medical treatises and archives that were stocked in the library, Madness and Civilization was not a conventional history nor a philosophical essay in the classic form. Needless to say, it infuriated both professions. Historians pointed out some shortcomings and errors of interpretation, and were challenged to produce alternative histories of the birth of psychiatry. While recognizing the importance of Foucault's intellectual breakthrough, philosophers accused Foucault of romanticizing madness and of debasing the ideals of the Enlightenment. The gist of their critiques was that the book represented more the values and concerns of Foucault than an accurate and responsible history of mental illness.Donning the armour of the avenger, Elisabeth Roudinesco sets out to defend her hero against personal attacks and historical revisionism. Alain Renaut and Luc Ferry's vitriolic charge against ""la pense 1968"" (the French version of radical chic and political correctness) is dismissed as a reactionary tract. The carefully researched book by Swain and Gauchet on the birth of the mental institution is rejected as a symbol of ""a complete absence of thinking"". Roudinesco considers that the hatred and vicious attacks against Foucault were motivated by the philosopher's unconventional lifestyle. To undermine criticism, she exaggerates the accusations that were waged against him. Was Foucault really accused of being a ""Nazi, nihilist, antidemocratic, and islamist""? Has he really been considered by any critic as ""the most infamous and perverted thinker of the second half of the twentieth century""? Roudinesco's blinding admiration for Foucault makes her reject any attempt to engage critically with his work. Like Sartre's Saint Genet, her Foucault is a modern martyr whose golden legend should be revered and placed on an unassailable sacred ground.Roudinesco confesses that she never met with Michel Foucault and that she only admired him from a distance. By contrast, she had close contacts with the three remaining figures in her gallery of intellectual heroes. She received frequent visits from Louis Althusser at the time the Marxist philosopher was suffering from heavy mental stress, and she continued to see him regularly after the personal tragedy that transformed him into a living dead. She attended Deleuze's seminar after 1968 at the time of the drafting of Anti-Oedipus, whose iconoclastic content was partly shaped by the atmosphere of classroom discussions. She benefited from Jacques Derrida's friendship for close to twenty years, and addresses him a moving farewell by discussing the eulogies and obituaries he wrote for various members of his generation. But she lacks Derrida's gentle irony and generosity that used to disarm even his staunchest critics. There is no denying that Derrida and the other philosophers discussed in this book were often the object of vicious and personal attacks. But they do not need hagiography or counter-attacks to protect their memory against trespassers. Their best line of defense lies in their works, which will remain long after Roudinesco's Philosophy in Turbulent Times will have fallen into oblivion.","2.0 out of 5 stars","July 2, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R136LGDBQF6IWX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=023114301X#wasThisHelpful","R136LGDBQF6IWX","A3IKQVN8N8AKRY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3IKQVN8N8AKRY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Louis Dumont is well known for his anthropological work on India, but less so for his political thought or for his contribution to the history of ideas. Yet I would argue that his main intellectual breakthrough, and the value of his legacy, lies more in political philosophy than in anthropology or Indian studies. Indeed, after the publication of Homo Hierarchicus in 1967, Dumont moved away from Indian ethnography, and suspended all reference to fieldwork. Instead, he decided to devote himself fully to what he called an ""anthropological perspective"" on modern ideology, building on the opposition between holistic and individualistic societies.In his Essays on Individualism, first published in French in 1983, Dumont traces the path leading from the ""individual-out-of-the-world"" found in early philosophy and Christianity to the ""individual-in-the-world"" affirmed from the Reformation onward. This collection of articles, written between 1952 and 1983, also presents in concise format some of the ideas he developed in full book form: the origin of the category of the economy and its autonomization from the realm of politics, as analyzed in From Mandeville to Marx (1977), and the contrast between the French and the German forms of individualism, as found in The German Ideology (1991).It has sometimes been asked whether Dumont's work on Western individualism still counts as anthropology and not just as history of ideas. Louis Dumont is sometimes classified along with Karl Polanyi, who wrote The Great Transformation in 1944, or with the French critic Marcel Gauchet, whose work on political liberalism revivified a Tocquevillian tradition in France. Indeed, Dumont is closer to these authors than to, for instance, Claude Lvi-Strauss, Roger Bastide or Georges Balandier, three prominent figures of postwar French anthropology. As Dumont recognizes in the introduction, Essays on Individualism straddles ""the academic distance between on one side anthropology as a specialty within social science, and, on the other, the history of ideas--or rather the intellectual history of our modern civilization.""Louis Dumont puts his research in the continuity of the French sociological tradition as embodied by Emile Durkheim and his nephew Marcel Mauss. He devotes an essay to the later--his teacher, his mentor, his model. Mauss was ""an encyclopedic scholar (...) keeping contact with history, with psychology, with philosophy, with geography."" This, together with his respect for facts, probably explains why he published relatively little: ""he had too many ideas to express any one of them in detail."" Mauss never published a book, but only articles, some of them extensive; almost all of them were written in collaboration with another scholar. He published annually detailed reviews of all publications of any importance published in Europe and the United States: ""Every work reviewed is summarized with great care before being praised, criticized, corrected, or supplemented.""Marcel Mauss was foremost a scholar, but a scholar who never lost interest in what was happening around him.  Through his writings, his teachings, and his political action, he found himself at the center of the intellectual and political life of his country and of Europe--in the ""witch's cauldron,"" to use his expression. Dumont applies to him the remark that the later made about one of his coauthors, Robert Hertz: ""He was not only a philosopher but a scientist."" Even though he never did fieldwork, Mauss was mindful of reality and familiar with all the ethnological research. He did not have to travel far: ""for he had been round the world without leaving his armchair."" Less indulgent, Charles Pguy derided Marcel Mauss as ""a box of index cards"" and contested the pretense to science of the Durkheimian school of sociology.Mauss's ambition was to make ""a catalogue of categories"", or rather to write ""the social history of the categories of the human mind"". He did this most famously for the act of giving in his ""Essai sur le don"", but also for the idea of the person, for bodily techniques, or for the distinction between right and left. For even basic human categories are sociological facts: they have a history, and they differ across cultures. Comparing our basic notions with their equivalent in nonmodern societies put these categories in perspective, and help us understand our world better. Anthropological concepts grow out of a contradiction between our modern notions and nonmodern categories, out of a clash between the theory and the data. We tend to think of the gift as an act of pure generosity, but observation tells us that every present calls for a counter-present, and that something has to be given back.By claiming Mauss's legacy, Dumont intends to treat a single category as a total social fact: individualism, and its obverse, holism, are the basic opposition through which Dumont intends to define the singularity of modern society. The opposition between individualism and holism operates at two distinct levels. At the level of ideology, modern societies hold the individual as the supreme value, whereas nonmodern societies subordinates the individual to the group. One can therefore speak of individualistic or of holistic societies, even though the individual and the group obviously coexist in all societies. If individualism is to appear in a society where the group is of paramount value, it will be in opposition to society, and as a kind of supplement to it. In holistic societies, individualism takes the form of the outwardly individual: in early Christianity or in India, to become a sage one must first renounce the world. Conversely, where the individual is the supreme value, any pretense to return to holism at the level of the community or the nation is revealed as an enterprise of fallacy and oppression. Holistic ideologies developed by totalitarian states contradict the underlying individualistic values, and can only be imposed by way of force or deception.At the level of science, a comparative sociology that takes as its object a nonmodern society is necessarily holistic. Methodological holism imposes itself when one studies a society or a culture as a whole: the group is distinct from the sum of its parts. In fact, every time we confront a foreign society, the holistic approach is called for, and the ethnologist or anthropologist must use the same tools to analyze his own society against the background of another. This methodological holism is distinct from holistic ideology developed by totalitarian regimes; but it also goes against the grain of the individualistic ideology to which the social scientist is exposed and that he recognizes as the supreme value. He should therefore agree to distinguish between his absolute convictions and his specialized activity as an anthropologist. Here Louis Dumont proposes a solution to a long-lasting debate within French social science between the Durkheimian school and the proponents of a Weberian approach to social facts.Dumont's distinct contribution is to analyze the opposition between the individual and the group as a hierarchy between two distinct elements, each of which encompassing the other when taken from a certain perspective. The relation between the individual and the group is hierarchical, and a different relation means a different place in the hierarchy. As its most basic formula, hierarchical opposition can be presented by the following: ""Let us suppose that our society and the society under study both show in their system of ideas the same two elements A and B. That one society should subordinate A to B and the other B to A is enough for considerable differences to occur in all their conceptions."" When we study holistic societies, we must adopt a methodology that recognizes the submission of the individual to the whole, but we must also reject the exclusivism or absolute sociocentrism that accompanies every holistic ideology.Hierarchical opposition is the encompassing of the contrary and can be found in many domains. Writes Dumont: ""In matters of religion, the priest is superior to the king or emperor to whom public order is entrusted. But ipso facto the priest will obey the king in matters of public order, that is, in subordinate matters."" Priests are therefore superior to kings, for they are inferior only on an inferior level. In the economic field, Karl Polanyi describes the progressive emancipation of economics from politics and moral science. Economics now tends to encompass all social aspects, leaving nothing outside its purview. But Polanyi also tells us that the economy is embedded in the social fabric, and that it is only we, the modern, who have isolated it into a different system. When it comes to spatial orientation, as in the Kabyle house described by Pierre Bourdieu, the left is generally subject to the right, as it is with bodily coordination. But the reference to the body as a whole, to which right and left hand belong, is constitutive to the right, the left, and their distinction.As I mentioned by way of introduction, Dumont has few heirs in the anthropological field. Those who wish to draw inspiration from Marcel Mauss go directly to the source, or pass through the structuralist interpretation given by Lvi-Strauss. The French school of anthropology is shrinking fast, along with French presence in Subsaharan Africa, and there never was an Indianist school to speak of. Dumont described anthropology as ""a science in progress of becoming,"" and he complained that ""the conceptual apparatus at our disposal is far from meeting the exigencies of a genuine social anthropology."" But if anything, anthropology in France has gone into reverse since these lines were written, and it is now a science in progress of vanishing.Meanwhile, French philosophers have been more ready to engage with Dumont's work. Vincent Descombes has stated his indebtedness to the French Indianist and followed in his footsteps to develop a comparative anthropology of modernity. Without always acknowledging his debt, Alain Finkielkraut has picked up Dumont's distinction between the individualism of equality, predominant in France, and the individualism of singularity, as expressed in the German tradition of Bildung. Dumont would have preferred to be considered ""not only as a philosopher but as a scientist,"" to follow his model Marcel Mauss. But the science of man to which he contributed has reached a dead end, and no longer offers directions for us moderns.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 24, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1T74OLO39AU4R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0226169588#wasThisHelpful","R1T74OLO39AU4R","A3IKQVN8N8AKRY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3IKQVN8N8AKRY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There was a change in the perception of literature's social role in Japan between the Taish and the Shwa periods. According to Maruyama Masao, Japan's foremost postwar critic, the average parent and teacher at the end of the Taish era thought that ""a middle school student who spent all his time reading novels was doing one of two things: avoiding his studies or corrupting his morals."" Progressively however, reading literature became a more respectable cultural pursuit, tolerated and even encouraged by schools and families. The social status of writers and the novel improved markedly: they became embodiments of the national spirit, and symbols of Japan's entry into modernity. The possession of a national literature became a point of pride for citizens who wanted to see Japan ranked among the greatest nations of the world. A mass market for literary productions turned writing from an insecure occupation into a potential source of wealth, and transformed select authors into celebrities.Although many factors influenced the shift in the general public's perception of literature's value, one cause had a disproportionate influence: the publication, between 1926 and 1931, of the Complete Works of Contemporary Japanese Literature (gendai nihon bungaku zensh). The series marked a watershed in the production, reception, dissemination, and preservation of modern Japanese literature. Thanks to its reasonably low price--only one yen per volume--, the series reached a much wider audience than the traditional readership of modern literary texts, clustered around Tokyo's literary circles and coterie magazines. For many readers, the series was the first access they had to actual literary texts assembled systematically into a cultural entity known as modern Japaness literature. In many ways, the series created and defined the very entity it purported to describe. The anthology brought Japanese modern literature to the home of ordinary Japanese: it became a familiar presence, and the bookcase offered to customers who completed the entire series was used as a decorative piece of furniture in many living rooms.Maruyama Masao describes the impact that the publication of this series, as well as other ""one-yen book"" anthologies, had on young students of his generation: ""Whenever the latest volume of the series arrived, everyone was talking about it, even during recess at school (...) That might have been the case only because it was a middle school in a large city. Still, it was the case for everyone--not just students--that, whether you had read them or not, you had to at least know the names of famous Japanese and world authors and their works."" Many writers from the early Shwa period confessed the central role the collection played in their early literary education. One publishing historian wrote: ""literary anthologies were the fundamental materials through which world and national literatures--centered on the novel--were systematically absorbed in Japan."" As an example, Victor Hugo's Les Miserables was published in the first volumes of the Anthology of World Literature, and became widely known through the translation by Toyoshima Yoshio under the title ""aa muj"" (Ah, No Mercy).Advertising was central to this commercial enterprise. In addition to posters, leaflets and banners, the publisher sponsored nationwide lecture tours in which prominent writers were mobilized. Akutagawa Rynosuke was quoted as complaining that he ""had been made to stand before the audiences in place of a billboard."" The exhaustion from his tour may well have hastened his mental and emotional collapse that led him to commit suicide in 1925. Akutagawa's reputation, bolstered by his inclusion in the anthology, was strengthened further when a critic established in 1935 the Akutagawa Prize in recognition of a major work of literature published during the year by a Japanese novelist.The promoters of the series were also interested in the ""noise"" (zawameki) of the period, not just by a narrow band of highly polished literary productions. Their anthology included minor genres such as juvenile literature or travel essays, as well as texts not usually classified as literature, such as newspaper columns or ""domestic fiction"". But by the finite nature of the list of published authors, the anthology created a ""static canon"", a closed shop of consecrated authors and works. The act of creating such a series demanded a ranking of writers, a banzuke as in a sumo tournament, even when the head editors were consciously trying to create as inclusive a collection as possible. Minor authors were consecrated, and prominent ones were left out. The choice of published material often had more to do with the ease of negotiating copyright or other extraliterary factors than the simple consideration of their literary value. Even when literary considerations came into play, they were more often inspired by whim and fashion, or by personal likings and dislikes, than by objective factors and rational arguments.The influence of the Complete Works of Contemporary Japanese Literature was not limited to the Japanese territory. Immigrants to Brazil or to the US took the volumes with them so as to keep a connexion with the homeland's national culture. The one-yen book series also sold well in the colonies and in the territories under Japanese influence. Uchiyama Shoten, a Japanese bookstore in Shanghai that opened in 1920, was a popular spot not only for Japanese expatriates but also for Chinese intellectuals such as Lu Xun, who had lived in Japan as a foreign student before becoming a figure of the May Fourth Movement. The poet Kaneko Mitsuharu, who lived in Shanghai in 1928 before moving to France, wrote that Uchiyama Shoten was the ""teat from which Chinese received their intellectual nourishment."" In Korea, even before the Japanese imposed a strict policy of forced assimilation, some Korean intellectuals were drawn to the model of expression offered by modern Japanese literature, and chose to write in Japanese instead of in their national language.The history of Japan's most popular prewar anthology forms only one chapter of Edward Mack's Manufacturing Modern Japanese Literature. Other chapters include the consequences of Tokyo's 1923 earthquake over the publishing industry; the literary debates by which Tokyo intellectuals struggled to define the nature of literary value; the creation of the Akutagawa Prize for pure literature and the Naoki Prize for mass literature; and theoretical discussions on the history and sociology of literature. Edward Mack's basic idea is that ""the ascriptions of value that attend works are neither natural nor inevitable because they do not emanate in any simple way from the texts themselves."" In the anthologies, in the Akutagawa Prize selection process, or in the literary debates about the ""I-novel"" as a specifically Japanese form of literature, a variety of both literary and extraliterary factors were at play in deciding which works would enjoy consecration and which would not. A few individuals, such as the critic Kikuchi Kan, possessed a disproportionate amount of influence on the course of literary production. Of particular importance in the formation of literary value was the rhetorical opposition between ""tszoku""(vulgar, mundane) novels and ""junbungaku"" or pure literature. What was considered pure or vulgar changed over time and was a matter of personal appreciation, but the binary opposition structured the forces at play in the literary field.Although reading this book does not require previous knowledge of modern Japanese literature or of literary theory, it is an extremely rewarding experience on both counts. The text begins with the most mundane--the material conditions of literary production such as printing presses, movable fonts, paper sheets--and ends with the most speculative--deconstructing the categories of ""modern,"" of ""Japanese,"" and of ""literature"". Prominent figures of Japanese literature are featured, such as Akutagawa Rynosuke or Kawabata Yasunari, along with minor authors and critics. Mack exhibits a mastery of Japanese texts and of epistemological tools that is rarely found with such balance in a Western scholar. The author borrows from Pierre Bourdieu the notions of symbolic capital (resources stemming from talent, prestige, or recognition) and of the literary field (defined as ""the constellation of competitive relationships among literary producers and consumers who struggle for various forms of capital""). Mack draws inspiration from cultural studies and post-colonialism by questioning the link between literature and the nation-state, and by placing Taish democracy in the context of the Japanese empire. He avoids the trap--conspicuous in the writings of Harry Harootunian, the editor of the series in which this book is published--of pure speculation that loses sight of empirical material. Manufacturing Modern Japanese Literature opens avenues for future research--some suggested, some implicit--, and should be read by all readers interested by Japanese literature or by literary criticism.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 16, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQ4VTV8MVS80F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0822346729#wasThisHelpful","RQ4VTV8MVS80F","A3IKQVN8N8AKRY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3IKQVN8N8AKRY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Knowledge about global products is itself global. We know about them even before they are sold in a store nearby. Indeed, shaping consumer expectations is part of the strategies of global firms, and has given rise to a whole marketing industry. Everybody knows, for instance, that McDonald's restaurants are to be found in all major cities in the world, and that they provide a food service experience that is both homogeneous and predictable (if not palatable to gourmet palates!) The Golden Arches, McDonald's trademark, have become an icon of international business and popular culture, and the Big Mac a symbol of junk food and fast service. There are even talks about McJobs, McWages, and a Big Mac Index tracking exchange rates.People who have travelled in Asia know that some fast food specialties are customized to accommodate local tastes--the Maharaja Mac contains chicken, not beef, and teriyaki burgers are to be found not only in Japan, but also in Taiwan and Hong Kong. Some McDonald's publics are specifically Asian, as witnessed by familiar scenes in ordinary restaurants: school kids in uniform having a snack on their way home or before cram school; office ladies enjoying a relaxed atmosphere; lively birthday parties during week-ends. We know the story. It has been told before: by articles in the international press, by case studies in business schools, and by direct observation when one ventures abroad. What can the reader possibly learn that he does not already know? And what can a team of anthropologists bring to the task that does not duplicate the narratives of journalists and business writers?Such skepticism was met by the five authors of Golden Arches East when they embarked on their collective endeavor to study McDonald's restaurants in five East Asian locations. Some academic colleagues accused them of legitimizing corporate hype, or of elevating to the status of a research project what could at best be handled as a sophomore class assignment. Few took them seriously, and they had to give justifications for their choice of topic. For James L. Watson and his coauthors, studying McDonald's is not only anecdotical: ""To dismiss enterprises like McDonald's as somehow unworthy of serious inquiry is not only elitist, it is also suicidal for our discipline."" As an academic field attached to cultural change, anthropology has to focus on terrains where change actually takes place, and the evolution of food habits is a prime example of cultural evolution.Besides, the fast food industry and its adaptation to East Asian urban cultures is a good test of theories that take a critical perspective on the transnational transmission of cultural norms. Is McDonald's an instrument of American imperialism, of cultural homogenization, and of commodity fetishism? In the lead author's terms: ""Does the spread of fast food undermine the integrity of indigenous cuisines? Are food chains helping to create a homogenous global culture better suited to the needs of a capitalist world order?"" When observing, in true anthropological fashion, people who actually eat and spend time at McDonald's, a different and more nuanced picture emerges. As James Watson underscores in his introduction, cultural adoption is a two-way street. McDonald's has indeed effected small but influential changes in East Asian dietary patterns, in ways that are more subtle than the critics of imperialism would surmise. At the same time, East Asian consumers have quietly, and in some cases stubbornly, transformed their neighborhood McDonald's into local institutions, again not always in the direction that was planned by corporate headquarters.What strikes the reader of Golden Arches East, more than the differences and variations across the five Asian localities, are the common patterns and repetitions in different cultural contexts. Sandwiches are produced according to a rigidly uniform process detailed in a 600-pages manual. The menu served at McDonald's is broadly the same from Tokyo to Hong Kong, from Seoul to Taipei, and the local adaptations serve only to underscore the homogeneity of the service provided. Customers usually, but not always, order a standard combo of three flagship products: the Big Mac, French fries, and a Coke. As the authors note astutely, ""the keystone of this winning combination is not, as most observers might assume, the Big Mac or even the generic hamburger. It is the fries.""This fact, added to the cultural trait that the hamburger is classified as bread or bun more than as meat, explains why fast food cuisine is usually considered as ""snack"" by Asian consumers. A proper meal must contain rice, which the McDonald's menu does not include. As a consequence, McDonald's restaurants are often used as meeting places, leasure centers, or even after-school clubs: middle school students usually sit there for hours, studying, gossiping, and picking over snacks. Another Asian characteristics is the presence of a majority of female customers. Women appreciate the relaxed atmosphere, the clean toilets, and the non-alcohol policy that keeps some noisy male customers away.The localization process of the McDonald's franchise also follows a similar cycle that is closely correlated with the level of development and openness of a given country. The first opening of a McDonald's facility in a foreign capital is not a minor event. The startup dates (1971 in Japan, 1975 in Hong-Kong, 1984 in Taiwan, 1988 in Seoul, 1992 in Beijing) closely follows the emergence of a new urban middle class with purchasing power and cosmopolitan tastes. The first McDonald's are usually located in prestigious districts (Ginza in Tokyo, Tiananmen in Beijing) and are first perceived as upmarket restaurants offering American cuisine (and culture) to a new class of young entrepreneurs and professionals who can afford the experience. These yuppies and foreigners are quickly followed by thrill-seeking teenagers and by young couples looking for a romantic date spot. Children are also prime movers in the creation of McDonald's East Asian clienteles. It is they who bring their parents or grandparents to the franchise, which offers a child-friendly environment complete with a play corner, birthday party salons, and iconic characters like Ronald McDonald or his female companion Auntie McDonald.During this first phase of installation, McDonald's employees have to ""educate"" customers to the rules of fast food restaurants. During McDonald's first weeks of operation in Moscow, employees distributed information sheets to people standing in queues, telling them how to order and what to do after paying. The first discipline is to form a line in front of cashiers: in Hong Kong during the 1970s, customers packed themselves into disorderly scrums and jostled for a chance to place their orders. Similarly, customers at first generally do not bus their own trays and leave without attending to their own rubbish. Napkins placed in public dispensers disappear faster than they can be replaced. Without guidance, elderly people are likely to disassemble the Big Mac layer by layer, and eat only these parts that appeal to them.After several years, when local managers think their business is well established, new items are introduced in the menu to suit local tastes in order to boost sales. The street-corner McDonald's restaurant is transformed from an essentially ""foreign"" setting into a place at once familiar and indigenous. The transformation from exotic to ordinary repeats itself across fast-growing East Asia at ten or twenty years intervals. Today it has become hard to convince a Taiwanese or a Korean child, whose favorite venue for birthday parties is McDonald's, that hamburgers are not part of the local food culture. McDonald's restaurants in most major Asian cities are packed wall-to-wall with people of all ages, few of whom are seeking an American cultural experience. For many people however, particularly in the politically sensitive contexts of Korea or China, McDonald's is not simply a corporation: it is also a representation of ""the West"" or ""America"". Some intellectuals see it as a symbol of American cultural imperialism--defined as the encroachment of cultural practices and values that reflect American political and economic power.Are they right? Obviously much more than cuisine is involved when McDonald's first comes to town. It is a signal that the country is open for business, and that its citizens are wholeheartedly embracing globalization. They are buying much more than food, even if food is all that McDonald's is selling. As Stephen Mintz argues in the closing chapter, ""Goods are embedded in their culture of origin; their introduction into a different culture is more than a simple importation of commodities."" The McDonald's experience embodies quintessential American values: it is fun, friendly, and familiar. Consumers are treated based on the principles of individualism and equality, especially between male and female customers. The restaurants reflect cleanliness, efficiency, transparency, and economy. These features affect the way in which such food service is perceived by people in the host culture.The cultural transplant sometimes creates misunderstandings. In Hong Kong for instance, people are suspicious of anyone who displays what is perceived to be an excess of congeniality. The visible smile that McDonald's employees were instructed to wear could be tantamount to a challenge. Similar reactions are reported by contributors who worked in Taiwan and Korea. In fact, the longer McDonald's operates in an East Asian city, the less evident are the forced smiles. Consumers are far more concerned with efficiency, reliability, and hygiene. And the penetration of American influence that intellectuals associate with McDonald's does not seem to bother ordinary customers. As Watson concludes his chapter on Hong Kong, ""Having watched the process of culture change unfold for nearly thirty years, it is apparent to me that the ordinary people of Hong Kong have most assuredly not been stripped of their cultural heritage, nor have they become the uncomprehending dupes of transnational corporations.""As a last comment, Golden Arches East also reflects the fast pace of change in East Asia. Based on fieldwork conducted in the early 1990s, many chapters have become completely obsolete or have acquired historical value as testimonies of a bygone era. It is hard to imagine the long queues that formed when McDonald's opened its first restaurant in Beijing in 1994; and the pocket bells or ""pokeberu"" carried by Japanese school children have long been relegated to history's dustbin. The chapters on Korea and on Taiwan also heavily bear the mark of the times. The first was written during the ""rice wars"" when Korean farmers protested against foreign food imports, taking McDonald's as a symbol of the loss of Korean identity. The chapter on Taiwan also reflects the politics of identity that opposed cosmopolitans from the mainland to Taiwanese natives reconnecting with their roots by chewing betel nuts.This historical context may explain why the book somehow overestimates the role of politics and does not devote enough attention to the ""theater of the familiar"" that fast food restaurants have now become. Meanwhile, yuppies in Tokyo, Shanghai and Hong Kong have upgraded to the Michelin guide, whose publication in select major Asian cities has been accompanied by much publicity and debates. An anthropology of the impact that the famous red guide has had on haute cuisine in the Asian cities where it was launched, remains to be written.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 10, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RA3TBUJ9PZ3DQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0804749892#wasThisHelpful","RA3TBUJ9PZ3DQ","A3IKQVN8N8AKRY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3IKQVN8N8AKRY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Chrysanthemum and the Sword, Margaret Mead once remarked, was a book that could safely be put in the hands of generals or congressmen. Similarly, the book was adopted by generations of students, visitors and businessmen looking for easy clues for understanding Japanese culture. First published in 1946, Ruth Benedict's essay was able to reach different targets and to pursue different goals--from the ""know thy enemy"" of occupying forces to the ""know thy ally"" of cold war officials and the ""understand thy competitor"" of US business executives. For an extended period of time, the Japanese were the most alien partner America ever had to deal with. Benedict's book therefore had successive leases of life, and was read anew by different publics.Such longevity is indeed rare for a social science book--all the more so for an essay written on the spur of the moment, and with a specific goal in mind. I can think of no other war propaganda material that has so well served the objectives of peace. Similarly, it is hard to imagine nowadays a policy maker or a military officer reading the work of a contemporary anthropologist to inform his decision-making process. The idea to commission a report by an anthropologist on a strategic policy issue would be alien to a modern bureaucrat. Today, anthropologists themselves would oppose being enrolled for a military cause, and few would accept the assignment to write on demand. But such were the times in the period immediately following World War II: anthropology was a young discipline that captured the imagination of the masses, and the nation was united behind common goals and values.As mentioned, Ruth Benedict wrote her book as a response to an official assignment: to understand Japan in order to propose a course of action for US military forces occupying the land. The book finds its origins in the works of the Office of War Information, which enrolled all the help it could find in order to adjust war messages and military tactics to its strategic objectives. ""Whether the issue was military or diplomatic, whether it was raised by questions of high policy or of leaflets to be dropped behind the Japanese front lines, every insight was important,"" Benedict recalls. Different materials were collected, not least the testimonies of Japanese men and women which the author was able to interview on US soil despite the policy of forced confinement, and to whom she addressed her grateful acknowledgments in the book's opening message.The behavior of the Japanese, at war or in peace, was read as an enigma. They had fought as formidable foes against US forces on the battlegrounds of the Pacific, and had vowed to resist invasion of their homeland with desperate energy. But once the Emperor told them that the war was over and they had lost, they accepted all that such a fact implied, and actively cooperated with the occupier. Already during the war, Japanese soldiers and officers, who treated their war prisoners harshly and fought to the death instead of surrendering, gave their full cooperation to the Allied forces and turned into model prisoners when taken into custody. On the political front, Japan transformed itself almost overnight from an authoritarian state into a fledging democracy.Benedict's preferred course of action was to treat Japan with respect and forgiveness. One strategy to plead for such an understanding policy could have been to emphasize the commonalities between the Japanese and the Americans. There was indeed a case for such an appeal: ""we must show mercy and compassion because they are like us,"" one could have argued. ""They have been abused by treacherous leaders and isolated from foreign influence, but we will bring the Japanese people into the fold, and bestow upon them the gift of liberal democracy."" Ruth Benedict argues exactly the opposite. Not that she thinks that the Japanese are not fit for democracy; but they must come to it at their own pace and on their own terms, not by fiat and imposition from an alien power. ""Japan will have to rebuild her self-respect today on her own basis, not on ours,"" she writes.Throughout the book, the author emphasizes difference and otherness. The Japanese are not like us. They behave differently; they are subject to different values and principles; and their key concepts do not translate easily into English. Examples of this abnormality abound: ""Men appointed to read [the Imperial Rescripts] have killed themselves because they misread a sentence."" Teachers are burned to death dashing into flames in order to rescue the picture of the Emperor which was hung in every school. A samurai father holds his sword upon the throat of his son undergoing surgery, menacing to kill him if he utters one cry. Zen disciples sit in an ice-cold waterfall before dawn, or spend eight years reflecting on a riddle. In this strange environment, words acquire a different meaning, and the effort at translating them into English is wholly deceptive. ""Makoto does not mean what sincerity does in English usage. It means both far less and far more."" The notion of ""on"" implies ""a return upon this indebtedness and therefore it means love. But the primary meaning is the debt, whereas we think of love as something freely given unfettered by obligation."" As for ""giri"", ""there is no possible English equivalent and of all the strange categories of moral obligations which anthropologists find in the culture of the world, it is one of the most curious.""Benedict does not seek to unriddle Japan and the Japanese by moderating this sense of otherness, but by accentuating it. She does so by several rhetorical figures, which all contribute to the pervasive feeling of strangeness. She repeatedly uses Japanese words and concepts that introduce a distance between the text and its meaning, as most of her readers are not familiar with the notions employed. She borrows examples from John Embree's Suye Mura, whose stories of ribaldry and other folkways from the countryside would seem strange to any urbanite. She draws parallels between social arrangements and habits of life in Japan on the one hand and customs or institutions found among the primitive tribes of the Pacific islands or Papua New Guinea on the other. She highlights comparisons with China, itself a different culture from a Western perspective, only to emphasize that Japan is in turn different from China, redoubling the otherness effect.This doubling of one's stakes is also found in her descriptions of common pleasures and popular habits. As Benedict writes, the Japanese have elevated simple gestures of everyday life to the degree of an art: sleeping is ""one of the most accomplished art of the Japanese,"" the daily bath is ""a fine art of passive indulgence,"" and erotic pleasure is ""an area about which they are not moralistic and we are."" But not only are these customs different from ours: they contradict themselves and are negated by other cultural traits. Every pleasure is redoubled by its negation: the hot bath with cold showers, relaxed sleeping with sleep deprivation, eating with fasting, romantic love with self-sacrifice, erotic pleasure with abstinence. Similarly, keeping a mistress, visiting geishas or prostitutes are ""within the circle of human feelings,"" and ""homosexual indulgences"", autoerotic pleasures, or indulging in sake drinking are also part of accepted behaviors, ""about which moralistic attitudes are inappropriate."" But these ""human feelings"" are in turn contradicted by duty and social obligations, to which they must abide.In the end, this doubling of contradictions inverts the poles between Japan and the US, and the American reader is faced with his own contradictions. As Clifford Geertz's suggestive essay highlights, ""what started out as a familiar sort of attempt to unriddle oriental mysteries ends up, only too successfully, as a deconstruction, avant la lettre, of occidental clarities."" To borrow a lengthy quotation from Geertz's essay: ""There is, in fact, nothing 'wrong with the picture,' just with those who look at it upside down; and the enemy who at the beginning of the book is the most alien we have ever fought is, by the end of it, the most reasonable we have ever conquered. Japanese newspapers pronounce defeat as 'all to the good for the ultimate salvation of Japan.' Japanese politicians happily govern the country under MacArthur's umbrella-parasol. And the Emperor, urged by the General's advisors to disavow divinity, complains he is not really regarded as a god but does so anyway because foreigners seem to think that he is and it should be good for the country's image.""","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 28, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RD5VJNJAH3P63/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0618619593#wasThisHelpful","RD5VJNJAH3P63","A3IKQVN8N8AKRY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3IKQVN8N8AKRY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I could not figure out what the heck the point of it was.The pictures looked the same to me.This company sent an email explaining how to use.I was really glad they did as I was not using it right.So I tried it again following instructions from the email.Darn, I was impressed with the difference I see so much detail in my cell phone pictures.I never used to use my cell phone camera due to the fact that it takes really crappy pictures.I am glad this camera lens makes them so much better.As sometimes I just do not want to lug my Nikon camera around.If you love to take photos as much as I do grab one of this LOHA camera lens.It was truly impressive the detail I could see with it versus just my cell phone camera.I received this camera lens at a discounted price in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3TU6YKOY1BEHA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZC0MHZE#wasThisHelpful","R3TU6YKOY1BEHA","AERCAJ266L2YU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AERCAJ266L2YU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Having such a large family.It has been a long time since I had the time to sit and focus on what I liked to do prior to having a family.This year my youngest girls went to preschool.I found myself at a loss as to what I was going to do with my time without little people in the background commanding my attention.One thing I really have always had a passion for was painting.So when the chance came up to check out this six-pack of acrylic colors.I was really looking forward to enjoying this new found time expressing myself.These are nice size tubes of paint.I did not have any paint brushes or canvas around.As I can not remember where I put them.I found some sponge brushes.And away I painted.The texture of the paint is thick not runny.So each color does give a nice solid color.The colors are all very bright and true to what you see on your screen.i had so much fun creating with this set of acrylic paints.I do not feel the are of lesser quality then paints I have used in the past.I was very pleased I got the chance to check them out.And hope the will help me to unleash my creative side once again.I do recommend these paints.I received these acrylic paints at a discounted price in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R28VJZ9PK9CI3V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0163G19KY#wasThisHelpful","R28VJZ9PK9CI3V","AERCAJ266L2YU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AERCAJ266L2YU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I did practice putting it in & taking it out before I started, just seemed like a good idea when I wasn't stressing about making it work. I haven't had any issues with these & can easily wear them the 12 hours they claim (the only time it leaked was about 13 hours in one day when I hadn't been around a restroom). For me these are the absolute best option, I do not feel them and there is no dryness issue. I have already recommend them to my closest friends.

"I liked the fact I was able to order this through prime. I have had a cord (from my cable jack being run to the tv about eight or ten ft away) for a couple months. I have been looking for one of these, and no store around me had them. This did just the trick. Half of the cord was already tucked under large toys, but it ran across a door way that was out in the open. I read other people had put it in a hot car or boiling water to get it to lay flat. Well, its been cold here (I know very strange for ""spring"" in the ""south"") & I am not about to use one of my pots we cook with to heat this with.

"I was looking at vitamins for my almost three year old and myself. He was taking flinstone vitamins, and I wanted to add probiotics and a good omega 3 to his intake. I came across this brand, and liked everything I read about it. It is well rounded and covers everything basic, without having allergens in it. It also has the probiotics already in them! I did order a omega 3 & DHA (spectrum is the brand) that are flavored liquid gels so he can chew them (I tasted them and they taste pretty good). These rainbow stars came in today, and my son happily chewed it up and said they taste good. He also loved the fact they have stars on them (stars are always a hit with him), I took a picture and posted it.I feel better that he is getting everything he needs, and he is happy with them. =) i also ordered my vitamins from this brand, and I like mine as well.

Also if you are looking for a black wire basket attachment I own 3 of the Honey Can Do brand which is available online for sixteen dollars at walmart and home depot.

These were on sale at BJ's for a 4 pack (green, yellow, orange, and blue), for ten dollars. So for that price I decided to try them. I deducted one star since the flip top presses on my face when I drink out of it and it is annoying to me.

"Yesterday I was shopping at costco and this item was being demonstrated. I had been turned off of coconut water from the 3 brands I had previously tried, but since it was free and it was chilled, I took a chance. IT WAS FANTASTIC! The flavor was not like the terrible Vita Coco brand I had also bought at costco nor the other brands I tried from the grocery store. This tasted exactly like fresh coconut water and I was quite surprised. The demonstrator warned me that even though it was a good seller, it was being cancelled by costco. For 4 of the 33.8 oz. containers it is twelve ninety seven. The expiration date is May 14, 2016 so I plan to stock up.According to the box on 33.8 oz. container is made from 5 organic coconuts and no sugar is added. For my taste buds, it is the perfect level of sweetness and I'm used to using Now or Kal organic stevia. This product is pasteurized which may turn off some people and frankly I would prefer it not to be but that won't stop me from purchasing it. I will likely add it to my S&S items on Amazon in the near future.From a health prospective fresh coconut has numerous beneficial health properties be it from the oil, water, or fruit.This water provides 1900 mg of potassium and 74 mg of magnesium per 33.8 oz. container. I eat coconut at least in one form daily and use it on my skin as it absorbs quickly. Let's Do Organic is my favorite brand of the coconut flakes which are thicker and larger than the standard shredded coconut. I put it in oatmeal, madras lentils, and eat it dry (and it is dry), but favorable and not sweetened with sugar. I also makes great dark chocolate coconut candy treats that easily satiate one's sweet tooth. Amazon thankfully has it on their S&S program so it is very cost effective.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1S4Y9WBJPTVVY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003V8SO10#wasThisHelpful","R1S4Y9WBJPTVVY","A2PNOU7NXB1JE4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2PNOU7NXB1JE4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is one of the best purchases I have made on Amazon and I have bought quite a bit over the past 13 years. If you price compare this item with the blue or orange stores, you will be shocked at what a generous deal this is and the extremely low shipping cost. This very heavy box arrived in perfect condition which shocked me when smaller light weight boxes arrive crushed.I purchased this a year ago to redo the moisture barrier under two houses myself. It is so much thicker and of a better quality than when I had my pest control company redo it twice since they used a thinner plastic that was not durable and charged quite a bit of money to remove and install it while not doing a good job. That ended my 25 year relationship with them. It was a bit challenging for me due to the weight and to be honest I do not enjoy being in the crawl space as it is a little spooky. It looks great and I plan on using it on my outdoor shed marine grade wood flooring base then putting the plastic shed on top.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2YF1BFE79MKOC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004BG4G2C#wasThisHelpful","R2YF1BFE79MKOC","A2PNOU7NXB1JE4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2PNOU7NXB1JE4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

During April 2015 I paid forty dollars and fifty three cents with subscribe and save for the 40 count pads which I had been doing for years. When I went to reorder the price increased by 50% which was unacceptable for my budget. I tried the other options and this brand by far was the winner of a permanent replacement unless Tidy Cat reverts back to their previous lower pricing. I contacted the manufacturer who promptly sent me a free sample and it is so close to Tidy Cat pads in absorption and odor control which my other alternative ALL-Absorb does not offer, that I bought this bulk package.

So when I had a chance to own this beauty, I grabbed it. Although I'm only 5'1"" and petite, I had no issue loading it while still in the box into my Camry and then into the rental house.When I took it out of the box and compared it to the Hitachi, well it was like a beginner's saw compared to a contractor's professional tool. Don't get me wrong, I've been happy with the Hitachi and have no complaints..However this DeWalt saw IS BEAUTIFUL and we all know DeWalt is a great brand for reliability.I own several other DeWalt tools: a planner,(which I admit it is so powerful I'm nerous when using it), drills, and the batterry operated screwdriver. Luckily I have a friend who will show me how to adjust it since it is somewhat different from the Hitachi..After I get finished with this property then I plan to add crown moulding to my house and some other upgrades which will require this saw.

This book is very well designed and is sturdy so that several children should be able to use it in consecutive years before it requires replacement. I was surprised at the wonderful detail and is so colorful that it presents as fun versus school work.Other bonuses are teaching your child the value of mulch which includes a simple experiment,making a soap ship, learning road signs, telling time,growing a tree, and making a shoebox treasure chest. You may well find that even at this level, adults may learn something new too. For me it was making a ship out of soap!

As fate would have it, Fan is eventually sponsored to come to America and attend high school for a year by Anna's close friend Andee's family who is half Chinese and very wealthy. Fan slowly adjusts to American culture although she is homesick, studies very diligently, and becomes like a sister to Anna and Andee. Later on her beloved grandfather, Gong Gong unexpectedly dies and Fan wants to go home. However her mother wants to stay and continue with her education until the Chinese Spring Festival, when if they can afford it will make the journey to visit her grandmother, the widow of Gong Gong. There is a surprise going away party for Fan prior to her return to China and a special poem is written for her by Anna and Andee to celebrate their sisterhood.I appreciated the subtle way social issues were addressed by this author and that she included a Chinese pronunciation guide.  I enjoyed practicing the words since one of my friends adopted two female Infants from China who are now eleven and thirteen and have recently learned some Chinese phrases. If you're interested in an adult version book about Chinese American women, please consider The Joy Luck Club by Amy Tan which was made into a fantastic movie of the same title. The Joy Luck Club book and movie provides a very strong positive message for all women. It is my favorite chick flick that I have watched at least a dozen times. I have it on its original release on videotape and DVD. It has some disturbing scenes that some may not want to watch, but keep in mind so does the daily news.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3C938QYVERBC4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0544344278#wasThisHelpful","R3C938QYVERBC4","A2PNOU7NXB1JE4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2PNOU7NXB1JE4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am a big fan and owner of numerous Dummies books from plumbing to photography, to the Lost Books of the Bible, and the list goes on and on. Although they might not always go into the detail I desire, they have consistently been beneficial and steered me to other resources. This book is exceptionally thorough as seen in its comprehensive Table of Contents.  It explains that it isn't just a book, it's a process designed to guide you to your enhanced self-esteem and clarifying ""Foolish Assumptions."" After reading the introduction, I went to chapter 23, Ten Famous People Who Raised Their Self-Esteem. This surprising famous ten included Helen Keller, Thomas Edison, Harriet Tubman, Theodore Roosevelt, Albert Einstein, Mahatma Gandhi, Ralph Waldo Emerson, Abraham Lincoln, Frederick Douglass, and my number one feminist hero, Eleanor Roosevelt. This chapter definitely gives one inspiration to not only read the chapters in order, but to follow through with the recommendations to improve one's self-esteem which most of us could probably benefit regardless of age or status. I think this esteem enhancing book would make an excellent summer gift for twelve year olds prior to starting the seventh grade to offset hormonal changes and peer pressure. Actually I think everyone of any age could benefit from this book as it covers more than just esteem building techniques. For example it discusses eating healthy food, exercise, self-nurturing which includes taking control of a bad mood, relationships, relying on alcohol and or drugs, making the most of your skin tone,  improving sleep habits and so much more. This is not a book you rush through if you truly want to gain permanent benefits, although initially I skimmed through it and highlighted the areas most important to me. It also offers free online webinars and teleseminars (www.thereismoreinsideyou.com and www.self-esteem-course.com). Other online tools are www.dummies.com/cheatsheet/selfesteem for a quiz that helps you assess your current level of self-esteem and stop negative self-talk. You can listen to guided audio visualizations @www.dummies.com/go/selfesteem.The chapters are:1. The Nature of Self-Esteem.2. Understanding the Impacts of Low Self-esteem.3. Where Does Low Self-esteem Come From?4. Measuring Your Self-Esteem.5. Affirming and Visualizing Your Better Self.6. Nurturing Yourself to Create Happiness.7. Creating a Healthy Body Image.8. Dealing with Your Negative Self-Talk.9.  Analyzing Perfectionism.10. Dealing Positively with Perfectionism.11. Increasing Your Confidence through Self-Awareness.12. Moving Beyond the Fear That's Zapping Your Faith.13. Creating and Reaching Your Goals.14. Examining Your Role in Creating Conflicts in Your Relationships.15. Rewriting Your Love Story.16. Getting Beyond Loving Love.17. Improving Personal Relationships.18. Re-Creating Your Image for Professional Success.19. Managing Your Relationships at Work.20. Presenting with Confidence.21. Helping Family and Friends.22. Helping Children and Teens Achieve Healthy Self-Esteem.23. Ten Famous People Who Raised Their Self-Esteem.24. Ten Approaches to Pursuing Excellence.25. Ten Tips for Quickly Improving Your Self-Esteem.Reading and doing these exercises isn't exactly fun all the time, but you get to learn better self-control and self-appreciation as you learn to release or let go of hurt, anger, and negativity towards self and others. For the cost of this book and your time commitment, this is an incredible bargain. Best wishes for your success!","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R6GTDG0QYQPCS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1118967097#wasThisHelpful","R6GTDG0QYQPCS","A2PNOU7NXB1JE4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2PNOU7NXB1JE4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This shampoo has a pleasant scent and lathers well. It has added moisturizers and is supposed to alleviate hair frizz. I usually use a hair conditioner and another heat protection product while blow drying my hair, but I didn't with this product so I could tell how well it worked. Well, there was a lot of frizz. Maybe it works better if you use their conditioner that matches this shampoo. I will continue to use it but now I will add my conditioner and heat protector which does prevent frizzy hair.

"I think this is a very reputable company and I like the products I've tried so far. This bar has a good chocolate flavor with a decent coconut flavor, but the cashew flavor is missing. There are tiny pieces of cashew you can see, but not enough to get the creamy nut taste, hence the one star deduction. The massive list of ingredients is impressive especially since quite a few are organic. I was very satisfied after eating this as a late afternoon  snack.

"These five clear tab plastic pockets dividers can hold up to 70 pages of standard sized paper are very well made and should last for a long time. They are considerably better quality than the easy to tear clear no tab full sheet size protectors I have been using to store itemized lists and corresponding receipts for a house rehab project. The clear deep front pocket opening is angled to make retrieval of pages or loose receipts easy to access. The back of the pocket is opaque and appropriately stiff but still very flexible. The included 10 layers of 5 clear label dividers can be used in either a laser or ink jet printer and can be applied to one or both sides of the tabs. Mine are labeled for electrical, plumbing, flooring, etc. and I will eventually need another set as it seems once one project gets completed, other repairs/replacements are required.To view a demonstration of designing and formatting the easy apply labels visit Avery.com/demo/im.

"This book reminded me of the movies Gone with the Wind, Cold Mountain and Yentl in the sense that Josephine and Libby are strong southern women disguised as men. I know in Cold Mountain, Zellweger and Kidman weren't pretending to be men, nor was Scarlett, but they certainly performed stereotypical male activity for that time period. And who could forget Streisand's strong woman disguised as a male rabbis student performance in Yentl?Their story starts out in picturesque pre-war Winchester, VA, which is horse territory and still very beautiful today. Libby's husband, Arden is killed during the War Between The States, so the two sisters eventually end up fighting against the Union soldiers disguised as men under very harsh conditions. We share their heartbreak, anger, and revenge as well  as their commitment, ability to survive, hopes, and new love. It is an enjoyable well written story that any fan of the Confederacy or strong female characters would enjoy. History is truly brought to life through southern culture from two women's perspective of this tragic war and all that is lost and regained.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R21G9T8KBUM8QZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0544400003#wasThisHelpful","R21G9T8KBUM8QZ","A2PNOU7NXB1JE4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2PNOU7NXB1JE4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I like Quicken products and this is no exception. In my case it has a lot of features that I didn't need. This version provides a free ebook of Nolo's Encyclopedia of Everyday Law and an one year subscription to its Online Living Trust which I was glad it did. I also signed up to be a complete organ donor, the brain has to be donated separately, and I hope using my body to practice on helps to save the life of some creature. Another plus was the paperback book, The Legal Answer Book for Families, which I skimmed through since none of that information was needed at this time. They also offer another version of this product with a more comprehensive paperback that you may want to compare before purchasing. Keep in mind you can upgrade with this from previous versions of Quicken WillMaker, WillMaker Deluxe, and Quicken Lawyer Personal, from 2002 to 2014, as each is only valid for the year it was produced and each year has pertinent legal updates. Also these estate planning documents are not valid in Louisiana, U.S. Territories or Canada. For the amount of information you get for this price, it's a great deal. The only reason I deducted one star is I think the other book version is easier for those somewhat lacking in computer skills. Just take your time and you'll be glad like me that you chose one of their WillMaker products.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZBMVW2DAEOJD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MILM2FA#wasThisHelpful","RZBMVW2DAEOJD","A2PNOU7NXB1JE4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2PNOU7NXB1JE4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"What a great erotic story that had my senses tingling from the very first page.  R.B. Greenfield obviously has a very naughty and creative imagination to be able to write such a sizzling story!  I instantly was attracted to the premise of this book as I am a big fan of erotic fiction, especially ones that have a different twist like this one.  So after I started reading I was definitely glad that I bought the book.  I loved the storyline and the dynamics & chemistry between Richie Greenfield and the different Amazon women that he engages with.  The storyline flows nice with the perfect balance of twists and turns and steamy sexcapades.  The sexual encounters are top notch and really get your juices flowing.  Now I really dont like to give away the plots from stories that I read as it would be criminal to ruin a good book like this for another reader.  But I will say that it is an extremely hot read that will have you blushing and wanting more.

"What a brilliantly written, twisted and torrid tale that was filled with passion, mystery, suspense, and taboos!  I simply couldnt put it down once I started reading it.  I dont know why, but gay-themed romance stories have always intrigued me.  And this one is one of the best I have read.  It has lots of twists and unexpected turns, which keeps you on the edge of your seat as you read through each and every page.  Some parts will leave you guessing, and other parts will make your senses tingle.  Even though the theme of the book is a little taboo and erotic, the actual storyline is really good!  I dont like to give story plots away as I would hate to ruin a great read for someone else, but if you are a fan of stories that have a gay romance theme, then I think you will really like this book as much as I did.

"What a helpful and eye-opening book! Sophie Lee provides detailed and easy methods for achieving a clean and tidy home. She has an easy style writing that makes cleaning feel a pleasure. I always loved clean and spotless houses, but I don't really enjoy cleaning and scrubbing floors. I prefer to work and do other things than waste my time on cleaning. I hate it when the house is a mess, but with all the work and the pressure I hardly have the time to make my house look the way I would like it to be. To most of us who have busy lives, housecleaning is an overwhelming job and unfortunately is done infrequently. This book is filled with great information and tips and it is really helpful. It is so easy to read and understand and it has helped me to be more clean and organized! It also gives useful tips and ideas on how to keep your home ready for guests and stress free.

"What a dynamic story that had me feeling so many emotions as I read along.  I laughed out loud a couple times and I also had to wipe away tears.  The three authors have brilliantly co-opted a great story that I am sure will resonate with a lot of women, as the touch on subjects & scenarios that most of us have faced at one time or another in real life.  I fell in love with all of the characters, especially Bobbi.  I could completely sympathize with her plight and dilemmas in the story.  The book kind of reminded me of the Sex In The City TV series, but with an entirely different set of personalities and escapades.  Now I dont want to give the plot away as I wouldnt want to wreck it for another reader, but if you are a fan of this type of fiction and you are looking for a great book to put on your summer reading list, then this one is a winner!  5 big stars!","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2JJYGIWJCP4PN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AFCJUG8#wasThisHelpful","R2JJYGIWJCP4PN","AUYU7RWJKXQXY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AUYU7RWJKXQXY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This was a great book!  I simply couldnt put it down from the moment I started reading it.  I am a huge fan of epic mystery and adventure novels and tend to be very critical when analyzing and reviewing a book such as this.  But I am happy to report that this one is an absolute winner!  The storyline is so well done.  Each part of the story transitions nicely into the next making the whole saga that plays out believable.  The characters are also very colorful and well done.  I loved Captain Johnny Blacks character, along with the two main characters Danny & Marsha Jones.  Now I dont like to give away plots when I review a book, especially one as good as this one.

"What a bone-chilling and terrifying story that will have you trembling in your shoes and gasping for breath from the moment you start reading it!  I absolutely loved it!  Joe Ireri obviously has a tremendously sinister and creative imagination to be able to write such a great suspenseful story.  His descriptive writing style really helps the characters and horror scenes come to life in your imagination.  A feat that is incredibly difficult to do in horror/suspense stories.  So hats off to the author indeed!  The storyline really flows nicely with so many twists & turns and cliff-hanger moments that you really never know what is going to happen next.  You will definitely stay engaged and anticipate each & every page all the way up to the storys great climactic ending. The only downside to this book was that it wasn't as long as I wanted it to be, as I was left wanting just a little more.  Just being honest...  All-in-all it was a great read that would recommend to anyone!

"I found this book to be incredibly insightful and straight to the point. It is a great resource on how to be yourself, the true YOU and how to get rid of all the false guides.  I think it's not so easy to be one's authentic self in this days and age. How many of us live our whole lives trying to be something we're not? Trying to do and say all the right things, to not mess up and try to be perfect.We all go through life wanting everyone else to be honest, real, and authentic with us... yet, how many of us are able or willing to do the same in return?  Basically, we all expect from others, what we struggle to deliver. This book  does a great job on teaching you how to get clear on who you are, what you want, and how to achieve the things you want to achieve. One of the phrases I loved is  ""We need to stop imagining non-existing bridges to nowhere"".  I always dream and expect things to happen that will never come.  It is because I have built the bridges to a non-existing reality.  All this must stop. We have to see ourselves and life through true eyes.  Do yourself a favor and read this book.  It will change your life!","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RWMWOFK9OTJ2E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OWHZ3Q8#wasThisHelpful","RWMWOFK9OTJ2E","AUYU7RWJKXQXY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AUYU7RWJKXQXY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Four great sizzling stories for the price of one.  That's what you will find in Donald Peterson's latest collection called ""Escorts"".  Although the theme of each story has to do with escorts, each story is completely original and unique.  And as you read through the book you will find that each story is a little more hot, steamy, and naughty the the preceding one.  Some parts of the stories will excite you, some parts will make you blush, and other parts have lots of great twists & turns to keep you interested and engaged.  The erotic dialogue and imagery is also very good as Peterson is a very descriptive writer who really gets your juices flowing.

"What a great sexy book that had me experiencing so many emotions as I read.  The author has crafted 3 great short stories between the covers of this book.  The first story was very sweet and romantic.  The other two stories are steamy with lots of twists and turns.  I really loved the author's writing style.  I also especially loved the climactic ending of the third story.  I totally sympathized with the two spouses who were being cheated on so I was completely amused with how their revenge played out.

"What a great companion that helped me fill in all of the blanks and questions I had from Blake Crouchs Wayward.  This book really was a godsend as it really made me understand the complete plot and underlying meanings of this great story.  Samantha C. Allen obviously is a meticulous reader & documenter with an incredible ability to read between the lines and get to the bottom of the inner working of stories like this.  It is truly a gift that she has and I for one am extremely jealous.  She really leaves no stone unturned.  After reading thorough this great companion, all of my questions have been answered and I have a complete understanding of the entire storyline, including the character motivations and roles in the story.  If only every great novel had a sidekick like this available, the literary world would be a much better place!

"What a tremendously in depth resource that completely educated me and opened my eyes to the world of successful SEO optimization.  It is like an easy to understand text book that could easily be used to teach college level courses.  Even though this book is very thorough and full of important technical information, it is written in a very easy to digest and understand writing style.  The author is obviously a master at taking complicated subject matter and breaking it down to where the average person can easily understand it.  I had previously bought a couple other books on SEO, but they were so complicated to read and written from a very technical standpoint.  This book is completely the opposite.  When you are done reading it you will actually understand all aspects of SEO, including specifics for all of the Google products that SEO must work with flawlessly if you want your website to ever be seen by the masses.  All-in-all this book is very useful and excellent!  I would recommend it to anyone!","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RSVUWYP42TMHT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XLGACIK#wasThisHelpful","RSVUWYP42TMHT","AUYU7RWJKXQXY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AUYU7RWJKXQXY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"What an eye-opening and educational book.  I am so glad that I found this gem.  I have been a life-long allergy sufferer and really thought I was out of options.  I have taken medications and other remedies, but thus far, to no avail.  So when I saw this gem of a book on Amazon I figured it was worth a try.  Not only was it worth a try but for me it has been life changing!  Guy Chapman is a genius and a life saver!  This book is just what the doctor ordered.  Shortly after I read it I started implementing the things that Chapman discusses in his book, and almost miraculously, my allergies have subsided.  I feel like my life has been changed forever!  I can never repay the author for having been freed from my allergy nightmare!  If you or someone you know suffers from any type of allergy related ailment, then I highly recommend that you let them know about this book!  It is truly a life changer!","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1G40X69JMJLJF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00W6EGPWU#wasThisHelpful","R1G40X69JMJLJF","AUYU7RWJKXQXY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AUYU7RWJKXQXY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"What a great erotic story that had my senses tingling from the very first page.  Lynette Casey obviously has a very naughty and creative imagination to be able to write such a sizzling story!  I instantly was attracted to the premise of this book as I am a big fan of erotic fiction, especially ones that have a different twist.  So after I started reading I was definitely glad that I bought the book.  I loved the storyline and the dynamics & chemistry between the two main characters Dawn and Katy.  The storyline flows nice with the perfect balance of twists and turns and steamy sexcapades.  The sexual encounters are top notch and really get your juices flowing.  Now I really dont like to give away the plots from stories that I read as it would be criminal to ruin a good book like this for another reader.

"What an eye-opening and enlightening book.  I honestly couldn't believe what I was reading.  I take my car to a cheap car wash regularly, that is, until I read this book.  Thomas Ingram truly is a godsend for writing this book.  I must admit I was completely clueless to how horrible these car washes are for your car.  Since I've read the book, I have gone back to the car wash and I completely noticed some of the things that the author describes in the book.  The ten steps he provides on preventing damage to your car are priceless pieces of information that everyone should know about.  All-in-all, this was an incredible read that is filled with valuable information.  In my opinion this book is worth 10 times more than what the cover price is.

I love fetish, BDSM, role playing, etc., and am a huge snob when it comes to erotically-themed stories, but this book absolutely got my attention.  I really got excited reading it as the author is extremely good at being descriptive with just enough suggestive imagery to stimulate your senses and imagination.  Sakinaa Davies is an extremely creative author and obviously has a tremendously boundless imagination to pen such a fantastic story.  And, even though the book is highly erotic and descriptive, the actual storyline is really good!  I am not going to reveal the plot of the story here as I wouldnt want to ruin this good book for another reader.

"What a fun and imaginative light-hearted read.  If only it were true.  I was a huge fan of Michael Jackson, so when I saw that the Holy Ghost writer had teamed up with Sadia Barrameda, I absolutely had to check this book out.  I loved the whole premise of the story.  The different paths that are explored about what might have become of Michael's spirit or ghost was really intriguing and fascinating.  I was definitely mesmerized and fully enthralled from the very first page.  Both writers have gifts & tremendous imaginations that really shine brilliantly throughout this book and its journey.  I am not going to divulge what happens here as this book is way too good to ruin for someone else who hasn't read it yet.

"Outstanding is the best word that I can think of to describe this book!  The author really hit this one out of the park!  This is the 1st book I have read by Emily Walters and I must say I was pleasantly surprised.  It is a bit romance, a bit power struggle, a bit adventurous, and definitely well written.  I instantly fell in love with Sara Armstrong and so could relate to her story and emotional struggles.  The story definitely illustrates the epic struggle between power & love, and all of the dynamics that are involved!  The characters are very colorful & believable, and the momentum of the storyline is great!  There are so many different twists and turns that you wont want to put the book down.

"This was an absolutely amazing book. It was incredibly fascinating and really dove deep into the Dream world and explored all of its different realms.  I have read a few other books on dreams and their interpretations, but this one is the most thorough and well done book that I have read to date on this topic. It is far from being just a simple dream exploration book.  It really analyzes so many different things that it is more like a definitive dream encyclopedia. The author is obviously highly gifted and an extreme expert on the subject. You will definitely be mesmerized once you start reading. You simply won't be able to put the book down.

This is definitely a naughty read that illustrates just how much passion and lust can hide inside of a shy and nerdy girl.  The sex scenes are raw and uninhibited.

The story follows the adventures of a young man, Henry Gallant, on his first assignment aboard the Repulse. Henry Gallant is a ""Natural"", with no genetic modification, the only human being left in the United Planets fleet. Space battles, aliens, and Henry's struggle to succeed kept me glued to my Kindle from page one to the end. The story is well developed, imaginative and flows beautifully. I found it to be extremely enjoyable!  There was plenty of mystery and tension and a bit of romance.

"Outstanding is the best word that I can think of to describe this book!  It is pure magic from the very first page.  I am a huge fan of fantasy fiction and am quite a critic.  But I must say I was pleasantly surprised at how good this book is.  Mark A. Cooper has definitely hit a home run with this story.  There are so many brilliantly crafted scenes throughout this story that it really pulls you in completely.  I honestly didnt want to put the book down.  Cooper has masterfully engineered so many different elements of surprise into the storyline that you really dont know what is going to happen next.  The battle sequences are epic and reminded me of the same sort of metaphors & imagery that is found in the great classics Moby Dick and Old Man and The Sea.  Quite a great feat for a young writer to pull off.  His use of descriptive words & imagery really sets the scenes to where you can actually picture the landscape, the characters mannerisms, the monsters ferocity, and the backdrop to each transition of the story!  If you are like me and you love this type of fiction, then I highly recommend you get this book and put it at the top of your summer reading list.

It teaches things step by step just as if you were in a painting class and features exercises so you can follow along with your own paints with what is being shown in the book.

"I bought this for my mother who is in her 70's. She has bad knees and is debating surgery, but in the meantime was having a hard time just doing normal daily activities. I knew she would like something like a cane, but she didn't want one of those huge metal canes with the multiple feet and she thought that a regular cane was too easy to slip away and cause a fall. The HurryCane addresses both of these concerns by being sleek and unobtrusive, yet offer a nice large handle grip and the multiple feet at the bottom to help support weight at various angles.As a bonus the HurryCane quickly collapses in size so it can easily be used to go into someplace such as a restaurant or show and then collapsed once you have sat down. This is also helpful if you go to the grocery and want to use one of the electric carts as you can collapse the cane down and place it in the cart's basket while you are shopping.All in all she is very happy with the HurryCane and uses it daily. If you are looking for a cane make sure to check this one out as it combines several great features into one affordable product!","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R38LF0352Y2Z2D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00E9ZFBII#wasThisHelpful","R38LF0352Y2Z2D","A2NMNWHKR9FTAT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NMNWHKR9FTAT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I won't go into details about everything the Fire TV Stick offers as far as content as you've probably seen that elsewhere. For me the main thing was to compare the Fire TV Stick against the regular Fire TV.The quick version is: Go ahead and pay more to get the ""regular"" Fire TV instead of the Stick.Here's why:- The Fire TV Stick still requires a separate power supply to be plugged in. So even though the device is small and plugs right into the HDMI port on your TV you still have to run a power cable to it and plug it into AC power. To me that reduces the benefit down to just not having to run the actual HDMI cable from the regular Fire TV to your TV which isn't that big of a deal.- The Fire TV Stick remote does not offer the speech recognition features like the regular Fire TV does. To me this is one of the primary features that separates the Fire TV from the competition. Being able to just say what you are looking for instead of using the onscreen keyboard saves a ton of time and frustration.- The Fire TV Stick is noticeably slower when navigating through the UI and accessing applications such as the basic games and things that are available with it.So in the end the Stick is a much cheaper buy, which may be the most important factor to you, but for me it is worth it to spend a little extra and get the full Fire TV. The speed of the interface and convenience of the speech recognition remote alone make it worth it.","2.0 out of 5 stars","February 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R12WCTWESYG0L0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GDQ0RMG#wasThisHelpful","R12WCTWESYG0L0","A2NMNWHKR9FTAT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NMNWHKR9FTAT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As far as I know this is the best version of Scrabble you can buy. Mainly because of three things:1. The board simply folds up and becomes the carrying case. No extra box to deal with and it has a built-in handle and stays closed via magnets.2. When you unfold the board it has built in wheels that are set at the precise angles so the board can be easily rotated to the next player as play progresses.3. The board itself has raised grid lines so your letters stay in place even when the board is spun around.If you like playing Scrabble do yourself a favor and get this edition. It's the best  you can buy!","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R38WHC4OJQDFNP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0036RRSU4#wasThisHelpful","R38WHC4OJQDFNP","A2NMNWHKR9FTAT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NMNWHKR9FTAT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"FYI - This review is for:Bonsaii PrinterBro C162-B Desktop-Style Cross-Cut 7-Sheet Paper/Clip/Staple Shredder, 18.9*17.3*25.4"", 3-in-1 Combo Unit, 9.3 Gallon Draw-out WastebasketI've noticed that Amazon seems to list reviews of different Bonsaii units together under multiple units so make sure you are looking at the proper item when you read my review.I previously had several smaller paper shredders. You know, the usual kind that sit next to your desk and have a slot on the top to feed paper in. These worked fine but I found that they were always filling up too quickly and the process to empty them was less than ideal (having to lift the bulky and somewhat heavy shredding unit off of the can in order to dump the can out). They also took up valuable floor space since the paper fed in from the top.That's where this Bonsaii model comes in! Not only does it solve your paper shredding needs, but it doubles as a great printer stand with built-in hidden storage! The unit is quite strong and seems like it can easily support almost any printer. I have a small HP LaserJet sitting on top of it and it fits perfectly. The paper feeds in through an angled slot on the front. Below the slot there is a large door that opens to reveal the very large bag holding area where the shredded paper goes, and below that a small storage area separated by a shelf. I use the storage area to keep extra paper and toner cartridges.When you open the door there is a pull out metal rack that you use to attach the trash bag to the unit. You simply feed a bag through the rack and wrap the upper edges around the rack to hold it in place. Then you slide the rack with bag attached back into the unit. The unit comes with several large Bonsaii specific bags but you can probably just use any trash bag. I've actually been dumping the bags out into a regular trash bag and then reusing the Bonsaii bag, but if you want to skip that step you can just throw the trash bag away straight out of the shredder.The door has a safety interlock so the shredder cannot be operated while the door is open.The shredder is very quiet compared to other ones that I've used. With other shredders sometimes I would be needing to shred things late at night but would hold off until the next day because I didn't want to wake other people up. With this shredder I use it in the middle of the night without fear of it making too much noise.I've only found a few downsides so far. First, it can only shred up to 6 sheets at a time. I would probably only do 5 sheets maximum just to avoid any potential jams. It does sound like the shredder is having to work hard to shred multiple sheets, but I think this is because it doesn't have a large amount of power in order to keep the motor operation as quiet as it is. Kind of along the same lines, it can't shred credit cards or CDs. This isn't a huge deal to me but it was nice having the ability to shred old cards or computer CDs every once in awhile.Overall this is the best shredder I've ever owned. It's quiet, can hold quite a bit of shreds before needing to be emptied, makes a great printer stand, and hides away both the shreds and any supplies you want to store in it. In fact, most people will probably just think it's a printer stand until you reveal it's a hidden shredder!","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1IC89T16EMCA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IOFISO8#wasThisHelpful","R1IC89T16EMCA","A2NMNWHKR9FTAT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NMNWHKR9FTAT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These full adhesive notes are exactly what I was looking for! I have a habit of writing to-do items and ongoing project notes on Post-its and then sticking them all around my keyboard on my desk so I can easily reference them. The regular Post-its have a tendency to start peeling off after a few days, most likely because papers, my arm, etc. are brushing up against them and peeling them back. These full adhesive notes aren't going anywhere! They stick completely flush to my desk and I don't have any issues with them peeling off. The bottom edge of the note has a space with no adhesive so they are still easy to peel off when you want to remove them.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1IB6ECM24IS4Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005GZ21GK#wasThisHelpful","R1IB6ECM24IS4Y","A2NMNWHKR9FTAT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NMNWHKR9FTAT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Great software! Like many of you I had been using TurboTax for years but their recent changes prompted me to give H&R Block (formerly TaxCut) another look. The software was just as easy to use for my situation as TurboTax was. I had regular income, investment income, mortgage deductions, and rental property and the Premium edition handled it all fine.As an added bonus H&R Block offers a 10% refund bonus that can be applied to a large amount of store gift cards if you so choose. TurboTax offers something similar but last time I used it you could only get an Amazon gift card. So if you are into the bonus thing H&R Block has a lot more options such as restaurants, retail stores, etc.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3SM15GZ8KXXL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PG8FZTW#wasThisHelpful","R3SM15GZ8KXXL","A2NMNWHKR9FTAT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NMNWHKR9FTAT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I purchased two of these devices to use in monitoring the temperature and humidity levels on different floors of my home. When I received them I placed them right next to each other and both continued registering the same values throughout the course of the day. These values also matched a larger thermometer that I had so I conclude that at least the temperature portion is accurate. The humidity portion also seems accurate, at least to the point that both units register the same value.These have built in magnetic backs so they are easy to attach to a file cabinet, refrigerator, etc. for easy monitoring. They also include an adhesive backed slim piece of metal so you can stick the metal on any surface and then the device will mount using the magnet as usual.All in all this is exactly what I was looking for. It's compact and does what I need it to.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R178F6CA7P9RVD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000H6CZQE#wasThisHelpful","R178F6CA7P9RVD","A2NMNWHKR9FTAT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NMNWHKR9FTAT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Well, these are Post-it Notes. Hopefully you already know how they work.I got these as I like to keep ongoing and daily tasks organized one per note at work. I wanted different colors to differentiate between to-do list type tasks and longer term projects.The adhesive on these is pretty good. It could be a tad bit stronger as they routinely slip around on my desk or other surfaces I have them stuck to, but they do stay put for the most part. There is a stronger version available and also a kind where the entire back of the paper is coated in adhesive, but I don't want to spend the extra money on those other kinds when these work good for my purposes.My package came with the following color mixture (which I assume is how they all come):2 packs of yellow2 packs of orange/red2 packs of purple4 packs of blue4 packs of green/blueI would have preferred that it came with 4 packs of yellow instead of 4 packs of the green/blue as the green/blue color is similar to the blue color. So basically you get 8 pads that are a similar color and then only 2 each of the other 3 colors.All in all these are a great buy and give you some better organizational options rather than just having all yellow notes stuck everywhere.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RAHSEMW3I46ZD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0002DOC68#wasThisHelpful","RAHSEMW3I46ZD","A2NMNWHKR9FTAT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NMNWHKR9FTAT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"These speakers will surprise you! Not only are they fairly small compared to big floor standing speakers, but they are SO inexpensive. You can't even get a single speaker from most other companies for the price that you pay here for a set of two! They have great range. Not a ton of bass, but that is expected, although they will surprise you with the amount of bass they do deliver. Highs and mid-tones sound great. I connected these to my turntable and small amp and they work great as a little separate music listening station with the turntable in between the two speakers. It really is hard to beat these speakers for the price. You'd probably have to spend hundreds more to get a noticeable gain in sound quality.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RTTY362YVSXTD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002RMPHMU#wasThisHelpful","RTTY362YVSXTD","A2NMNWHKR9FTAT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NMNWHKR9FTAT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I originally bought this printer just so I had a way to occasionally print color accented documents (flyers, signs, etc.). My primary printer is an HP laser printer but that just prints in black. This Canon printer is AMAZING for the price!It uses four small ink cartridges (cyan, magenta, yellow, and black) and one large black ink cartridge (the larger black cartridge is used when you are just printing regular documents that don't need color). The cartridges that come with the printer say ""SETUP"" on them so I suspect they are not quite as full of ink as the replacements you buy. As is always the case with inkjet printers the ink is fairly expensive and doesn't last nearly as long as a toner cartridge in a laser printer would, but I find them to be acceptable. I was able to print 30 or so full page color flyers/photos at the highest setting before one of the initial cartridges needed to be replaced.As I'm sure you've already read the printer can do both black and white and color copies. I've used this quite a bit as it's a very handy feature if you just need a copy every now and then (don't use it for high volume or you'll go bankrupt on ink!). The copy speed is fast even for color copies.I have the printer sitting across the room from my computer desk on it's own little table. The nice thing about it being wireless is that you literally just plug in the power cord and you're done. It will work from anywhere in your house without additional cables from your router or computer.The only other cable you may need to connect is a telephone line if you plan on using the fax features. Since I rarely use the fax portion I just plug in a long telephone cable whenever I need to send a fax and then unplug the telephone cable when I'm done.The printer has two trays on the front. The lower tray holds regular sized paper and can just be left full with plain paper. If you want to print a large sheet of photo paper you can just sit it on top of the plain paper so it gets fed into the printer next. For smaller pieces of paper such as 4x6"" photo paper you can use the top tray. There is also a CD tray that allows you to print labels directly on CDs or DVDs that have a printable surface.Another neat thing with this printer is that the front paper output tray can be left closed when not in use. This way dust isn't settling on the tray or getting inside the printer. As soon as you go to print something the tray will automatically flip down so there is a place for the paper to go after it has been printed.THE BEST FEATURE:I've saved the best for last. THE SCANNER! This printer is worth the price even if you never print anything from it! I would buy it for the scanner alone!Since it's wireless you don't need to attach it to your computer. Just lift the lid, place whatever you want to scan inside, and then connect to the scanner from your computer. This is a very nice convenience as I was used to having to plug a USB scanner into my laptop every time I wanted to scan something. Now I don't have to mess with any wires or move the scanner or laptop to be near each other.When you place multiple photos or other documents on the scanner at the same time the scanner will automatically recognize the borders of each document and scan them to separate files. This is a very nice time-saving feature when you are scanning large amounts of old photos. Just place as many photos as you can fit at a time on the scanner and they will all become separate image files with one pass of the scanner!The feature that has spoiled me the most is the sheet feeder. In the past I would have to individually scan pages of a document if I wanted to create a PDF. Many times I would be scanning 10-20 page contracts and would have to insert each page, wait for the scanner to scan, click a button on the screen, then insert the next page, and so on until the entire document was scanned. With this Canon scanner you simply place the ENTIRE document in the sheet feeder on top and with one click it scans all the pages and creates a PDF file (and very quickly at that!). This has saved me so much time and frustration!This printer is a STEAL for the price! I look at it as a great scanner that just happens to come with a free printer and fax machine!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3H6R4B6GMUSXR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AVWKUJS#wasThisHelpful","R3H6R4B6GMUSXR","A2NMNWHKR9FTAT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NMNWHKR9FTAT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I really like this table. It has a sleek modern look without the high price usually associated with modern furnishings. The tabletop is made out of wood with a glossy white paint finish applied. When I first received the table the top had a corner chipped off of it, which I suspect was due to the very tight packaging that the table comes in. I contacted the manufacturer and they promptly sent me a new tabletop that was very well packed. Also, be aware that some of the chrome frame pieces may have very slight imperfections on them (scratches, weld marks, etc.), but I don't think anybody will really notice these unless you inspect the table closely.

"I wanted a space heater that included a fan so the heat would actually get spread around the room rather than just radiate straight up from the unit (like most heaters). This item seemed to fit the bill and produced a nice amount of heat along with a fairly powerful fan, however on the particular one I received the fan had some type of clicking/rubbing noise while operating. I was expecting the usually whooshing sound of a fan (which would have been fine), but this other sound was more like a piece of plastic or something was hitting the fan as it spun and was very distracting.

"This is a perfect case for me. It completely protects the sides and back of the phone without adding much bulk to the phone. The back is a clear hard plastic so you can still see what the actual phone looks like behind it. The sides are rubberized to make pushing the side buttons easy but the rubber is not too sticky so it will still easily slide into and out of your pocket. The sides of the case are just slightly taller than the screen of the phone so you can place the phone screen down on a table without the screen actually touching the table. The back of the case has a similar design with the clear plastic being thicker than the new iPhone 6 camera since the camera now protrudes from the rear of the phone a bit. This along with some small raised edges on the back prevent the camera lens from coming into contact with anything when you lay the phone down.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R6O7NKQ4PGW7I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JH88B1Q#wasThisHelpful","R6O7NKQ4PGW7I","A2NMNWHKR9FTAT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NMNWHKR9FTAT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is one of those products that is designed so well it's almost like a work of art. When not in use it folds completely flat. To use it you just flip open each end. The bottom piece has a standard size tripod mounting socket and the top piece is spring loaded. It has rubber grips on each end to securely hold your phone in place, and the tension from the spring loaded top piece makes sure the phone wouldn't go anywhere once you have it in the grip.As a bonus there seems to be enough space within the grip so you can slightly tilt the phone up or down once you have it in the grip. For instance you can place the bottom of the phone towards the front of the grip, and the top of the phone towards the back of the grip and your camera will then be aimed up a little bit. This is nice if you want to just use this device on its own without a tripod. You can just sit it on a table or something and still aim it up and down a bit to get a good shot. Pretty useful since it can fold flat and be thrown in your pocket if you don't want to take a whole tripod with you.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R35726N32EI68K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009GHYLKS#wasThisHelpful","R35726N32EI68K","A2NMNWHKR9FTAT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NMNWHKR9FTAT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Overall I really like the Fire TV. The interface is fast and Amazon content begins playing extremely fast. I won't repeat what all the other reviews say regarding the hardware itself.However, I am disappointed at the moment as the Showtime Anytime app does not allow DirecTV customers to use it. I also own an AppleTV and bought the Amazon Fire TV primarily to use it with Showtime Anytime since Showtime Anytime is not available on the AppleTV. I use the AppleTV for HBO GO (which is not on the Fire TV at the moment), so I figured I would just switch between the two devices in order to get Showtime Anytime and HBO GO.I am hopeful that Showtime Anytime will be available on the Fire TV for DirecTV customers soon, and also hope that Amazon is able to add HBO GO in the future so I can just use the Fire TV for everything.The Fire TV has potential, but if you are a DirecTV customer and want to use Showtime Anytime be aware that this is not possible right now.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R25QTRLPWW0ZG2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CX5P8FC#wasThisHelpful","R25QTRLPWW0ZG2","A2NMNWHKR9FTAT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NMNWHKR9FTAT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"You just can't find a better turntable at this price. Not only does this model sound incredible but it also looks fantastic even when it's not in use!When you receive the turntable it will be packaged very well from the factory. Make sure you save the box so you can safely relocate it later if you move! Inside the box you'll find the plastic dust cover and below that the main turntable plinth/tonearm assembly and in the very bottom of the box the metal platter and felt mat packaged separately. There's also a bag with the instructions and the various accessories and cables.Installation is very easy even though this is an entry-level audiophile device. First you loop the included drive belt around the motor pulley and platter hub. Then you simply sit the metal platter on top.Next you place the downforce weight at the rear of the tonearm and adjust it until the tonearm will ""float"" and remain balanced without pitching forward or backwards. Once you get it to do this you rotate the inner portion of the weight until the ""0"" mark lines up with the indicator line. Now when you twist the back portion of the weight it will move the numbers as well so you can properly set the downforce. The manual shows the proper downforce for the included cartridge or you set it to whatever your cartridge says if you are using something different.Once you have the downforce set you loop the skating weight line over one of three points on the tonearm (the manual also explains which point to use based on the downforce), then you feed the weight itself through the metal loop that allows it to hang freely.That's basically it for the initial setup. The cartridge itself is already installed from the factory so you don't need to mess with any of its settings unless you have replaced it with something different.The dustcover simply slides over the two pegs at the rear of the turntable and can then be pivoted open and closed.The audio outputs, power connection, and power switch are all mounted underneath the main deck and are set back just enough so they remain pretty well hidden from view. The rocker-style power switch is under the front left side and is very easy to switch on and off.The turntable comes with a decent set of RCA cables that also has a grounding wire incorporated into the cables which makes things less cluttered.Note that since the drive motor is located beneath the platter you will need to remove the platter each time you want to switch between 33 and 45 RPM. To do this you remove the platter and then move the drive belt to one of two positions on the pulley. Alternatively Pro-Ject sells a speed box that allows you to adjust the speed with the push of a button. I suspect I will buy this rather soon as even though moving the belt isn't that difficult I really don't like putting extra wear and tear on the belt all the time, plus the speed box supposedly smoothes out the power signal and provides a noticeable increase in sound quality (but don't worry, the sound quality is great to begin with).Also note that this turntable, like pretty much any good one you look at, will require a pre-amp if your amp does not have one built in. If you are new to turntables this may be something you weren't aware of. You will connect the RCA audio outputs from the turntable to the pre-amp, and then from the pre-amp run another set of RCA cables to your actual amp or receiver.A special note: When you receive your turntable make sure you give it a good physical inspection. The first one I received had one of the corners chipped off and upon further inspection had horizontal cracking in the wood around each of the two dust cover mounts on the back. It looked like the dust cover mounts themselves had been tightened too much. I contacted the seller and they were very pleasant to deal with and offered to immediately send me a replacement, however when they inspected the rest of their stock they discovered that all of the ones they had also had the horizontal cracks around the dust cover mounts. Apparently there was a bad batch of these from the factory. I ended up ordering from a different retailer and luckily received one without the cracks.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2PBTJGYLBC65O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008RA9YSE#wasThisHelpful","R2PBTJGYLBC65O","A2NMNWHKR9FTAT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NMNWHKR9FTAT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Even though I will probably never use the CD it was a nice bonus to receive the UK edition.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2O9X33SNPWUZF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008B11R2A#wasThisHelpful","R2O9X33SNPWUZF","A2NMNWHKR9FTAT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NMNWHKR9FTAT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was looking for a compact case to store some digital photo backups. My main criteria was I wanted a case that could store more than the usual six or ten discs but I also wanted something that could fit into a safe deposit box or small safe.This case is perfect for my use. It has twelve double-sided pages so you can insert two discs in each page. The outer shell is a soft yet rigid design that holds it's shape and provides protection for the contents. It also has a nice zipper closure so nothing can fall out or easily get in from the outside while it is closed.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2VUGMINPMEOP5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00011KM38#wasThisHelpful","R2VUGMINPMEOP5","A2NMNWHKR9FTAT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NMNWHKR9FTAT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I got this phone to use in my home office. The main things I was looking for were great speakerphone performance and a mute button as I spend lots of time on conference calls and needed a way to simply leave them on speakerphone and mute for when I'm not actively talking.For the speakerphone portion I knew I wanted a phone that required separate AC power as the phones that try to power the speaker phone simply off the phone line power aren't very good. This phone does use the separate AC power adapter and the speakerphone works great. The speaker is nice and loud and I never have complaints from people on the other end when I am talking on speakerphone.The mute button is right along the bottom of the phone making it easy to access. My only complaint with the mute button is that it doesn't have any indication to show that it is enabled. The speakerphone button has a nice red LED light next to it to show that the speakerphone is on. It would have been nice if the mute button had a similar light to let you know when you have mute on. As it is the only indication that the phone is muted is via a ""MUTE"" notice on the main LCD display at the top of the phone. Unfortunately the display at the top of the phone can't be angled up at all so it lays almost flat with the phone, and at the same time it is not backlit at all. This means that the display is VERY hard to read when you are sitting at your desk. You have to lean forward until your head is almost directly above the phone in order to read the display, and thus tell if you have mute on or off.The phone allows two lines to be used and also has a conference call button to connect both lines together. It also has a headset input so you can easily attach a headset if you'd prefer to use that instead of the speakerphone or handset.The white strip down the side of the phone looks similar to a speed dial list on other phones, but that's not what it is for on this phone. This phone can actually be used as part of a multiple phone setup for your small office or even in your house if you want. You will need to install this same model of phone in all areas but once you do you can assign each phone an extension number and then call between the phones directly or page through the remote phones. This makes a nice little intercom system without requiring an actual central phone system. I don't use this feature since I just have a single phone but it seems like a nice addition.Overall I am pleased with the phone. The lack of a light on the mute button is a slight annoyance but honestly I couldn't find any other phones with the features I wanted so I can live with it.If you're looking for a desk phone with a good speakerphone then you should really consider this model.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R9U63PILLBQ3P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00009MVHF#wasThisHelpful","R9U63PILLBQ3P","A2NMNWHKR9FTAT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NMNWHKR9FTAT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

It sits how it sits.Some nice additions on this keyboard include the separate volume and mute keys and a dedicated key to bring up the Windows calculator.This is honestly exactly what I was looking for despite it being one of the absolute least expensive keyboards out there.

"This is a fantastic monitor. I liked it so much I ended up buying two!My main concern when buying a monitor is the issue of ""dead"" or ""hot"" pixels. Either a pixel that is always off resulting in a noticeable black dot or a pixel that is always on resulting in a dot of color that never changes. Many people don't consider this an issue but for me once I notice one of these pixels on my monitor it bothers me from that point on.The first thing I do when I get a new monitor, laptop, tablet, cell phone, etc. is run through several different images of just solid colors and carefully examine the whole screen to make sure there are no dead pixels. When I did this with both of the monitors I bought I found zero problems. This is great as I really hate having to ship monitors back and forth.This monitor is nice and bright, provides great viewing angles, and offers a nice matte screen (unlike many computers these days that come with glossy highly reflective screens).Bottom line: This is a terrific monitor that won't disappoint you!","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1USLEOVKM0DIQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005LN1JEC#wasThisHelpful","R1USLEOVKM0DIQ","A2NMNWHKR9FTAT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NMNWHKR9FTAT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I've always liked remote controlled models. I had several radio controlled cars when I was younger and always dreamed of building an airplane or helicopter that could really fly.Unfortunately the larger flying models ended up being difficult to fly and maintain. Not because I couldn't  build them, but more because they require a lot of space to operate and also can break VERY easily if you aren't well practiced in how to fly them. Put simply I wanted a toy I could mess around with but not something I had to spend hours and hours working on as a full-time hobby.The Syma S107 helicopter is simply amazing. You can seriously take this thing out of the box, charge it up, and begin flying it without any practice or any worries. It flies amazingly stable! As long as you don't ""floor it"" and push the stick all the way to the top immediately you'll be fine (otherwise you'll fly straight into the ceiling). The helicopter can easily simply hover in one spot. This ability to me is just amazing when you consider how much design and technology has to go into accomplishing something like this.The body is actually very durable with a mostly metal frame. The blades themselves utilize a folding design that means you can fly this into the wall, ceiling, floor, etc. without much worry about damaging it. I've run it into the wall and other objects many times and even though the blades start striking the wall and the helicopter falls to the ground I have yet to damage it. Many times it will fall down and land upright so I can just crank it up from the remote again and start flying without even having to touch it!The helicopter uses an infrared remote control rather than radio, but surprisingly this works great inside. I can only guess that the remote puts out a very bright and wide angle infrared signal because it will even work if the helicopter is around corners or if the remove is behind an object.While flying you have three controls:- The left stick moves only up and down and does not automatically reset itself. This is used to control the speed of the helicopter blades, which in turn determine the altitude that your helicopter will fly at. Since you can take your finger off the left stick and it will remain in place you are able to get the helicopter to a hovering altitude and leave it there ""hands-free"".- The right stick moves both up and down and left and right. Moving it left and right changes the speed at which the counter-rotating main blades spin, thus causing the helicopter to turn left or right. Moving the stick up and down causes the helicopter to pitch forward or backwards (by using a smaller propeller at the tail of the helicopter). When the helicopter is pitched forward it causes the main blades to then propel the whole helicopter forward. The reverse is true when you have it pitched backwards.The remote control unit takes four AA batteries. The helicopter itself has a built in lithium battery that can be recharged either through the included USB cable or via a small cable that pulls out of the bottom of the remote control. I recommend charging the helicopter using the USB cable when possible so you can prolong the life of the batteries you have in your remote control. I actually just connect the USB cable to a standard iPhone charger and charge the helicopter that way.A nice feature of the USB cable is that it has a light that lights up when the helicopter is fully charged so you know it's ready to go. Charging time is somewhere around an hour and provides you with about seven to nine minutes of flight. When the battery starts running low the helicopter simply won't fly as high. Even when you have the blade speed maxxed out you'll notice that the helicopter will slowly start drifting downward until eventually it won't have enough power to even lift off the floor.I'm in my thirties and have this little guy sitting on my desk in my home office. It's a great little toy to fly around for a few minutes as a break! If you've always wanted a little helicopter but don't have the time or the drive to mess around with the big models then get this! It provides great straight out of the box fun and the price is right!","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1U7XKY34YF8W8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004A8ZRB0#wasThisHelpful","R1U7XKY34YF8W8","A2NMNWHKR9FTAT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NMNWHKR9FTAT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This thing is very impressive especially given its price. The technology that goes into these is simply amazing the way it is able to individually control each of the four propellers and automatically keep the model level.A word of caution though: This little guy is very fast and takes lots of practice to fly accurately. If you are used to the other standard Syma helicopters this is a totally different ball game. The other helicopters are very easy to fly and can be used even in small rooms because of their stability. This one requires a very large room or even outside on a calm day because it is so fast and it is also easy to lose control of if you aren't well practiced with the multiple controls.The model has an automatic feature which will let you do a flip with it. This is very cool since this move is a complex combination of propeller actions but with this model you just push a single button and you do a perfect flip. The only downside is that you will lose quite a bit of altitude when doing this so you really need to be outside or in a large gym or something.A very important tip that I learned: The model will automatically calibrate itself to ""level"" as soon as you turn the power switch on the model to the ON position. This means that if you are holding the model or lifting it up slightly in order to access the switch then as soon as you move the switch it will assume that whatever way you are holding it is level. If this happens then you will notice that the model constantly pulls one way or another because it thinks it is flying level. Therefore you have to make sure that you have the model totally level and flat on the ground when you turn the power switch to ON. Otherwise you'll be trying to adjust the trim settings to no avail in order to correct the lean of the model while in flight.","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1X62X84YH53W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0096SJU3U#wasThisHelpful","R1X62X84YH53W","A2NMNWHKR9FTAT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NMNWHKR9FTAT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This scoop is great. It's simple and durable. It is pure stainless steel without any type of metallic coating like other scoops have. This means that the coating will never start flaking off and getting into your ice cream. It also means that you can toss this in the dishwasher or simply rinse it off without any worries.One thing that I've noticed with this scoop compared to others is that it really can dig into the hardest frozen of ice cream. With other scoops I was having to pop the ice cream in the microwave for a few seconds to make it at least slightly soft. No need with this beast.

"I, like many of you reading this I suspect, grew up watching ""Battle of the Planets"" in the United States. It wasn't until many years later that I learned about Gatchaman and how Battle of the Planets was a modified version of the original.I still have a few VHS tapes from the very early 80's with the original airings of Battle of the Planets on them, but other than that I largely had forgotten about the show for the past thirty years. There were some previous releases of Gatchaman on DVD but for whatever reason I never really looked into them.A friend and I were recently having a discussion about Gatchaman as he is a fan too, which prompted me to look it up on Amazon. Much to my delight I saw that this new Blu-ray release had just become available. I ordered it immediately.Now that I've received it I've watched a few episodes and am having flashbacks to my childhood. One day I will get the time to watch the whole series but for now just a few episodes are great. Having the option to choose between multiple languages and subtitles also provides several ways to experience these original episodes.If you were a fan of Battle of the Planets then this is the set for you. You won't get 7-Zark-7 or 1-Rover-1 (those were added to the American version to make up for the scenes that were cut out), but you will get the original Japanese version of the shows with all their uncensored violence and original dialogue.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R29IM9I79KAY6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DPH7SZA#wasThisHelpful","R29IM9I79KAY6","A2NMNWHKR9FTAT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NMNWHKR9FTAT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This case is ridiculously overpriced for what it is, but honestly it is the best case you can get so if you can afford it I would recommend getting it and not wasting your time with the cheaper cases. It fits the Kindle Paperwhite perfectly and is as slim as possible. This case truly transforms your Kindle Paperwhite into a slim book that just happens to be electronic. You can slip the Kindle into your bag or backpack without worrying about scratching the screen.I tried several other cases and none of them came close to the fit and finish of the genuine Amazon case.

"I can't say enough good things about this book!Richard Dawkins explains practically every scientific element that has been incorrectly explained by religions for thousands of years. He does it in a simple, matter-of-fact way that is easy to understand no matter your education level. Mr. Dawkins is well known for his often in-your-face attitude about religion, but in this particular book he tones it down a bit and treads lightly on the topic while at the same time dismissing all the old religious misconceptions about science.From evolution to plate tectonics to the reason the Earth has seasons... and everything in between! Dawkins explains each item completely and also dedicates some space at the beginning of each chapter to review the religious misconceptions and past (incorrect) explanations for why things happens. He then proceeds to go over the real reasons behind each item.I truly wish that this book was required reading for all children. Even more so I wish that most extremely religious adults would read this book as well. It really is written in a way that is tasteful and would hopefully convince people that the ""magic"" they see is simply the ""reality"" of science! I just hope that Dawkins name doesn't steer people away, but I know it will.

I also use them in devices that don't get used often such as flashlights and emergency radios.Rechargables are nice, but they don't hold their charge for long periods of time between uses so they aren't well suited for emergency items.

I actually just keep them all separate rather than using the little chain that connects them. They also store easily in your drawer since you can nest them all together.

"I wanted to like the new Kindle Paperwhite. I tend to read my Kindle books on my iPhone and was looking for a little bit larger screen and also a device that wouldn't be a total loss if it were to get damaged at the beach, by the pool, etc. (vs. my actual phone that contains much more than just the Kindle software).I first purchased the new Paperwhite at a local Best Buy store. Upon opening it and powering it on there were very noticeable ""specks"" underneath the top layer of the screen. These were not visible when the display light was off, but as soon as the light was on, even at its lowest setting, these spots would become visible. The best way I can describe it is that there is some type of dust or other imperfection that is between the top layer of the screen where the light is and the screen itself. When the light turns on it hits these specks from the side and causes bright white spots to appear on the display.Since these bright white spots were right in the middle of the display they were right in the middle of each page of the book. I returned the first Paperwhite to Best Buy and decided that I would just buy it directly from Amazon because I figured Amazon would be better able to support their own product in case I got another one with this flaw.I ordered the second Paperwhite from Amazon and when it arrived I was disappointed to find that it too had the same issue. This time the specks were a little lower on the screen than before.I contact Amazon support to have the item exchanged. Amazon requires that you actually call and speak to somebody before returning or exchanging a Kindle, presumably because they want to make sure you understand how to use it and aren't returning it for a simple problem that they can fix over the phone.When I called and explained the problem the support person I got kept insisting that bright spots along the side of the screen were normal. I already knew this as there was significant coverage in major tech website's reviews about the bright edge lighting on the Paperwhite. This was not my issue at all though as I was totally aware of and expected the slightly brighter light along the edges of the Paperwhite. The bright edge lighting does not bother me at all as it is on the edge and not in the middle of the screen where it will be in your line of sight while reading. After explaining the issue several times the agent seemed to reluctantly agree to send me a replacement Paperwhite.The replacement Paperwhite arrived a few days later and, not surprisingly at this point, had the same issue but this time there were even more specks and they were once again right in the middle of the screen. Once again I contacted Amazon by phone to inquire about a replacement. This time the agent was very defensive and indicated that ""Amazon is fully aware of this issue but has chosen not to offer replacements for it"" (the agent's words). I was told that my only options were to either keep the one I had or return it for a refund and ""choose another Kindle device"" but that they would not allow me to exchange it for another Paperwhite. If I had known this was going to be the case I wouldn't have returned the second device because at least with it there were less specks and they were lower on the screen.In any event I ended up just returning the third Paperwhite as well and have since started using other devices to read Kindle books. Generally I find Amazon's customer service to be top-notch and have been a frequent and long-time customer of theirs, so I was a bit surprised that they didn't want to fully support their flagship product. Having known issues with the display and not wanting to fix them seems unusual for Amazon.Some people may look at this as being picky, but when I am going to be reading thousands of pages of text on a display I want it to be absolutely perfect and not have a bright white dot in the middle of the page. It it was a regular book then it would be fine because it would only affect a single page, but on the Kindle that display is EVERY page of EVERY book you read.Since this flaw was present on three separate devices purchased from two different sources, and Amazon even told me on the phone that it is a known issue, then I must assume that it is an issue on a a large percentage of the devices but most people either don't notice it or don't care about it.If you decide to purchase the Paperwhite and are at all sensitive to ""dead pixels"" or bright spots on your computer monitor then make sure you give the Kindle screen a good inspection when you receive it to ensure there aren't any of these specks that reflect light trapped between your screen.","1.0 out of 5 stars","January 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJA9W9514VWM5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AWH595M#wasThisHelpful","RJA9W9514VWM5","A2NMNWHKR9FTAT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NMNWHKR9FTAT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is hands down the best set of cookware I've ever owned! Each piece simply screams quality from the moment you open the box.The design is very modern and functional. You will be amazed at the sheer weight of each item. The large pot is several pounds! The shine on the steel is great and holds up fine in the dishwasher.Since these are pure ""professional grade"" stainless steel items you don't have to worry about hand cleaning them to protect any type of non-stick coatings. These are stainless through and through and can easily be thrown in the dishwasher. Without the non-stick finish there is the possibility of food sticking more than you are used to, but personally I haven't had any issues and I like knowing that there aren't any strange chemicals from the finish wearing off on my food.If you are looking for a nice complete set of cookware then look no further. I looked at everything here on Amazon as well as what was available at several local stores and finally settled on this set. Once it arrived I knew I had made the right choice!","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2DB49F92SVC7A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009JXPS6U#wasThisHelpful","R2DB49F92SVC7A","A2NMNWHKR9FTAT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NMNWHKR9FTAT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I purchased these nylon spoons as an alternative to the traditional wooden spoons. They work great and are super easy to clean in the dishwasher!I've used them for baking needs as well as for mixing things such as hot pasta and vegetables on the stove top. They are very sturdy and the nylon surface doesn't give food a place to stick to like it tends to do on the wooden spoons.Overall these are a great wooden spoon replacement for your kitchen. I will probably buy a few more in the future.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3RJH4364IYAA7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0000DZCJC#wasThisHelpful","R3RJH4364IYAA7","A2NMNWHKR9FTAT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NMNWHKR9FTAT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I've wanted this tea kettle ever since I first saw it many many years ago. The whimsical yet modern design adds a great finishing touch to any kitchen. This is a piece that you will want to leave on your cooktop all the time as a great accent piece.Not only is the design fun but it is also a great tea kettle! The circular handle provides easy pouring and is mounted high enough to not interfere with filling the water through the top. The classic red bird whistle works just as you would expect it to. Some people may find that having to manually pull out the bird before pouring the water is an extra step compared to other kettles where the whistle simply flips up, but this doesn't bother me at all.The whole kettle looks great with a fantastic silver shine! This is definitely an extremely expensive item as far as function goes, but you are definitely paying for form over function in this case and the form is a classic that will look great in your kitchen! Highly recommended to anybody who is interested in art and design.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RXH5XGYBLADLU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00004Y6FT#wasThisHelpful","RXH5XGYBLADLU","A2NMNWHKR9FTAT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NMNWHKR9FTAT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I can't say enough about this flatware set. At first I bought two sets, but after receiving them I ended up buying another set so I have service for twelve people. I didn't want to risk them not being available any longer later!Each piece has a great balanced weight to it and feels like a quality item in your hand. These are very modern looking and at the same time very functional. The handle of each utensil is a triangular shape which is very unique among other flatware sets that I looked at. It makes holding these very comfortable since your fingers have three sides to grip rather than the usual two sides on standard flatware.The 18/10 finish gives everything a timeless shine that doesn't wear off. Just running them through the dishwasher produces a shine that will make people think they are polished!If you are looking for a modern set of flatware that will last a lifetime you've found what you should buy!","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1RBI99VLOH68L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AF78D02#wasThisHelpful","R1RBI99VLOH68L","A2NMNWHKR9FTAT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NMNWHKR9FTAT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the perfect colander for making ""normal"" sized meals for a few people. You might need the 5-quart model if you are cooking for a large family, but for me this size is perfect. It easily can hold a few servings of pasta (a box of macaroni for example). The stainless steel design seems very durable and also cleans easily in the dishwasher. The rubberized grips add a nice touch and the rubberized bottom makes for soft placement on any surface. You can easily sit this directly in your sink and pour pasta into it to let it drain hands-free.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RFC7OM2PCJJG8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008NLHPN8#wasThisHelpful","RFC7OM2PCJJG8","A2NMNWHKR9FTAT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NMNWHKR9FTAT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the perfect scanner to go with your laptop. It is very small and does not require a separate power supply. I keep mine tucked away under my desk and only take it out when I need it. That way it isn't always just consuming valuable desk space. When I need to use it all I have to do is plug it into the USB port on my computer and it's ready to go!This scanner and the Canon software allows you to do multiple things. I mainly use it for scanning documents to PDFs and also for scanning in color photograph prints.As a PDF creator it is nice because you can easily convert your paper documents to PDFs for sending contracts or for just eliminating some clutter and moving your file cabinet into your computer. The only downside is that since it doesn't have any type of document feeder you have to scan each page separate which can be a little time consuming if you have large multi-page documents.For photos it works great. I'm slowly converting a huge collection of family photos into digital copies so I can just manage all my ""new"" photos from digital cameras with my ""old"" photos from film on my computer in one giant library. A nice feature when scanning photos is that you can place multiple photos on the scanner at the same time and it will recognize where the edges of each photo are and automatically create separate image files for each photo. This allows you to quickly scan 3 or 4 photos at the same time.All in all this is a great little scanner and the price simply can't be beat!One piece of advice is you may need to run the platen calibration routine once you get the scanner setup. This is accessed from within the ScanGear software. I initially had an issue where my color photos had banding lines and a yellow offset to the color, but this was immediately fixed once I ran the calibration program.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 1, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3V4ZR1GERFG5Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003VQR1UC#wasThisHelpful","R3V4ZR1GERFG5Y","A2NMNWHKR9FTAT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NMNWHKR9FTAT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My cats really loved this fountain and it seemed to be a nice product at first, however after running for just a few hours it began to build up a foamy residue on the water. After taking the whole thing apart several times it seems that the water doesn't get filtered very will and quickly becomes dirty as it circulate through the system. This causes a nasty film to build up everywhere. I didn't feel that the water remained safe for my cats to drink so unfortunately I had to stop using it and switch back to their regular water bowls (much to their dismay).I think one of the issues is that this fountain holds so much water the cats will not drink it fast enough and you will end up with a good portion of the water that has been in the fountain for days as you keep just topping it off. Since the fountain is so large and heavy, and the power cord has to be placed just right under the fountain so it remains level, you won't be able to easily just pour out the water each day and start fresh. I think you'd be better off getting a smaller fountain that you can easily empty out completely and refill with fresh water each day.","1.0 out of 5 stars","September 1, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2NU06XI8DPJOY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001NIZAH6#wasThisHelpful","R2NU06XI8DPJOY","A2NMNWHKR9FTAT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NMNWHKR9FTAT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These lights shine as pure white for your daytime running lights. They look just like the pure white light you see on many brand new cars these days.Installation is super easy, you just swap out your existing bulbs for these and you're done!The only downside is that most cars that use these bulbs for the daytime running lights also use the same bulb (at a higher power) for the high beams. When you use these lights you will essentially be eliminating your high beams as these are designed to just be daytime running lights and don't function the same for the high beams as the halogen bulbs that you will be replacing.

"This case is exactly what I was looking for to use when I'm at the gym or outside exercising.Your phone slides in from the top and is held snugly inside. The headphone port has an access hole in the bottom of the case so you can easily plug your headphones in, and there is a small velcro flap on the side that allows you to coil your unused headphone cable around it so it isn't dangling everywhere while you are exercising.The armband itself fits me fine, but I can see where some other people might need the optional extension if you have super muscular arms. For me (average guy), it is close to the limit on how large the opening can go but still fits fine and stays tight.I have a slim case on my phone that adds a small amount of size to the phone, and it still fits in this armband without having to remove the phone from the case, which is exactly what I was looking for. I can slide my phone, case and all, into the armband, work out, and then quickly remove the phone and case and put it back in my pocket when I'm done.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 1, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2A66SWECR9VW2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009XGZGZG#wasThisHelpful","R2A66SWECR9VW2","A2NMNWHKR9FTAT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NMNWHKR9FTAT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Grace Wilde is an animal behaviorist with a special skill. She has the psychic ability to hear animals thoughts. However this skill doesn't carry over to hearing human thoughts, just animals. Being able to hear human thoughts would be mighty handy for Grace, especially as she's investigating a murder. That is the murder of her sister's abusive ex-husband, and the police have arrested Grace and are accusing her of murder!! In an attempt to clear her sister's name, Grace ends up hot on the trail of not just a killer, but also a missing horse. This is one mystery that is going to take all of Grace's sleuthing skills and psychic ability to solve.One of my biggest reasons for enjoying this series, besides my natural love of cozy mysteries, is that I really like reading about Grace's abilities. I'm a huge animal lover, and growing up I always wished I could understand my pets. As a kid I thought it would be really fun. Now as an adult, and the human servant to three felines, I'm not sure I want to know what they are thinking about!! However, it's Grace's abilities as a animal psychic that makes this series different to all the cozy mysteries released every month, and I really enjoy this aspect.I enjoyed the mystery aspect of Horse of a Different Killer, and I had a hard time untangling the clues that were laid about by Laura Morrigan for Grace (and myself too!) to solve. This was definitely a mystery that kept me guessing right until the end.This series is such a perfect fit for me, with my love of animals and mysteries alike, and I think many animal lovers and readers will simply fall head over heels for it. When a mystery starts with a cute, cuddly koala that Grace is trying to rescue, the cute factor is at a all-time high and you know it can only get better!If you haven't read it yet, pick up the first book in the series, Woof at the Door.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RGX0W9JP6FP23/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0425257215#wasThisHelpful","RGX0W9JP6FP23","A2XTCY5SSI6LQN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2XTCY5SSI6LQN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Connie Archer is back with another Soup Lover's Mystery with Ladle to the Grave. In Snowflake, Vermont, it's May and the residents are looking to welcome Spring in. However, Spring begins with a big bang, when a few locals participate in a Pagan festival, and one lady ends up dead! When the police determine the cause as poisoning from some herbs in a wine she drank, they start to point their finger at Lucky Jamieson's grandfather, Jack. Now Lucky will have her hands full between managing her soup shop, finding a killer and making a dress for her best friend's upcoming wedding!Ladle to the Grave was my first trip to Snowflake, VT, but it certainly won't be my last. Living in a country that has six months of winter I'm a big soup person. There is nothing better than curling up with a book and a big bowl of warm, hearty soup in the middle of winter!! That warm, cozy feeling is how I felt reading Ladle to the Grave.I really liked that Connie Archer started this book off with a murder. There was no slow opening chapters. No, she throws you right into the murder, leaving you to decide who could have wanted to kill this poor lady. Was it someone against the Pagan festival? Or was it something else? From there is a action packed story, as another death drops down on Lucky, and she races against time to figure out the killer before Jack ends up in jail!Ladle to the Grave was a fun read. As this was my first introduction to the series, I liked that I could read it without feeling lost. Connie Archer sets up the characters nicely for those new to the series, without repeating facts from previous mysteries. I liked the ecclectic mix of characters in Snowflake, and certainly loved the virtual smells of the soups Sage makes in Lucky's soup shop, By the Spoonful.All in all Ladle to the Grave was a very enjoyable mystery. With a tasty mystery, mouth-watering recipes to try, and even a wine to brew, it hit all the right spots, and I'm looking forward to reading more books in this series.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3PG7N6KS04I5S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0425273113#wasThisHelpful","R3PG7N6KS04I5S","A2XTCY5SSI6LQN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2XTCY5SSI6LQN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Suspendered Sentence is the fourth book in the Amish Mysteries by Laura Bradford. Claire Weatherly, owner of Heavenly Treasures, lives amongst the Amish and English in the town of Heavenly, Pennsylvania. She loves the quiet life in Heavenly, but it certainly isn't dull and boring. During the raising of a new barn, human bones are discovered and they are believed to belong to a Amish teenager, who ran away many years ago. With police officer, Jakob, and Claire on the trail, they try to piece together this cold case, and figure out who the killer is.I live in a town, where there are no Amish about, but that doesn't stop my curiosity about them and the lifestyle they lead. In some ways they have a simple, beautiful life, where they help each other when help is needed. Of course when it comes to crimes they are reticent about having police involvement, and this makes Jakob's job more difficult.The lastest installment in the Amish Mysteries is certainly a page-turning, unputdownable read. Laura Bradford beautifully describes the ups and downs of Amish life, in a almost lyrical style, and as her words drew me in, I found myself stepping alongside Claire, her Aunt, Diane, and police officer, Jakob, trying to solve the murder with them.The events that lead to this murder surround the rumspringa. For those that aren't family the rumspringa is a rite of passage available to Amish youth around the age of 16 when they are allowed to see the world outside the closed Amish community. It ends when the youths return to the community to be baptized into the Amish church or decide to remain outside it. It's a interesting time in the life of the young Amish and I like how this rite of passage was weaved through the mystery, letting readers learn more about this.As with the other books in this series, Laura Bradford doesn't disappoint with Suspendered Sentence. As befitting someone living in a Amish town, she is moving the relationship between Claire and Jakob at a perfect pace, and I enjoyed several toe-curling moments between them, and I look forward to seeing where the path leads for both of these characters.I had a wonderful time visiting the fine folks of Heavenly, and I absolutely cannot wait to tag along for another adventure, when the next book is released.If you are looking for a first class mystery, pick up the Amish Mysteries today. They are written so that you can pick up any book in the series, and just read, or to really do this series justice, pick up Hearse and Buggy, and enjoy four of the best mysteries on the market today.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1H7JGPKQEQE70/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LMGK6L4#wasThisHelpful","R1H7JGPKQEQE70","A2XTCY5SSI6LQN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2XTCY5SSI6LQN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In Fran Stewart's debut series she introduces readers to Margaret ""Peggy"" Winn. Peggy lives in Hamelin, Vermont, a town that is like a mini Scotland in America, and owns the Scotshop, a darling little store selling Scottish items. On a trip to Scotland, to purchase more items for her store, she brings home with her an unwanted gift in the form of a 600+ year old ghost, who she names Dirk. With a ghost following her around, marveling at all the changes in the last 600 years, Peggy is determined to carry on with her life, and put the heartbreak of finding her boyfriend in bed with her best friend, behind her. However, this proves difficult when her ex-boyfriend is found dead in her shop and her cousin is accused of murder. With the help of her ""wee ghostie"" Peggy and her friend set out to clear her cousin's name, and try to find a murderer.Fran Stewart has done something so incredibly right with this new series. She whisked me away to the land of Scotland right from the beginning, and the magic of Scotland carried through, even when Peggy returned back to Hamelin. Of course this was helped with the Scottish atmosphere of Hamelin, where kilts are aplenty, and of course thanks to Dirk, her wee Scottish ghostie.Dirk is the perfect gentleman, and everything about the 21st century is a surprise to him! Peggy tries to explain to him, but of course she's talking to a ghost, so at times Dirk has to fumble along for himself, lest Peggy looks like she's talking to thin air!! Dirk was a delight, and at times I found myself copying his old Scottish account, and delighting in his every action and word!The mystery in this debut book is very interesting, because Fran Stewart doesn't give us many suspects. With a mystery that involved hidden rooms, secrets codes and only a handful of suspects, I certainly had a hard time trying to solve it before Peggy and Dirk!Fran Stewart's debut is a strong start to what is going to be a fabulous series. She's created very memorable characters, full of charm and mischief, and readers will be fondly recalling this adventure long after they turn the last page. If you haven't picked up this first book in the Scot Shop Mysteries yet, go grab a copy today, because it is going to be one series you don't want to miss!","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RGQ32B1R2M7KC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LMGK41Q#wasThisHelpful","RGQ32B1R2M7KC","A2XTCY5SSI6LQN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2XTCY5SSI6LQN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In Leslie Budewitz's new series, she's spicing up the Seattle scene with a delectable culinary mystery to appeal to all the senses!After a corporate crash leaves Pepper Reece jobless, she opens up a spice shop, called Seattle Spice Shop. All is going well with her somewhat relationship with local restaurant owner, Alex Howard, and running her store. That is until she finds a dead body on her front step, and the dead person looks to be connected to one of her employees. With her nose to the ground, she's soon trying to catch the scent of a killer, that is if she can stay out of the way of her ex-husband, police officer, Tag Buhner.I really enjoyed the first book in Leslie Budewitz's debut series, the Food Lovers' Village Mysteries with Death Al Dente, and I was excited to hear that she was also releasing a second series, surrounding a spice store.Assault and Pepper is certainly a book for all the senses! Right from the first chapter I felt like I could almost smell the delicious scents that must waft in and out of the Seattle Spice Shop. The way the different spices, and recipes, are described I was practically racing to my local stores to try out lots of new spices!! With an atmosphere like this to begin with, the mystery that followed could have only made this debut novel better.I found it interesting that Pepper starts off with a boyfriend of sorts, especially as in in most cozy mystery debuts we see the sleuth as single and looking for the love of her life. I won't spoil this story line for readers, but I thoroughly enjoyed the direction that Leslie Budewitz takes Pepper, in both her business and her personal life, and I absolutely can't wait to see what kind of adventure she has in store for her next.The mystery was first class and it kept me guessing until the end. Leslie Budewitz certainly delivers in this new series: a first class mystery, delightful characters and when the mystery is all finished, there are mouth-watering recipes for the reader to try.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1DDJD5RMD4BT3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LMGK51A#wasThisHelpful","R1DDJD5RMD4BT3","A2XTCY5SSI6LQN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2XTCY5SSI6LQN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Jackie Parker, with her Damaged Goods Property Management crew, are back for another adventure. Reeling after the near death events in Final Notice, things aren't going smoothly for Jackie and her ex-marines husband, Luke. Especially not with the sexy Logan, Luke's brother and Jackie's one-time fling many years ago. However business is business and together they are off to evict to another dead beat in their jobs as property managers.  What begins with evictions leads to ""furries"", drug labs and murderers on the loose for the Damaged Goods team.I simply can't get enough of the Damaged Goods Mysteries. I really enjoyed the first book, Final Notice, and when I finished it I was eager for a second story. I patiently waited for a sequel and I was rewarded with ""Lease on the Beach"".Lease on the Beach was definitely worth the wait. Jennifer L. Hart has created a very intense relationship with Jackie and Luke, throw in the mix the sexy brother, Logan, and there is definitely drama aplenty. Jackie is not the usual airhead running into situations without warning, and I like that she does think about the situations before diving in. She is definitely a amateur sleuth worth following!Lease on the Beach was full of adventure on every page, and I loved every second of it. This is not a series that you will be bored with, and one that you will get thoroughly addicted to.I give Lease on the Beach five sparkling stars (if I could give it a trillion stars I would!) and I am very eager to visit with Jackie and the Parker boys again to find out what is in store for them next.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R32AAECU0R95Y7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OQWY0VS#wasThisHelpful","R32AAECU0R95Y7","A2XTCY5SSI6LQN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2XTCY5SSI6LQN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Fortunately, the Milk tells the story about a father that sets out to buy milk for his children's breakfast, and when he comes back he has a fantastical story to tell of aliens, pirates and dinosaurs flying in hot air balloons!I listened to Fortunately, the Milk in audio format and it was a little story but a brilliant one. It was only 58 minutes long but in that time, Neil Gaiman packs it full of a wonderful story. I love how he has the ability to turn the most simplest thing into something wonderful. He does it with Chu's Day (the Panda that sneezes and makes lots of things happen with just a sneeze!!) and he does it again with this story. I don't think I will think about an errand to get milk quite the same way again!Neil Gaiman narrates this story himself, and I love his narration. He has a great narrating voice, and I love the many inflections he uses to voice the different characters.I recommend this one to anyone that is looking for a quick escape into a funny little world, alike to ours, but with pirates, aliens and a fabulous stegosaurus inventor!

This was a good one to get me back into the groove of listening to Agatha Christie mysteries on audio.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2G0Y9V2PC8YGO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007US2WUQ#wasThisHelpful","R2G0Y9V2PC8YGO","A2XTCY5SSI6LQN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2XTCY5SSI6LQN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Cabin Pressure is a radio play set aboard a chartered plane and it's simply delightful. I admit I did first get this one because of Benedict Cumberbatch, but as I listened I found myself really enjoying what each of the actors brings to this hilarious play.It was side-splitting funny as you listen and watch while they get themselves into messes and have to figure out how to get themselves out.I listened to this one at work and I had to pause several times to catch my breathe because I was laughing too hard.If you like british comedy I highly recommend this one.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3E1IY31O1OQL1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1445825635#wasThisHelpful","R3E1IY31O1OQL1","A2XTCY5SSI6LQN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2XTCY5SSI6LQN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The holiday season is fast approaching in the sleepy town of South Cove. Jill Gardiner, owner of Coffee, Books and More, is busy planning a holiday supper and fundraising for the season. The last thing she needs is to get involved in another murder case. However, one seems to land right in her lap when she discovers the body of a visitor to town. Ted Hendricks is a first class jerk and also the director of a work program, placing interns in local businesses to help them garner some experience. When Ted turns up dead Jill doesnt have to look far for suspects. It seems everyone had a reason to dislike Ted and Jill and her boyfriend police officer, Greg, will have their work cut out trying to find the killer.If The Shoe Kills was my first visit with Jill and her dog, Emma, to South Cove. However, after listening to just one book I know it wont be my last. I really enjoyed the variety of people that live in South Cove, and the addition of the interns visiting certainly provided a lot of color and intrigue!The murder aside, what really drew me into this story was Jills store, Coffee, Books and More. I really like books about books. So many of my favorite cozy mystery series are set in bookstores and libraries. Being such an avid reader I cant get enough of cozy mysteries that heavily feature books in their stories. I felt right at home in Coffee, Books and More and I liked how Jill not just works there, but talks about books, not just mentioning titles but giving the reader a great view of what goes into running the bookstore. In every scene I really felt like Jill was as much an avid lover of books as I am.With the interns of the work program in town, there were a lot of visitors to South Cove. This made trying to figure out the killer so much harder, especially as the victim was new to town as well. I had an interesting time trying to figure it out and didnt manage to solve this one before Jill.I listened to If The Shoe Kills on audio and I enjoyed Susan Boyces narration. It didnt take me long to get into the story and I quickly found myself hooked, which is a good indicator to a great author and narrator combination.If the Shoe Kills was a great introduction into this series for me. I plan to go back and read/listen to the earlier books in the series, to find out a bit more about Jills other adventures. If you like charming cozies about enchanting small towns I highly recommend picking this one up.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1X69NM56SHD3J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KM9O6SQ#wasThisHelpful","R1X69NM56SHD3J","A2XTCY5SSI6LQN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2XTCY5SSI6LQN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Christmas in Paradise is the fourth book in the Paradise Lake mysteries featuring TJ Jensen, and definitely my favourite to date. Alike to most cozy mystery series each book builds on the previous books. Each book in this series can be read as a standalone, but I'm glad I've read them in order. I've loved watching the relationships and friendships of TJ Jensen and her family and friends grow and develop, and Kathi Daley's skill at great character development is more than evident in Christmas in Paradise.TJ Jensen has a wonderful and unique family. She's the guardian of her two sisters and has a extended family of ""uncles"" and ""aunts"" for her sisters, made up of her delightful friends. It's the holiday season and I loved seeing this big family settle down for a Thanksgiving meal, that included four turkeys!! It would have been picture perfect, except for the dead body...I really enjoyed the mystery. I don't want to give too much away but I love how deep the mystery went. Kathi Daley clearly plots out her mysteries carefully and they always keep me guessing.Christmas in Paradise was another great installment in the TJ Jensen mysteries. This is a fun, suspenseful series and I can't wait to see what TJ Jensen gets up to next.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3NOAQXCUI228T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N3GZPMG#wasThisHelpful","R3NOAQXCUI228T","A2XTCY5SSI6LQN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2XTCY5SSI6LQN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"For dog lovers and mystery fans, there is a new mystery on the shelves and it is one from a long-running and much cherished series, the Melanie Travis mysteries. To those that haven't met Melanie yet she loves dogs. She's also pretty good at solving mysteries, especially given that this is her 17th mystery!!With any long running mystery series, there has to be something beyond the mystery to continually hold my interest. Laurien Berenson writes engaging mysteries, but it's her characters that have me coming back for more. I love Melanie's sarcastic dialogue, her love of animals and her sense of adventure. Alike to a blood hound once she's on the investigation she doesn't stop until she has her man (or woman!).I enjoyed the mystery immensely. Melanie meets Nick, a ""dog whisperer"". At first Nick is suspicious and not believing the hype surrounding Nick, but she soon learns that Nick knows dogs very well and when Nick turns up dead, she gets involved and helps to solve his murder.For readers that love this series for a interesting mystery, adorable dogs (of all breeds and sizes, like Barney, the basset hound on the cover) and engaging, relatable characters, then you're going to want to pick up this one. It was a really enjoyable read and even my family of cats give it four paws up!!","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R39HLZIXF34VIB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IUPCKMI#wasThisHelpful","R39HLZIXF34VIB","A2XTCY5SSI6LQN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2XTCY5SSI6LQN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Andrea Andy Buckland has come home. After nearly poisoning a live audience on what was supposed to be her big break as a tv chef, shes returned to her hometown and to the family restaurant, Bowtie Angel. As she tries to sort out her life and come to terms with her ex-boyfriend now engaged with her mortal enemy, she stumbles upon the dead body of tv chef, Chef Zoltan Farnsworth. Chef Zoltan waa unfortunately one of those that she nearly poisoned in Atlanta and it looks like the police are seeing Andy as a person of interest. In order to clear her name Andy starts to investigate with the help of sexy newcomer, Malcolm Jones, half-brother to her enemy, Lizzie.Ive read two of Jennifer Harts other books (Skeletons in the Closet and Final Notice) and have enjoyed her combination of mystery, humor and romance immensely. In her newest novel, she shows why she is one of the best new cozy mystery authors. She introduces readers to the Buckland family, an Italian family that loves to cook pasta so much that they run a Italian restaurant. This family puts the fun in dysfunctional and they are a laugh a minute. I particularly loved Andys Great Aunt Cecily, whose answer to everything is we make the pasta! Add in a murder to the mix and the result will be a cozy mystery that you will be remembering fondly long after you turn the last page.As with most cozy mysteries there is a subtle romantic element. In between solving the murder, Andy has her hands full with the sexy Malcolm Jones, a photographer with a interesting history and complete with a sexy New Zealander accent. The only catch is Malcolm is the half-brother of Lizzy, who Andy has been in not-so-friendly competition since their school days together.Murder Al Dente was a fabulous debut in this new series. It hit all the right notes with me, and the pasta recipes are to die for. I cant wait to get into the kitchen and see if I can make the pasta just like Great Aunt Cecily and Andy! If youre looking for a new series to read this summer, I highly recommend this one. Murder Al Dente was a delectable mystery and I cant wait to return to another adventure with the Bucklands to see what they are up to next.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RRYEO7YZXUQBX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MYGH13W#wasThisHelpful","RRYEO7YZXUQBX","A2XTCY5SSI6LQN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2XTCY5SSI6LQN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Im a fan of Lorraine Bartletts other mysteries, including the Booktown mysteries she writes as Lorna Barrett, and Ive been eagerly awaiting a new book to devour. Then along came Panty Raid. Panty Raid was a super fun introduction to Tori and Kathi, our sleuths in the upcoming Lotus Bay Mysteries.Tori and Kathy are best friends from college that have drifted apart but come back together to help Tori solve the mystery of a panty thief. The outcome was utterly hilarious and I didnt see it coming. Lets just say when the final culprit was culprit was caught Im glad I wasnt drinking or I may have spit liquid all over my kindle screen!!I really liked Tori and Kathy and I could relate to them a lot. As life with jobs, children and blogging has gotten in the way my own best friend from school days and I have drifted apart then together again, and the way Lorraine wrote the relationship between Tori and Kathy was just perfect.I loved Panty Raid and Im super excited for this new series. I have enjoyed everything Lorraine Bartlett has written so far and Im sure this new series will be no different.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R6H83VXTX64P9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LZ050EA#wasThisHelpful","R6H83VXTX64P9","A2XTCY5SSI6LQN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2XTCY5SSI6LQN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Prior to reading The Moonglow Cafe, I read Above the Bridge, Deborah Garners first novel in this series. Above the Bridge gave me a insightful look into this series and into the life of Paige MacKenzie as she arrives in Jackson Hole, Wyoming. I enjoyed the mystery and I was excited to see what adventure Deborah Garner would take the characters on next.In The Moonglow Cafe, Paige and cowboy, Jake, are back with another mystery to solve. This time Paige is in Manhattan to write a story on sapphire mining. With Jake nearby in Jackson Hole, shes not expected murder and mystery, but that is exactly what ahe finds. Paige finds a hidden diary and with her natural reporter instincts shes soon on the trail of this mystery.I really love Deborah Garners writing style. She paints a vivid picture of the isolated mining town and the quirky characters in the town. The mystery kept me on the edge of the seat, madly flipping the pages faster, eager to find out how it would end.I read a lot of indie cozy mysteries and The Moonglow Cafe is definitely one of my favourites this year. I enjoyed letting Deborah Garner whisk me away to Montana for an afternoon of adventure and I cant wait to see what Paige gets up to next.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2HNLZH277EHAA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JUG0VZO#wasThisHelpful","R2HNLZH277EHAA","A2XTCY5SSI6LQN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2XTCY5SSI6LQN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Mmmm. Snickerdoodles. I want to start this review by saying Wendy Delaney totally sold me with Snickerdoodles. I love Snickerdoodles, and I figured a book that has the word snickerdoodles in the title is bound to be a winner! Luckily for me, I was right. Sex, Lies and Snickerdoodles is more than just a yummy title, its also a fabulous mystery.Charmaine Digby is Assistant to the Prosecutor, and had a secret love life with long-time friend, Detective Steve Sixkiller. That ought to be enough to stay out of trouble, however she manages to walk into more trouble with the death of bad boy, Russell Falco. What unfolds is a suspenseful and enjoyable mystery that had me on the edge of my seat, trying to figure it out before Charmaine and Steve.An essential element of a good cozy mystery is the setting and I loved the seaside setting of Port Merritt. As I was reading I swear I could smell the fresh fish and salt air, or maybe that was my own wishful thinking of wanting to be transported to Port Merritt with these interesting characters.Sex, Lies and Snickerdoodles was my first mystery by Wendy Delaney, but it sure wont be my last. It was a thoroughly enjoyable read, and I intend to go back and read the first book in the series, Trudy, Madly, Deeply to find out what else Charmaine and her friends have been up to.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R152MZDY7KWO9B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00M7ILJQW#wasThisHelpful","R152MZDY7KWO9B","A2XTCY5SSI6LQN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2XTCY5SSI6LQN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Amy thinks she finally has a pie tobeat Mandy Jo but little does she know Mandy Jo is already dead!!Pies and Peril drew me in like the sweet smell of a fresh apple pie and I didntwant to stop until the very end.I was drawn to the charming Amy. Alike to myself, shes passionate about baking, butnot always clear headed. In the opening chapter she illogical thinks her pie hasbeen stolen from her house and the way ahe reacted to the situation wouldve justbeen like me. Her reaction had me laughing and smiling, and the warm cozy feeling ofreading a good mystery never left me.For readers of the blog will know Ive been on a bit of a reading slump lately. WellPies and Peril pulled me right out of it.

"Here at Cozy Mystery Book Reviews the one thing we all have in common is our love of cats. We have a soft spot for dogs too, but we really LOVE felines! So when a new book crosses our desks we all clamor to be the first one to read it. After all mysteries and cats just go hand in hand. Patricia Frys mysteries definitely have a cat as their focus a klepto cat named Rags. Together with Savannah, Rags provides plenty of enjoyment in this fifth book in the series.The mystery focuses heavily on the Hammond Cat Alliance and their involvement in helping with the feral cats in the area, which of course brings in the mysterious old building. I really enjoyed the way Patricia Fry has weaved the elements of mystery with the serious side of animal welfare, and the care of the feral cats. The Hammand Cat Alliance warmed my heart with all they do to help cats.The Colony Cat Caper was my first introduction into the lives of Savannah, Rags and the other folks in town. I was able to quickly pick up the story, and I was glued to each page with intrigue as the mystery unfolded. For me, the Klepto Cat mysteries is a hidden gem, and Im glad Ive now got four other books in the series to go back and enjoy. I cant wait to find out what other adventures Rags has gotten up to!!","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RK3FP0R38DZHF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KR10GYW#wasThisHelpful","RK3FP0R38DZHF","A2XTCY5SSI6LQN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2XTCY5SSI6LQN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In her debut series Jennifer McAndrews delivers a stunning mystery, with a flaming red-headed heroine that readers are not going to forget in a hurry...Georgia Kelly has packed up her life in New York City, complete with a job loss and departing fiance, and is heading home to Wenwood, New York, to live with her grandfather, until she figures life out. In Wenwood she finds a quiet life. That is until a local is killed and the police point their finger at Georgia's grandfather. With Grandy about to be arrested for murder, Georgia and her new friend, Carrie, set about trying to find the real killer.I love new series and as a reader, I'm lucky in that many new series are published every month for me to try. I instantly warmed to this new sleuth, Georgia Kelly, within the first few pages of Ill-Gotten Panes. She has fiery red uncontrollable hair and her hair certainly matches her personality. In no time at all she's getting herself buried deep within a murder investigation.In this first mystery we meet Georgia, her grandfather, Grandy, and her new friend, Carrie, who owns a antique store. She enlists Georgia to help her repair a Tiffany lamp, and through this we learn more about Georgia's hobby of stain glass. It's not a hobby that I know much about it and I found it fascinating. Alike to Georgia I use craft as therapy, and I it's nice to read that I'm not the only one. Crafting can be very therapeutical!The mystery was a great whodunnit. While I did guess early on who the murderer was, it wasn't until the last minute that I had tied everything up together. It was cleverly crafted and kept me on the edge of my seat.Wenwood was such a delight to visit. Between the locals, Georgia's new companion in the form of a cute, little, white kitten named Friday and the adventure of a murder mystery I had a splendid time with this first mystery and I can't wait to see what Jennifer McAndrews has on offer next.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R36FU71OU6ZM4I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HDMS2BW#wasThisHelpful","R36FU71OU6ZM4I","A2XTCY5SSI6LQN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2XTCY5SSI6LQN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Casey Feldstein has her hands full yet again with baking, yarning and solving a murder. Casey is continuing on with yarn retreat business she inherited. While she didn't begin as a knitter nor crocheter she's learning more about yarn and enjoying the retreats. This new retreat will be fantastic as she plans to even include sheep shearing and spinning!! However when the retreat's teacher is found dead, and the death is declared a suicide, the retreat looks like it might just fall apart. It's up to Casey to pick up the pieces and solve the crime. With Casey at the helm it's going to be one yarn retreat no-one will forget.I love to crochet so early on I picked up Betty Hechtman's crochet series and instantly became a fan for life! I like the way she weaves elements of crafting with the mystery so seemlessly. I always finish one of her mysteries satisfied that I've not only enjoyed the mystery but picked up for a tips for the crafter in me too!!In this new series Casey is as beginner of a knitter as you can get. She doesn't even have a yarn stash (yet!)! She is enjoying running the retreats and learning along the way. She also has a insatiable curiousity! Part of the reason I enjoy following Casey's adventures is because I really like reading about each retreater's journey into knitting and crochet. They are all at different skill sets and through the story I almost feel like I'm right there, alongside them, taking part in the projects and building friendships in only a way that yarn can.Yarning aside, Betty Hechtman delivers a delightful mystery in this latest instalment. What first appears to be suicide, clearly is murder and I enjoyed watching Casey put her ""detective shoes"" on and solve the crime. Fans of Betty Hectman's earlier mysteries won't be disappointed with this one. In my opinion, it's one of her best and I'm looking forward to seeing where she takes Casey and her friends next.If you haven't read this series yet I highly recommend giving it a go. The mystery will delight you and afterwards you'll be itching to start a knitting or crochet project of your own!","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3IZY62ALSHBPX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HDMMF56#wasThisHelpful","R3IZY62ALSHBPX","A2XTCY5SSI6LQN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2XTCY5SSI6LQN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you are a cozy reader (and especially those of the culinary variety) then you know how delectable those recipes at the end of the mystery are. Almost every culinary cozy mystery I buy I end up trying out the recipes at the back. Its the perfect way to make the mystery last just a little bit longer.

Each recipes contains an introduction to the author and their books, followed by a mouth-watering recipe. Ive already wowed my family with several recipes, including Jenna Bennetts whoopee pies and Annie Knoxs Hot Grudge Sundae Cake with Dark Chocolate Fudge Sauce!If you buy one recipe book this year make it Cozy Food.

"Hollywood has come to Savannah with the shooting of a film called Love in Revolution. Katie and her Aunt Lucy are called in to step in as caterer, when the previous caterer was fired. However what starts as just another job turns out to be a deadly murder mystery when Simon Knapp, the Production Coordinator, is found killed  stabbed with a knife from the Honeybee Bakery! Katie and the gang at the Honeybee Bakery start to investigate and try to unravel the mystery.Ive really enjoyed the previous mysteries in this series. They are simply spellbinding with mouth-watering recipes after the adventure. This latest adventure, however, tops the previous mysteries and provides a page-turning mystery, that is one of the best Ive ever read.With each book Katie Lightfoot is finding out more about her witchy powers. Shes a lightwitch and also a catalyst, meaning she seems to attract trouble! She, nor the members of her spellbook club (coven), are surprised when the victim Simon, reveals via a psychic, that it will be Katie that will find his killer! It was enjoyable to read the subtle blend of magic and mystery, with Katie heading the adventure and solving the mystery.My favourite thing about this series is that it evolves at a realistic pace. From the start I was captivated by the spark between Declan, fireflighter, and Katie, and I really enjoyed the twist that Bailey Cates put into their relationship in Some Enchanted Eclair. Fans of Declan and Katie will certainly enjoy this sub-plot, as much as I did.If you havent discovered the Magical Bakery Mysteries I highly encourage you to race to your bookstore and pick them up today. While you are there pick up all four because you are going to want to read them back-to-back and fall head over heels for these spellbinding witches!","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R36KI84EF8583Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HDMM6RS#wasThisHelpful","R36KI84EF8583Z","A2XTCY5SSI6LQN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2XTCY5SSI6LQN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I enjoy science fiction, and in the last few years I've been reading more than my fair share of YA science fiction. Beth Revis' series starting with Across the Universe was one of my favourites. I picked up The New World a couple of years ago on Audible and didn't think to listen. That was until this week, when I was waiting for a new book to come out and thought I'd listen to The New World while I wait. Well The New World blew me away and I can't believe I haven't listened before now.The New World is a prequel and tells the story of Viola and her family, who are the landing party sent out to settle on a new world and report back. The new world isn't what Viola or her family expects.This story was a great teaser. It made me want to race out and grab the first book in this series. I plan to listen to the rest of the series right away!! It was narrated by Angela Dawe and I liked her narration of Viola, and how she portrayed Viola's doubts about the new world.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R129VKZTAXDC6Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0044KM2L2#wasThisHelpful","R129VKZTAXDC6Q","A2XTCY5SSI6LQN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2XTCY5SSI6LQN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In the 8th mystery in the Booktown Mysteries Lorna Barrett takes readers on a new suspenseful adventure. Its winter and all is quiet in Booktown Stoneham, New Hampshire. However, with Tricias sister, Angelica, running two businesses and being newly-appointed President of the Chamber of Commerce her life is anything but dull. Particularly since her Chamber of Commerce receptionist, Betsy Dittmeyer, likes to stir things up by constantly reading everyone the riot act and causing trouble. When Betsy is found dead, crushed under a bookcase, Angelica and Tricia are sad but not surprised. However there was more to Betsy than met the eye, and Tricia is intrigued enough to investigate and see if she can hunt down a killer!The Booktown Mysteries were one of the first modern cozy mysteries series I ever discovered. Each year I settle in to enjoy the latest offering and every time Im not disappointed. With the release of Book Clubbed, Lorna Barrett has kept up this wonderful tradition of keeping me thoroughly entertained.From the first book, Murder is Binding, to this book Ive enjoyed watching Tricia adapt to life in Stoneham. Her life has had many ups and downs, especially in her romantic life. Her ex-husband, Christopher, has now taken up residence in town and shes no longer dating Police Chief, Grant Baker. She seems to be enjoying life on her own. Just her and her darling cat, Miss Marple. However there is one relationship in her life that is blossoming and that is the one between Tricia and her older sister, Angelica. When we were first introduced to Angelica I wasnt sure about her. She seemed to rub Tricia up the wrong way and they didnt get along at all. Ive really enjoyed watching the two get closer, and in Book Clubbed they share some wonderful, close moments. Anyone with a sister or a brother in their life that is also their best friend, will appreciate the direction that Lorna Barrett has taken these wonderful sisters. It is heart warming and beautiful, and Im so glad that Angelica is not just a part of Booktown, but a big part of Tricias life too.Lorna Barrett never fails to offer a suspenseful cozy mystery. The mystery certainly kept me on my toes and right up to the denouement I was holding my breath, waiting to see how it would all my play out.Fans of this series will rejoice at another wonderful instalment in their favourite cozy mystery series. Lorna Barrett provides a entertaining, highly enjoyable new mystery for readers to solve, and I cant recommend Book Clubbed enough. If you havent read this series yet I recommend picking up Murder is Binding and beginning what will quickly become one of your favourites.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3SQ6MMCLYMVPT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00G3L13KQ#wasThisHelpful","R3SQ6MMCLYMVPT","A2XTCY5SSI6LQN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2XTCY5SSI6LQN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Cherry is back and ready to take on the world, by solving a mystery and keep her own love life out of trouble!Ive enjoyed watching Cherry not just solve mysteries, but the interactions in her personal life as well, both with Deputy Luke and also the ups and downs of each of their families. With Cherrys brother missing there is sure a lot going on with Cherrys family and I glued to each page wondering how it would all play out.I always enjoy the mystery elements of the Cherry Tucker mysteries. As someone that reads a lot of mysteries I find it easy to solve my fair share of mysteries. However Larissa Reinhart has me stumped every time!! In the case of this one I liked the realism Larissa Reinhart adds with the real world elements of cyber bullying and suicide. While this is a fictional story readers will recognize elements of life that we hear about on the news, far too often.Death in Perspective is another thrilling adventure in this series and Im sure, like myself, readers will fall in love with Cherry Tucker all over again, reminding us all why she is one of our favourite sleuths!","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2GL29BIDM2ILJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00L5Q7AYW#wasThisHelpful","R2GL29BIDM2ILJ","A2XTCY5SSI6LQN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2XTCY5SSI6LQN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Nina, Mel and Avery are the best of friends. They are the ""Bermudez Triangle"" and they do everything together. When Nina goes away for the summer to Stamford University for a summer course, she expects to come back and everything is the same. But things are different. For once in their lives, Nina feels like Mel and Avery are shutting her out. Then Nina learns that Mel and Avery have a ""romance"" and they are closer than she will ever be with them. She doesn't know how to process that her best friends are now ""girlfriends"". While struggling with a long distance relationship and the stresses of senior life at high school, life is certainly going to be different for Nina, and for her friends.I've enjoyed all the Maureen Johnson books I've read (and listened to) so far, and I expected to enjoy The Bermudez Triangle. I wasn't wrong. I enjoyed this one immensely. I expected to be more about the lesbian romance between Mel and Avery, but it was that and much more. It was more about the friendship, and how a friendship can fall apart and what it takes to rebuild it. Mel, Avery and Nina grow so much in the course of the book and discover more about themselves (and each other) in the process.This was definitely a very enjoyable coming of age story. At different points each character annoyed me a tiny bit. However I'm in my 30's and it is amusing to read about teens and realizing how immature they can be, and what it takes to make them grow up a little. The characters were written in such a way that I did remember what it was like to be a teen.The Bermudez Triangle was my first audiobook by Ellen Archer and I really enjoyed her narration. She applied the perfect voice for each of the different girls, and I enjoyed her portrayal of Parker, a close male friend to all three girls. It was a fun story to listen to and I plan to listen to the rest of Maureen Johnson's books on audio.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RGOKSO8ORUSU6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0071I0HW0#wasThisHelpful","RGOKSO8ORUSU6","A2XTCY5SSI6LQN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2XTCY5SSI6LQN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Agatha Raisin, amateur sleuth extraordinaire, has decided to start up her own detective agency. At first things are slow going with lost cats. However soon she hires her new neighbour, Emma Comfrey, as her secretary and her friend, Sir Charles, refers a case to her. A Mrs Laggart-Brown wants her to investigate the death threats her daughter has received. As Agatha and her detectives investigate they discover a tangle of relationships and murder, as they try to get to the bottom of it.Im smitten with Agatha Raisin. Shes sassy, funny and I love that she is now a detective  officially! Cozy mystery series with their amateur detectives poking their nose into things can sometimes get very long-winded, so its refreshing to see a series that has gone from amateur to official detective and thus gives Agatha a reason to poke her nose into things!!I enjoyed the mystery a lot, but perhaps what I enjoyed more was Sir Charles Fraith being around, and James Lacey not. James Lacey is Agathas ex-husband, who went off to be a monk and then disappeared. Hes barely even mentioned in Agatha Raisin and the Deadly Dance and as Im firmly on Team Charles I was completely fine with this! I have a feeling that M.C. Beaton will be making him pop up sooner or later though.Penelope Keith is the voice of Agatha Raisin for me. I really enjoyed Penelopes acting career, being such a big fan of british tv, and Im glad shes voicing these audiobooks. I love the voices she provides, especially the caring tones she puts in her voice for Mrs Bloxby, who is perhaps Agathas greatest friend. I hope Penelope Keith continues to provide the voice for these audiobooks for many years to come, because both Penelope and Agatha herself are the reason I keep coming back to listen to more.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2JLV9H2PB0P5U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003J4VECM#wasThisHelpful","R2JLV9H2PB0P5U","A2XTCY5SSI6LQN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2XTCY5SSI6LQN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Death on the Nile is a short story featuring Parker Pyne. Parker is on holidays and even though his holiday has been previously interrupted by clients, he's hoping that it won't be interrupted even further. However the other occupants on his cruise have other ideas. One Lady Grayle asks him to find out if she is being slowly poisoned by her husband. He sets out to investigate but before he can uncover the truth Lady Grayle ends up dead.I find the title of this short story amusing because Agatha Christie has a full length novel under the same title. The full-length Death on the Nile is of course widely popular, having been made into several movies, featuring Hercule Poirot. This short story was unknown to me until I picked it up. The short story was published three years before the novel. I do wonder if perhaps the short story was inspiration for the novel.In any case it was a good, little story. Parker Pyne doesn't usually solve murders, so it was interesting watching him try his hand at this one. With limited suspects and evidence aplenty, Parker managed to solve it in time.Another good Parker Pyne mystery.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2P89T8IDLEQUN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CGZXS88#wasThisHelpful","R2P89T8IDLEQUN","A2XTCY5SSI6LQN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2XTCY5SSI6LQN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Dead Air by James Goss is a story featuring the tenth Doctor, as portrayed by David Tennant. It seems the Doctor going back to the 60s to track down a creature that could take over (and destroy) the world through the radios. The Doctor lands on a ship, where a radio station is broadcasting from, and tries to find a way to defeat the creature.I'm a huge Doctor Who fan and since the show is on a break I've been listening to a lot of the stories on audiobook. Of the new Doctors my favourite was David Tennant and I love seeing how many of these stories he's narrated. It's great to hear his voice and go on a new adventure. As I'm also a mystery I love trying to figure out parts of the story and see if I can clue in to how the Doctor will defeat the monster. This story threw me a big curveball at the end that I didn't see coming - thankfully for humanity the Doctor did!!I really enjoyed this one and I loved David Tennant's narration. Since he played the part of the Doctor he was perfect to narrate. He also provided really good voices to the other characters. I definitely plan to listen to more Doctor Who stories on audiobook format.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3RQ20MBQDD1RH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003G5W44G#wasThisHelpful","R3RQ20MBQDD1RH","A2XTCY5SSI6LQN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2XTCY5SSI6LQN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Witch and vintage clothing store owner, Lily, has a knack for getting herself into interesting situations. For what starts out as a lovely evening out with fellow witch, Aidan Rhodes, ends up in a mystery when a lady at the Art Deco Ball collpases and Lily thinks foul witchy play is involved!! When Detective Carlos asks for Lilys help with the death of a witch, Tarregan Dark Moon Tara, Lily thinks the two may be connected. As she delves further into another coven she discovers some very evil magic at play.I like the Witchcraft mysteries because they are always unexpected!! Lilys life is never boring. Besides the main mystery there is always a lot going on and I never finish reading one of these and think it was dull. For all the things that Lily is, she certainly isnt dull. In this one Lily gets to go to a fancy ball, try to untangle a murder case and help Miriam, who collapsed at the ball and is in a coma!! If that isnt enough there is also her love life. Definitely not dull.Lily is a interesting character. She was chased out of her hometown by witch hunters and hasnt gotten close to anyone. Even her own mother doesnt like that shes a witch. But shes settling into a good life now, with her vintage clothing store and making friends with fellow witches. I like watching her life evolve, as she becomes happier with herself and her place in San Francisco.The Witchcraft Mysteries are truly magical. They are everything I love about magical cozy mysteries are more than just a murder mystery! Im excited to start the next one.I listened to In a Witchs Wardrobe with the narration by Xe Sands and I can only use one word to describe her narration flawless. She is the voice of Oscar, Lilys familiar, to me and her narration is part of the reason I love this series so much. If you like audiobooks I suggest trying this series on audio.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1DJYM5SFDW68U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0073XV2D6#wasThisHelpful","R1DJYM5SFDW68U","A2XTCY5SSI6LQN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2XTCY5SSI6LQN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Jailhouse Glock is the second book in the Dead Sister Talking Mysteries. I really fell in love with this series when I read the first book in this series, Heard It Through the Grapevine. For readers that havent read this series yet, I highly recommend starting with the first book so they can discover this great town of Vineyard and find out why the Garcias sisters have their dead sister, Tessa, as their own friendly ghost.In Jailhouse Glock, we get an adventure featuring Maddy. Maddy is a widower and a cop. Shes alarmed to see Tessa one day, who says she is here to help Maddy out, but Maddys not in trouble yet! One night on her shift a prisoner is shot with her own gun and of course suspicion falls on her! With the help of her sisters, both dead and alive, they must clear Maddys name before she receives life in jail!I love, LOVE, LOVE this series. The five sisters are all fabulous, and I love seeing each book featuring a different sister. In the first book it is Laineys story and now we get Maddys story. Each sister is unique and has their own baggage, and we learn more about Maddys life, as the girls try to clear her name.Lizbeth Lipperman packs a powerful punch with this adventure. It kept me on the edge of my seat and when I thought I had everything figured out, she swung a storyline I wasnt expected. I love when a story keeps me guessing and this one definitely did! Jailhouse Glock was everything I was wanting and more, and I cant wait to read the next book in this series.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3HV9FKJ5MGRFY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JMJJX76#wasThisHelpful","R3HV9FKJ5MGRFY","A2XTCY5SSI6LQN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2XTCY5SSI6LQN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In the first Caprice De Luca Mystery, readers are introduced to the very unique Caprice De Luca. Caprice is a home stager. Before I picked up Staged to Death I had no idea what a home stager was, but thanks to Karen Rose Smith and Caprice De Luca Im definitely more in the know now! Caprice rearranges houses to make them more appealing for selling, or even just for a person that wants a fresh new look! She has a unique fashion style (mainly vintage!) and shes definitely talented in her home staging. One of her more challenging jobs, was to be home staging her close friend, Rozs mansion home, which has a castle feel. Unfortunate for Roz it also ends up being the site where Rozs husband is killed! Before Caprice knows it shes asking all sorts of questions to try and clear Rozs name and uncover the truth.Karen Rose Smith gave me three things I really crave in a cozy mystery: a interesting job that I knew little about but wanted to learn more, cute animals and a mystery that had me perplexed. Try as I might I couldnt solve this one before Caprice! I was definitely on the wrong track, but I loved trying to guess and figure out the clues.I adored Caprice. She comes with her own set of baggage from past relationships, but there is a few hints of romance on the horizon for her. Im looking forward to following her next adventure to see what happens not just with her romantic life, but that of her family too! In this first mystery we meet brother, Vince, a confirmed bachelor, caterer, Nikki, and Bella, who seems to have a troubled marriage. Between all of them I cant wait to see what Karen Rose Smith has in store for them in Deadly Decor.Staged to Death was definitely an unputdownable read for me. Right from the first page I was telling myself just one more page until I reached the stunning conclusion. I highly recommend readers add Staged to Death to their summer reading list.

"In her fourth Library Lovers Mystery, Jenn McKinlay tantalizes readers with books, mysteries and Shakespeare! The town is putting on A Midsummer Nights Dream, and Violet La Rue has enlisted popular actor and close friend, Robbie Vine, to play the cheeky Puck! With a wife and girlfriend in tow, Robbie certainly seems to have his hands full, but this doesnt stop him from flirting with Lindsay, our favourite town librarian. With her relationship with Sully on hold (at Sullys request) Lindsey takes a shine to Robbie and is devastated by Robbies death and puts her sleuthing skills to work to find a killer!When I first started this series I was not expecting to like it as much as Jenn McKinlays other series. How can she top cupcake mysteries and bargain shopping mysteries (two of my favourite activities), but shes taken my love of books and cozy towns and has made me a huge fan of this series too! Four books in and Im thoroughly addicted and like a good cozy mystery addict, I was ready to scoop up her latest offering!Read It and Weep is immersed within books, from Lindseys job as town librarian, to her involvement behind stage on the set of A Midsummer Nights Dream and her crafternoon group, who is reading Pride and Prejudice. For a book lover like me, I cant get enough of books within books and Jenn McKinlays certainly satisfied my inner booknerd with Read It and Weep.Over all of her series, Jenn McKinlay doesnt just create a murder mystery, she creates a reading experience. Every time I visit Briar Creek I feel like Im shadowing Lindsey, eating with her at the Blue Anchor, taking her adorable pup, Heathcliff, for a walk and getting to know all the patrons of the library. There is so much life between the pages of each story and I cant wait to take another visit when On Borrowed Time is released.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2LHV5PUQTI8RU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BDQ39O4#wasThisHelpful","R2LHV5PUQTI8RU","A2XTCY5SSI6LQN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2XTCY5SSI6LQN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In the latest instalment of the Black Cat Bookshop Mysteries, Ali Brandon tantalizes readers with an action-packed mystery featuring karate, cat whispers and even the Mob!Hamlet is feeling a little blue following his last entanglement with a murderer. In an attempt to feel more confident against further attacks, Darla, owner of Pettistones Fine Books, and Robert, a goth teen working at the store, have taken up karate at the local dojo. All is going well until they discover the dead body of their beloved Sensei. What first looks like suicide turns out to be murder, and finding a killer might be just what Hamlet needs to bring him out of his funk!Ive been singing the praises of this series since Double Booked for Death first hit the shelves. Since I love cats and mysteries, this has always been the perfect combination in a cozy mystery series for me. Ive enjoyed each book in this series more and more, and always anxiously await the release of the next book. With her latest book I think Ali Brandon has hit it out of the park. There is more of Hamlet to adore in this one, more mystery to try and solve, and lots of interesting happenings in the bookstore and the dojo!I enjoy watching characters progress as a series develops, and I like how Ali Brandon does this so well. Its not just solve a mystery and done with it. She really brings the fictional characters to life with their own problems and events, just like any real-life person. Professor James might have a romance on the horizon, and Darla is battling her feelings for Reese. Not to mention the fact that Hamlet gets a visit from a cat whisper and makes a new friend in a fellow animal, and not of the feline persuasion!!! When you add in the mystery youve got one of the best cozy mystery series that is currently on the shelves!If you havent visited Pettistones Fine Books yet, I highly recommend you take a visit. Pick up Double Booked For Death and get to set to enjoy three fabulous mysteries, with hopefully more to come!","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2NHIC6Q1U48FI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BC24NP8#wasThisHelpful","R2NHIC6Q1U48FI","A2XTCY5SSI6LQN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2XTCY5SSI6LQN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In the third book in the Sweet Nothings Lingerie Mysteries, Emma Taylor is settling into life in Paris, Tennessee. Shes in a relationship with Brian, who helps his father at their hardware store and is starting his own renovation business, and enjoying working with her Aunt Arabella at Sweet Nothing Lingerie Store. However it all unravels when a former beau walks into the store and sends Arabella into a spin. What begins as an invitation to a lavish dinner ends in murder, with Arabella as the prime suspect!! Once again, Emma and her friends must play sleuth and try and clear Arabellas name!Using the word Sweet in this mystery series is perfect because everything about Paris, Tennessee is sweet. From the adorable lingerie store to the delicious cupcakes they bring in for their Valentines Day shopping events and even Arabellas French Bulldog, Pierre, everything is sweetness and love. I find slipping amongst the pages of these mysteries as easy as curling up in my favourite reading chair. The only difference is that I dont have a nice glass of Tennessee tea, or Arabellas famous fried chicken!!Alike to the other two books in this series, A Fatal Slip completely lived up to my expectation. Meg London always delivers a stunning mystery and this one is no exception. Emma goes to work part-time at the Grangers to catalogue their art collection. Of course its the perfect place to snoop into the mysterious death of Hugh Granger, art extraordinaire and Arabellas ex-love. I found all the tidbits about the art world very fascinating  especially as the author gives us a little lesson in art history as well!All in all a stunning instalment in a series that Ive grown to love with each new mystery!

"In the third book in the Haunted Yarn Shop Mysteries, the town folk in Blue Plum are looking to celebrate the Blue Plum Preserves, with a festival and a skit that has been nicknamed the ""Piglet War"". However, not all is fun and frivolity when a person is accidentally shot during the skit. However, afterwards it seems that it wasn't an accident at all.This is how much I love the Haunted Yarn Shop Mysteries: before purchasing this book I didn't even read the synopsis at the back. I know that every new mystery by Molly MacRae I will love, and they are always auto-buys for me. I was ready to dive in with the Thank Gosh It's Fiber group! Having done this I had no clue who the victim was, which was actually a fun experience. Straight off I saw a few disliked people that could be the victim, and actually guessed right! However, finding the killer.... well I never saw that one coming!!I'm a bit of a yarn geek and I loved reading about everyone's projects, and the spinning... oh yes I loved the spinning demonstrations during the festival. I also loved learning more about Kath's friend, the friendly ghost Geneva. Her story is slowly unfolding, and I love how we get to hear a little bit more of it with each books. I'm happy for this story to drag out, because if Kath solves Geneva's own death, will that mean no more Geneva? That would be very sad, because Geneva definitely brings a element of fun and spontaneity to the stories.This is a fun series and the latest book is a fantastic whodunit. Even though the killer seemed obvious when it was revealed, I never solved it in time. Maybe I will next time!!","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2UNLAMY92OWQB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EOARAQO#wasThisHelpful","R2UNLAMY92OWQB","A2XTCY5SSI6LQN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2XTCY5SSI6LQN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In the latest Cupcake Bakery Mystery our favourite bakers, Angie and Mel, find themselves knee deep in tiaras, cupcakes and murder when they agree to bake cupcakes for the Miss Sweet Tiara Pageant. When a mean judge turns up dead, fingers point to one of Mel and Angie's friends and they must do all they can to find a killer.I'm not really a pageant person, but I love my cupcakes and I love Cupcake Bakery Mysteries. I've been following the lives of Mel and Angie, and Tate, their best friend and business partner, and the endless men in Mel's life.The mystery is top-notch, but what I liked the best about Sugar and Iced was watching the developing storylines amongst the characters, that have grown from the first book. I've become so invested in the lives of Mel and Angie and I was glad that one of them has a happy ending (for now!) and I'm looking forward to seeing what the future involves for the other.

"Agatha Raisin is heading north for a vacation, following some psychic advice that she will find love in the north. However in the sleepy town of Fryham she finds not love, but murder. Agatha doesn't feel at home in Fryham and she's almost relieved when her friend, Sir Charles Fraith, turns up. However they soon have their hands full trying to solve a murder, which could be difficult to do since the locals don't seem to trust them.I really love the Agatha Raisin mysteries. I prefer the funnier mysteries like Stephanie Plum, Jaine Austen and Agatha Raisin falls into this category too. She's always a hoot and I always put down a Agatha Raisin mystery feeling like I went on a adventure with a great friend.I did miss Carsely in this one, but it was fun to see Agatha and Charles stir trouble in Fryham. The reader gets a little bit of resolution of the Sir Charles Fraith -v- James Lacey in Agatha's love life and I won't say more than that. I do believe she's better off with Sir Charles than the stuffy James, but we will have to wait to see what M.C. Beaton has in store for Agatha for the future.A thoroughly fun mystery and naturally I plan to continue until I'm caught up to date.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R7D8STAMEG2SI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DO8QRHK#wasThisHelpful","R7D8STAMEG2SI","A2XTCY5SSI6LQN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2XTCY5SSI6LQN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Mayhem on the Orient Express was one of my favourite books of February, and I was super excited to see that the second book in this series is already out. A Tale of Two Biddies is set a few months later and sees the girls embarking on a new book to read together, A Tale of Two Cities, and a new murder to solve. This time it's the death of a clumsy local, that a lot of people have a reason to see him dead. It's a job for the League of Literary Ladies to solve this crime!I love visiting this cozy town in South Bass, and I definitely enjoyed watching the Literary Ladies solve this mystery. In the first book they are at odds with each other, but now they are starting to form a friendship and I love watching this friendship grow. All four are very different from each other and compliment each other when it comes to solving a mystery.With Charles Dickens impersonators, a trivia contest and even a aging boy band in town, it is certainly a fun time for everyone. Well with the exception of the murder!!These books are really well-written and I love how Kylie Logan easily combines the mystery with the book that the book club is reading. As a fan of the classics it was enjoyable seeing A Tale of Two Cities being re-enacted through the lives of the locals, with respect to the murder.A fun reading and I can't wait for the next book to be released in October.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1AZ65EJKCASLV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DYX9KJ2#wasThisHelpful","R1AZ65EJKCASLV","A2XTCY5SSI6LQN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2XTCY5SSI6LQN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I'm a big Doctor Who fan, but am only just getting into comics and graphic novels. I picked up Prisoners of Time, Vol 2 at the library and I was pleasantly pleased. There is a short story adventure with each of the 5th, 6th, 7th and 8th doctors. Each adventure could be read as a stand alone but I believe they are building up to a bigger story in the next volume.This graphic novel is a great read for Doctor Who fans and can be appreciated by new and old fans. I'm definitely hooked on this series and will read the next story, featuring the 9th doctor.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RVO951DBHMDAB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00F0YJ9H6#wasThisHelpful","RVO951DBHMDAB","A2XTCY5SSI6LQN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2XTCY5SSI6LQN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In Sheila Connolly's latest County Cork Mystery, Scandal in Skibereen, we're heading back to the little sleepy town of Leap in Ireland. Maura is getting used to life in Leap, running the pub she inherited and starting to build a life for herself. When an American stranger comes to town, she stirs up the locals with her rudeness, as she tries to find a lost painting. However when the body of a local, simple-minded gardener is discovered, all fingers seem to point to the American, Althea, and Maura steps in to help uncover the truth.The County Cork Mysteries became my favourite new mystery series of 2013 and I'm happy to see that Sheila Connolly continues the trend in 2014 with the latest book. I loved all the history and intrigue surrounding a lost Van Dyck painting, that Althea, Maura and several locals are trying to find. Along the way we discover a little more about Maura's history in Leap, including the fact that her Gran used to work at the manor where the painting is discovered.With my own Irish heritage, I find the County Cork mysteries fascinating and I love how much flavour of Ireland that Sheila Connolly has wrapped into the pages. She writes with such Irish flair that it's hard to believe that Sheila isn't from Ireland!Scandal in Skibereen kept me on the edge of my seat, as Maura and Althea hunt for the painting and try to find a killer together. It was a great second book in this series, and readers of this series will fall head over heels for this small town of Leap all over again. For those that are new to the series, I suggest picking up Buried in a Bog and be prepared to fall in love with this series.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2NRV9G9UOSQV2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DYX9KFQ#wasThisHelpful","R2NRV9G9UOSQV2","A2XTCY5SSI6LQN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2XTCY5SSI6LQN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I'm a huge fan of Terry Pratchett's writing, in particular his Discworld series. I've re-read many of the books multiple times and I've decided to listen to them as audiobooks for the first time. The first one up is The Light Fantastic, which follows the adventures of Rincewind, the Wizard, and Twoflower, the tourist, in Ankh-Morpork. Part of this adventure starts in The Color Magic and continues on in The Light Fantastic. It's high adventure for Rincewind, as he has a history of running away from trouble, but it seems trouble is chasing him!There is so much to love about the Discworld, and especially the first two books in this series. I love Twoflower for many reasons. One is that my career is the same as his - he sells insurance (or in-sewer-ants as he describes it to Rincewind). He's definitely a glass-is-half-full kind of guy and a perfect match for Rincewind, who is sure the glass is pretty empty. It's fun when these two get together, especially with their invincible Luggage along for the ride, and Conan the Barbarian, who is almost reaching 90!I really enjoyed this on audio. I have only listened to one other Discworld on audio (Raising Steam) and I'm glad that Nigel Planer's narration lived up to my expectation. His voice for Death is just perfect, as was the scene where Twoflower teaches Death and several gods to play cards! After imagining all these voices in my head for the last two decades of reading these novels, I'm glad to discover that the audiobooks are just as fantastic. I plan to listen to more on audio.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2W11HY8YEKF1F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000W914OU#wasThisHelpful","R2W11HY8YEKF1F","A2XTCY5SSI6LQN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2XTCY5SSI6LQN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It's the holiday season, and Hamish Macbeth is heading to the Happy Wanderer, a scottish health farm. The owner, Jane Weatherby, is worried that someone is plotting to kill her and invites Hamish for the holidays to investigate. At the Happy Wanderer Hamish discovers an eclectic group of Jane's friends, none of which would seem to want Jane dead. However, when one of the guests is killed instead, Hamish wonders if it was a case of mistaken identity or whether the snobby, mean woman, Heather, was the intended victim.I really enjoy the Hamish Macbeth mysteries. They have a beautiful English-Scottish flair to them, and Hamish, as the bumbling police officer is simply adorable. Death of a Snob had a nice holiday setting, and even though it's March I was getting into quite the holiday spirit listening to this one.I found it interesting, that in Death of a Snob, Priscilla gets to meet Hamish's parents. In the previous books there has been a on-off flirtation between Priscilla and Hamish. While there is no relationship between them, I liked that Priscilla got to meet Hamish's family while Hamish was away. Hamish comes from a big family, and the complete opposite of Priscilla's fancy yet small family and I think she definitely looks at Hamish a different way after spending time with the Macbeths.The mystery in this one was good and for those us that like mysteries involving authors then you will definitely enjoy the author angle here.Shaun Grindell voices Hamish Macbeth and he does a superb job on the accents. I love all the Scottish and English and even an American accent! I plan to listen to the rest of the books in this series as audiobooks because this one was that enjoyable. The audiobook is short at just over 4 hours but I think it would be perfect for a car trip! Definitely a good series to discover on audio.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R22XY2E6KTR1NA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006QBKJPS#wasThisHelpful","R22XY2E6KTR1NA","A2XTCY5SSI6LQN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2XTCY5SSI6LQN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"At the insistence of her childhood friend, Ruth Van Rydock, Miss Marple heads down to visit Ruth's sister, Carrie Louise, whom Ruth is worried about. It seems that Carrie Louise isn't always in touch with reality and things seem wrong to Ruth, so she asks Miss Marple to visit and find out what is happening. In a house with over 200 juvenile delinquents, that Carrie Louise and her husband insist they are helping, and also several heirs to their fortune, it seems almost too perfect to be the grounds for a murder. Except it is not Carrie Louise who is perfect, and no-one can understand how the murder happened and who the killer is. Well no-one but the unflappable Miss Marple.I have a bit of a fangirl crush on Miss Marple. She's my favourite sleuth of all time. She's unassuming and quietly listens and pays attention and always solves the mystery. For me she really is the anti-Poirot, who is cocky, confident and determined he has a mystery solved before it has even happened!For this reason I've been savouring the Miss Marple mysteries, but it was time to enjoy another one.They Did It With Mirrors was written in 1952 and arguably when Agatha Christie was in her writing prime. It was a really good mystery and right from the start I thought I had the motive and the killer and I was completely wrong. As usual Agatha Christie had me guessing and I was guessing all wrong.The back of my copy of this book actually doesn't go into who was murdered, so I went into this mystery not knowing much and I really enjoyed that. It was a surprise, especially as I was expecting Carrie Louise to be the victim.I really enjoyed They Did It With Mirrors. I'm as ever in awe of Agatha Christie's ability to craft a brilliant mystery. This was another great Miss Marple mystery and I can't wait for the next one.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R5O2PVSLYX11J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000FC1PLG#wasThisHelpful","R5O2PVSLYX11J","A2XTCY5SSI6LQN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2XTCY5SSI6LQN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Hercule Poirot is on holiday when he hears the words ""she's got to be killed"". He thinks maybe they are authors, talking of a plot or something like that. He doesn't think that they mean a real person. When a death occurs, that appears to be natural at first, those  words come back to Poirot as he investigates. The victim is a tyrant of a woman, a Mrs Boynton, who treats her family like slaves. They aren't allowed to socialise with anyone outside of the family and this trip to the Middle East is the first time they've ever been allowed outside of the house. It would seem to be inevitable that this most-hated woman would die, but who killed her?I'm getting back on track with reading my Agatha Christie mysteries and I'm not sure why I stopped for so long. She's simply brilliant. She understood human nature so perfectly and wrote the most fascinating characters - in this case also the most evil characters.From the first page I instantly disliked Mrs Boynton. Before her marriage she was a prison warden and she treats her family like they are in prison. When her step-son makes the acquaintance of a Miss Sarah King on the trip she immediately forbids him to talk to her again and he agrees. She has worked hard to keep her family under her thumb and enjoys the power she has. It was inevitable that someone would kill her. I was trying to figure out if it was a member of her family, or someone else that she had mistreated on her trip.As usual Hercule Poirot gathered all the suspects in a hotel room and drew out his theory, as only Poirot can do. The final denouement was fascinating and I was only half right in guessing the killer.Appointment with Death was a thrilling mystery set in the Middle East. I think it is one of Poirot's best and I'm looking forward to picking up another of her mysteries soon.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2HAU66RC5CTP2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000FC2RS6#wasThisHelpful","R2HAU66RC5CTP2","A2XTCY5SSI6LQN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2XTCY5SSI6LQN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A treasure hunt has come to the shores Briar Creek. When a salvage companies discovers a treasure map that may lead to the treasure of the infamous Captain Kidd, they flood in to Briar Creek to try and find the treasure. Everyone in town suddenly has treasure fever, from Beth, the children's librarian, to Charlie, who has taken a job with the salvage company. However, when one of the locals that was involved in bringing the treasure hunters to Briar Creek is murdered, Lindsey and Sully and their friends need to try and find a killer.I've immensely enjoyed Books Can Be Deceiving and Due or Die, the first two books in this series. While at the start of Book, Line and Sinker Lindsey and Sully are now a couple and have been dating for several months, the heat out of the relationship has not disappeared, nor has the adventure in the somewhat sleepy town of Briar Creek.As with any cozy mystery series as the series moves on I love seeing the developing characters and become to know them as friends. Beth, the children's librarian and Lindsey's best friend, has become one of my favorite characters and I love watching how she gets treasure hunting fever and includes this as part of her job of being the children's librarian.The adventure was high in this one as there are explosions and speeding cars and boats, as Lindsey and Sully try to catch a killer. Jenn McKinlay leaves us on the edge of our seat, eagerly making readers turn the pages faster to try and discover who the killer is.Whether it's this series, the Cupcake mysteries or the Good Buy Girls mysteries (under Josie Belle) Jenn McKinlay never disappoints and this was another first class mystery. I'm looking forward to picking up the next book in this series, Read It and Weep.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R134EXZNZQYFRN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008JHXQVG#wasThisHelpful","R134EXZNZQYFRN","A2XTCY5SSI6LQN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2XTCY5SSI6LQN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Hamish Macbeth is in Strathbourne and absolutely hating it. He misses his quiet village of Lochdubh and craves to go back. The citizens miss Hamish too and devise a plan to get Hamish back in Lochdubh for good. When Hamish returns to Lochdubh he senses trouble in the air with Mrs Maggie Baird, who has invited four exes to stay with her in the plan that she will marry one. With a tell-all of her life as a hussy planned to hit the shelves, it seems inevitable when Maggie turns up dead. But which of the four wanted her dead, or was it someone else entirely?I love, love Hamish Macbeth. Granted that this is only the fifth book I've read of this series, but I love his quiet way of going about things and the sweet village of Lochdubh, where things are never boring.Even though this mystery started out in Strathbourne, I like that it soon settled on Lochdubh and I got re-aquainted with all the characters that reside there. In his own plodding way Hamish goes about trying to find the murderer, while the rest of the police force insist he won't be able to solve it. I always like that Hamish proves them wrong!M.C. Beaton is fast becoming my second favorite English author (second to Agatha Christie of course!) and I can't wait to dive into the rest of this series. Without a doubt this was another great instalment and I can't wait to see what Hamish and the residents of Lochdubh have planned next.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RFDG0LK7BO3UZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006QBKJOE#wasThisHelpful","RFDG0LK7BO3UZ","A2XTCY5SSI6LQN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2XTCY5SSI6LQN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Bea is new to town and not getting along with her neighbours. She's in constant dispute with Chandra, whose cat likes to pee on her flowers, and Kate, who owns the winery and is unhappy with Bea's renovations. It's sure making life as a Bed-and-Breakfast owner difficult. After another dispute ends up in court the judge orders the ladies to get together for a book club for the next year to try and get along. The first book is none other than Christie's acclaimed Murder on the Orient Express. When the owner of the chinese restaurant, Orient Express, is found dead, the fiction starts to overtake real life as the girls face solving their first murder investigation.Murder on the Orient Express is one of my favorite Agatha Christie novels. It's one of about three that I know extremely well and can recite the plot on whim. Seeing this one in another cozy mystery is like a dream come true, and I was excited to see how Kylie Logan pulled this off.I found it interesting that Bea doesn't get along with her neighbours and I found this a nice change. Too often in cozy mysteries a newcomer makes instant friends, but Bea doesn't and she must adapt to life in her new town. We get a few hints as to her past, but not the full story. Kylie Logan has given us just enough to tease us and be curious about how Bea ended up in the island of South Bass. By the end of the book I was so anxious to find out more about Bea's past and her future on the island.I liked the seaside setting, and the fact that at times the story mirrors Murder on the Orient Express. Bea and her book club members are so different from each other and I think it's going to create some interesting situations in future books.This was my first Kylie Logan book and it won't be the last. I liked the mix of humor, murder mystery and new-found friendships and I'm looking forward to returning to South Bass in A Tale of Two Biddies.If you're a fan of cozy mysteries about books and looking for a tantalizing winter mystery, then pick up Mayhem on the Orient Express.

"I've had these drapes in place for about 16 months and find them to be of excellent quality and construction.  The grommets are nice and large and the drapes are easily drawn back and forth.  I ordered the beige drapes to match my carpet and overall light-painted room.  Since I had never owned ""blackout drapes"" before I assumed they would completely blackout the room.  Wrong.  As you can see from the photo, they may cut about 50% of the light, but don't count on light colored drapes making your room pitch black at high noon, won't happen.Because I have an increasingly difficult time sleeping during daylight hours, I'm going to order navy or black drapes from this company.  I avoided this initially I was afraid of it attracting cat hair and lint, I will report back later on how well it handles this potential problem.UPDATE:  I ordered the navy version and I was able to put them behind the beige curtains on the same rod.  Now I can get a total blackout of the room but the outer curtains remain beige, the navy curtains are the same size and remain completely hidden.  The grommets match exactly, I put a VERY thin film of WD-40 on the rod to make the curtains slide more easily.  Of course, this makes the effort more expensive, but I have beige curtains which match my bedroom and totally dark curtains hidden behind them which make the room 100% dark during the daytime.  Plus, there's an extra layer of insulation against the wind which blows across this large expanse of windows.Note on the photo:  This is a southern exposure but it does not get direct sunlight, the photo is at high noon so this is the maximum brightness the room receives.

"I've been using this for six months now and it has exceeded my expectations in every aspect.  I should mention that this is the first toaster oven for me, having been a microwave person my entire life.  I did a lot of shopping around prior to this purchase, and the things I thought I needed did not come with the Black & Decker:Backlight for the readout:  Not necessary, this one is large enough to be seen even in dim light, with good contrast, don't waste your time or money searching for a backlit oven.Interior light:  The very few models which have these are reportedly too dim to be of use anyway.This cooks evenly and the temperature setting seems to be accurate.  There is a rounded out space in the rear to accommodate a pizza.  While this is being used for mainly cooking frozen foods, I have had success with cookies during the holidays.  My only complaint is the feeble beeper which alerts when the pre-heat cycle has been reached, and when the oven turns off, unless you're standing nearby it can't be heard.When cooking, the display alternates between cooking temperature and time remaining, as shown in the photos.  A large, bright blue light indicates the oven is in operation.  Be aware this has an 18"" power cord, I'm sure this is for safety purposes.

"I'm not the handyman I used to be, but putting this together was totally simple.  It seems to be of excellent quality, and was occupied immediately upon installation.  I had an old, beat up, discontinued K&H bed, which had been heated.  I simply removed the heating pad and installed it in this model.  I'm sure it's the same pad as is used in the much pricier, heated version of this bed.  Works fine.  I wouldn't really plan on installing this using the velcro, you'll never really be sure there won't be a late night kitty crash.  Use the supplied screws.  Tip:  the suggestion of a 1/16th bit hole is not correct for the size of the screws supplied, use a slightly larger bit or you might split the wood.I also found it helpful to attach 1/4 inch rubber bumpers where the bracket meets the wall, it assures the bracket is snug and doesn't wobble or make noise, any small self-stick type pad will work.This arrived packaged in a heavy, quality carton, with clear instructions.  I have it mounted on a 4.5"" window sill, but it will certainly attach to a sills smaller or larger.  I cannot attest to its weight bearing capacity.

"Update July 25, 2015.  As has been noted in numerous reviews, this keyboard has a problem maintaining a connection where the wire enters the keyboard at the mid-back point.  Every few days, the contact simply is lost and the keystrokes don't record.  The solution is to remove and re-insert the connection wire.  My keyboard is 100% stationary and never moves even slightly, so there's definitely a manufacturing issue here.  Since this is one of those dreaded ""intermittent conditions"" and not always replicable, I am not returning this under warranty, I'd probably just get another problem child.  Overall though, this is an excellent mechanical keyboard which I'd buy again, I'm reducing this to four stars because of this minor, recurring annoyance.This is perfect for use as a home computer keyboard, I do not find the ""click"" overly loud or obnoxious, it did not scare the cats as one reviewer reported. What I particularly like is that it has a quality feel, weight and finish. It won't go sliding around on the desk and has fold-out feet to elevate it slightly if desired. This is best described as an off-white, it's neither blindingly white nor noticeably beige. The frame is glossy but shouldn't show fingerprints.I looked at its ""quiet"" brother, the Mini Quiet Pro, but it only came in black and the negligible difference in sound wasn't worth $40 extra which was being charged at the computer store where I saw it. Curiously, this came with two identical USB cords, with mini connectors which plug into the center rear of the keyboard. Regular USB ports are on the right and left sides and they serve as extra outlets. My first use of the Matias Mini Tactical Pro has been a positive experience. Maybe because I ""came of age"" using mechanical typewriters and keyboards, this doesn't feel foreign or different.I like it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3AI7M4LHAPHK7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FW7FHFE#wasThisHelpful","R3AI7M4LHAPHK7","A14Q0AIKQUJG3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A14Q0AIKQUJG3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The numerous positive reviews indicate this is a great remote, and I pretty much agree. The price cannot be beat, and this now eclipses my Logitech 650 which had previously been my ""go to"" remote. I've always been in search of a perfect remote, but there's no such thing. My primary need these days is a remote which has strong key illumination (ancient eyes) and logical key placement. The Inteset fulfills both those requirements. Because a previous review has exhaustively covered this remote's features, I won't go over every detail. But a few observations:Smiles:Strong Orange Key IlluminationEasy ProgramabilityTranslucent Keys Easily Glow When IlluminatedHas An Input Key Which Many Remotes LackPerfect Balance In Hand, Nests Softly In PalmFrowns:No Dedicated Illumination ButtonIllumination Stays On For Only Five Seconds (See Workaround)Buttons Have No Positive Feedback, They're Just Mushy FeelingPIP Buttons Take Up Too Much Real EstateToo Few Dedicated Device ButtonsIt's hard to understand why PIP buttons are included on the remote. Does anyone use PIP anymore? Did anyone ever? Wasted real estate which could have been devoted to other functions and/or enlarging the important keys. The lack of a dedicated light button is a major failing, one must push a random key to light the display, which could, presumably, initiate an unwanted command. And the five second illumination period scarcely gives you time to locate a key before the keys go dark. I accidentally found a solution: Briefly touching the ""set"" key in the upper left hand corner will light the display for ten seconds without initiating a command.The Inteset will control up to four devices, those who need more should be aware of this limitation. I have it programmed for a Samsung TV, Sony Receiver, Apple TV and Google Fiber DVR, the latter had to be programmed button-by-button since it is not included in the device code listing, not a failing, only a few cities have Google Fiber available.I should mention the Inteset remote was provided to me at no cost for review purposes.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RDU4ZZCRXVZ6S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00M4I1BAY#wasThisHelpful","RDU4ZZCRXVZ6S","A14Q0AIKQUJG3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A14Q0AIKQUJG3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a sturdy, well crafted safe which will be more than sufficient to protect you from a grab 'n snatch burglary.  I live in a large apartment complex and who knows how many pass keys are floating around.  This is being used to store small electronics and prescription medication, and it does its job quite well. I have this mounted to the inside wall of a kitchen pantry, with virtually no space around it to use a pry tool.Smiles:--Large, bright, segmented display--Three mounting holes both on the back and bottom, this makes for an immovable installation--When open, the door springs out about 1"" which makes access easier, and also gives a quick visual open/closed status--The padding which is included is slightly heavier than included with my Viking safeFrowns:--No warning beep if safe is left unlocked.  This would only be applicable if used as a gun safe, and children were in the home--The mounting hardware enclosed is not what is depicted, what I received could not be used in a standard 3/8th inch drywall mounting.  No biggie, toggle bolts are easily purchased.--Common circular emergency key, reportedly easy to pick.  The Viking safe has a 4-sided key which would be more secure--Warranty !There is a standard one year warranty, but read closely.  To obtain repair or replacement of a defective unit, you must1.  Pay shipping to Barska (UPS quote:  $48)2.  Send them a check for return shipping ($40 or $50, it's quoted differently on two enclosed warranty cards)3.  Allow them 6-8 weeks to fix or replace the safe.I call this a ""non-warranty warranty.""  Requiring a customer to foot shipping costs both ways  makes almost it cheaper to buy a new safe, and this does not even take into account the potential extensive loss of use.  6-8 weeks? Do they send it back to China for repair?  Before addressing this issue in an Amazon review, I wrote Barska customer service asking them to verify my understanding of the warranty, the reply I received was pretty much incomprehensible, but my reading of the warranty seems to be spot on. UPDATE:  I did eventually receive an email from Barska customer service advising me that my interpretation of their warranty was correct.  Advice:  buy this under Amazon Prime so you can return it if it's dead out of the box or fails within the first 30 days.As far as comparison overall with my Viking safe, flip a coin, they both have plusses and minuses, neither towers over the other.  A thief would have to put time and energy into opening this, it will keep out all but the most determined bad guys.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R31YPFY8N3DDZB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004XSB5S6#wasThisHelpful","R31YPFY8N3DDZB","A14Q0AIKQUJG3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A14Q0AIKQUJG3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This works perfectly on my Panasonic FZ200.  Surprisingly high quality and packaging.  Make sure when you plug the angle-end into the camera you push it hard, all the way in.  The plug will stop short, appear firmly in the camera, but it's not.  I think this may be one of the reasons for folks thinking the device doesn't work.My only negative observation, and it's a small one, is the softness and lack of affirmative ""clicking"" on the hand transmitter button.  But you'll learn how to use it quickly.  For the price, this is really a bargain.

"There's not much left to say which hasn't been already covered.  What I did not know is that there is a tiny light on top which momentarily glows green/yellow/orange to indicate battery level.  This is clearly designed for exercise activities, don't be too concerned about a designer color because it will be very hard for anyone to see anyway.I have used this for eight hours and still have a good charge.  I have loaded 50 songs, I have no idea how many it will hold.  I did not have too much trouble uploading music from iTunes, it just took a couple of tries though.  No matter how the size is described, you'll be surprised at how small the Shuffle actually is.  I'm attaching a photo.The clothing clip seems firm enough, but I either double over the fabric or keep it in a top pocket, even if it comes unclipped, the earphone jack is so secure the Shuffle would just dangle from your earphone cords, it would be probably hard to lose.

Both measurements were accurate to within .5 of a degree.Be advised this is for light duty use only.  If you drop it on a hard surface there will be a plastic explosion.

"UPDATE:  For reasons unknown, the readout on this phone has suddenly started reading:  ""12 missed  calls"" or ""15 missed calls"" or other random numbers when only one is received.  This takes away a very important feature.  I am moving my rating from five stars to three.  As this is a new business phone I can't afford to return it under warranty service, I need the answering function NOW.  Everything else seems to work okay.This is a really good phone for the price, you probably won't get a better deal anywhere.  It has several excellent features, primary among them is the setup.  Even an old coot like me could figure it out right away, the instructions are barely necessary.  Also nice is the fact the phone has dedicated buttons for each item on the answering part, there are no uni-buttons to control multiple features.  If you want to listen to your message, hit the ""listen"" button, ""delete,"" hit the delete button, and so on.  The listen button flashes when a message is received, and pushing it plays the message also.  The LED panel is a nice orange, it comes on only when making or receiving a call, so your bedroom, if that is where you place it, isn't lighted up all the time.Smiles:  An adjustable display panel which flips up to make it easier to see when used on a table.  You can answer the phone by simply pushing the speaker button if desired  You can skip or replay messages by pushing independent buttons  The mute button can be used to put a caller on hold, no need for two buttonsFrowns:  While the phone will function in a power outage, none of the other features will.  Even worse, you will have to reprogram  the entire phone from scratch.  Ditto if you simply want to move the phone to another location.  A battery backup to hold  the programing would have been helpful.  I do not know if the answerer works in an outage, but I can't see why it would.  This may be difficult to wall mount, I was lucky and already had a phone mounting plate on the wall of my apartment, so it  was a snap.  Speaker quality is poor, scratchy, but easily audible.In conclusion, this is a great buy for the money, easy to use, easy to setup, and attractive also.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R304GNMD0181C8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007B5VH0E#wasThisHelpful","R304GNMD0181C8","A14Q0AIKQUJG3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A14Q0AIKQUJG3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm writing this review under the assumption that a timer's main function is to alert the user that something has been completed, typically, your dinner is cooked.  I purchased this in high hopes I'd be able to hear it just a room away from the kitchen.  Wrong.  While the unit itself is easy to set and has good sized numerals, the beeper speaker is on the back.  It is smaller than a pencil eraser, and is about as loud as an alarm on a wrist watch.  The magnet seems to be strong enough to hold it on the fridge, but that completely blocks the speaker, which is on the back.  I guess I will just have to carry this to whatever room I'm working in, it has to be very close to hear it at all.I will give it two stars for numeral size and ease of setting, but this is a major failure as alerting device.

"This is quite possibly the best weather station I've ever owned, and I've owned MANY during my lifetime.  The digits are large, easy to read, and can be seen from across the room.  The backlighting can be adjusted to levels of brightness and it changes color at various temperature levels, i.e. from dark red at the hottest, 100+ to light violet at the lowest, 10-.  The warmer colors will indicate more comfortable temperatures, while the cooler temps will be indicated by progressively cooler colors.  You get an actual barometer reading, the graph is fairly useless because the blocks are too big and look clumsy.  This is an initial review, I will update as needed.Smiles:Fairly easy to set up.Has calibration feature to fine tune the unit.Records highs & lows, can be set to clear manually at midnight or within what ever time parameter you choose.Accuracy specified to +/- 1 degree, unusual for a consumer weather station, seems spot on so far.Instruction manual is neatly presented and laid out, just English.Dew point can be displayed, this is more ""telling"" than the actual humidity metric.An uncluttered bezel with large buttons and clear labels.Entire unit is LARGE making it easy to work with, the display is 5"" H x 4.5"" W.An excellent price point.  There's a lot of junk out there costing more with fewer features.  LaCrosse is a great example.Frowns:I found the instruction manual a bit confusing.  This may be due to the fact this unit has so many parameters and configurable settings.  Customer service answered an email question in just a few minutes though.The forecast is based solely on a barometer's rise or fall.  Some units claim a forecast based on algorithms taken from a 14-day sampling period.  No big deal, just don't plan a picnic around the forecast icon.I did not find an outdoor battery power indicator as described, perhaps it turns on only when the power is low.Temperature/barometer graph is so blocky it's hard to read.  It occupies too much space for too little value.These are my initial impressions, I will report back with an update after this has been in use for a few weeks.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R156Q2XHID8RVK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LY9E3Z4#wasThisHelpful","R156Q2XHID8RVK","A14Q0AIKQUJG3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A14Q0AIKQUJG3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A piece of advice from someone who spent 25 years handling auto claims, some of them catastrophic.  This tool seems to be marketed around the concept of a water escape.  The far more likely event is a car fire.  Some reviewers have placed this in the driver's door pocket.  Bad idea.In the case of a ""T-Bone"" crash the door will be jammed against the seat and the door pocket and the tool inaccessible.  You won't be able to open the door either.  It's best to find a place within arm's reach where the driver compartment will be less susceptible to crash deformation.While the tool looks up to the job, I am marking it down for the following reasons:  mounting instructions are poor, and three tiny screws are included, their use unknown and not addressed in the instructions.  They could not possibly be used to mount the holder onto any firm surface since they are so small they barely extend beyond the mounting bracket holes.  Perhaps longer, self tapping screws could hold this bracket to a hard surface.I used the included double sided tape, which is shaped like the bracket, to mount the tool to a piece of metal under the dash.  Time will tell if it holds, I'll update this review with the results later.  This hammer is probably no different from the others sold here, just think about a practical place to mount it, and that's not the door pocket.Update:  Just as I suspected, the double sided tape is worthless.  I used machine screws to mount it to the side of the fiberglass console, easy for those who are just the slightest bit handy.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2QPMCYE7O2L8B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KPR3IKC#wasThisHelpful","R2QPMCYE7O2L8B","A14Q0AIKQUJG3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A14Q0AIKQUJG3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Ipad 2 fits snug in this case, all of the holes align perfectly with the iPad's various openings.  Some have noted the clasp is a bit tight, which it is, but that will provide extra protection from it opening accidentally  when traveling.  For casual use, such as reading,  the case can be kept slightly ajar without snapping down the cover.  What works perfectly compared to larger composite covers is the auto shut off feature.  It is precise and does not have to be wiggled around to assure proper contact.  It works with the cover lightly closed so it does not have to be snapped down all the way to activate.  Incredibly, the case adds almost no width or length to the iPad itself.  It's hard to see the iPad is even in a case.  My only doubt is how much protection this case will afford if dropped.  If you are clumsy with your gadgets this may not be for you.  The case is beautifully finished, tight and sturdy, and while expensive, at least you feel like you got what you paid for.  An excellent product made in China, how rare is that???UPDATE 11/15/2012  While this remains a sturdy and solid case, I do have a complaint about the unfinished edges, and sharp openings.  I have to be extremely careful not to get my fingers or clothing anywhere near the edges or openings, a painful pinch or cut could result.

"Ken Park is a competently made effort, production values are acceptable and acting is adequate given the paltry script.  As noted by previous reviewers, the film is about youthful alienation in a small California town.  But everybody's alienated, even the parents.  There's a personality to fit every situation, from the super religious to closeted homophobe.  The kids and the parents  are screwed up of course, and the film spends its 90 minutes attempting to illustrate this without ever letting us know how they got that way, or showing us a path out.  I guess we are supposed to assume that society made them that way, which then makes  the film a snapshot of that culture at that time, with no narrative meat on its bones.There isn't much else worthy of comment except the extensive sexual situations, which propel the plot around in a circle rather than straightforward.  The female actors are attractive and easy on the eyes.  The boys are another matter.  Each is skinny, ugly and presumably  a drug addict in real life.  There are open sexual acts, the camera doesn't flinch, but if you are looking for a hardcore skin flick the internet can give you more with much better eye candy.  The real porn is in the dialogue.  I'm sure it's accurate given the extreme sexual situations, but it's jarring nonetheless.In summary, this is a string of vignettes looking for a plot, pushed forward by the  unsympathetic characters who populate the film. If you are looking for a good Larry Clark film try Bully, a film with similar trappings as Ken Park that knows how to advance a plot toward a real and scary finale.  Ken Park is a curiosity piece which is not  worth the time or the money.","2.0 out of 5 stars","September 6, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R33FEBLTRZ37S9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001AZKB8K#wasThisHelpful","R33FEBLTRZ37S9","A14Q0AIKQUJG3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A14Q0AIKQUJG3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Given the anti-war sentiment at the time, I was surprised to find a theater full of these types who loved Patton.  This is one of the few ""war"" movies which does not glorify it.  Most films fade in time as they have little relevance to generations which follow.  This film is perfect as the first time I saw it a lifetime ago.  George C.

Absolutely seal this, I would advise Permalac Clear Satin, it's made specifically for copper.  It is available from ArtChemicals on the West Coast.  It shipped the day I ordered it and was delivered in three working days.  It costs $38.35 delivered, expensive, but don't get cheap, you have a beautiful work of art to protect.2.  The Permalac comes in a spray can and you can use the packing boxes as a spray backstop.  It is ULTRA important to spray this in a well ventilated location.  A garage is perfect, just keep the door open at least halfway.  The fumes are flammable so be careful to stay away from an ignition source, the pilot light on a water heater is easy to overlook.  The Permalac has about enough for two applications, front and back.  Let it dry an hour between applications.  The tubes are solid copper so don't forget them.3.  When installing the vertical support tubes, use a level to make sure they are absolutely on the bubble vertically.  I mounted mine on a fence since the ground here is too hard and rocky to even penetrate an inch.  It was easy to get it perpendicular this way.4.  Make sure the support tubes are very tightly screwed together.  The top tube will be slightly crooked otherwise.5.  Even if you want to make the neighbors jealous, do not mount this anywhere that copper thieves can get it, namely the front yard.  This type of crime is fairly new, they strip vacant houses, a/c units, even street lights, all for drug money.6.  Lastly, enjoy this!  Take the necessary preparatory steps, don't rush things, and you will find this more gorgeous than anyone has described.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 17, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2JW1E8VAEWHG1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002L0DSKQ#wasThisHelpful","R2JW1E8VAEWHG1","A14Q0AIKQUJG3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A14Q0AIKQUJG3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I want to say I am only a few pages into this book and it is difficult to read, not because of the subject matter ( I haven't ventured that far yet) but because of the incredibly poor writing, editing and proofreading.  One error which shows up in every paragraph is ""track housing,"" instead of ""tract housing.""  There are changes in tense from sentence to sentence, repeated punctuation errors, grammar and spelling are nonexistent.  This book looks like a third grader typed it with his feet.  As a writing rule, simple sentences can be powerful sentences, read: To Kill a Mockingbird.  Every sentence here  is almost a fragment, ""I went to my desk.  I sat down.""  I have a background in copyediting, so the errors here jump off the page at me, but you may find this book impossible to read even  if you have only basic high school English.  I was interested in the subject matter, not any prurient material, but this book is so terribly hard to read it may end up in the trash before I finish chapter one, assuming there are chapters.  The two sentence description on the cover even has six errors.Update:  Further checking, this got on the market via a ""vanity"" publisher, wherein the so-called author has to pay to have it published.  Rates start at $899.  Amazon, how could you be a party to such swill?  At least take a look at it before you market such trash.  Shame, shame!!!!!!!Further Update:  After reading further into this garbage, it is strictly written as a novel, not as an expose or documentary as the cover would have you believe.  The boy, a 3rd grader, is constantly subjected to medieval type torture:  rack, whips & chains, even crucifixion  hanging by his arms while being whipped by adults.  When he goes home his mother beats him bloody, several times a chapter.  He is gang raped by 16 men.  Also beaten almost to death by high schoolers.  Were this a true story it might have some social value, however slight.  Instead it is kiddie porn without the pictures.  Impossibly, the narrative seems to try and make us believe the boy enjoys it, or at least puts up with it, for money and gifts.  I have filed two complaints with Amazon about this and heard nothing.  How they could miss and publish vile sadistic trash like this is beyond all comprehension.

"This film is taken from a stage play by John Patrick Shandly, and unfortunately he also wrote the screenplay for Doubt.  From the beginning we can see something is missing, the head nun's suspicions arise suddenly without time for exposition.  For anyone who had the misfortune to go to a Catholic grade school during this era (me) this film will bring back memories, most of them not good.  The ending purports to be dramatic, but it is ambiguous and will leave you confused.  The problem here is we have a three hour play trimmed down for a two hour script.  There is a glaring loss of continuity.  I worked in insurance claims for 25 years and handled a great number of identical claims.

"This is a handsome unit with a small footprint which won't look ugly or upset the neighbors.  It was easy to set up and the vanes are always turning, it even measures wind speed down to 1mph, something the Big Boys don't do.  I have mounted it on a 10' pole where it captures all the wind and is not blocked by trees or houses.  The signal is very strong and it captured the atomic time immediately.  Now why it only gets 4 stars:It mounts on a 3/4"" pole, readily available at Home Depot.  Despite the admonitions that a metal pole might attract lightning, get one anyway.  A plastic pole will whip in the wind, and lightning will hit the highest object, your house not the anemometer.  Mounting this illustrates a true design flaw.  When this is placed on a 3/4"" pole, it needs to be tightend onto the pole by two set screws which tighten the two halfs together.  Good luck.  The screws are deeply recessed and are so tiny you can barely even see them.  I do not exaggerate when I say you will need the smallest jewler's screwdriver on the planet, phillips head, to even make contact.  Then you cannot generate enough torque to tighten the screws.  This would be a deal breaker if the pole did not penetrate so far into the unit it could not fall off anyway.  Were it mounted on a plastic pole the wind would whip it around so much it would fall off.  Does the manufacturer ever test their products before rushing them to market???The final negative is something which is beyond control.  During the day the solar radiation gives a temperature about 2-3 degrees above normal.  It would be nice if there were a compensation feature which would allow this to be adjusted, but then the nighttime temperature would be off a few degrees.  Also, a backlight should have been included.  For you desert dwellers, the humidity level reads down to 1%, here in Las Vegas it is in the single degree range 6 months a year.  This is rarely spelled out in the summary of products.To conclude, this is a well constructed station with the console extremely easy to read.

"I am a long time weather buff and have gone through my share of weather stations over the past decades.  I purchased the Acurite Deluxe Wireless Weather Center based on the almost unanimous great reviews posted here.  I received this station today and can report the following, based on my reference station, an expensive Davis unit:*The temperature is accurate to the exact degree of my reference station.* The humidity is within 2% of my reference station.  Humidity is notoriously hard to measure, so this is excellent.*  The unit comes preset to the day and time, backed up by a button battery.  All you have to do is tweak the time zone.*  The backlight is a beautiful blue and easy to see at night.*  The setting buttons and the backlight are all controlled by simply touching the setting bar, this is apparently done by electrical conduction as no pressure is required.*  Alkaline batteries are included, a rarity to be sure.*  The signal transmits through three walls and still gets the maximum 4 bars.* The barometer is accurate but I cannot comment on the supposed algorithm for forecast modeling.  My Davis unit makes the same claim and it's rarely accurate.I put the outdoor sensor in a protected station which I've had for years; it costs more than the weather station now.  This was the only way to get the sensor away from my patio, which faces north, and causes a ""heat island"" effect 24/7 during the summer months in Las Vegas.  To conclude, this is an excellent product which more than lives up to its expectations.  I could not find it anywhere else but Amazon, which is why I do all my shopping here.

"I'm too old to be fooling with complicated setups like some of the other (younger) reviewers have done, so I'll stick to what works for me.  I started out with a cheapo pair of Sonys, still being sold after ten years.  Terrible mistake.  They hurt my ears and showed static when ever I moved my head.  The best selling point on the new one was the battery life, a brand new feature on this model.  A three hour charge lasts 20 hours, but you will rarerly completely  discharge the battery anyway.  A big plus.Since I only use my headphones for watching TV and my iPad  I cannot comment on the complicated setup most reviewers are enamored with.  Also, I don't notice the 7.1surround sound and dont know how this would be possible given you only have two ears.  That said, the headphones produce beautiful sound, are completely comfortably , and are well worth the extra price.

"I've had this for about a month (you can't find one anywhere now) and I have to report it's of excellent quality in keeping with the Ambient tradition for their radio controlled products.  It looks great on my kitchen table and is bright enough to be seen from across the room.  It has a three stage brightness adjustment for use in the bedroom.  The Cirrus has forecast two rain events at six days out, you can't find any weather station that can do that.

I am a weather buff and have had many such stations throughout the years and this the best by a long shot.

"It's probably a little early to start bragging about a product, I just received it yesterday, but contrary to some of the reviews it was surprisingly easy to set up.  Some have complained about the black clips breaking which hold down the watering cone, but if you look carefully at the pictures in the instruction book and put them gently on you will have no problem.  I've read that the max/min indicators are hard to see on the cone and they are, so I just took a  magic marker and drew a line which now makes the level lines easy to see.  So far my three cats have taken to it well despite some initial reluctance.  I live in a very hard water area and ruined a fountain because calcium deposits built up quickly.  Now I use distilled water which is cheap and does not build up any deposits.  So far, so good, I will post any problems that develop later.  At first blush, it's a winner.Update July 25, 2015:  This has now been in service four years.  I've had to order replacement parts for the fountain spout and filter, but everything else, including the pump, is continuing to work perfectly.  The stainless steel looks brand new.

"The obvious source of inspiration for such off-the-wall metal groups as Cephalic Carnage, Unexpect, Fantomas, The Dillinger Escape Plan, and Gojira, Strapping Young Lad are easily one of the (if not THE) funniest and zaniest things to happen to the world of extreme metal since the days of Meshuggah, Mr. Bungle, Mike Patton, and Naked City. They started out as, essentially, a one-man supergroup, as frontman Devin Townsend plays virtually every instrument in the book (including guitar, most keyboards, programming, and production), but here  he gets more than a few helping hands on SYLs debut, 1995s Heavy As A Really Heavy Thing. (There is a plethora of guest musicians present, here, including a trio of drummers.)Devy has definitely been diagnosed with bipolar disorder, and he sure lets it show, here. Note that I said disorder and not disability, because as a result of said disease, the dude comes up with some of the most extremely great and memorably dynamic music that one can imagine. H.A.A.R.H.T. is a cyber/industrial-grind album, meaning it owes every bit as much to the likes of Ministry and Fear Factory as it does to, say, Napalm Death and the aforementioned Naked City. The end result is a chaotic and eccentric (to say the very least) mix of sounds. So for every grinding blast, monster riff, and brutal pig squeal, present, here, there is also at least the same amount of dub-step beats, techno-beat loops, samples, and synthesizers.At its heaviest, it is a tumultuous exercise in all-out calamity; but at its softest, it is restrained, docile, and even borderline rhythmic. Cuts like the brutal opener, S.Y.L., are furious blasts of barely controlled chaos with very little melodies to speak of. They motor ahead with foaming-at-the-mouth vocals, blistering riffing, and pummeling drums. And Happy Camper (Carpe BUM) is another three minutes of uncompromising, unbridled, unrelenting fury, a savage, grindcore-worthy beat-down of blasting drums, maniacally high-pitched screaming, and tempos that will require listeners everywhere to be prescribed a neck brace. It just oozes with viciously thrashing grooves and brutal instrumental interplay.On the flip side, though, there is also plenty of restrained industrial rock-like material. Take Cod Metal King, for one example. It is an early Ministry/KMFDM-flavored industrial/dance metal boogie with a heavy use of synthesizers, beeping bass lines, and repetitive, programmed-sounding drum beats. And the vocals, meanwhile, consist mostly of the distorted and electronic-heavy style. The Filler: Sweet City Jesus and King Me are two other techno-industrial-lite numbers. One boasts an addicting, staccato guitar riff, squealing keyboards, and faint backing vocals to create a really trippy and ethereal atmosphere; whereas the other is a borderline danceable tune, what with its groovy guitar/bass riffs, chugging rhythms, and rhythmic, Skinny Puppy-like beats.The remainder of the record falls somewhere in between these two styles described in the above songs. Goat offsets its alleged use of Chris Meyers-donated keyboard flourishes with chunky, lurching riffs, snarly, growly vocals, and strong, grumbling bass lines, while Drizzlehell lays harsh, dissonant vocals over thrashy guitar licks and brutal, adherent grooves that make your speakers shake and floors rumble. And the amusing, set-closing joke song, Satans Ice Cream Truck, is also of note, as it is a silly, childrens lullaby-sounding tune with hilarious vocals, vibes, techno-industrial-like keyboards, and noteworthy bass lines.But it is Critic that is actually a better representation of Heavy As A Really Heavy Thing, as a whole. It is another slab of psychotic cyber-industrial-grind-metal with memorable (and often even borderline catchy) thrash riffs. It boasts a tour-de-force on the vocal front, too, as Devy definitely pushes his pipes to the limit, here; but the track is actually mostly of note for the way it explodes from mid-tempo grooves to brutal, headbanging, neck-aching fury without warning.Heavy As A Really Heavy Thing never -- and I mean NEVER -- locks into any kind of cohesive groove for the listener to latch on to and sink their teeth into, but that is part of its charm. So while things like accessible hooks and organic-sounding musicianship might be a thing of the past, here, it is still a very strong release, and auspicious debut. And while it may not be as mind-blowing as Strapping Young Lads sophomoric effort, 1997s City, or 2005s Alien, it is nevertheless recommended for all objectively-minded fans of heavy music.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1RNUB04CVDYS4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008Z4H7HC#wasThisHelpful","R1RNUB04CVDYS4","ASVNSWIXBV72Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ASVNSWIXBV72Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Continuing their forever-non-dying quest to constantly explore, innovate, expand, and never release the same album twice, Colorado's finest musical exports Cephalic Carnage deliver another great slab of technically-deranged death-grind by the name of ""Misled By Certainty."" The self-proclaimed hydro-grinders sixth full-length effort from the studio explodes with a truckload of blistering tech-metal riffs, immaculate drumming, and monstrous vocals, this fourteen-song set appears to at first be armed with all of the usual trademarks found on a technically-impressive extreme metal record. But once the surface is cracked, it becomes readily apparent that it is actually quite a unique and original-sounding affair.For one thing, it is armed to the teeth with a whole friggin' slew of guest musicains -- so many, in fact, that it almost seems like there is a cameo from some well-respected death metal or grindcore icon on most every track. Members of Immolation, Skinless, Krisiun, Cattle Decapitation, and Nashville P (among numerous others) all make a cameo from behind the mic. And not only that,but Pat Hanson and Bruce Lamont (of Yakuza fame) also chip in to help make the arrangements even fuller with some guest keyboards and saxophones, respectively.Furthermore, in addition to possessing an undeniably strong sense of humor, ""M.B.C.' also stands out in that it is an expansive, shape-shifting, genre-melding affair. Indeed, as with any Cephalic Carnage release, elements of sludge metal, black metal, thrash/speed metal, jazz-spazz, NYC-era hardcore, and full-on jazz-rock all come into play into Cephalic Carnage's patented blend of hyper-speed death metal and grindcore. As a result, the group manages to attain an even more unique and borderline untouchable sound.""Pure Horses,"" ""P.G.A.D.,"" ""Power And Force,"" and the intentionally humorous (scratch that, hilarious) ""Aeyeucgh"" are all explosive and bludgeoning barrages of unbelievably savage and cut-throat grindcore. And they all are really short blitzkriegs, too, thus making them evoke the genre's halcyon days. And they are all fueled by ferocious and destructive grindcore blasts, too, although said drumming mostly stands out on ""Power And Force,"" where it is especially breakneck and jackhammer-fast. Other standouts, including ""Abraxes Of Filth"" and ""Ohrwum"" find Cephalic Carnage opting for the approach taken on their 2007 effort, ""Xenosapien,"" in that they both feature some really dexterous and nimble-fingered bass work, including some really fast and technical bass soloing in the case of the former track and Brain Drill-like warbling bass grooves threaded into the mix of thunderous, earth-quaking rhythms in the case of the latter. (But only ""Abraxes"" can claim to also feature a little nicely melodic guitar soloing, in addition.)And even though the remainder of the record does not claim to be quite as epic as the above songs, there are certainly other highlights to be had. Opening salvo ""The Incorrigible Flame"" is a monstrous death-grinder that deftly switches from rapid-fire to ominously mid-tempo churning at the drop of a hat. And some bah-roo-tal vocals are laid over the whole thing, too, including low growls, high-pitched screams, unnerving shrieks, and near pig squeals. The tune's rhythms are also of note, as they are driven forward by stop-start blasts of blistering double bass propulsion. And the next one after that, ""Warbots A.M.,"" takes a similar path, as it augments its monstrous guitar riffs and almost Black Dahlia Murder-like vocal stylings with breakneck blasts of trapkit annihilation (including plenty of grinding, mind-boggling blast beats).The almost shockingly mellow, melodic, and vapid ""Cordyceps Humanis"" ultimately comes across sounding like a grindcore cover of some song taken off of Metallica's ""Load."" The occasional huge, booming power chord and spot of monstrous vocals are dropped in, here, just to keep the listener on his/her toes, though. This anomaly is not without company, though, as the ensuing ""Raped By An Orb"" takes a concertedly jazzy route, offsetting massive, chugging riffs, killer vocals, machine gun-fast drumming, and utterly whiplash fast/slow tempo changes with some exotically melodic lead work. And so does ""Repangaea,"" as it is primarily occupied by a basic, rock `n' roll-esque drum beat and some jazzy saxophone soloing, thus making it possess a very strong Naked City-esque vibe. (The song does build and eventually get increasingly experimental, complex, and epic, as it plays, though, and even goes so far as to include a cool-sounding piano line.)And a handful of other gems round out the set, including ""Dimensional Modulation Transmography,"" a heavily groove-oriented piece of death-grind with some abnormally intelligible hardcore shouts. And speaking of vocals that differ from the norm, ""When I Arrive"" slips in some clean backing vocals into the mix -- and what memorable and wailing vocals they are, too. But that might be a tad misleading, as the remainder of the track is a vicious and blistering grindcore assault that spends its time spewing out impeccable double-time drum blasts, thrashy guitar leads, and dissonant, black metal-worthy shrieking. And lastly, we are also treated to ""A King And A Thief,"" which is primarily occupied by propulsive, grinding blasts, and huge, meaty riffs, but is mostly of note for featuring a bunch of bowel-twistingly low death metal growls.A little uneven but always very enjoyable and greatly unpredictable, ""Misled By Certainty""  might be more than a little bit weird; but hey, a little weirdness never hurt anybody, now did it? And besides, it is as good an album as it is a weird one (and that is really saying something! It is just Cephalic Carnage's way of trying to distinguish their current sound from not only the hordes of other extreme metal albums available on the market today, but from their own, previous successes, too. And if that was the band's intent, then they were very, very successful.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R37OS2BSBD9YTJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003OT4M7G#wasThisHelpful","R37OS2BSBD9YTJ","ASVNSWIXBV72Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ASVNSWIXBV72Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"On their sixth full-length, Christian metallers Norma Jean sound hungry -- much hungrier than they have since the release of their sophomoric effort, O God, The Aftermath, in 2005. But even though the band has produced one of the heaviest -- if not THE heaviest -- efforts of their career, they have also turned out a record that steps outside of the comfort box, and explores experimentation beyond the mere realms of noise-inflected metal/hardcore.Being based out of Georgia, newcomers would be forgiven to think that Norma Jean are a sludge/doom/stoner metal group (since Mastodon and others of their ilk have come from said state). And on 2013s Wrongdoers, they do dabble a little bit in the world of sludgecore. (Its not exactly Eyehategod, but hey, its a start!) And furthermore, N.J. also sprinkle in a handful of undeniable progressive rock elements into the mix, here, too. By doing so, the end result is one of the most viscerally satisfying yet also well-rounded pieces of music ever to bare this bands name.Standouts If You Got It At  Five, You Got It At Fifty and The Lash Whistled Like A Singing Wind are both bludgeoning, decapitating assaults of grinding, throat-tearing noisecore, thus making them the heaviest songs that Norma Jean have ever dared to write (to date). The former is a breakneck ripper in the same vein as Botch and The Dillinger Escape Plan; and the latter evokes Converges most cut-throat stuff. If You Got It is filled with Dillinger-like math-y riffs, surging, jerking tempo changes, pounding bass lines, angular hardcore breakdowns, and dexterous drumming (including some blast beats); whereas The Lash is a blitzkrieg that just barely cracks the one minute mark, thus catching the listener totally off-guard. But there are plenty of cuts that lean more towards the melodic side of the line, with the excellent title track, which has staccato guitar hooks and vocals that range from semi-melodic to downright harmonic and pop-ish, being one example.Most of the remainder of the record, however, falls somewhere in between the above-two described styles: Brutal and tuneful. HiveMinds, with its shimmering, shaking line of feedback followed by thundering, sludgy, commanding guitar riff rooted in sludgy, grumbling bass lines, and The Bled-style hardcore screams, serves as a very strong set opener. Also make sure to check out the two pieces of more traditional and therefore accessible, pop-tinged hardcore punk/metalcore (Sword In Mouth, Fire Eyes, and the big chorusd Triffids); The Potter Has No Hands, which again adopts a punishing hardcore mentality, what with its shredded-throat screams and breakdown happy rhythms; and the bass-heavy/driven Funeral Singer. (Lots of great bass work abounds pretty much throughout this number, including plenty of sludgy, twangy bass lines, technical fills, and dirty-sounding riffs.)But the sets undisputed highpoint comes at the very end. Proof that sometimes the best is saved for last, Sun Dies, Blood Moon is a fourteen-plus minute long closing epic that takes Norma Jeans songwriting prowess to a whole new level. It is nicely textured piece with several different layers and dimensions, a docile near ballad that is layered in ethereal keyboards, gorgeous acoustic guitar strums, calmly crooned vocals, violin, cello, organs, and bow cymbals. And there is just enough throaty metalcore screams and electric guitar resonance to keep things tense, keep the listener on the edge of his or her seat, and add some much-needed dissonance to an otherwise totally melodic and progressive mix.Technical and challenging yet somehow simultaneously accessible and easy-to-digest, wholly satisfying, inventive, and unpredictable, this stands as the penultimate album to beat in Norma Jeans discography. (It rates as a close second behind only 2006s brilliant Redeemer.) And when considering how respectable (to say the very least) that discography already is, that is quite a compliment to Wrongdoers. It is definitely a worthwhile listen!","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RO14D24UA7DRX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DJYJV6S#wasThisHelpful","RO14D24UA7DRX","ASVNSWIXBV72Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ASVNSWIXBV72Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"After spending several years experimenting with their sound and trying to prove to the world that they, too, hate nu-metal, Linkin Park finally returned to their roots with long-player number six in 2014. Although it cannot be deemed to be a true return-to-form for the band, ""The Hunting Party"" tries to recapture the same levels of musical friction, energy, and all-around irresistibility first heard on 2000's debut, ""Hybrid Theory."" And while it never quite successfully does so, several of its songs make a valiant attempt at it.As a result, the album does do what previous efforts (i.e. 2012's electronic rock-leaning ""Living Things"") failed at: Scratching your Linkin Park itch. Indeed, even though it by no means is an Earth-shattering affair, or a particularly deep one (some of the material races by without leaving much of a lasting impression on the listener), it is all-but guaranteed to satisfy both schools of fans: The old school and the new school. Indeed, does ""T.H.P."" possesses just enough new-ish-sounding elements to maybe turn a few new heads, while at the same time retaining that angsty rap-metal flavor that got the band to be so big in the first place. By doing so, they have created a heavy and adrenalized, yet simultaneously melodic and never out-of-control record, and one that is in the running for being the year's crowning nu-metal achievement.There are several cameos from guest instrumentalists/vocalists spread out over the course of these twelve tracks, but of those four guest spots, only half of them are noteworthy. Helmet's Page Hamilton chips in with a catchy, cleanly-sung chorus on ""All For Nothing,"" thus offsetting the tune's fluid, youthful rap-rock stylings really well. (The rest of the track is occupied by hip-hop-ish vocal stylings and lyrics that are primarily centered around a few really good rhymes.) The end result is a sound that recaptures the one heard on the band's earliest recordings (""All For Nothing"" kind of evokes the band's fourteen-year-old hit single, 2000's ""Faint"")And the other notable cameo comes in the very next song: ""Guilty All The Same"" finds Rakim chipping in with some great guest rapping, thus helping to further the tune's potential for heavy radio-rotation. With that said, though, it would have been one that stood out in its own right, as it is a pretty darn great mix of bobbing, lurching guitar hooks, heavy, grumbling bass lines, and tight, driving rhythms that flow perfectly into deftly sweeping and fist-pumpable choruses. Add what sounds like something that could pass for a little mini guitar solo (or a whammy bar/wah-pedal-abusing guitar lick, if nothing else), and the end result is a song that has all of the makings to be a new Linkin Park classic.""The Hunting Party""'s other two cameos, though -- System Of A Down guitarist Daron Malakian on ""Rebellion"" and Tom Morello on ""Drawbar"" -- are both almost completely transparent. (A grave shame when considering what a great talent either of those guitarists is.) Fortunately, there are enough of other standouts found elsewhere to more-than-compensate for any of these shortcomings. Opener ""Keys To The Kingdom"" is one early highlight, as it is a potent mix of brutal, viscerally angsty and bratty screaming and supple, calm, sweet crooning; and ""War,"" which almost plays like a blast of nearly full-on hardcore punk (and is a very muscular and propulsive song, needless to say), is another.Other standouts include the groovy, staccato guitar crunch and more deft, sing-scream-rap vocals of ""Wastelands""; the touching ""Until It's Gone,"" which is a much gentler and more docile piece, a near ballad if you will, and one that is centered around, sweetly-sung choruses that are big and epic enough to require their own area code; and ""Final Masquerade."" The latter of these three songs might have a catchy, funky, trip-hop-esque beat, but is ultimately a number that, thanks to its utilization of some of Linkin Park's all-time best and most accomplished clean singing, kind of reminds of L.P.'s ""In The End.""But the set's two biggest highlights are actually found elsewhere. ""Mark The Graves"" puts the album on heavier ground, as it is centered around a massive, thunderous, lumbering guitar riff. Said track also features some tricky tempo and arrangement change-ups, but again, how about that riff (!): It is as commanding and memorable as anything that six-stringer Brad Delson have ever produced! And the second arguable highpoint comes at the very end: ""A Line In The Sand"" is a very seamless, insanely hooky, and infectious shuffle. It transitions from effortlessly fluid rapping to hard-rocking guitar-driven crunch seemingly without even breaking sweat. The end result is the deepest and most epic tune on the whole record, hands down.In summary, ""The Hunting Party"" is Linkin Park's best effort since 2003's ""Meteora,"" and one that might not be a true ""classic,"" but is still one that shows definite signs of improvement for the band. It is not exactly a reinvention (or even drastic expansion) of the form, meaning it is not an absolutely essential or life-altering listen. But nobody could argue that it is anything less than a really fun and enjoyable one. And at the very end of the day, could you really ask for anything more?","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RFP075XSYUCZ0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00K03VZ1K#wasThisHelpful","RFP075XSYUCZ0","ASVNSWIXBV72Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ASVNSWIXBV72Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Machine Head are exactly the type of band that seems just perfect to release a live album, seeing how they have a frontman whose frenetic energy really knows how to work crowds everywhere. And plus, with seven full-lengths under their mighty belts, they have quite a large back catalogue to choose songs from. So here we are, finding the band release of Machine Fing Head Live hitting store shelves in 2012.True, M.H. do already have a live album to their names. And even though this second one does not QUITE recapture the same levels of irresisitbility as 2003s Hellalive, it is still one of the best live thrash albums that this reviewer has heard since Metallicas S&M came out in 1999. And yes, these live renditions might adhere closely to the songs original versions -- meaning there are no added guitar or drum solos -- they are played with a sufficiently minimal amount of crowd noise, which is a plus. And furthermore, they are impeccably played (frontman Rob Flynn and Co. tear through them without any audible mistakes.) All of this considered, what we have on our hands, here, is a definite must-purchase for all hardcore fans of the band.With fifteen tracks spread out over the course of two discs, there are bound to be numerous standouts. Set opener I Am Hell is a monstrous wall of thunderous, staccato riffing and drumming, although it does splice in some memorable, wah-heavy guitar soloing into its mix of blistering thrash picking and impeccable, blast beat-centric drum beats. Be Still And Know, then, is another blistering, but this time groove-centric thrasher with more memorable and exceptional, shred-happy soloing; but it is the next track after that, Imperium, where it becomes first blatantly obvious that the mosh pit was working overtime going berserk. It boasts blowtorch riffage and shotgun blast-esque percussion, and is also home to a few well-placed fast tempo changes (which might showcase Machine Heads more math-y and technical side, but are nevertheless flawlessly-executed.)Beautiful Mourning continues these brutal ways, as it is a frenetic mosh pit anthem with elastically thundering, throbbing thrash grooves and biting, grinding guitar crunch. The only time the onslaught ever relents is to drop in a semi-sweet, cleanly-sung chorus, and ripping, surprisingly melodic solo. And the following The Blood, The Sweat, The Tears is every-bit the irresistible mosh pit anthem that the above-described two tracks were, and it in fact proves to be quite impossible for you, the listener sitting in the safe confines of your own home, not to bounce around with energy, headbang, and break some s**t. Yes, the energy is that freaking palpable in this one!Locust boasts plenty of huge, crunch-n-churn riffs, but is actually mostly of note for featuring some of the first discs best and most memorable and epic guitar soloing. Moving along, the misleadingly-entitled This Is The End kicks off with an excellent introductory drum solo before being followed by a rip-roaring barrage of Eighties-worthy thrash. It is a blistering thrash/riff-fest, needless to say, and one with a few extensive and very screaming solo flights. And rounding out the first disc are Aesthetics Of Hate, which is dedicated to our brother, Dimebag, and sure to get the circle pit acting stupid; and Old, which is highlighted by some abnormally strong, and prominently audible bass work, as well as plenty of excellent, fiery, groove-laden guitar licks, and an audience-involved chorus.Highlights on Machine Fing Head Lives second disc include the fiery, swirling thrash of the Sepultura/Soulfly-reminiscent Darkness Within; the blistering Who We Are (which is home to the extensive use of excellent, all-over-the-map guitar soloing); and Halo, which is seemingly tailor-made for head-banging (Flynn even admits it is!). It has abrasive buzzsaw riffing and towering, dizzying melodic solo flights to go along with its sweet, sing-song-worthy melodic singing, and crunching, skull-rattling grooves. And, of course, one must not forget to mention the inclusion of the sets final song, Davidan. It might now be a nineteen year-old hit single, but it is still every bit as potent and vibrant as it was when it premiered on Machine Heads 1994 debut, Burn My Eyes. (At the beginning of it, frontman Rob Flynn proclaims I wanna see this place explode -- and it almost surely did just that once the band lunged into the meat of the song.) Suffice it to say, it is a truly anthemic song, and I cannot think of a better way to close out the album.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R28Y2X00ZDRYKP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009INAMCQ#wasThisHelpful","R28Y2X00ZDRYKP","ASVNSWIXBV72Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ASVNSWIXBV72Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"After recruiting a new vocalist, one who goes by the name George ""Corpsegrinder"" Fisher, in 1996, New York death metal natives Cannibal Corpse released a slew of new recordings, each one of them as strong as the ones recorded with Chris Barnes behind the mic. This included the release of the band's second ever E.P., ""Worm Infested,"" which saw the light of day in 2003 (in the downtime in between 2002's ""Gore Obsessed"" and 2004's ""The Wretched Spawn""), despite having material that had floated around the marketplace in various locations over the course of the last seven years. It is primarily a compilation E.P., as it is comprised of three cover songs, and one re-recording of a C.C. classic; but it also features two brand-spankin'-new studio recordings.Opening with a bang, the blistering ""Systematic Elimination"" is just about as speedy, insane, viciously violent, and malevolent a two minutes and fifty-five seconds as you will ever hear from Cannibal Corpse. (And when considering the band's always high standards in that department, that is REALLY saying something!) It is backed by ferocious, barn-burning riffage, viscerally rumbling bass, stop-start drum blasts, and careening guitar soloing, and topped off by Fischer's trademarked growly, horse-throated bellowing. The title track then continues the album's brutal ways, as it might start out as a sludgy and brooding, bass-heavy piece, but soon takes off into blistering, blasting death metal-dom with searing, wall-of-sound guitar leads, pain-inflicting drums, and memorable vocal patterns. (Here, the usual abundance of brutally low growling is occasionally augmented by piercingly high-pitched shrieking.) And I must mention the fact that this song also boasts another wild, Slayer-ish solo, too.Next we have the set's first cover song, ""Demon's Night,"" which was originally written and performed by German power metallers Accept. The Cannibal Corpse cover of it, though, is just as good as the original. Working up a steady, meaty chug and stomp from a brief bit of introductory near-silence, it eventually climaxes by becoming a rhythmically galloping number with oddly intelligible vocals and unorthodox guitar soloing. ""Confessions,"" is the album's next cover, this one being a spot-on Possessed cover, and one that is, needless to say, very blistering, and full of densely churning, bone-crunching riffage and some of the short-player's absolute best guitar solo work.But do not overlook track four on the album, ""The Undead Will Feast,"" just because it is sandwiched between these two already described covers. It is an excellent, vintage Cannibal Corpse-sounding breakneck surge of brutal bass lines, tight and precise cymbal rides, incessant double bass pummel, and grumbling guitar noise. And the solos in this song are of the screaming and frenetic variety. And rounding out the set is ""No Remorse,"" a Metallica cover, and one that is loaded with fiery, thrashy tempo'ing, chugging riffs that are positively catchy, and abrasively grinding rhythms. Add some blazing guitar leads, memorably shredding solo runs, and surprisingly technical, slapped bass fills to the mix, and the end result is easily one of the finest cover songs in the history of death metal. And it retains the original version's catchy and memorable choruses, too!Again, ""Hammer Smashed Face"" is not great (or long) enough to be deemed an essential listen for everybody. But even if the necessity of its release is, at best, questionable, it is still nonetheless most certainly good enough to be a worthy purchase for everybody that claims to be a serious fan of the band or genre. It is, after all, one of the best E.P.'s ever released in the entire history of death metal music.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJU6GFUBAAIJ9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0000794DR#wasThisHelpful","RJU6GFUBAAIJ9","ASVNSWIXBV72Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ASVNSWIXBV72Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Emerging as a very talented and auspicious young power metal group, Germanys Sabaton are, if nothing else, then at least high in the running of being crowned the very respectable title of the Accept of the new millennium. They bare all of the workings of a prototypical power metal classic, and while it might come up a bit short of attaining such a prestigious attribute, there is plenty to like on this album, their seventh full-length. Among the attributes on this 2014 release include crunchy, industrial-strength riffing, pronounced, bubbling bass, solid, natural-sounding drum beats, fantastical lyrics, and epic-sounding arrangements/songs.Sabatons frontman, Joakim Broden, meanwhile, splits his time alternating equally between Bruce Dickinson-meets-Rob Halford impressions. So while he may not be the most original vocalist on the market, he does certainly prove to the world that he is nothing if not an accomplished singer. The end result produced of all these things is a good throwback traditional/power metal record, and a more than sufficient homage to the bands influences. With that said, however, it should be known that Heroes is not exactly an earth-shattering affair, nor one that can be deemed to be frequently amazing. (The guitar solos, in particular could use some work -- they could stand to be a bit longer, as could the songs, in general.) But man, is it rock solid!Cuts like Night Witches, a triumphant-sounding opener with unforgettable, chanted vocals and blazing melodic soloing that both evoke classic Judas Priest; and No Bullets Fly, a propulsive chugger with tons of really tasty guitar crunch to go along with its delicious, Iron Maiden-inspired guitar harmonies and solos, practically scream pure power metal. But there are a few curveballs thrown into the mix every now and then, too, including making Smoking Snakes a blistering, speed metal-lite anthem, and inmate 4859 take on a near industrial rock-esque vibe, what with its chanted, Rammstein-esque vocals (that are sung very dramatically and in Sabatons native tongue, German), and all. Also on the experimental front, To Hell And Back opens with a really cool, foreign instrument (a whistling wind instrument of some kind). But this is before, however, the tune falls into typical power metal territory, adhering to a rhythmic, toe-tappable groove and uncorking good guitar solos for the remainder of the song.The Ballad Of Bull is a big standout track, thus making it the perfect album centerpiece. It is a bit of an anomaly, too, as it is an epic and chilling power ballad with lush musical arrangements (including gorgeous strings and cool-sounding piano keys) laying the foundation for the frontmans excellent, triumphant, and often even borderline-soulful clean vocals to soar over the top of. But immediately following this, the record returns to its metallic roots, as Resist And Bite maxes-out its levels of guitar crunch. Plenty of wailing melodic soloing, memorable vocal patterns, and extra-dramatic-sounding drum fills also highlight the mix, here, too. And continuing these aggressive ways, Soldier Of 3 Armies is a hard-hitting, speed metal-inflected power metaller rooted in hard-hitting drum beats and thrashy picking. Here, a bouncy, thundering drum intro flows right into fiery, chugging riffage, humming bass lines, solid double kick drumming. And the tune hits its memorable climax when it tosses in some crystalline-sounding melodic solo flights which are nearly vertigo-inducing.Next after this comes Far From The Fame, which brings back that twiddly melodical soloing (some of the albums best!), and towering piles of it, too, and anchors the whole thing with some impressively dexterous drum fills. Then, following the extremely catchy, oh-so-Iron Maiden-ish galloping cadence and impressively soaring vocals of Hearts Of Iron, the listener is treated to the closing 7734, one last propulsive and steady chugger where excellent clean singing and abrasive guitar crunch are underpinned by heavy, grumbling bass lines.Although not a totally flawless and/or timeless masterpiece, Heroes is a highly enjoyable, promising, well-played, and certainly always very decent and listenable musical experience with more-than-a-few flashes of brilliance. And it is proof of the fact that Sabaton have all of the tools they need in order to be a very successful young power metal band, and arguably one that can play right up there with the big dogs. Essential? Nah; but a heckuva lotta fun!","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RWSF1J0SNFFX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ISYLBHG#wasThisHelpful","RWSF1J0SNFFX","ASVNSWIXBV72Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ASVNSWIXBV72Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Fallujah's sophomore effort, ""The Flesh Prevails,"" is easily one of the finest and most original death metal albums of 2014. One of its original attributes is the fact that its bass tone is abnormally strong and meaty (especially for death metal), meaning it is mixed high in the mix, and thus easy to pick out and follow. Furthermore, the bass work, while very prominently audible, is also exceedingly technical. We're not talking Brain Drill-levels of technicality, here, but it is more complex and precise than you are probably used to hearing on the average DM recording.But what makes this the innovative, game-changer of an album that it is, and the sizeable leap forward from Fallujah's three-year old debut (""The Harvest Wombs""), is the fact that it skillfully balances equal parts of harmony and nuance with its heaviness. Indeed, for every moment of extremity, there is always a pocket of gorgeous melody waiting just around the corner. (Epic-sounding harmonious guitar runs are utilized to help aid in this cause, as are various other audio pleasantries, including keyboards.) You'll see what I mean, here, shortly...Opener ""Sarlit Path"" fades in with some ominously ambient noise before suddenly adopting punishing death metal elements, allowing smashing drum blasts, sludgy, twangy-sounding bass lines, blistering guitars, and tortured-sounding vocal howls to slam onto the scene with little-to-no warning. The number does open up a little bit the more it plays, though, as the nice twin guitar melodicism at around the four-minute mark filtered in at around the four-minute mark allows the arrangements to breathe nicely. ""Carved From Stone,"" however, mostly plays like an uncompromising blast-fest in that it is laden with thunderous riffing and furious drumming. In a particularly weird move, there are some ethereally clean vocals in the mid-section of the track; but on the whole, ""Carved From Stone"" mostly plays like a no-holds-barred Deicide song in that it is so straightforwardly brutal and aggressive.Next up, ""The Night Reveals"" slips in some dreary melodic guitar lead-work in its intro before shifting back to blasting, roaring death metal brutality. Granted, though, this brutality is offset by some more neat little melodies, coming in the form of some middle Eastern/Arabian-sounding guitar leads, a technical, winding bass line, and female vocal-backing harmonization. This melodic angle is further-fleshed out on the ensuing title song, which brings back those female backing vocal lines and augments them with some more exotic guitar melodicism and shimmering synth ambiance, thus creating a song that is, for all but the last half-minute or so (which is again really heavy), an extremely trippy and proggy, ethereal-sounding interlude.An interesting, adherently complex and prominent bass line and some nicely layered vocal harmonization begin ""Levitation,"" a nice touch by all measures. But from there, the song quickly jumps to a brutal, speaker-shaking death metal climax taut with pummeling, stop-start blast beats and visceral, borderline monstrous-sounding vocal roars. But as good as ""Levitation"" is, it is almost overshadowed by what comes next: ""Alone With You,"" a heavily progressive and industrial-lite interlude that makes heavy use of electronics, dreary, dreamy synth textures, and other heavenly ambiance. And this piece, the album's sole completely instrumental piece, also features some martial-sounding percussion to boot.But once ""Alone..."" winds to a close, the heaviness storming back in full force, as ""Allure"" kicks off by lumbering out of the gate with massive power chords, and locomotive double-kick drumming creating some ultra-imposing and resonating rhythms. Like the album's best songs, though, this one does not totally discount melody, and in fact does an exceedingly good job at balancing it with the tune's aural aggression. And the end result is a very well-textured, epic, and deep piece of music, and one whose arrangements are made even further dynamic through the use of a pretty darn wailing guitar solo near the end.""Sapphire"" also continues in this relentless-yet-simultaneously-restrained manner, underscoring heavenly melodic guitar leads with a nearly crushing barrage of mean, blast beat-heavy percussion, crunching riffs, solid, grumbling bass lines, and a blisteringly tight interplay/give-and-take between the three instruments. And some more melodic lead/solo work is also interwoven on-and-off into the mix throughout this number, thus helping to further its undeniably epic vibe. From there, the album is capped off by ""Chemical Cave,"" which begins by luring the listener in with a nearly trance-inducing, progressive rock-derived melody and thumping, if non-threatening drum beat. And this piece, the set closer, also features some nice, winding melodic solos, and plenty of harmonically jazzy guitar leads/scales which help to really further its epically mazy and unpredictable persona.All in all, ""The Flesh Prevails"" is without question one really great and standout-worthy release. It is such a good album, in fact, that it verges on being an essential purchase. It is much more than just tough-guy hardcore posturing or Cannibal Corpse worshipping metal; meaning that there is much more going on, here, than just the mere use of monster riffs and Cookie Monster bellowing. As such, there is no debating one thing: The fact that it is an extremely convincing take on the American death metal genre, and one that most certainly deviates from the norm.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1KVK76I7DCBSB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KJFZW0O#wasThisHelpful","R1KVK76I7DCBSB","ASVNSWIXBV72Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ASVNSWIXBV72Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In the world of extreme metal, there are really three sub-genres where it is okay to for a band to be comprised of only one or two members: Grindcore (see The Berzerker, etc.), black metal (e.g. Gorelord), and industrial metal (i.e. Hanzel Und Gretyl). Fortunately for Norways Anaal Nathrakh, the band fall somewhere in between these three sub-genres, meaning they are among the absolute most sonically extreme new groups in all of metal. And this also means that A.N. operate as a mere duo comprised of Dave Hunt (a.k.a. V.I.T.R.I.O.L.), and Mick Kenney (who is better known as Irrumator, and handles all instrumental and programming duties, in addition to designing album artwork for 2013s Vanitas, and producing said record.)And while things like variety, infectious melody, nuance, and live-energy have never been any of the bands strong-suits, they are still very well capable of stacking one seizure-inducing guitar riff and pummeling blast beat un top of another. By doing so, they keep the intensity level in the red throughout this records near thirty-eight-minute long playing time, even when they opt to explore the realms of nuance and atmosphere (which are rare occurrences)Peeling out of the gate with tires squealing (almost literally), blistering opener The Blood-Dimmmed Tide is a totally off-the-rails attack on the senses, a rabid, vicious, swirling barrage of brutal, hissing, venomous vocals, and bullet-fast blasting; while cuts like the token-grinder Of Fire, And Fing Pigs play more like a piece of more traditional grindcore in the same vein as, say, Nasum and some Napalm Death stuff. But with that said, it is actually tracks like To Spite The Face (which slips in some spooky clean vocals into its choruses) and You Cant Save Me, So Stop Fing Trying that are better representations of the album, as a whole, as both songs are bludgeoning and evoke Agoraphobic Nosebleed (or some other cyber-grind band) being fed through Cradle Of Filths meat-grinder.One of the records other biggest highlights is Todos Somos Humanos, a track that enters the realm of thrash territory with Slayer-esque picking, and machine-gun drums, but is actually mostly of note for its wide-range of vocals. Here, V.I.T.R.I.O.L. switches gears from hissing to low death metal growls to piercingly high black metal shrieks, and even drops in the occasional goregrind-derived pig squeal, too. (And trust me when I say this: That stuff hurts!) A Metaphor For The Dead also a stands out from a vocal perspective, as it offsets its memorably thunderous, churning riffs and pounding (if largely blast beat-free) drumming with some bizarrely soaring, tactful, and almost operatic-clean backing vocals.Other standouts include Forging Towards The Sunset, which sure cuts awfully deep, as it is a caustic musical stew comprised of monstrous vocals, battering ram-esque blast beats, and thunderous rhythms; In Coelo Quies, Tout Finis Ici Bas, which is another exercise in ferocious, paint-peeling brutality, as it brims with earth-quaking grindcore blasts and racing, blood-pumping guitar leads, and only occasionally flirts with the odd melodic flourish (including the use of a brief but nice melodic guitar solo in the songs outro). And, of course, one must not forget to mention the terrifically dark, ominous, and neck-hair-raising interlude called Feeding The Beast.Much like far-too-many bands (Rotten Sound, Circle Of Dead Children, etc., etc., etc.,) of their kind, Anaal Nathrakh are criminally underrated. They possess a sound that is so extreme that it not only turns most listeners off, but truly alienates and disgusts them. Even so, what A.N. have created, here, on Vanitas is one very unique sound, a solid black metal album, and an actually pretty darn good grindcore album. And also as a result of this, they have become a band that is more-than-deserving of some much-needed attention.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R17IJOVGTGRV8R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009H441G4#wasThisHelpful","R17IJOVGTGRV8R","ASVNSWIXBV72Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ASVNSWIXBV72Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In a lot of ways, there are really two types of bands in the world of heavy metal music: Those that want to press forward and survive, and those that don't. Let's discuss is a little more, shall we? Following the release of ""Unseen"" in 2011, The Haunted endured a devastating, and totally acrimonious split with longtime vocalist Peter Doelving, and, subsequently, guitarist Anders Bjorler and drummer Per Morllers Jensen, thus leaving the future of the band up in the air. Couple this with the fact that they had recently released a couple of albums, ""Versus"" in 2008, and the horrendously-received (and already noted) ""Unseen"" 2011, and the end result is a time in the band's career where they, like most bands, very well might just split-up. (This would be following in the same footsteps as Pantera, who dissolved back in 2003 following the departure of their vocalist, Phil Anselmo, and bassist, Rex Brown. Or, for a more recent example, check out Chimaira, who disbanded after losing everybody except vocalist Mark Hunter)But The Haunted are not one of those bands. Realizing that this would be far-too-easy and that they have put too much effort into the band to call it quits now, The Haunted recruited a new singer, Marco Aro, and rhythm section (guitarist Ola Englund), and kicked out a safe-yet-fully-satisfying rifferama. No, ""Exit Wounds"" does not have the same level of landmark-worthy innovation that previous Haunted efforts like 2004's game-changing ""rEVOLVEr,"" and 2006's wonderful ""The Dead Eye,"" had. But it doesn't need to. It is nevertheless still such a strong album that it reaffirms this band's status as being the leaders of the now burgeoning Swedish thrash metal circuit. The songs on this 2014 release, the band's eighth full-length, are short but sweet. Indeed, they are compact yet still manage to cut deep -- and I mean right down to the bone! Saturated with the good stuff (i.e. great riffs, propulsive leads, and exceptional solos) ""E.W."" is guaranteed to tickle the fancy of just about any and every metalhead on the market today.The pounding, churning instrumental lead-off cut (""317"") flows right into the blistering, metalcore-tinged ""Cutting Teeth."" Here, The Haunted motor out of the gate with fiery, razorwire thrash riffage and taut, interlocking blast beats in order to create thundering rhythms for the frontman to spill his throaty, phlegm-flecked aggression over. And immediately following this comes ""My Salvation,"" another pounding, scorching thrasher with delicious buzzsaw guitar crunch, vehement vocals, and really, really memorable choruses, and the even more brutal and blistering ""Psychonaut."" The latter of these two tunes is a barreling, heads-down, circle pit-stoking thrasher with charging, Slayer-iffic guitar leads and Doelving-esque screams. But this bruiser does feature some melodic guitar leads/soloing, and interweaves them tastefully into its otherwise hard-hitting mix and At The Gates-esque galloping beats.The ensuing ""Eye Of The Storm"" is ever-so-slightly more mid-tempo, but it is still very heavy, a fact that is in a large part due to it being a bass-driven number that boasts uber-strong, grumbling bass throbs. But this piece is further highlighted by some nicely clean and melodic guitar soloing, too. ""Trend (Will Not Heal)"" is an even bigger standout, though, and one of this reviewer's personal favorites, despite it actually sounding more like a Slipknot song than anything else. It does feature some wailing, sweeping melodic guitar soloing, but it is actually the rhythm section that stands out the most, here, as it is home to a strong bass intro and tight and precise drumming throughout. (Ex-At The Gates skinman Erlan Erlandsson really nails his blasts and thrash beats, here, no matter how machine gun-fast as they might be.) And ""Trend Killer"" is also further highlighted by some varied vocal patterns which produce offets growling with screaming and even a few shrieks in order to produce some REALLY memorable choruses.The band's undeniable Pantera influence shifts to the forefront of the mix for the next two tracks, the ensuing ""Time (Will Not Heal)"" and ""All I Have."" The former of these two inclusions is an insanely hooky chugger that augments its rhythmic, ""Dimebag"" Darrell-sounding chunk with squealing pinch harmonics and tacks on a gently wailing melodic guitar solo for good measure; and the latter kind of evokes a ""Vulgar Display  Of Power"" b-side. Indeed, it does feature catchy, adherent grooves, a cascade of grinding, Pantera-esque licks, and even some Phil Anselmo-stylized growling. And yes, it is home to some more really memorable (and totally air-guitar-able) soloing, too.But the next two songs after that find a definite metalcore/modern day thrash influence coming into the fray, including thunderously chugging breakdowns in the Lamb Of God-like bruiser ""Temptation,"" and ""My Enemy,"" which are similar tunes in that they both stagger blistering thrash tempos with undeniable moments of restraint. But the next one after that, ""Kill The Light,"" is a more traditional Haunted cut in that it brings together all three of the sources of inspiration, playing like a brutal, surging, lunging thrasher that evokes Slayer-meets-Pantera-meets-Hatebreed. And rounding out the set are two final songs, each one of them as solid as anything else on the whole record. ""This War"" is a really catchy speedster, no matter how scalding it may be, and is home to some blistering guitar solo runs; while the bookending ""Infiltrator"" and ""Ghost In The Machine"" both boast some deep, heavy, rolling bass grooves. With that said, though, this closing track actually mostly stands out on account of it utilizing a fairly extensive use of deliciously melodic guitar leads and soloing.No, ""Exit Wounds"" is not a groundbreaking or even particularly essential affair; but it never really pretends to be. What is it? A great album from a great band? Oh, heck yes! And when considering the history behind it (just think about the fact that it was produced by a mere two-fifths of a band), it is made even better. A satisfying and immensely enjoyable monster with scads of inspiring vocals, impassioned performances, and memorable riffs that will hang with you long after the record has done playing.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3BCMZVOKZBC4G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00M1IGTQI#wasThisHelpful","R3BCMZVOKZBC4G","ASVNSWIXBV72Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ASVNSWIXBV72Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"When you hear the phrase ""Viking metal,"" what probably comes to mind are bands like Amon Amarth, Ensiferum, Destroy Destroy Destroy, and Amorphis. And while those two groups are definitely among the cream of the genre's crop, there is one band that has never gotten enough credit, but certainly deserves to be ranked right up there alongside the elite: Unleashed. And the kicker to the story is the fact that this Swedish metal band actually formed in 1989, making them quite a bit older than most Viking metal groups. Hence, they are held accountable for helping to spearhead the genre, and being one of the leading influences on groups like the ones named above.And while almost all of the songs on Unleashed's ninth full-length, 2008'S ""Hammer Battalion,"" might follow the exact same structure (verse-chorus-verse-solo-outro), they are also chockablock full of great riffs and even greater solos. As a result, the songs capture an intensity so enormous and vibrant that any such notion of a cookie-cutter vibe is very soon forgotten about. (Heck, the solos are so darn virtuosic that they alone warrant purchasing this album.)Check out track twelve, ""Home Of The Brave,"" an amazing collection of godly, insanely intricate, and nimble-fingered, string-busting death-thrash riffage that rivals the best stuff put out by the likes of Nile and Morbid Angel. The tune does not completely forsake melody, though, as it does feature a deliciously harmonic guitar lead section; and yes, this is one of those instances where the solos verge on near neo-classicalism. And also included, here, is another simple yet very potent and effective chorus. With that having been said, though, it is actually a song like opener ""The Greatest Of All Lies"" that is a better representation of the album, as a whole. It is an explosive and punishing opening blast with a galloping cadence, booming double kick-drum propulsion, and shriek-y, early Morbid Angel-esque vocals to go along with its crunching thrash riffs and wailing, trade-off melodic guitar solo section. And add another catchy and memorable chorus to the mix, and the end result is one song that actually closely evokes latter-day God Dethroned (even though, yes, this reviewer is well-aware that Unleashed predate G.D., too.)But does that mean those are the only standouts? Oh, heck no -- far from it, in fact! ""Long Before Winter's Call,"" which boasts blistering blast beats, inventive and catchy, galloping riffs, buzzsaw-fast guitar leads, and solo flights that are equal parts epic and excellent, might be a great song for those reasons, alone, but this fact is made certain by its use of effective and well-placed fast tempo changes. And moving along, ""Your Children Will Burn"" is another early-album gem, as it is a slightly more restrained (and insanely catchy) chugger with crunchy, chugging guitar hooks, and equally-as-catchy and memorable, concert-ready choruses. Back on the breakneck side of the line, though, ""Hammer Battalion"" is an explosive and bludgeoning excursion -- an all-out blitzkrieg of pulverizing extremity played at brutal, blasting speeds.Following it comes ""This Day Belongs To Me,"" a much more restrained and involved, mid-tempo brooder with some more epic, and highly infectious melodic solo work, doomy overtones, thudding skins, and unforgettable choruses. Hence, it is a tune that evokes ""Monotheist""-era Celtic Frost. It is immediately offset, however, by ""Marching Off To War,"" another blistering jaunt, this one home to pummeling death-grind blasts and ripping guitar leads, although it is also home to a mid-tempo breakdown with plenty of twiddly and wailing guitar melodies. And ""Entering The Hall Of The Slain"" continues in this same manner, with excellent, abrasively grinding riffs and strong, galloping hooks serving as the perfect compliment to stellar, unforgettably epic, and totally air-guitar-worthy melodious soloing.Then, after the buzzsaw-fast insistence of ""Black Horizon,"" the record serves up one of its sole anomalies in the form of ""Carved In Stone,"" which opens with a nice and peaceful acoustic guitar intro followed by a thunderous and pounding attack where ominously booming rhythms, dissonantly snarly/growly vocals, and blistering melodic soloing run the show. ""Warriors Of Midgard,"" though, is a decapitating and uncompromising assault, a totally relentless and grindcore-worthy sprint of dexterously fast bass lines, rip-roaring guitars, smoldering rhythms, and pummeling drums.And rounding out the set are two final songs that simply must not be ignored. ""Midsummer Solstice"" is an especially catchy number with industrial-strength chugging. But its real highlight comes in the form of another epic, Exodus-style trade-off melodic solo section that is just plain fabulous. And, finally, ""I Want You Dead"" boasts another simplistic yet effective -- and, in this case, terrifically creepy and portentous --chorus (with staccato, chanted-esque vocals reciting the tune's title phrase), as well as plenty more crunchy and propulsive, chug and churn riffing, blazing melodic leads (that crop up in the background of the mix), and an ascending/descending solo run. The drumming also really stands out, here, as skinsman Anders Schultz, an all-too-often overlooked hero behind the trapkit, is granted to lay down plenty of really deft and machine gun-fast fills at various points throughout the song.Viking metal, death metal, death-thrash, blackened death metal, melodeath, death-grind -- ""Hammer Battalion"" is an excellent album, no matter what the genre, and one that is so full of the good stuff that it easily ranks amongst 2008's upper-tier for metal releases. And it makes the following fact very clear: Unleashed are one of the most criminally-underrated (or at least overlooked) bands in the history of extreme metal.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RW36VZFQJ5165/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0016ORPM0#wasThisHelpful","RW36VZFQJ5165","ASVNSWIXBV72Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ASVNSWIXBV72Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There is very little-to-no debate that Zakk Wylde (a.k.a. Jeffrey Phillip Wielandt) is a great guitarist (after all filling in for the absent seat vacated by Randy Rhodes, the original six-string virtuoso in the Ozzy Osbourne band, is no small feat.) And on the masterful ""1919 Eternal,"" the third record from Black Label Society, the Zakk-fronted side project founded in 1999, Mr. Wylde plays a lot, thus quite frequently (to say the least) showing off his amazing, fretboard shredding skills. His talents are so great, in fact, that this 2002 recording argues the point that Zakk is a god of his instrument. And even though he probably might not be THE almighty guitar god (Jimi Hendrix and ""Dimebag"" Darrell Abbott edge him out), there is no question that he (alongside a few others, including Rhodes, Dave Mustaine, Yngwie Malmsteen, et al.) proudly sits at the right hand side of that throne.Zakk's instrumental mastery is, again, astounding pretty much all throughout ""1919 Eternal."" But it is at its most impressive on cuts like the very aptly-entitled ""Battering Ram,"" which is, essentially, two and a half minutes of blistering buzzsaw riffage and thrashy tempo'ing; the uber-crunchy, meaty, and abrasively grinding riff cascade and thundering rhythms that back ""Lords Of Destruction,"" and make it the irresistible headbanger that it is; the darkly dreary, dreamy, and docile acoustic balladry, splendidly jazzy, melodic soloing, and surprisingly decent clean singing of ""Bridge To Cross"" (which ultimately comes across sounding not unlike Pantera's cover of ""Planet Caravan""); and the insanely, intricately gorgeous (and entirely instrumental) acoustic rendition of the appropriately-entitled set closer, ""America The Beautiful.""And, certainly, there are numerous other album highlights. Opener ""Bleed For Me,"" with its galloping cadence, propulsive, chainsaw-stutter guitar leads, whammy bar-heavy solo flight, and really catchy and memorable vocal refrains make it one the best moments; and ""Life/Birth/Blood/Doom,"" which augments its industrial-strength riffing and epic, several parted, and totally air-guitar-able soloing with funky, slapped bass lines (that are especially audible during a late-song bridge, and come courtesy of ex-Ozzy Osbourne/future Metallica bassist Robert Trujillo), is another.A handful of other choice standouts include the galloping, pounding, churning groove and memorable, sing-songy vocals found in ""Graveyard Disciples""; the fiery, staccato lurch of ""Demise Of Sanity""; and ""Genocide Junkies,"" a nearly six-minute-long crunch-fest. Furthermore, The beautifully-plucked, flamenco-sounding string arrangements in the misleadingly-titled ""Speedball"" is not too shabby, either (making it much more than a mere minute-long interlude track); and the brutal, snarly vocals and machine-gun-like guitar licksmake ""Refuse To Bow Down"" also well-worth your time and attention.True, whether or not Zakk's songwriting is as stellar as his understanding of/grip on great riffs and wah-wah-drenched solos is very much up for debate. But it does not really matter, because ""1919 Eternal"" is pretty darn unforgettable either way. As such, it is absolutely essential listening for anybody that claims to be any kind of fan of sludge/doom/stoner metal, hard rock, and/or traditional heavy metal music, as a whole. And trust me when I say this: If you like virtuosic guitar work, you will fall deeply in love with this album.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2JUVGJ4TGEV5E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00242KCXM#wasThisHelpful","R2JUVGJ4TGEV5E","ASVNSWIXBV72Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ASVNSWIXBV72Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Accepts fourteenth album proper is one of the more highly-anticipated heavy metal releases of the year. How did it get to such a prestigious status? Well, for starters, it is the bands first collection of new songs from the studio in over two and a half years. Secondly, after meeting with one postponement, debuted at number one on the German sales chart. Next, its release marks the thirty-fifth anniversary (believe it or not) of Accept being a band. And finally, but equally as importantly, 2014s Blind Rage proudly proclaims (on its cover) that Accept are the ""gods of German metal"" -- a risky statement to say the least.So does B.R. does it live up to the hype? The answer to that is, sadly, no, mainly because the Teutonic power metallers have very little earth left to scorch. But that in no way should imply that it is even in the same ballpark as a bad (or even mediocre) record. Indeed, the bands instrumental abilities remain as exceptional as ever, and their songwriting is finely honed and refined, too. As a result, it is a very, impeccably solid and unquestionably inspired effort, and one that is nothing if not extremely enjoyable.The pure, unabashed Judas Priest worship of aptly-entitled opener Stampede is very tolerable, and not just because of its crunchy, galloping beat, but because it is further highlighted by blistering, speed metal-lite tempoing, memorably aggressive, call-and-response vocal patterns, and a glass-shattering, dive-bombing guitar solo section. This is then succeeded by Dying Breed, an uber-crunchy and churning follow-up song, and Dark Side Of My Heart, a restrained, slow-motion chugger with more tasty and ripping solos galore. The ominous and foreboding Fall Of The Empire comes next, and it pins really, really memorable, chanted-like vocals against a tasty musical bed comprised of delicious harmonic lead work.The tempo might have dipped slightly over the course of the last couple of tracks, but the intensity level never fades even for a moment. And album centerpiece, Trail Of Tears, makes sure of this fact. It really revs up the engines again, playing like a no-holds-barred and blistering speed metal jaunt that races by like a sports car. And the nicely textured Wanna Be Free is an even bigger standout still, as it opens with a lovely bit of melody in the form of a colorful little acoustic intro. But this is then followed-up by a solid, grumbling bass line and steady guitar chug. And from there, the tune ascends to a speedy gallop iced off by another round of epic melodic-shred soloing.200 Years is another insanely hooky, industrial-strength chugger; and track eight, Bloodbath Mastermind, picks up pretty much right where the above-described song left off, starting out playing like a crunchy chugger before picking up steam. From there, it gradually builds to blistering speed metal-mania, complete with fiery chainsaw riffing. And the tracks epic scope is further illustrated by the fact that it boasts quite a few wailing solos, too.Then, following the nearly anthemic crescendo and great, climactic soloing of From The Ashes We Rise, Accept take one more venture through more restrained territory with The Curse, whose soaring, introductory harmonic leads lend the song an indisputably epic feel early on. And this vibe lingers pretty much throughout the duration of the tunes six and a half-minute-long playing time, even as it adopts crunchy guitar licks, wailing, Halford-esque vocals, and a rhythmic, militaristic-sounding cadence. And of course, the listener is also treated to another catchy and memorable chorus, and totally air-guitar-able solo section, to boot. But saving the best for last, aptly-named closing blast, Final Journey, is a full-on, heads-down, no-holds-barred thrash metal attack; an all-out speedster riddled with ferocious, rip-roaring riffage.Blind Rage is dragged down a bit by a dearth of surprises and truly excellent, timeless songs (the only thing that is at all surprising about it is how un-mind-blowing it is.) Even so, it is a very, very solid effort, and thus very strongly recommended if  you are a fan of traditional heavy metal, hard rock, and/or power metal. It is a good Accept album, just not a great one.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Q8BAD0HOXXRV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KRYKEAA#wasThisHelpful","R1Q8BAD0HOXXRV","ASVNSWIXBV72Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ASVNSWIXBV72Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Like fellow hard rock revivalists such as Clutch, Bigelf, Brand New Sin, and (to a lesser extent) Avenged Sevenfold, Kentucky's Black Stone Cherry specialize in a brand of old-fashioned hard rock/alternative metal heavily influenced by the likes of Cream, Black Sabbath, Guns `N Roses, AC-DC, Led Zeppelin, Whitesnake, and the like. And if paying homage to the above-named groups was their intent, then they most certainly achieved said goal admirably well on their fourth full-length.On the whole, thoough, 2014's ""Magic Mountain"" feels a little bit on the limp side, as if the band is holding a little bit back, and not rocking quite as hard as they possibly could. As such, the record could stand to be a touch or two heavier. And furthermore, it is quite blatantly lacking originality. But that's not to say that it is without potential, because B.S.C. are clearly a group very competent musicians and decent-enough songwriters, and one that is very capable of producing an album that is not without a few flashes of brilliance.Among the standout tracks, it is cuts like opener ""Holding On...To Letting Go,"" which gets things started on the right foot, as a b*lls-out hard rocker by brimming with meaty, Sabbath-y riffs reminiscent of Zakk Wylde, that seems to be the most irresistible And plenty of catchy swing/swagger, pounding rhythms, and unorthodoxly shredding, wah-pedal-wanking soloing helps to make sure of this fact. Elsewhere, ""Peace Pipe"" struts a catchy chug-and gallop-that evokes vintage Aerosmith -- and it is one threaded by steady, grumbling bass fills, and some more exceptional, twin-guitar-harmony heavy lead work.The wah-wah-heavy ""Bad Luck & Hard Love"" is among the most infectious and air-guitar-able moments on the whole record, but it is track four, ""Me And Mary Jane,"" that is the set's lead-single. Quite obviously, too, as it plays like vintage Black Stone Cherry, what with its heavy, metallic verses iced off by pop hooks and radio-ruling melodies. Nevertheless, it is a pretty darn great hard-rock-boogie, as it boasts a thundering main guitar riff, pounding, propulsive drumming, wah-wah-inflected leads, and super strong chorus hooks.Moving along, the set's first hit-or-miss tune comes in the form of ""Runaway,"" a much more melodic and open, ballad-esque jam with sing-songy vocal patterns that practically cry ""arena-friendly."" And moving to the next step up on the heavy ladder, the title song is fueled by industrial-strength guitar leads, and really hooky, sing-along-worthy vocal refrains. With that said, though, it is the track's Audioslave-like hand-clap that is what really ensures that this is the biggest and most bonafide party song to be found, here.The downtuned guitar crunch and pulsing bass throbs are offset very well by particularly catchy melodic chorus in ""Never Surrender""; and ""Blow My Mind"" is another good inclusion, playing like an up-tempo and lively hard rocker, what with its pyrotechnically propulsive guitar shredding. But, unfortunately, soon thereafter, ""Magic Mountain"" dips a tad in quality, as the ensuing ""Sometimes"" is an entirely unplugged ballad. And it is not necessarily a bad one, either, but it is one that just comes across as overall a bit unnecessary, and actually kind of detrimental to the album's flow and momentum.Most memories of such mediocrity are soon all-but lost, though, by the time the surprisingly brutal and borderline anthemic ""Fiesta Del Fuego"" rolls around. And ""Dance Girl"" is also very decent, as it is another slab of pop-inflected hard rock where prominent bass fills swoop in and out of bobbing rhythms and crunchy, lurching guitar-grooves. And it all flows perfectly into an epically catchy and melodic, open-aired choruses. Unfortunately, following that, things again take a turn towards the downward slide, as ""Hollywood In Kentucky"" is a total throwaway of a track (it sounds like it could darn well be a Nickelback or latter-day Kid Rock outtake). And also on the weak front, ""Remember Me"" begins as a tasty, crunchy piece of swingin' hard rock (complete with plenty of refined guitar soloing); but soon becomes unglues once its huge, radio-ready choruses hit.Sure, there are numerous groups that do this brand of metallic, Southern-flavored hard rock better than Black Stone Cherry (see: Velvet Revolver, Black Label Society, and Rebel Meets Rebel, among others). So what this means is that ""Magic Mountain"" is definitely decent enough to check out, just so long as you do not expect it to be a watershed-worthy masterpiece. And to help ensure the fact that you won't come away from it sorely disappointed, think more along the lines of it being a release that is solid and certainly enjoyable, just not one that is overly unique or unforgettable, and one that is likely to leave the listener (and the genre, as a whole) largely unmoved.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 3, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3MYFK1QK7E7QH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IMTOK84#wasThisHelpful","R3MYFK1QK7E7QH","ASVNSWIXBV72Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ASVNSWIXBV72Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Much like their fellow Illinois-bred extremists Lair Of The Minotaur, Indian a ferocious, beastly amalgam of most things heavy. They are rooted in Eyehategod/Sleep/The Melvins-inspired sludge metal, but do not stop there, as they filter in a lot of noisecore (a la Unsane, Botch, and Converge) elements, and also have more than a few leanings towards the doom metal genre. And as if that didn't make them extreme enough, they also filter in some progressive metal elements. With that said, though, make sure to note that their songs are only progressive in terms of epic and unorthodox song structures -- because speaking from a sound-wise perspective, they are maybe ten times more brutal, dissonant, and less melodic and tuneful than you are used to hearing from the progressive music world. Next up, there are a few faint Discharge/Black Flag-styled hardcore punk and Cradle Of Filth/Darkthrone-like black metal tinges present in these arrangements. And finally, like some Nineties sludge metallists (i.e. EHG, Acid Bath, Soilent Green, etc.), and new millennium groups (Mastodon, Gojira, Withered, et al.) do, Indian also adopt a harsh, ear-pinning-back approach when it comes to vocals. (They are so atonal and amelodic that they actually have much more in common with the grindcore genre than anything.)But just so we are clear: This is first and foremost a sludge metal band. Their fourth full-length, 2014's full-length, ""From All Purity,"" just differs from most of the works put out by, say, the Crowbars, Downs, and The Swords of the world because it is essentially almost devoid of individually memorable riffs. But note that this reviewer said ""devoid"" and not ""lacking"" or ""missing,"" because Indian's style of repeatedly churning out searing, droning, wall-of-sound guitar noise is not without its charm. So yes, there are very few hooks or air-guitar-able moments to be had, here, meaning that this is the kind of record that you put on and just let consume you. But even if it comes up short in the commercially accessible and traditionally catchy departments; it more than makes up for by having guitar work that could not be fuller of visceral aggression, urgency, resonance, and potency. And besides, it is a bit refreshing to hear some sludge/doom metal songs that aren't simple Black Sabbath re-warmings (there's a lot more going on in the riffs than to call them that), nor are they ones that will have the listener playing ""name that guitar lick"" for the duration of this set's thirty-nine-and-a-half minute-long playing time.It all makes ""F.A.P."" one album that will probably not put Indian anywhere near the front of the ""next big thing"" list, but one that should surely give them a front-running start towards becoming a pretty darn important group in the underground metal world. ""Rape"" plays very much like an Eyehategod b-side, as it boasts a wall of feedback-spewing guitars, mammoth, crunching riff chunk, and pounding rhythms. The vocals, meanwhile, scream away in an unnervingly dissonant and high pitched squeal, thus evoking some weird blackened-noisecore hybrid. From there, the opening blast segues through a terrifically dark and portentous section with droning, crawling, atmospheric guitar noise, before closing with some powerfully-pounding, rhythmically martial-sounding drum fills. And working similarly, ""The Impetus Bleeds"" is backed by another monstrous, thunderous guitar slice sandwiched between darkly droning, sludgy feedback and noise-derived sound effects. And when it is all topped off again by the frontman's larynx-lacerating, throat-scraping, eardrum-piercing shrieks, screams, and snarls, the end result is an extra urgent, violent, and angsty number that just might make you want to get into a fight and smash some faces.""Directional"" is another exercise in churning, blood-curdling sludge/doom metal, as it again finds the band kicking out one big, ominously dense, and uber-dangerous guitar line while the vocalist (Dylan O'Toole) is practically foaming at the mouth as he is howling all over it, and the band's drummer lays down a simple drum beat that consists mainly of crashing, slow-motion cymbal rides. As a result, what is created are some droning stoner metal rhythms that might obviously be quite repetitive, but never come across as being boring or redundant.Next come the record's two biggest curveballs in ""Rhetoric Of No"" and ""Clarity."" The first of which exercises some very surprising tempo variation in that it is an up-tempo jaunt reminiscent of EHG's ""Dopesick""-era that captures an almost punk-like level of chaos and velocity. It also features some pleasantly surprising variation in its guitar work. Needless to say, it is one very crushing and thunderous number with lumbering guitar leads, squealing noise/sound effects, a beefy bottom-end, and momentous, pounding drum beats. And the latter of these two songs is a blaring, squealing, noise-drenched soundscape that evokes a blend of Superjoint Ritual, AxCx, The Melvins, and Fantomas. And needless to say, it is filled with guitar distortion, high-pitched sound effects, and distorted, perverted, electronic-heavy screams.And finally, we get the set closer, ""Disambiguation,"" which is another superbly creepy and portentous piece/noise collage that boasts miles and miles of jarring, nightmarish figures. It has some Pelican-esque riffage, but for the most part is a psychotically, schizophrenically cluttered noise collage comprised of ominously grumbling bass lines, reverberated, part Mike Williams and part Dani Filth-esque scream-shriek vocals, and the like. ""Disambiguation"" is also home to a droning, towering doom metal riff and some on-again/off-again bursts of surprisingly fast, tight, and brutal double bass slamming. So, when arriving right at the point, it is a very, very strong way to conclude an already extremely promising album.As if the mere mention of Eyehategod's name in an Indian review weren't enough of a high compliment, let me put it in plain English for you, here: It is a definite, distinct possibility that this Chicago collective are the Eyehategod of this generation. They certainly have the potential, instrumental chops, and staying power to be. So again, ""From All Purity"" might not exactly be everyone's cup of tea, but that does not mean it isn't a resoundingly successful effort. After all, it is a nightmarishly dark, dense, and disturbingly dissonant affair that makes for a brutally exhausting and challenging listen. But it is also a pretty darn great one, too.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RHK0EP6NKD25Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GV8B06S#wasThisHelpful","RHK0EP6NKD25Q","ASVNSWIXBV72Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ASVNSWIXBV72Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Iron Maiden. Judas Priest. Helloween. Blind Guardian. In Flames. Children Of Bodom. Slayer. Metallica. Megadeth. Dream Theater. Yngwie Malmsteen. These are all obviously heavy sources of influence for Dragonforce. But anybody that knows the first thing about heavy metal music knows that all of these bands are mere launch-pads for DF, because the U.K.-based extreme power/speed metal collective actually has a sound that, while not completely all their own, is very unique and inventive. It boasts miles and miles of spectacular solo skills, blazing leads, and propulsive thrash riffs, in addition to its usual truckload of overtly cheesy lyricism and soaring melodic vocals. But Dragonforce's sound differentiates from that of most modern day power metallists mainly in that it overflows with mind-boggling, face-ripping, head-spinning musicianship, including impossibly technical guitar work, and an airtight interplay between it and the rhythm section.But the sixth full-length studio effort from the much-ballyhooed sextet is much different from anything else that they have ever recorded before, except for maybe 2012's ""The Power Within."" (See, that two-year old album marked a bit of a turning point for Dragonforce, as it was the first to feature a song that was mid-tempo without being ballad-esque.) So while the speeds remain blistering for much of the duration of the fifty-minute playing time, DF do occasionally ease off of the gas pedal, exploring various other tempos and moods, and toggling back and forth between them and the band's usual cut-throat speed metal policy.As a result of this increasingly intelligent songwriting, the individual track identity has also gone way up this time around. Pounding opener ""The Game"" and ""No More"" are both highlighted by a great guest spot from Trivium frontman Matt Heafy. And his presence is almost transparent on the former of these two epics, because despite the cameo, it plays like a fairly prototypical Dragonforce epic, as it is a dizzying, squealing deluge of thrashing grooves, ridiculously tight drumming (including plenty of thunderous blast beats), and soaring clean vocals. And, naturally, the song, the album's wisely-chosen lead single, by the way, is also not without a section where the band rips out a lengthy, unorthodoxly strangulated and screaming guitar solo section. But Heafy is allowed to lend more of his personality to the latter song, because although this might be another rip-roaring speedster, it does feature some distinctly metalcore-esque/influenced/flavored vocal patterns in its choruses. This, however, is to go along with the usual abundance of machine gun drums, ripping guitar leads, and white-hot soloing.Sandwiched in between these two tracks (described above) is another good inclusion, if one that will probably be overlooked all too often because of its surroundings. Indeed, ""Tommorrow's Kings"" is another blast of furious speed where barreling, buzzsaw riffage and unforgettably epic choruses (that sound like they could have been ripped out of some long-lost Bruce Dickinson notepad) run the show. Needless to say, it all makes for one other really epic tune, and one that has plenty of longevity and un-forget-ability.""Three Hammers"" and ""Symphony Of The Night"" are similar in that they both epically stagger a variety of different speeds, and both open with a melodic, fade-in part before eventually kicking up massive amounts of blistering speed, and propulsion. ""Three Hammers"" opts for a harmonic guitar part (complete with epic-sounding melodic leads and even some acoustic strumming); whereas ""Symphony..."" chooses to instead include a cool, haunted house-esque harpsichord. And even though the band does immediately plunge into the depths of propulsive, uber-crunchy, and belligerent thrash/speed metal territory, they do also ease off of the gas pedal, allowing for some mid-song breathing in the form of slow tempo changes and jazzy melodic leads/soloing.And the former of the two tunes even goes a step further down this path of exploring different velocities and volumes by featuring some thoroughly restrained -- especially for Dragonforce -- pacing. And while ""Three Hammers"" does eventually transition through blustery chainsaw riffage and screaming, wild, shredding solos, it always retains a certain melodic edge, thanks mostly due to its harmonized, falsetto clean vocal hooks (which have more in common with an actual ballad than any real metal song.)Moving along, ""The Sun Is Dead,"" is easily the album's most epic piece, and not just because it clocks in at well past the six and a half minute mark. See, even though this is a predominately speedy number dominated by gnawing, chugging guitar riffs, and fast, grumbling bass lines, it also explores a few various other approaches and shifts in mood, most notably when it slows almost all of the way down, filtering in some placid acoustic strings and jazzy, trade-off solos. And as if all of that weren't enough, the icing on ""Sun""'s cake comes from it being further highlighted by epic vocal patterns, pyrotechnic guitar solos, technically-impressive bass soloing, and some excellent keyboard soloing, to boot. (Indeed, everybody in the band but the drummer gets in on the soloing action, here!)And working your way through the rest of the record, a track called ""Defenders"" plays like a never-ending cascade of solid, chugging riffs, chainsaw-stutter leads, and twiddly, neoclassical melodic soloing anchored by more punishing, blast beat-esque drumming. And this then proves to be only a stage setter for ""Extraction Zone"" and ""City Of Gold,"" two other ripping, heads-down thrash scorchers with thunderous, dexterous drumming, huge, galloping guitar hooks, dazzling leads, and epic, harmonic, high-flying solos out the wazoo. And finally, we are also treated to one final inclusion in ""Ring Of Fire,"" a spot-on-yet-simultaneously ten-times-heavier, thrashier, and fierier-than-the-original Johnny Cash cover song. Suffice it to say, it, too, is home to a catchy, galloping cadence, and plenty of blistering solos. On ""Maximum Overload,"" Dragonforce make painfully obvious to the rest of the world that they have, like metal's elite, already mastered the art of letting off of the ignition slightly without ever losing even a single iota of momentum. By doing so, the band might not be looking to turn new heads, but they have nevertheless certainly crafted their finest and most well-rounded, accomplished, expansive, interesting, and dynamically textured effort to date.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3N358J20C5A0Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00M4DAPZQ#wasThisHelpful","R3N358J20C5A0Z","ASVNSWIXBV72Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ASVNSWIXBV72Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This one is a monster, folks. The elventh full-length from Schledamn's Sinister is a slab of pure, grade A, 110% old-fashioned extreme metal intensity, conjuring up memories of early death metal bands such as Morbid Angel, Deicide, Cannibal Corpse, Vader, Vomitory, and latter-day Immolation. And some influence from a few younger acts like Nile, (latter-day) Krisiun, Dying Fetus, and Hate Eternal also come into play at several various points throughout 2014's ""The Post-Apocalyptic Servant."" The end result is a record that possesses the same motto as what a football coach should expect from his team on the eve of the biggest game of their lives: Fired up and ready to play! (What this translates to in a more literal sense is producing grinding, rip-roaring speeds, impeccable musicianship, and exceptional technicality.)The songs continuously balance ear-catching groove with all-out, nerve-damaging extreme metal chaos. The record begins in skull-cracking fashion, with ""The Science Of Prophecy"" being a jackhammer-fast blast fest of pummeling drums, thrashy, racing guitar leads, Frank Mullen-meets-Chris Barnes-meets-David Vincent-esque vocal stylings, and blistering solos. And ""The Macabre God"" follows this up in suitably crushing fashion, as it, too, overflows with thunderous riffage, cracking grindcore blasts, and evil, visceral vocals. (The drummer is of particular note, here, as he is heard riding a tight, stop-start pattern pretty much all-throughout ""Macabre God,"" but another blazing, careening guitar solo also rips the air, in this song, too.) But immediately following up these two exercises in scorched earth devastation, ""T.P.A.S."" then proceeds to explore some more restrained territory, dipping into chugging, Bolt Thrower-sounding grooves on cuts such as ""The Sculpture Of Insanity,"" ""The End Of All That Conquers"" (which features an unorthodoxly ripping guitar solo section), and ""The Dome Of Pleasure.""""The Masquerade Of An Angel"" is another very possible highpoint, as it is a blistering and almost purely thrashy scorcher of a song with some noteworthy bass work (two excellent bass solos are slipped into the mix at various points throughout the number). And this track, the album's centerpiece, is also highlighted by some particularly strong and infectious hooks, a few well-placed and breakneck fast tempo change-ups, and another fiery, shred-happy solo section. Elsewhere, the title track is another thundering drum blast and blistering riff-fest that, again, sounds positively awesome, even as it beats the listener down into submission at 3,000 BPM; and the Slayer-iffic, foundation-shaking ""The Art Of Skin Decoration"" like-mindedly features careening, Slayer/Sepultura-esque guitar leads, and scalding riffage galore. And this is, naturally, to go along with the track's musical bed, which is comprised mainly of frenetic, machine gunning percussion. But the arrangements do make room for a very surprisingly melodic solo section to rip the air, though, too.And rounding out the set are two final gems in ""The Saviour"" and ""The Burden Of Mayhem."" The former is home to some of the record's most individually memorable riffs -- and what thunderous, abrasive, and gear-grinding riffs, they are too! -- as well as another especially excellent performance from drummer Toep Duin. Indeed, Duin might opt to fill this song with plenty of earthquake blasting, but also is sure to include plenty of variation, including some non-double-bass-driven sections, and smart, crashing cymbal patterns. And the latter of these two tracks (""Mayhem"") is also highlighted by some more excellent, meaty riff slices and thunderously chugging rhythms, but is mainly of note for featuring a terrifically portentous and ominous, spoken-word dialogue vocal line. And some more respectably ripping solo flights are also utilized here, and to excellent effect. (The solo section is abnormally lengthier and more epic in this song than in most.)Brutal. Crushing. Uncompromising. All of which are phrases -- check that, compliments -- that could -- check that, SHOULD -- be used to describe ""The Post Apocalyptic Servant."" Seriously, folks, this is one piece of music that might not reinvent the death metal wheel, but one that most certainly greases the axles until they squeak. As a result, it is very highly recommended that all fans of satisfying, meat-and-potatoes death metal buy this platter of satiating, meat-and-potatoes death metal from Sinister. It is, after all, an easy to love effort from a band that has already all-but clinched its status as one of the most criminally under-appreciated and overlooked of the Nineties.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2A8D5QDL2CD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00I8ACQXI#wasThisHelpful","R2A8D5QDL2CD","ASVNSWIXBV72Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ASVNSWIXBV72Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Is the ""album"" really dead? Well, in this day and age of mP3's, YouTube, and who knows how many iGadgets, I can certainly see how you would think so. Yet for all of the single song downloads and inclinations there are nowadays, there are a select few records that still exist with a very ""album""-esque feel to them. What this means is that they have steadfast wall-to-wall sequencing, and track listings where each song is as good and important to the set as the last. For one example of this, proceed to long-player number eleven from Stockholm's Opeth, 2014's ""Pale Communion.""With this record, frontman Mikael Akerfeldt and Company have done the improbable, if not necessarily the impossible: Crafted a masterpiece that is equally as fitting for headphones and arena theaters alike. It is a very, if unsurprisingly well-disciplined effort, as it is one that might lack immediate sonic heaviness, but is also completely devoid of uneven consistency, diluted superfluous fat, and/or filler material. And with this album, Opeth continue to define what it means for a band to be firing on all cylinders, as evidenced by everything from its stellar musicianship to its brilliant songwriting to its infectious melodies, stellar, inspiring vocals, and hummable hooks, right down to its immaculate production job, impassioned delivery, and epic-yet-simultaneously concise delivery.""Pale Communion"" also achieves a perfect equilibrium from mixing epic yet accessible song structures and arrangements with more traditional-minded choruses and crispy, sunny melodies. As a result of crafting this record around such densely-assembled and written anthems, it seems like now would be a very inappropriate time for longtime fans to cry ""sell out"" at the band. If they were going to do that, it probably should have been done after 2003's entirely unplugged effort, ""Damnation."" As it is, however, what Opeth have created, here, is much less like a commercially accessible cash-in and more like the perfect follow-up to 2011's ""Heritage.""The gems are found in abundance over the course of this fifty-six-minute-long set. Opener ""Eternal Rains Will Come"" is surprisingly heavy, but mainly because of how its thundering, lumbering, Atheist/Cynic-esque bass line is skillfully slipped into its mix of dramatic-sounding keyboards, jazzy drum rolls, and orchestral/choral-tinged backing vocals. This, subsequently, leads to the song then swooping down into an ambient, keys `n' all interlude where a bit of placid piano playing adorns gentle string arrangements. And this, then, leads to things adopting an epic melodic groove, one that is replete with gently, melodically humming bass grumbles, jangly acoustic guitar strumming, and jazzy melodical soloing. And it is all topped off by a gorgeously accomplished, heavily layered clean vocal from Mikael. And equally as irresistible is the album's lead single, ""Cusp Of Eternity,"" which is predominately driven by crunchy, chug and churn riffing and looming keyboard accents, and is also home to another simply fantastic vocal performance. But this tune's real highlight comes in the form of its epic, soaring melodic solo work, as it is easily one of the most amazing -- if not THE most amazing -- solo sections that this reviewer has ever had the pleasure of hearing Opeth attach their name to.Back on the heavier side of the line, ""Moon Above, Son Below"" kicks off with a strong, grumbling bass intro before turning to a bass-driven prog metal groove, and even goes so far as to be flirty with some surprisingly aggressive vocal stylings (some near death metal-esque growling is included, here). The number does then open up into colorful, soaring prog rock territory, with stellar, heavenly clean singing and spindly acoustics; but this is again before it leads back into the aforementioned locomotive groove. And ""Moon Above..."" continues wrestling back and forth between beauty and brutality for the remainder of its duration, offsetting said groove with blissful a capella vocals and harmonized melodic guitars. Some more splendid, crystalline-sounding soloing again finds its way into the mix, here, in this epically epic piece, a sprawling, ten-and-a-half minute long exercise in progressive music excess that also features a terrifically somber, stabbing organ, and places it right alongside a rolling groove concocted by a dirge-like keyboard line and deft, jazzy, drum roll-style fills.""Elysian Woes"" opens sounding like a ""Damnation""-era outtake, as it is a gorgeous brooder graced by a lovely, dexterous, acoustic-plucked riff and soulful clean singing. Add some more jazzy melodic soloing to the mix, and the end result is one extremely light, heavenly, somber, and ethereal piece of progressive rock ambiance. And continuing this ""album""-like tradition, the record then opts for a rather short instrumental interlude-esque track in ""Goblin,"" which clocks in at a relatively scant four-and-a-half minutes in length, thus coming across as like a continuation of the already described epic that preceded it. This piece of full-on, Seventies-esque arena metal really adds to the set's powerhouse prog rock vibe, and ultimately comes across sounding not entirely unlike a Jethro Tull cover. It features a palm-muted arpeggio guitar riff, and its heavy use of jazzy bass lines and proggy synth blankets both help to aid it in the undeniably funky-sounding approach taken to its overtones.And picking up right where ""Goblin"" leaves off, Opeth drop in ""River,"" another b-e-a-utiful prog-rock venture that blends together divinely harmonic, unplugged guitar strumming perfectly with more of Mikael's superb, harmonized vocals. But keeping things at least mildly unpredictable, at around four minutes into things, the track adopts a technical, beeping, slapped bass part and some more fantastic neo-classical melodic guitar soloing that is again harmonized perfectly into the arrangements. And some ringing, gently crashing drum cymbals intermittently pepper the mix, here, too. Next up comes ""Voice Of Treason,"" a symphonic/orchestral-tinged piece with plenty of strongly pronounced, grumbling bass, cymbal-heavy drum beats, and lurching guitar hooks to go along with its usual abundance of ethereal keyboards, and soaring vocal melodicism. With that said, though, ""Voice..."" is actually mostly a highlight song for its brief but memorable flirtation with colorful, middle Eastern-inspired twin-guitar harmonies, and Arabian-like flamenco guitar splashes -- a move that rivals the works of Nile and Morbid Angel in the experimental departments.""Pale Communion"" then wraps up any and all remaining loose-ends in fittingly stunning fashion with ""Faith In Others,"" one more positively unforgettable piece. It augments sinfully sweet and infectious vocal cooing (which you will find yourself singing along to, and maybe even humming from memory later on in the day) with orchestral tinges, beautiful acoustic guitars, and even what sounds like the use of some violin accompaniment. It all couples together to form a breathtaking soundscape that might not be particularly long (especially by Opeth standards), but one that is still undeniably epic. After all, what better way is there to describe the amounts of inventive breadth, sonic depth, and trippy texture on tap, here? In fact, come to think of it, one might even make a good case for arguing the point that ""Faith In Others"" is the epic to end all epics -- a fitting sentiment when considering it is the set's closer.In summary, do not let words like ""experimental,"" ""trippy,"" ""sweet,"" and/or ""ethereal"" deter you: This is not only a definite standout in Opeth's discography, it is hands down one of the best pieces of musical psychedelia you are bound to hear all of this year. So do not miss out on what is easily already the best progressive music effort released in all of 2014. And don't be worried about genres and all, just embrace the album for the masterpiece of modern music that it is. Besides, ""P.C."" might lack the visceral satisfaction that previous Opeth epics possessed (i.e. see the brutal death metal-leanings of 1998's ""My Arms, Your Hearse,"" or 2002's ""Deliverance,"" for two examples of those), but as far as the big picture goes, this new stuff is actually quite a bit heavier.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R12P413UL78BUC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KQYNGVA#wasThisHelpful","R12P413UL78BUC","ASVNSWIXBV72Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ASVNSWIXBV72Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Despite being overshadowed by the majority of the population thanks to the uprising of a batch of fellow New York-based hardcore stalwarts (including Sick Of It All and Prong), as well as some modern-day metallic-hardcore rockers (i.e. Sworn Enemy, et al.), and even a few New York-bred crossover hardcore/thrash titans (like Anthrax and Stormtroopers Of Death), NYC's Madball are actually every bit as good as the next band. They certainly have the instrumental skills and convincing delivery to rival anybody else -- that much is for certain on their new album, full-length number eight, 2014's ""Hardcore Lives.""And in this day and age of innumerable hardcore subgenres (i.e. post-hardcore, melodic hardcore, and, most prevalently, metallic hardcore/metalcore), it is so refreshing to hear a band do hardcore the right way, the way it was meant to be played. As such, you can expect lots of visceral aggression, very little technicality involved in the musical arrangements, straightforward song structuring, and only just enough melody to be memorable on this record. It's almost as if Madball are saying to the rest of the world: ""This is hardcore, and anybody that does anything less than this is just imitating."" All told, it seems like a heartfelt ""thank you"" very well-deserved from the heavy music world to frontman Freddy Cricien and Company.The album's ""Intro"" track is exactly that: A very thrashy and even-more catchy instrumental opener with headbanging, fist-pumping chugging that is sure to get many-a-pit revved up. And it flows right into the record's rousing  title cut, a mean, heads-down bruiser with thrash-derived pacing, picking, and raging vocals. ""The Balance"" is the first instance, here, where the rhythm section is really fleshed-out and allowed some time in the limelight, what with its pounding double-kick drumming and grumbling bass lines. But even without these two attributes, said song would still be a keeper on account of it being a blistering mosh pit anthem that also features fiery guitars and memorable, call-and-response vocal patterns.""Hardcore Lives"" then continues in this bass-driven fashion with ""Doc Marten Stomp,"" another bass-heavy bruiser. But this one differentiates itself from the rest of the pack on account of it also being highlighted by some backing vocals that could almost verge on being called ""borderline clean."" And next up after that, we get ""DNA,"" which plays almost like full-on Nineties thrash, what with its scalding, buzzsaw-fast picking and smashing skins. With that said, though, the tune does retain some of Madball's patented hardcore attitude, as it does not forsake the use of chugging, gut-checking hardcore punk breakdowns and chanted, constipated yelling.Track six, ""True School,"" is an even bigger standout still, as it boasts a guest spot from Terror's Scott Vogel. And needless to say, he really helps to make this one unforgettable exercise in blistering and brutal, pain-inflicting hardcore-tinged thrash, and one that is home to some extra-memorable and ferocious vocals. The next two songs after that find Madball again delving  back into their traditional hardcore sound, as ""The Here And Now"" and ""Nothing To Me"" are both heavily reliant on the almighty chug and breakdown. (But two more really memorable and empowering choruses help to make sure that these two cuts are both better-than-your-average page out of the hardcore playbook.)""My Armor"" might be relatively brief, as it clocks in at only ninety-seven seconds in length, but it nevertheless still packs one mighty forceful punch. It is a very, very Pantera-esque scorcher that opens with Cricien hollering ""1,2,3,4"" before diving headfirst into a rip-roaring river of blistering thrash riffage and pummeling drums. And what's more, but ""My Armor"" also utilizes a cameo from not one, not two, but three guest vocalists: Toby Morse, Chad Gilbert, and CM Punk, and does so to excellent effect. (There are some truly unforgettable vocal stylings in the song's choruses.) And some solid bass work (i.e. grumbling bass fills) also highlights the arrangements, here, as well.""Beacon Of Light"" might be another speedy, and ultra-abrasive number with grinding guitar licks and catchy, chanted vocals; but it is overshadowed by the three standouts that come next. ""Born Strong"" (which features Candace Puopolo on vocals) is a scathing assault of machine gun-fast riffing/drumming, clangy bass lines, and bellowed, chant-along vocal refrains; while the next two after that are both pieces of Latin-music-inspired metalcore. Indeed, both ""Spirit"" and the bass-driven ""Mi Palabra"" are fiery, thrashy jaunts home to Spanish-sung (or, more accurately, shouted) lyrics, thus evoking memories of Sepultura's ""Chaos A.D."" days. ""H.L."" serves up two final gems as a grand finale. The first of which, ""NBNC,"" is a scant, twenty-seven-second long blast of hooky, staccato riffing and impressively acrobatic, near blast beat-esque drumming; whereas the second, ""For The Judged"" is one final mosh-pit stoking bludgeon that smells strongly of Biohazard influence. It is one super abrasive bugger, that's for sure, and is backed by solid, locomotive chugging and quick, pounding thrash beats.""Hardcore Lives"" is one darn solid record, and one that can stand toe-to-toe with the likes of Ringworm and Nausea in order to be a leading contender for the much-sought after ""Hardcore album of the year (2014)"" category. After all, Madball might not exactly be spring chickens anymore (in fact, with a quarter of a century under their belts, they are actually pretty old). But none of that matters because they are still on the top of their game. And so long as they continue playing to their strengths (lean, mean hardcore with a strict diet of red meat and potatoes), they will always keep releasing albums that are of this strong magnitude.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RFZS6XAE0LH1X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JPWI4C0#wasThisHelpful","RFZS6XAE0LH1X","ASVNSWIXBV72Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ASVNSWIXBV72Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Has it really been six long years since the release of Bigelf's last album, 2008's fifth long-player ""Cheat The Gallows""? Yes. And has the band endured a significant lineup hiccup in order to now returned with a new supporting cast of characters, including guitarist Luis Maldonato and Dream Theater drummer Mike Portnoy? Maybe so. But the Los Angeles band's vision remains as focused and unified as ever: To kick out some of the best and most psychedelic progressive hard rock this side of Mastodon and Wolfmother.The Eighties hard rock revivalists definitely possess a strong resemblance to Black Sabbath, Dio, UFO, Type O Negative, and Led Zeppelin, but they are every bit as equally influenced by, say, Pink Floyd, King Crimson, Mr. Bungle, and Jethro Tull. Various comparisons to the likes of Rush and Tool can also be made. And, of course, the Beatles are also another major source of inspiration -- and needless to say, it is very fitting when considering how Bigelf have long since described themselves as ""the evil Beatles."" And now all they have to do is live-up to such a prestigiously high description, and darned if they do not come awfully close on this 2014 recording.The heaviest song on ""Into The Maelstrom"" is ""Control Freak,"" because it boasts a big, fat, sludgy, and instinctively memorable main riff, and a little shred-lite soloing. And all the while this is going on, the drummer, Portnoy, thumps away at his trapkit in a manner very similar to Led Zeppelin's John Bonham. It all makes for one very heavy and doomy song, and one that is not likely to be forgotten anytime soon, but not the only standout track there is to be had, here. ""Incredible Time Machine"" evokes Black Sabbath's drug-crazed period, as it augments a chunky, lurching, Sabbath-y riff with oh-so-0zzy Osbourne-esque singing to create one really experimental and ethereal number, and a fitting album opener. But if you think this song is weird, then just proceed to the ensuing second track, ""Hypersleep,"" which, with its trippy, A.I.-esque intro, crashing drum cymbals, and really weird, synthesizer/flute-sounding melody, is an aural head-trip of a song, and one whose huge, pounding, sludge/doom metal riff and wailing vocal line get lost in the tune's out-of-this-world overtones.""Already Gone"" begins sounding like another heavily experimental number, as it opens as a slab of acoustic power balladry. But this is all before the song hits an energy crescendo, steadily gaining heaviness, and climaxes by segueing through a heavy section with a chunky electric guitar riff, and some shredding, Jimi Hendrix-stylized soloing. And next after that comes ""Alien Frequency"" is another heavily proggy piece, this one highlighted by some especially excellent and superbly dexterous drum fills that evoke memories of Zepp's forty-five-year old hit, ""Moby Dick."" And while we're on that note, let me mention the album's closing song, ""ITM,"" because it again finds the drummer channeling his inner John Bonham. It is an eight-minute and twelve-second long bookending composition, and one that is divided into three epic movements: ""Destination Unknown,"" ""Harbinger Of Death,"" and ""Memories."" It is an intermittently heavy piece, although one that is mostly proggy and melodic, with plenty of Beatles-inspired tunefulness and ambiance.Elsewhere, ""The Professor & The Madman"" is highlighted by a heavily progressive intro that has been harmonized into little, tiny pieces before segueing through a section that utilizes a sitar, as well as some irresistible wah-wah-heavy guitar hooks. The next two tracks after that, ""Mr. Harry McQuhae"" and ""Vertigod,"" both strongly conjure up memories of vintage Rush and Queen. The former opens as a piano ballad before escalating to guitar-driven sections iced with Ozzy-inspired vocals and looming keyboard ambiance, thus creating one pretty darn gorgeous and extremely jazzy soundscape, and an epic that clocks in at well past the six-minute mark. And the latter song (""Vertigod""), with its fuzzy guitar riff and high-pitched vocal harmonies, sounds almost like it could be a ""2112""-era b-side.But the record's biggest highlights are actually found later on, as ""High,"" is an epic venture into the nether-worldly realm of prog-rock psychedelia, and one that is backed by a piano intro, trippy, looming synth line, falsetto vocal hooks, jazzy drumming, and a steady guitar chug. ""Theater Of Dreams,"" then, is a very dreamy and ethereal song with theatrical-sounding vocals, thus again heavily evoking memories of ""Yellow Submarine""-era Beatles; but it is preceded by another, significantly heavy cut in ""Edge Of Oblivion,"" a crunchy, doomy rocker with a heavy, grumbling bass line and some more Ozzy-indebted clean singing to go along with its extremely deft, inventive, and dexterous drum fills. And some nicely clean and jazzy-sounding guitar leads adorn the mix, here, too, just for good measure.Yes, ""Into The Maelstrom"" does suffer from a production job that is probably much too unnecessarily murky, distorted, and low-fi. And plus, there is very little material present, here, that grabs the listener with its scream of ""instant classic,"" or is likely to convert absolutely zero new fans to the Bigelf crowd, but it does not need to. Why? Because an album as consistently good and unique as this deserves merit from anybody that knows what they are talking about when it comes to the world of hard rock. Solid and mostly satisfying, ""Maelstrom"" just might be Bigelf's best and most accompished effort to date.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1SNN9MG7FRPRM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HW3F256#wasThisHelpful","R1SNN9MG7FRPRM","ASVNSWIXBV72Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ASVNSWIXBV72Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Chockablock full of excellent riffs, commanding leads, and screaming solos, High On Fires second full-length, Surrounded By Thieves, is easily one of the heaviest non-death metal/grindcore recordings of 2002. And the guitar pyrotechnics are not the only attribute that the Oakland-based stoner metal experts have going for them, as H.O.F. also boast plenty of catchy, Lemmy-meets-Ozzy-inspired vocals, guttural bass rumbles, and dexterous drum beats. It all comes together to make for one of the finest stoner metal offerings of the new millennium. But hey, what else would you expect from a band that rose out of the ashes of primitive doom metal giants Sleep? (Frontman Matt Pike did used to front that genre-defining group back in the Nineties.)Much of the album, including bruising album standouts like the thunderously booming Nemisis, the pyrotechnic title cut, and the percussively-intense Razor Hoof, gets by on a commanding, sludgy riff slice and lumbering rhythm backed by really energetic and forceful drumming. The end result creates some deliciously pounding, head-rattling grooves. But the records two most outstanding cuts are actually found elsewhere, in The Yeti, a sprawling, seven-plus-minute long epic that interweaves some nifty, wah-tinged guitar leads and a blistering, careening shred-solo into its mix of ominous licks and viscerally rumbling bass. And an even greater behemoth is found two tracks later, as Thraft Of Caanan compliments another hugie-pugie, churning sludge/doom metal riff that is as meaty as it is gripping, with clattering cymbal crashes and a sludgy, heavy bass line. This epic piece, which clocks in at well past the eight minute mark, is also home to some of Thieves best and most epic and lengthiest guitar soloing, too.But do the highlights stop there? Oh, abso-friggin-lotuely not! After beginning with a slowly-burning ambient intro (consisting of portentous wind whooshes and footsteps), opener Eyes And Teeth storms onto the scene with a pounding, droning, Sabbath-y sludge riff, crashing drum beat, and ominously grumbling bass line. And this is all before the piece uncorks a strangulated, winding guitar solo, too. Another track to pay close attention to is Speedwolf, because it opens with a nice little guitar melody before slamming, like a brick wall, into a ginormous, devastating, towering doom-laden electric guitar riff and thunderous rhythm. And a brief but nicely dissonant and very screaming solo pops up later on, too. And Hung, Drawn, And Quartered isnt half-bad, either. It kicks off with a pounding, rhythmically martial-sounding drum solo (that lasts roughly half a minute) before settling down into a sludgy groove augmented by mammoth, churning riffage and steady bass lines (four-stringer George Rice is heard grumbling along pretty much for the duration of the song.)The production values of Surrounded By Thieves leave a lot to be desired, as it, for who knows what reason, opts for a dense, and unnecessarily murky, dull, and bass-heavy mix. And also on the downside, there are few songs present, here, that could be classified as instant classics. But even if you cannot help but wonder if the affair would have been better with somebody else turning the knobs, this is still a nasty little sludge/doom/stoner metal album, and a promising sophomoric effort that should satiate everybody that has a yearning for the good stuff.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RE6NBTP24ZRVQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000066HJ6#wasThisHelpful","RE6NBTP24ZRVQ","ASVNSWIXBV72Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ASVNSWIXBV72Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Blending together heavily symphonic black metal with elements of European death metal, metalcore, and a tiny dollop of grind is not exactly a novel concept anymore. Winds Of Plague, Abigail Williams, The Faceless, and even Cryptopsy all experimented with this ""symphonic deathcore"" sound circa 2008. But none of that really matters when you are the originator. Such is the case when it comes to Austria's Hollenthon, who began specializing in melding together all four genres into one cohesive, huge sound, all the way back in 1999. (Hence, calling Hollenthon an imitator would be like saying Black Sabbath were a Johnny-come-lately to the sludge/doom metal scene.)The band continue striving towards a near-perfect, or at least seamless, equilibrium on their third full-length record, 2008's ""Opus Magnum."" And even though the attempt at attaining a perfect equilibrium is not yet entirely complete, no one should be able to argue that at least Hollenthon do this type of genre as well as, if not better than, the vast majority of the competition. And on the whole, ""O.M."" lands at some point between Dimmu Borgir, Cradle Of Filth, Arch Enemy, At The Gates, Hatebreed, Fear Factory, and Lamb Of God.Tracks like ""Bazaar"" and epic opener ""On The Wings Of A Dove"" skillfully balance abrasive, charging death metal and symphonic, Dimmu-esque black metal. They flirt with brief little symphonic flourishes, but are primarily centered around catchy, staccato chugging, punishing, interlocking blast beats, and Shagrath-styled black metal gargling. The end product perfectly contrasts melody, nuance, and atmosphere with blistering, heads-down death metal. Other cuts, like ""Ars Moriendi"" (which is adorned by some very exceptional and memorable guitar soloing), the bass-heavy ""To Fabled Lands,"" and the blistering ""Dying Embers"" (a ripper backed by buzzsaw riffing and thundering drum blasts) play more like full-on death metal, utilizing symphonic touches only minimally, and instead choosing to terrorize the neighborhood in an old-fashioned kind of way.Conversely, however, there is also plenty of black metal-leaning melodic material to be had, here, though, too. ""Son Of Perdition"" and ""Once We Were Kings"" weave in a wailing female backing vocal line into its otherwise completely dissonant mix of snarly black/death metal vocals, thunderous riffing, and galloping drums. And if that weren't enough, the former of these two tracks is also highlighted by some trumpet accompaniment (!), and even goes so far as to drop in an exotic, Middle Eastern-sounding instrumental melody to help keep things a little unpredictable.And last but far from least, one must not forget to also mention the record's two final highlights: ""Of Splendid Worlds"" is a gorgeous, mid-tempo brooder that augments some decent guitar soloing with a docile, piano-driven section; and ""Misterium Babel"" opens with a few soulful, siren-like female vocals and foreboding, spoken-word male vocals before taking a page out of the ""Transylvanian Hunger""-era Darkthrone playbook by delving into a seemingly Arabian-music-inspired instrumental melody. Needless to say, it all makes for one very complex and multi-faceted, eight-and-a-half-minute-long epic, let me tell ya!""Opus Magnum"" is not without a few boring and thus forgettable parts. When taken on the whole, though, it is a very solid and convincing take on the black metal genre, and certainly one that differs from the norm. So when mining the material found on this record, it becomes readily apparent that ""O.M."" is, in a small part, useless rubble, and part diamond in the rough, but mostly pure gold. As such, it is a worthwhile endeavor for all black and death metal enthusiasts.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3KHW93LEJJ13U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00172ABAE#wasThisHelpful","R3KHW93LEJJ13U","ASVNSWIXBV72Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ASVNSWIXBV72Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Seven years after first establishing themselves as Colorado's answer to Origin and Necrophagist, Allegaeon storm back onto the scene with another new album, their third, in 2014's ""Elements Of The Infinite."" And do not let the somewhat generic title fool you, because Allegaeon are not your everyday technical death metal band. They, in fact, have as much in common with the European melodic death metal circuit as anything, as is evidenced by their extensive use of dazzlingly melodic lead and solo work. So, on the whole, in addition to the aforementioned Origin and Necrophagist, ""Elements"" lands somewhere between Dying Fetus, Suffocation, At The Gates, and In Flames.The album's epic opener, ""Threshold Of Perception,"" begins with a hauntingly peaceful and ambient intro before giving way to mazy melodic soloing, and in turn, slamming into punishing tech-death/grind fury with triggered, grinding blasts and blistering riffs. And the composition, which clocks in at well past the six-minute mark, later adopts some more exceptional melodic solo work, but its return to thunderous death metal roots is always waiting just around the corner. And other songs, like the steady tech-death beating that is ""Dyson Sphere,"" slips in some decisively groovy leads, choral-esque backing vocal touches, and an infectious bit of nearly neo-classical soloing into its mix.And speaking of neo-classical, the lengthy, sustained, and involved melodic solo sections in cuts like the Black Dahlia Murder-influenced ""1.618,"" ""Gravimetric Time Dilation,"" the head-spinning ""Our Cosmic Casket,"" and ""Biomec II"" cannot be more accurately described as anything but. Plus, the last of these four tunes is also home to a steady, flowing bass groove, and an actually catchy chorus (!), too.Other standouts include the slightly more mid-tempo chugger that is ""Tyrants Of The Terrestrial Exodus""; the noteworthy bass work (including thundering bass fills and Origin/Cryptopsy/Brain Drill-like bass soloing) in ""The Phylogenesis Stretch""; the epically epic, sprawling, and nearly thirteen-minute-long closer (""Genocide For Praise""); and ""Through Ages Of Ice -- Otzi's Curse,"" a concertedly restrained venture, and a mix of swirling harmonic leads, melodic solos, grumbling bass lines, and steady, chugging riffs. And the fact that the first two and a half minutes of this song are completely instrumental further assists in helping ""Ages"" to stand out some more, as does the fact that it also features a lengthy, Arabian-inflected melody in its outro.Not every song on ""Elements Of The Infinite"" is great, and moreover, there are a few parts to these nine songs that are a little, if not generic, then at least not wholly remarkable or memorable. But even if there are a few spots of monotony present, here (as the constant use of jackhammer-fast rhythms does get a bit old by album's end), there are just as many (if not more) instances of wonderful, air-guitar-worthy tech-death fretboard wizardry and skillfully symphonic black metal-derived keyboard flourishes be had, here, too. And at the end of the day, it is a good trade.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R30FKV85CTF9QS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00K5P3BM4#wasThisHelpful","R30FKV85CTF9QS","ASVNSWIXBV72Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ASVNSWIXBV72Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Seeing how this is the third album in a row that frontman Ben Falgoust has recorded with Goatwhore, it seems like a pretty safe assumption to think that the dude has put Soilent Green on the far back burner for the foreseeable future in favor of this group, even if it is one that initially began as merely a side-project. And the almighty Goat remain as true to their roots as they possibly can get on their sixth full-length, 2014's ""Constricting Rage Of The Merciless,"" in that they deliver another set of explosive, brutally pummeling, and certainly very ripping and rag-tag set of blackened death metal anthems streaked with strong elements of hardcore, grind, speed and thrash metal. ""Constricting...""also picks up right where 2012's ""Blood Of The Master"" left off in that completely and quite simply forsakes Goatwhore's patented doom metal-derived breakdowns (which were found in just about every song on their first four albums) in favor of speed, speed, and, ah yes, more speed.Wasting absolutely no time getting right down into the thick of things, ""Poisonous Existence In Reawakening"" is a ferocious barn-burning opener that anchors blistering chainsaw riffage with pounding thrash beats. This track is also of note from a vocal front, as it utilizes some excellent vocal variation, offsetting Ben's typically high-pitched screaming with some brutally low, Dying Fetus-esque growling. And the ripping ""Unraveling Paradise"" brings back some more of those same vocals, and augments them with more solid lead work and cymbal-heavy blasting. ""Barin g Teeth For Revolt,"" then, is a more groove-centric thrasher with steady, chugging riffs; but it is mostly of note for the way it steadily gains momentum and builds off of itself, generating heaviness and energy and eventually climaxing with blazing guitar leads and a ripping, wah-tinged solo.Two later tracks, ""FBS"" and the closing ""Externalize This Hidden Savagery,"" both flirt with surprisingly melodic soloing, an unexpected surprise especially when considering how the latter of the two songs mostly plays like a piece of full-on grind. (With that said, though, the former of these two is a much more restrained venture that adheres to positively catchy and headbangable lurches and grooves.) But the track that immediately precedes it, ""Cold Earth Consumed In Dying Flesh,"" deals the listener an even bigger curveball in that it has an intro that, laden with clean, echoing-out guitar strums to create a stellar bit of infectious ambiance, is positively startling. This is before, however, ""Cold Earth..."" adopts some ominous, pounding chug and churn riffs and roaring vocals. (Ben's vocals -- or, rather, vo-kills -- are of the grindcore-esque variety, here, in that they at times nearly verge on the goregrind-esque pig squeal-style. And needless to say, they lead the way, here, even when the number picks up speed and launches into scalding, earth-scorched territory.)Found in another place, ""Heaven's Crumbling Walls Of Pity"" has pummeling, stop-start death-grind blasts and subtle, fast tempo changes to go along with its memorable, blowtorch riffing in order to make for one other whopper of a standout song. And rounding out the set is ""Nocturnal Conjuration Of The Accursed,"" which, boasting catchy, crunching riffs, chugging grooves, and a catchy vocal hook (early on), produces one positively hooky, contagious, and headbangable anthem, and one that compensates for the fairly lackluster (and thoroughly unremarkable) piece that comes next, ""Schadenfreude.""True, ""Constricting Rage Of The Merciless"" does not break any new ground whatsoever for Goatwhore. But that little drawback does nothing to prevent it from becoming a tremendously enjoyable listen, and a pure, unbridled success. ""Constricting..."" is a nastily savage and grotesque album, but it sure makes for a satisfying listen; and even though it might be almost perversely harsh and dissonant, it will surely make for one heckuva pleasurable sound to all extreme metallists' eardrums.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RHJUAHAJJXRBT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KE3B8FY#wasThisHelpful","RHJUAHAJJXRBT","ASVNSWIXBV72Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ASVNSWIXBV72Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Think of Origin as like a group of mad scientists. They have frequently been described as such before, and the comparisons really are significant enough to mention. See, this Kansas-bred group of extreme metallists also are extremely smart, experienced, and influential collective that specialize in surgically-precise delivery in order to produce an end product that will only appeal to maybe five or ten percent of the population. But that control group, no matter how small it may be, is absolutely guaranteed to fall deeply in love with it.This end product of which I am referring to is the masterful 2014 album, Omnipresent, Origins, sixth album proper, and doubtlessly one of their finest hours. It takes a cue from Antithesis by being much more epic and realized than any of the works that Origin released subsequently to that watershed-worthy 2008 effort, and one that features actually audible bass work and excellent guitar solos. (For example, check out Unattainable Zero, which is adorned by both a viscerally grumbling bass line and epic, exotically melodic solo section.) And the end result is also one that produces a significantly greater amount of tempo variation, and individual song identity (i.e. standout tracks).Origins musicianship remains top-notch all-throughout this thirty-seven-minute-long playing time -- that much is an absolute no-brainer. And so is the fact that it is riddled with positively blistering riffage and jackhammer-insistent drum beats. But that the band delves into compact-yet-simultaneously-fleshed-out, and not only mature but also downright epic songwriting is what really sets the bar high, and makes them distinguish themselves as a cut above most of the rest of the extreme metal/technical death-grind playing field. And the rhythms, no matter dense as they might be, always fly by quicker than you can say speed metal. I would say they fly by so fast that you dont even know what hit you, but doing so would be a touch misleading, as these songs do certainly leave a lasting impression.Tracks like the opening All Things Dead are wildly frenetic blasts of energy loaded with careening guitars (i.e. chunky riffing, blistering leads, etc.), brain-rattling gravity blasts, and freaky, Cryptopsy/Dying Fetus-styled high/low vocal patterns; whereas cuts like the ensuing Thrall: Fulcrum: Apex evoke classic grindcore, what being one minute-long blast fests that are stuffed to the gills with head-spinning, face-ripping tempos, insane grindcore blasts, machine gun riffs, and the like. Later on, the band take a page out of the Nineties melodeath playbook by tossing in a couple of minute-long instrumental interludes in the form of Permanence and Continuum, both of which are tracks that feature serpentine, crystalline-sounding melodic leads and harmonies. But this is before the album pounds back in full brutality, with the pummeling Manifest Desolate succeeding the former case, and the thunderous Continuum following-up the latter.And the band continue to incessantly pummel the life out of your eardrums with songs like The Absurdity Of What I Am, which kick starts with a long-overdue drum solo from skinsman John Lengstreth (that is guaranteed to get you pumped up, by the way) before catapulting into pulverizing death-grind territory with screaming, shriek-happy vocals, and buzzsaw riffing. And the fact that an actual, honest-to-god catchy chorus comes into play, here, also helps make Absurdity the big highlight that it is. And the albums centerpiece, Source Of Icon O, again works up a frothing amount of energy and carnage-inducing instrumental interplay as it gallivants back and forth between sharp, barbed guitar hooks and stop-start grindcore blasts that evoke the sound of two machine guns firing at once.And later on, Origin continue adding a few new tools to their repertoire, as on the catchy, straightforwardly thrashy Redistribution Of Filth and the largely instrumental epic Obsolescence. The latter of these two tunes opens with a shockingly melodic and subdued, symphonic-sounding intro, thus making it a huge standout. Of course, the fact that this piece of pure, exotic ambiance is augmented by some nicely jazzy melodic solo work also helps aide this fact. As epic as Obsolescence is, though, it is nearly overshadowed by the two tracks that come next.Malthusian Collapse is a concertedly epic piece, one that clocks in at 4:10 in length, and segues through several different places, including restrained chugging but also completely blown-out, grindcore-worthy chaos. And this number also features a lengthy instrumental section that is strictly mid-tempo (not fast or slow, just mid-tempo), and adorned by chunky, serrated riffing. And the second-half of this epic late-album arrival comes in the form of The Indiscriminate, which also finds Origin thinking outside of the box, expanding their sonic scope, and dabbling with all sorts of tempo variation (including mid-tempo sections that set the stage well for breakneck excursions and blasts of catchy, stop-start picking and drumming.)Flawlessly played and impeccably delivered (yet done so in a way as to retain a certain level of live energy), Omnipresent is insanely intricate, inventive, enthralling, and utterly devastating body of work, and one that is an early contender for 2014s extreme metal/deathgrind album of the year honors.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3JVCVX6ZBI616/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KE3B9M6#wasThisHelpful","R3JVCVX6ZBI616","ASVNSWIXBV72Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ASVNSWIXBV72Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Six years ago, Italian brutal/technical death metal collective Hour Of Penance began lighting a little bit of a fire under listeners' *sses with a good debut in 2008's ""The Vile Conception."" And now, midway through the next decade, the band has again returned to pour some diesel on that flame with another very satisfying (and this time realized) effort in 2014's ""Regicide.""True, Hour Of Penance can never claim to be the most original band out there, but they really, really know how to rock. And really friggin' hard, too! Simply tearing their way all throughout these eleven tracks and forty minutes, they blast out brutal, no-holds-barred death metal (clearly influenced by the Floridian DM scene) at grinding speeds, producing intensity levels that remain in the red, no matter how low the listener keeps the volume.""Through The Triumphal Arch"" sets the stage well, if in a misleadingly melodic kind of way, as it is a creepy and ambient little intro piece that flows into ""Reforging The Crowns,"" which is a better representation of the album as a whole. It launches the listener into an uncompromising onslaught of blistering tremolo picking, ""rat-tat-tat"" machine gunning blast beats, and Deicide-al vocals. And this song is also of note for its use of a very decent and surprisingly melodic guitar solo, too. Of the latter half of the record, it is a cut like ""The Seas Of Light,"" a satiating riff-fest, that seems to stand out and be the most memorable. It puts on a virtual symphony of riffage, including chugging riffs, thundering riffs, groovy ones, thrashy ones, and chainsaw-fast ones. And it is all anchored by taught, stop-start deathgrind blasts.But there certainly are other highlights, too. Take, for instance, a ripper like ""Desecrated Souls,"" for one example of such. It is another inexorable death-metal jaunt, and a riff/growl/blast fest that is filled to the brim with jackhammering percussion that serves as an anchor to ferocious yet groovy guitar leads and full-bodied death metal bellowing. A couple of ripping solos crop up, here, as well. And ""Resurgance Of The Empire,"" a biting, buzzsaw-riff and pummeling drum blast-backed sprint with menacing growls, and the occasional thunderous breakdown, is another. Of course, this tune is also of note for dropping in a little vocal variation into the mix, as the occasional shriek is also included, here.The title track completely decapitates the listener, playing like a suffocating aural rush of insane gravity blasts, bone-crunching guitars, and skull-rattling rhythms that simply overwhelms the listener. And for two other recommended tracks, also make sure to check out ""The Sun Worship,"" the early Suffocation-worthy closer, ""Theogony."" The former of these two standdouts motors you over with its relentlessly pummeling, machine-gun-fast-blasting, careening guitar leads, and high/low vocal patterns that are memorable without ever coming across sounding like Black Dahlia Murder worship.But it has got to be the album's centerpiece, ""Sealed Into Ecstasy,"" that takes the cake for being the highpoint of the set. Thanks to its abundant use of groovy riffing, memorable vocal patterns (in a very Glenn Benton-esque move, vocalist Paolo Pieri's shrieks of ""Burn our mind -- unrestricted"" in the choruses are prefaced by growls of ""Burn alive this fake reflection"" in the pre-choruses) and rhythmic, staccato grooves, ""Sealed Into Ecstasy"" is made into an extremely memorable and infectious anthem. Heck, one might even venture to say it is about as catchy a death metal tune as you're ever going to find!Hour Of Penance are still not the best at peddling individually-identifiable songs with memorable, accessible hooks; but not all of that matters, because they are nevertheless still an upper-tier death metal import. And it might prove that H.O.P. are still lacking originality, but they do utilize just enough, if not innovation, then at least musical growth (i.e. the inclusion of guitar solos and occasionally audible bass lines) to make this release mark a definite step forward for the band.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R371CW4AKSSC8Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00J8JQ80U#wasThisHelpful","R371CW4AKSSC8Z","ASVNSWIXBV72Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ASVNSWIXBV72Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Despite being hands down one of the most influential heavy metal acts of the Nineties, and arguably the most important thing ever to happen to the  sludge metal subset, Eyehategod actually only have ever given fans very little effort from the studio. (Prior to the year 2014, EHG had only three proper records under their belt.) And said year's new album, a self-titled affair, is their first album in fourteen whole, friggin', insufferably long years!Or to put that another way, the last time Mike Williams and Company got together in the studio and churned out a long-player, Bill Clinton was president. (And the American people were still trying to recover from the emotional roller-coaster that was the Lewinsky scandal.) Furthermore, the last time Eyehategod wrote a full new album, the world was learning that the whole Y2K debacle was all just a figment of our imaginations. It has been so long since ""Confederacy Of Ruined Lives"" dropped in 2000 that, in the time that has passed since then, Pantera has disbanded, Metallica has reformed, the Colorado Rockies have lost 975 games (give or take a few), and Eyehategod have collected an entirely new rhythm section. (Gary Mader took over the four-string responsibilities in 2002, and Aaron Hill filled in for Joey LaCaze, who passed away while this new album was still in its tracking stage.)But despite being gone from the public eye for so darn long, and despite undergoing a whole host of internal band problems (including drug addiction, side-projects -- i.e. Soilent Green, and Arson Anthem - band member arrests, internal disputes, etc.), and despite undergoing the whole Hurricane Katrina disaster (which ripped through their home town of New Oleans, Louisiana), very little has actually changed in the world of Eyehategod. (They still churn out anguished, agonized sludgecore by the truckload.) And heck, one might even argue that the boys, having survived so many struggles, even made it out stronger than ever (as 2014's self-titled album possesses a strong sense of revitalization and inspiration).The set's most memorable piece is, fittingly, its sole anomaly: ""Agitation! Propaganda!"" is a bludgeoning album opener that verges on having grindcore tinges, and really fleshes-out the band's hardcore punk influences. It is a crushing blast of thrashy tempos, pounding, crashing drum beats, Melvins-esque rhythmic power, and really visceral and angsty screaming. But immediately following this number comes a more traditional Eyehategod anthem in ""Trying To Crack The Hard Dollar,"" which is  a terrifically sludgy and ominous collection of plodding tempos, feedback-spewing guitars, densely sludgy, churning rhythms, and nightmarishly freaky and dissonant, full-bodied vocals.The murky, trudging, riff and bash approach that worked so well in the first two tracks does eventually get a little tiresome the more the record plays. But that is not to say that there is anything really wrong with the songs themselves, as a standout like ""Parish Motel Sickness,"" which pins howling vocals against a bed of sludgy, pounding, Sabbath-gone-haywire riffing and fat, stomach-churning rhythms, could not be more satisfying or reminiscent of vintage EHG. And what is not to like about cuts like the groove-heavy ""Quitter's Offensive"" or the extra crunchy ""Nobody Told Me,"" for example? They are two slabs of Southern sludge at its finest that find the guitars being tuned down extra low (to almost noggin-busting frequencies) in order to produce a truckload of really excellent and eminently memorable doom riffage.Elsewhere, ""Worthless Rescue"" finds the band taking a more strategic route, sandwiching a few really dark and ominous pockets of guitar feedback into its mix of serrated, stop-and-go guitar leads, abrasive, cohesive grooves, and banging skins, thus making this mostly instrumental epic a fitting album centerpiece, and another significant standout track. And it precedes ""Framed To The Wall,"" a surprisingly up-tempo jaunt of really memorable and grumbling guitars, and ""Robitussin And Rejection,"" which opens slowly before allowing a mammoth, moving riff slice to pound, lumber, and smash onto the scene.""The Age Of Boot Camp,"" with its monstrous (and truly unforgettable) riff work and viscerally-rumbling bass lines, is another one of the more memorable anthems on tap, here,, although ""Flags And Cities Abound,"" which begins with a chillingly ominous, feedback-drenched intro and near spoken-word vocal dialogue, and boasts extra dramatic-sounding drum rolls, does give it a fair dose of competition. And rounding out the rest of the set, ""Medicine Noose"" cuts equally-as-deep. It is a lean, mean, steamrolling groover with a monstrous, Pantera-worthy main riff, recklessly, raucously rollicking rhythm, and some more Melvins-esque percussion power.So much was riding on the release of ""Eyehategod,"" but the band escaped the anticipation and anxiety with mostly successful results. Furthermore, often when a veteran metal outfit opts to release a selt-titled affair, it signals a watershed release of sorts -- one that marks the rearrangement of the battlefield, if you will. Or, if nothing else, then it is at least a move that is a telltale sign of a group becoming lazy and simply taking the easy way out mid-way through their career. But neither of these things proves to be true in Eyehategod's case, a band that has returned with an arresting and accomplished return to form, and one that is sure to garner the respect of literally everybody that currently occupies the American heavy music underground.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2XRFRPSBY8QRY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JDB4DV4#wasThisHelpful","R2XRFRPSBY8QRY","ASVNSWIXBV72Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ASVNSWIXBV72Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The ninth long-player from Swedish melodic death metal titans Arch Enemy is their first release with a new vocalist (Alissa White-Gluz replaced Angela Gossow earlier this year) in thirteen years. Even so, 2014's ""War Eternal"" is the sound of a band doing what they do best: Producing a highly infectious and groove-oriented brand of European death metal that is influenced equally by Iron Maiden and Iced Earth as by Slayer and Metallica, and latter-day Carcass and Soilwork as by Death and Morbid Angel.Gluz is certainly a very competent vocalist, as her growls and bellows are both visceral and simultaneously intelligible and believable. But it is, once again, Arch Enemy's instrumental prowess that takes over most of the spotlight over the course of this thirteen track, fifty-minute long playing time. As a result of both of these factors, ""War Eternal"" is not only a definite standout in A.E.'s discography, it is arguably their best album since 2001's ""Wages Of Sin."" Drummer Daniel Erlandsson lays the foundation for the songs with tight and precise double-time pummel, and Sharlee D'Angelo completes the rock-solid rhythm section with solid, grooving bass lines. But it is the axemen (Michael Arnott and Nick Cordie) that really light up the sky, doing so by uncorking one catchy guitar lick and unforgettably pyrotechnic lead/solo after another.The record's curveballs usually come from the band adopting an increased sense of melody, as evidenced by the symphonic opener (""Tempore Nihil Sanat""), and the closing ""Not Long For This World,"" which is a completely instrumental piece that possesses a very dramatic, drawn-out, and epic feeling where a plodding tempo gives way to nicely harmonic leads and a cool, classical music-derived piano solo. But fear not, though, because this piano bit is before the number becomes an up-tempo and groovy death-thrasher with catchy, chugging riffs, and wickedly memorable, skin-crawling vocal patterns (including a fist-pumpable chorus). And elsewhere, as in the middle of the album, the band flirts with some Iron Maiden-like neoclassical melodicism, with ""As The Pages Burn"" beginning as a full-speed ahead thrasher with dueling/trade-off vocals before dialing things down a notch for a more subdued and melodic chorus where a neoclassical-tinged solo section pops up, and once again returning to the headstrong heaviness described above. And ""No More Regrets"" further flirts with such melodies, slipping in Necrophagist-style tunefulness into its solos, which, in turn, are slipped into a bed of chunky riffing and thundering drums. Indeed, the solos are truly very epic, infectious, and phenomenal all throughout this unforgettable song.But do not let all of this talk of experimentation fool you, because there is plenty of heavy -- check that, brutal -- stuff to go around, here. ""Never Forgive, Never Forget"" is but one example of Arch Enemy at their angriest, as it is a ripping maelstrom of belligerent riffing, punishing blast beats, and shriek-happy vocals, and although it does tuck in a neat, and fairly darn wailing solo section, it is still a track that is as close to pure death metal as you're gonna find on this whole record. And ""War Eternal"" works similarly, beginning by barreling out of the gate in thunderous fashion with blowtorch riffage before segueing into more melodic territory with fiery-yet-crystalline-sounding melodical solos. (These solos are sometimes wah-tinged and borderline chaotic, and sometimes more subdued and involved, but are always very memorable and exceptional.)""Graveyard Of Dreams,"" a brief little melodic guitar interlude that sets the stage perfectly for ""Stolen Life,"" a piece of pummeling, chainsaw guitar-backed European thrash metal assailable to the likes of The Haunted and The Crown, is one late-album standout track. And ""Time Is Black"" is another. It opens with the sound of a children's lullaby-esque melody before slamming into forceful death metal punishment with booming breakdowns, a long cascade of huge guitar licks, and mosh-pit-stoking grooves. And in a more meticulous move, ""T.I.B."" is also sure to include some faintly ominous backing symphonic flourishes (that wouldn't be out of place on a Dimmu Borgir joint), and also features some more nicely melodic and even mildly jazzy-sounding solo runs. Other highlights include the throbbing, pulsating bass groove (augmented by more terrific, soulful melodic soloing and really memorable choruses) in ""You Will Know My Name""; the tailor-made-for-headbanging ""On And On""; the crunchy riffs and excellent, blistering, trade-off solo section in ""Avalanche""; and ""Down To Nothing,"" a charging death metal beat-down that utilizes melody only as an afterthought, and is complete with a round of bruising, machine gun-fast drumming.When all is said and done, a couple of these new songs could conceivably rub some longtime fans' feathers the wrong way, as it is often more melodic and groovy than what you might be used to. But do not let that deter you from thinking anything else aside from the fact that this is a very, very solid and extremely enjoyable effort from Arch Enemy, a band that, even with a new vocalist, is definitely entering its third decade of existence by continuing to fire on all cylinders. ""War Eternal,"" which just might be the premiere melodic death metal release of 2014, is very highly recommended to fans and newcomers alike.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R135O9IAQVNACD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JZ4X9V4#wasThisHelpful","R135O9IAQVNACD","ASVNSWIXBV72Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ASVNSWIXBV72Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Just two short years after dropping his eleventh solo studio effort, 2012's ""Metal Clone X,"" six-string ace Marty Friedman returns with another collection of heavy riffs and unpredictable twists in 2014's ""Inferno,"" a record that trumps all of his previous solo works (including 2003's ""Music For Speeding,"" which was previously his best album before this one), and one that even goes so far as to rival all of the excellent works that the man put out while in Megadeth and Cacophony. Since this is a Marty Friedman joint, one can expect it to be loaded to the gills with terrific licks and even greater solos. But you probably did not plan on it being so full of intelligent songwriting and inventive curveballs. As a result, ""Inferno"" is far more meticulous, infectious, and all-around better than anything that any fan probably could have ever expected. The highlights are many. And I mean many. In fact, they are so abundant and close to each other that this reviewer might even go so far as to say that to have a non remarkable track is almost unheard of.Only three of the eleven songs presented here are home to some sort of vocals, with the first of which being ""I Can't Relax,"" which features a cameo from vocalist Danko Jones. And what rapid fire vocals, they are, too! And when they are combined together with Friedman's exceptional guitar fireworks, the end product is one mighty swinging, swaggering, and fun-loving hard rocker, and one that is complete with blistering melodic solo runs. The second of these three songs, ""Sociopaths,"" finds Dave Davidson chipping in, and doing so with vocal styles that vary between dirty and harsh-sounding growls and emphatic clean singing that evokes some Avenged Sevenfold stuff. And it is all underpinned by chugging thrash verses, and some surprisingly forceful double bass drumming. And it all leads in to create a whopping, six-minute-and-thirteen-second long epic, and one that features a really memorable chorus, and three other solos from Marty, each of which rip the air like a serrated knife. And finally, the last track of its kind, ""Lycanthrope,"" features guest vocalists Danko Jones and Children Of Bodom mouthpiece Alexi Laiho. With that said, though, this tune is actually mostly of note from a musical front, as it is a steady, groove-centric thrasher that is home to guitar soloing that can only justifiably be described as simply blistering and virtuosic.Elsewhere, the title tune, with its crunchy licks and surprisingly tight and thrashy drumming, sets the stage perfectly for the rest of the album. But, it is almost needless to say that it is the guitars that again dominate the maelstrom, here, doling out truckloads of pleasant backing guitar harmonies, and pyrotechnic, wailing solos to create one of the densest, trickiest, and most highly technical and fleet-fingered epics this reviewer has heard since Cacophony. And following it up is ""Resin,"" which is misleadingly slow and doomy -- at least at first -- before erupting into a ball of punching, staccato guitar hooks, and chugging grooves. And it all leads up to a really dramatic and sizeable climax, coming in the form of a truly dazzling solo section.But track number three, ""Wicked Panacea,"" is an even bigger highlight still. It is primarily based around funky, fleet-fingered flamenco guitar picking (from Spanish guitar virtuoso couple Rodrigo Y Gabriela), but it also features plenty of belligerent, chugging thrash riffs that help the number to gain momentum and gradually become heavier, before being topped off by an unorthodoxly shredding, whammy-bar-heavy solo from Marty. And next up is ""Steroidhead,"" a humourously-entitled anthem that continues this steady thrash attack with charging, chunky riffs offset by only occasional slow breakdowns (which are aided by wailing solo flights).Working your way through the rest of the record, there is a track called ""Meat Hook,"" that is peppered with cool, memorable piano solo lines dueling with zany, John Zorn-esque jazz-inflected saxophone lines, and doing so to excellent effect. And it is all topped off by Friedman, who gets some more substantial time in the limelight, uncorking one squealing solo and crunchy riff after another with seemingly impossible ease. As a result of all of this, ""Meat Hook"" is made into a crazy, head-spinning, and highly frenetic number, and a definite mid-album curveball. And another is the very appropriately-named ""Hyper Doom,"" which features dramatic, ominous, and yes, even at times mildly doomy-sounding guitar licks to go along with its usual abundance of thrashy tempos and screaming solos. The end result makes for a gem that, like many on here, evokes many a ""Rust In Peace""-era Megadeth classic.""Undertow"" opens with a symphonic sounding intro and piercing solo run before emerging as a gorgeous, strings `n' all-led ballad with wailing melodical solos, docile harmonic leads, harp-like acoustic/flamenco-plucked strings, and gently crashing drum cymbals. As good as ""Undertow"" is, though, it is immediately overshadowed by the epically epic, nearly-seven minute-long whopper that succeeds it. ""Horrors,"" featuring guest fret-shredding by Jason Becker, opens with a mournful violin and heavenly acoustic guitar intro before letting a huge electric guitar riff come smashing onto the scene. It then segues through a seriously proggy and pretty melodic guitar section (that might lead some listeners to believe that Rodrigo Y Gabriela made another appearance) before leading back to the song's hard, heavy, and propulsive main riff slice. And ""Horrors"" is also noteworthy for transitioning through a series of white-hot melodic solos, each one of them seemingly more tuneful and crystalline-sounding than the last.""Inferno"" is so chockablock full of the good stuff that it likely cannot be all consumed in just one sitting (it takes at least one repeat listen to absorb the whole thing.) And it is, again, probably the best work that this fleet-fingered axeman has ever turned out without being attached to some other group of equally-as-talented-musicians. But in any event, then the fact at least remains true that this is, without question, the best piece of thrash metal to come on the market in 2014 thus far. So does all of this make it out to be an essential purchase? Well, it has ""Marty Friedman"" in the title, so what do you think?!","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R28JBE0H6XFRTK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JEBXMJM#wasThisHelpful","R28JBE0H6XFRTK","ASVNSWIXBV72Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ASVNSWIXBV72Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Incantation's 2012 album, ""Vanquish In Vengeance,"" was the New York-bred death metal group's first recording of all new material in six years (as their last new album before that, ""Primordial Domination,"" was released all the way back in 2006.) But even if album number nine, 2014's ""Dirges Of Elysium,"" cannot be said to be a true comeback, it most certainly still marks a triumphant return to form for the band. And so doesn't it make perfect sense, then, for ""Dirges"" to be arguably the band's best effort to date?!Granted, the album does begin with a terrifically dark and foreboding instrumental piece in the title song, but this is before it really lets rip with two earth-scorching attacks of visceral extreme metal. ""Debauchery"" is a skull-crushing onslaught of ferocious blasting, thunderous riffing, and evil, possessed-sounding vocal growls. It is also home to a couple of blistering guitar solos, as well. And ""Bastion Of A Plagued Soul"" is even more brutal still, as it is another earth-scorching deathgrind maelstrom that constantly abuses the listener's eardrums with its murderous, grindcore-worthy blast beats and booming guitar noise. Following these two grindcore-leaning assaults, however, comes ""Carrion Prophecy,"" which is an exercise in a slight bit of tempo variation that opens on a mid-tempo and even borderline doomy note. But fear not, though, because plenty of chugging, muscle-bound guitar licks kick in, taking the song to an elevated (and almost out-of-control) speed where it segues through a catchy gallop to get to an explosively climactic conclusion where buzzsaw riffing and disturbing death metal bellowing run the show.With its epic scope and towering, seven-and-a-half minute long playing time, ""From A Glaciate Womb"" is a wonderful album centerpiece, and far-and-away better than anything heard thus far. It begins by sounding ominously mid-tempo, with a brooding vibe and lingering sense of impending doom. But it, of course, eventually speeds way up, maxing out intensity levels with breakneck picking and drumming. The song then goes back over this slow-fast build-0up a few times, thus concocting a terrific contrast and juxtaposition -- and each time it does this is just as intense and nerve-frying as the last. Next comes ""Portal Consecration,"" which finds a brief harmonic intro being smashed to bits by ensuing riffs and monstrous vocals. But even still, despite this briefly devastating death metal respite, ""P.C."" remains a mostly mid-tempo and ominously brooding piece. But hold on to your buts, because a fast tempo change (that launches the listener into frenetic picking and drumming) kicks in later on, and it is nothing short of breakneck! Top it all off with a climactic, Slayer-esque careening-shred solo, and the end result is a mini, mid-album epic.""Charnal Grounds,"" which opens with another skin-crawling, doom metal-derived breakdown, and closes with a somber-sounding bass solo, is another highlight. And two other more unforgettable moments include the frenetic, hold-nothing-back blast of insane, bludgeoning death metal (played at blinding, grinding speeds) in ""Impalement Of Divinity"" (which is propelled forward by a flurry of warp-speed riffing, blasting skins, and hoarse-throated growls occasionally punctuated by shrill, black metal-esque shrieks); and the barreling speed, corrosive main groove, steady bass work, pummeling thrash beats, and totally-off-the-rails guitar soloing that pepper the mix pretty much all throughout ""Dominant Ethos."" And as if the second of these two songs weren't already awesome enough, it is also further highlighted by a cool, three-second long drum solo near its end.But it all seems like mere poppycock when compared to what comes next: ""Elysium (Eternity Is Nigh),"" the album's obvious high point. Clocking in at sixteen-and-a-half minutes in length, this epic begins by descending from a dramatic mid-tempo march to even slower territory (with doomy peaks and bass-aided valleys) where momentous, reverberating, doom-soaked power chords and ringing drum beats do battle against killer (if still mostly intelligible) death metal vocal stylings. From there, the song does pick up a little speed and energy, but nevertheless remains a subdued and involved piece for the vast majority of its playing time. And following an up-tempo stretch (with chunky, serrated chug and churn riffs), ""Elysium"" again delves right back down into Autopsy/Grave-worthy doomy death metal, with groovy bass fills complimenting sustained, reverberating power chords. The number never fully explodes into Incantation's usual wall of blistering death-grind madness, but that is part of what makes it such a big standout -- well, that, and the fact that it is one terrifically expansive and sprawling closer whose latter half is largely instrumental. (Indeed, the band opt to let their instruments do most of the talking, here, thus helping to further the track's undeniably epic feel.)It serves as the mere icing on the cake that is ""Dirges Of Elysium,"" an already decadently sweet offering. Or, to word it more literally, this is a masterful extreme metal album, likely one of Incantation's finest hours, and an irrefutable shoo-in for 2014's end of the year top-five list.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R321ZA777XADEK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JQRHNCG#wasThisHelpful","R321ZA777XADEK","ASVNSWIXBV72Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ASVNSWIXBV72Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The Voyage is a great little device, bright, lightweight, and capable of storing a huge library of books. I downgrade it to three stars for three reasons. First, Amazon requires that you pay $20 to keep from being bombarded by ads -- calling them special offers only seems that much more dishonest. Second, even if you pony up the $20, they still ship the devices with the lower 1/2 of the screen filled with advertisements for other books. You have to go into the menu system to turn this off -- again, blatant advertising that frustrates many users. And third, I take a star off for the high price of the unit and the accessories.

"Ping Two (Across the Valley) is the sequel to Ping (From the Apocalypse), and I encourage readers to enjoy both of these delightful books.What is perhaps most interesting about Ping Two is that it manages to bridge a post-apocalyptic survival adventure with a touching human story. The main survivors, Lucy, Travis, Christopher, Sarah, Kate, Jack, Rose, and Kevin are all very real, with individual flaws, ambitions, and strengths. The story blends together their interpersonal relationships, some loving and some sad, in a setting that is truly unique and interesting.Travis (the young boy) was my favorite character because he seemed like the glue that held this ""family"" together. The author's incorporation of telepathic powers  was a unique complexity that served to better interconnect the characters and events. The writing itself was skillful and the editing professional.

"You Got the Job! is a very useful collection of advice relating to building an effective resume to actually land the job - not just tell what you've done and when. The author points out that a resume is your ""personal brand,"" your chance to make a first impression. I know first hand that sometimes a good resume can essentially line you up as a front runner even before the interview. At that point, it's up to you to mess up (or not).The book addresses several common employer concerns, such as you've been out of work a while, appearing too old for the job, making a transition to a new job, having a focus on management (or avoiding responsibility), and being over (or under) qualified. It points out that a resume should start out with a statement not only of what you are looking for, but also what the employer wants to see. It goes on to tell how to ""make your case"" - yes, sell yourself in a professional manner. It highlights the importance of being specific about your accomplishments (e.g., Increased sales revenue by 30% in 2013).Overall, the book is well organized and filled with great advice.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 10, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3DS9KLU2S7GEM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FOCNEV6#wasThisHelpful","R3DS9KLU2S7GEM","A34IC48GLL4U3Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A34IC48GLL4U3Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I'm a big fan of Jane Smiley and will read anything she writes. (Don't miss the two novellas Ordinary Love and Good Will--stunning!) Some Luck doesn't disappoint--it's the kind of insightful, sweeping family saga for which she's become renowned (think A Thousand Acres)., and it's the first book in a trilogy she has planned. But while her characters, as usual,0-[ are fully drawn and. in the case of Frank, absolutely fascinating, the book itself is very episodic. The end result is that it holds the reader's attention but ultimately feels as if there's a little missing from the plate--we get snippets from their lives but are left wanting a bit more meat.Some Luck traces the members of the Langdons, a farming family in rural Iowa, from 1920 to 1953, starting with the young couple Walter and Rosanna and their firstborn, Frank, when he's a baby. They go on to have several more children and experience their share of joys and tragedies, triumphs and disappointments. Each of the children has a distinct personality, and nearly all the characters could carry an entire novel as the main protagonists on their own, but the fact that their stories are so intertwined tends to give them short shrift. I'd have loved more about Eloise, Rosanna's sister, who moves to Chicago and becomes a Communist (maybe that's in store for the second novel in the trilogy),and Joe, the second son (what makes him tick)? And it seemed as if Frank decided to marry Andy very suddenly--a bit out of character for someone who had never really connected with anyone before and who prided himself on being something of a ladies' man. How did Arthur come to work in federal intelligence services?Each chapter covers significant events a single year, and the points of view change as the different characters take center stage during the chapter. it may be that the format is hampering the story a bit as well, though it's also an effective way of covering ground without filling in every detail.Some Luck absolutely held my interest, and I fully intend to read the other two books in the trilogy once they're released, but Smiley's previous books set the bar very, very high, and I've deducted a star the reasons I've delineated. But it's well worth reading and enjoyable on many levels.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3D5N55R4VNF02/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0307700313#wasThisHelpful","R3D5N55R4VNF02","A3G25AHB4CHEZ6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3G25AHB4CHEZ6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I loved Mona Simpson's first novel, Anywhere but Here, but never got into The Lost Father and hadn't read any of her other books until picking up Casebook. The cover copy in no way conveys what an utterly delightful protagonist and narrator Miles Adler-Rich is or how the nuanced the storyline is. Simpson has created several memorable characters, especially Miles and his mother's love interest, Eli Lee. His mother, Irene, a mathematician on the UCLA faculty, and his best friend, Hector, are also worth mentioning, as is his mother's friend, Marge, and Ben Orion, the private eye the boys consult. I really enjoyed the book, pretty much from start to finish. The only minor quibble I had, and it may be me more than the author, is that I couldn't always keep all of the parents of Miles's friends straight, especially since a few couples split up.Casebook spans several years in the life of Miles, a self-proclaimed underachiever, and his friends and family. It's a coming-of-age story, but with a twist. Miles is an inveterate snooper, and he and his friend Hector, who practically lives with him, devote considerable energy to rigging up various ways to spy on his parents, whose marriage is falling apart. Along the way, among other entertaining touches, he and his friends also develop a hobby of disassembling his twin sisters' stuffed animals and sewing them back together with mismatched parts, a la Frankenstein. Miles and Hector also have a string of business ventures that tend to get them into trouble. And, inevitably, life happens to all the characters, lending a certain poignancy as an undercurrent to much of the story.But most of the story is devoted to Miles's and Hector's efforts to suss out the truth about his mother's lover, Eli. Miles comes to love Eli over the six years he dates his mother (it's a long-distance romance, so Eli comes and goes), but some things don't add up, and he and Hector set out to determine what's really going on. They get more than they bargained for when their suspicions prove legitimate.One of the things I especially enjoyed about the book was how Simpson never inserted herself into the prose. It's hard to explain, but Miles's voice was so strong and distinctive and so believable that I was totally caught up in his narrative and never became aware of, e.g., a nifty turn of phrase (though some of his analogies were indeed very funny).Is the book flawless? Of course not. The ending seemed a bit rushed, for one thing, and a few of the relationships that developed a bit pat. But overall, it was a wonderful read, and I highly recommend it to fans of accessible and amusing literary fiction that also happens to ring true.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3MI8M5K2IT2XT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385351410#wasThisHelpful","R3MI8M5K2IT2XT","A3G25AHB4CHEZ6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3G25AHB4CHEZ6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've been in a quandary over how to review this book. I ordered it because I really liked Christian Jungersen's earlier book, The Exception. And You Disappear reflects the same facility with language and focus on psychological themes (in this case, neurological). But I didn't love this book, even though it kept me reading. Mostly I felt sorry for every single character. I could relate to Mia's dilemma in dealing with her brain-injured husband, whose brain tumor caused a personality change that completely transformed their lives (and not for the better). But it was a painful read, in which each character was a victim of some kind.Interspersed among a number of chapters are excerpts from research literature about brain injury and neuroscience, and while I understand why Jungersen included them, they became fairly tedious, especially the longer ones. Another gripe I have is that the ending leaves readers hanging, with no resolution.Three and a half stars--a little better than okay, but not one of my favorites. I imagine You Disappear will appeal to people who are fascinated by neuroscience and questions of identity and responsibility and don't particularly care about plot and characterization.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RIMDN0F946J6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385537255#wasThisHelpful","RIMDN0F946J6","A3G25AHB4CHEZ6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3G25AHB4CHEZ6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The true story of a wolf who was an anomaly in Juneau, Alaska, for the six years or so he hung out near the Mendenhall Glacier, A Wolf Called Romeo manages to be both highly informative and incredibly moving. Romeo, as the lone black wolf was dubbed, readily befriended the many dogs who came to the area, seeking them out and playing with them, to where they served as kind of a surrogate pack. Year after year he returned when Mendenhall Lake froze over, incredibly tolerant of the humans who accompanied the dogs and in one or two cases, even behaving in a friendly way toward them. No one had ever seen a wild wolf act like this before, and no one knew why he was neither aggressive nor fearful.Anytime a wild animal becomes too acclimated to human contact, however, it sets off alarms, especially when the animal is a large predator, and Romeo had his advocates and detractors. Author Nick Jans, one of the first to encounter Romeo, was squarely in the advocate camp, but he was all too aware of how little it would take for things to go wrong, especially with the attention the wolf was attracting, and if it did, Romeo could pay with his life. At the same time they reveled in the unique experience of Romeo's company, Jans, his wife, and the wolf's other friends worried about the precariousness of the situation, as people with no common sense flocked to the lake to see and interact with him. Romeo's detractors included longtime Alaskans who were handy with guns and traps and had no use for wolves. Caught in the middle were state wildlife officials, who were damned if they did nothing about him and something went wrong and damned if they acted before something did.It's hard not to fall in love with Romeo while reading this book. He was a remarkable animal who united a community and gained renown around the world. At first, I thought A Wolf Called Romeo was basically an exceptionally well-written nature book, deserving of four stars, but as the narrative progressed, it became more and more gripping, to where, by the end, I was totally caught up in the story of this unique spirit and the people who loved him and moved to tears. Unequivocally, this wonderful tribute merits five stars. Highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R11F9HQTZ4E5AG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0547858191#wasThisHelpful","R11F9HQTZ4E5AG","A3G25AHB4CHEZ6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3G25AHB4CHEZ6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Everything I Never Told You is so insightful, confident and self-assured that it's hard to believe it's author Celeste Ng's first novel. This is literary fiction at its finest.I have to admit, though, that for most of the book, I figured I'd award if four stars, not five. It was excellent but not as gripping as some others that have bowled me over from day one, and the subject was uncomfortable. But as the story progressed and especially as it reached its denouement, I found I couldn't put it down and by the time I finished it, the fifth star was a foregone conclusion.Everything I Never Told You is a beautifully wrought, if sometimes disturbing exploration of a dysfunctional biracial family. Set mainly in the late 1970s, when Lydia, the elder daughter of Marilyn and James Lee, is found dead at the bottom of the local lake, it traces the stories of her, her parents and siblings. In the period it depicts (something Ng has done very well), ethnic ""diversity"" as we know it today was an unfamiliar term, and especially in their small Midwest college town, a family where the wife was blonde and blue-eyed and the husband Chinese-American, was an anomaly and not a particularly welcome one. In this book no one really feels comfortable in his/her skin or environment.At its core the book is about the tug-of-war between parents who want different things--to stand out from the crowd vs. fitting in--and the excruciating toll that dichotomy takes when parents who have given up their own dreams attempt to project them onto their children. To Marilyn, Lydia embodies everything she wanted for herself before she got pregnant and had to drop out of Radcliffe. She is relentless in pushing her daughter to become the doctor she herself never will be, never stopping to consider that Lydia may not share her dream. James, by contrast, the son of immigrants, earned a Ph.D. from Harvard in American history but only managed to land a faculty position at a small, second-rate college in Ohio, not the Ivy League appointment of his dreams. He wants nothing more than for his daughter to be popular and fit in with her peers, pushing her to take part in social activities that she abhors and where she is ignored. Even as Lydia is the focus of her parents' competing aspirations, her older brother, Nathan, finds himself largely dismissed by them, and the youngest, Hannah, is practically invisible. As the story progresses, their complete failure to understand and connect with their children takes a heavier and heavier toll.This is not an especially uplifting book, though by the end there's enough reconciliation that it doesn't leave you bummed out. But if you appreciate exceptional writing and powerful themes, you'll want to spend some time with Everything I Never Told You. It really is a remarkable book, and I'll watch eagerly for whatever else Celeste Ng produces in the future.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1A95JEF5XJNEP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=159420571X#wasThisHelpful","R1A95JEF5XJNEP","A3G25AHB4CHEZ6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3G25AHB4CHEZ6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Make no mistake--I really enjoyed reading Lucky Us. Amy Bloom is a fabulous writer with a gift for creating memorable characters, placing them in unusual situations and putting completely believable words in their mouths. Her pacing is right on target. My only quibble is that I didn't find the resolution of the plot entirely satisfying (and I can't say more without giving things away). But suffice it to say that I would have much preferred a different outcome for Eva, the young woman at the center of the story.Eva lives with her single mother, on the edge of poverty in the 1940s, and her father, Edgar, who's married to someone else, visits them weekly. When her mother learns that his wife has died, she packs up Eva and drives to his home, then leaves her on the porch and drives away. Eva's father, Edgar, has another daughter, Iris, and the two half-sisters eventually bond. There are many twists and turns to the plot--how the two girls set off on their own and create a surrogate family, how Edgar isn't who he seems, how Eva is swept along in Iris's wake, how family doesn't necessarily mean the traditional nuclear family, and much more. World War II is a key event, of course, but it doesn't really dominate; this is Eva's story.There is much to like about this book; it was enjoyable and absorbing, and I'm glad I took the time to read it. It was only the end that seemed a bit false to me, and I've deducted a star, accordingly.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R11XBZ45JFVV2Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1400067243#wasThisHelpful","R11XBZ45JFVV2Q","A3G25AHB4CHEZ6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3G25AHB4CHEZ6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Painted Horses is hands down one of the best books I've read in the past year. I ordered it because the subject (archaeology, the West, a female protagonist) intrigued me, but I had absolutely no idea what a treat was in store.Exquisitely written, Painted Horses is at once bold and nuanced, a tale of passions and greed, naivete and cynicism, trust and betrayal, grief and redemption, and the tug-of-war between progress and tradition. And a whole lot more. It's a hell of a story, as expansive as the Montana landscape it describes so well, and as another reviewer has noted, it's mind-boggling that this is author Malcolm Brooks's debut novel. Painted Horses is so assured, so perfectly paced and peopled with characters so fully drawn that it reads like the work of a seasoned writer. To say I'm impressed is a gross understatement.It's the 1950s, and Catherine Lemay, who hails from a well-to-do family in New Jersey, has forsaken the musical career her mother had dreamed of for her in favor of her first love, archaeology. After taking part in a dig in London, she lands in Montana, hired by the Smithsonian to determine whether a valley slated to be flooded for a dam holds any sites of archaeological value. Catherine knows little about Native American culture or how to begin looking for the sites she seeks. A local man, Jack Allen, has been assigned the job of serving as her guide, but he has little interest in truly helping her because he's more determined to round up a herd of wild horses and selling them for meat. She enlists the aid of a young Native American woman to accompany them. At the same time, a man named John H is living in the back country, as determined to save the horses as Allen is to lead them to slaughter. John, who is something of a horse whisperer and who ran away from home at a tender age, is a complex character, devoted to the memory of a Basque man who served as a surrogate father to him and to living a quiet life away from civilization. Allen is mean to the core, John H his opposite.Needless to say, nothing goes as anyone has planned. Brooks seems to have boundless knowledge about postwar London, archaeology, horses, Montana and Native American culture. The research alone is impressive, let alone how he wove it all together.If I could give this book six stars, I would. Failing that, I'm recommending it to all and sundry. Painted Horses is an eminently satisfying book that will appeal to men and women alike.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2YOYAFGZSCA33/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0802121640#wasThisHelpful","R2YOYAFGZSCA33","A3G25AHB4CHEZ6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3G25AHB4CHEZ6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm a big fan of Henri, le chat noir, and I've seen all the Internet Cat Video Festival entries that have been posted online. So I get the appeal and thought this book was a cute idea. And the execution is pretty clever for the first three sections.Unfortunately, there isn't enough material for the 128 pages this book runs, so it peters out pretty quickly after that. The sections on how to make a video and the business end aren't particularly funny--mostly they come across as trying too hard, as if an editor had wanted more, and the author was grasping at straws to expand the material.Ultimately, I think this would have worked best as a blog. If you have a friend who's super into cat videos, then this could make a good gift, but overall it's pretty thin on the entertainment after the initial 77 pages.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3BUVT3EBVD6PJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1594746796#wasThisHelpful","R3BUVT3EBVD6PJ","A3G25AHB4CHEZ6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3G25AHB4CHEZ6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When I need air to circulate in a room, I usually rely either on ceiling fans or floor fans with rotating grilles. (I don't have any conventional oscillating fans). I was hoping this diminutive fan would serve a similar function to the those with rotating grilles,as mine are all getting along in years.It is, however, quite small, and for that reason alone, its uses are more limited.Like all Vornado fans, it's well built and solid. I don't really have a problem with the noise on the highest setting, as others do--I've heard worse. But unless I'm directly in line with the stream of air, I don't get the circulation that it's supposed to have. In my master bedroom, which is large, it wouldn't even reach across the room. In my office, which is much smaller, it was better, but still not as effective as my ceiling fan.Its small size makes it easy to perch on a shelf, and you can position it either vertically or horizontally and pivot it to direct the air where you want it, which is great if you have an appropriate place to put it where and when you need it and, like me, like a steady stream of air blowing on you when it's hot. But I can't see how it circulates all the air in a room, as advertised. Perhaps once the heat hits, and I can test it for a more extended time, I'll change my mind. But for now, it's simply a nice adjunct to my current fans and one I may or may not use much.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2B1K127553LVH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00I3A47VM#wasThisHelpful","R2B1K127553LVH","A3G25AHB4CHEZ6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3G25AHB4CHEZ6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Jim Stegner, Peter Heller's protagonist in The Painter, is a man possessed--by the memory of his murdered daughter, by the need to paint to soothe his soul, by his passion for fishing (also to soothe his soul). And at the same time, he doesn't really understand what drives him when he's overcome by rage and commits acts of violence. He's a complex character, and that complexity, plus Heller's exquisite prose and astute observations about life, are what make The Painter a satisfying and memorable book.That said, it's also very much a man's book, IMO. That isn't so say that I didn't appreciate Heller's artistry or his philosophical insights. I did. But it seemed to me that the themes are very much ones dogging the heels of men in American society, and as a woman, I didn't relate to them as readily. Give this book to the art-loving, outdoor-loving and literature-loving males in your life. I imagine it will be a big hit.The cover copy and other reviews have covered the plot and characters well--how Stegner, who did time for nearly killing a man who was eyeing his young daughter, attacks a man abusing a horse and later kills him. How the man's family come after him and how he plays a game of cat and mouse with them and law enforcement, all while leading up to a painting commission he doesn't really want. Stegner is a loose cannon, but he's also likable and usually on the side of what's right, even if he doesn't necessarily go about it the right (or legal) way.All the characters in The Painter are interesting and multidimensional, even when they only put in a short appearance. Stegner's longtime friend Irmina, who's somewhat psychic and utterly steadfast; his model and new lover, Sofia, who's an independent woman who doesn't conform to any stereotypes; the family commissioning a portrait of their twin daughters; even the cops, Stegner's neighbor and the guy who runs the local gas station--all come across as real people you might want to get to know better, and it makes for a completely believable novel.Heller is clearly an immensely gifted writer, and I will be interested to read his future books. Four and a half stars for a book well worth the time to read it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ZPV1KPIWF1PA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385352093#wasThisHelpful","R1ZPV1KPIWF1PA","A3G25AHB4CHEZ6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3G25AHB4CHEZ6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've read most of Jo Nesbo's Harry Hole books, so I already knew what an accomplished writer he is (even if I take issue with some of the more gruesome and graphic elements of the Hole series). But I wasn't sure what to expect of this standalone novel. Would it be more graphic than I could stomach? How could I relate to a junkie in jail?As it happens, any trepidation disappeared within the first few chapters, when it became clear that it was going to be a book about corruption in the police force and the long reach of organized crime. It's also about innocence and culpability, as well as justice, however you might define it. It's a tautly written and intricately plotted novel, with plenty of cliffhangers. Shortly after starting the book, I was already crazy about Sonny Loftus, who's quite an original character. While I doubt Nesbo will resurrect him for future books, I'd sure love to make his acquaintance again. Nesbo even addressed one of my gripes by the end of the book--how the yellow house, unoccupied for 12 years, still had utilities connected.The premise of the book has been covered in the synopsis and other reviews--the young man, son of a late police officer, who has been framed for murders he didn't commit and kept addicted to heroin until he learns something he never expected about his father, which changes his life. The characters are all interconnected, and the story well paced and gripping. These aren't the two-dimensional characters you find in other books but the creations of a master storyteller who has created a highly satisfying story.Five unequivocal stars.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R16M2VQ6FTB2L0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385351372#wasThisHelpful","R16M2VQ6FTB2L0","A3G25AHB4CHEZ6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3G25AHB4CHEZ6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I read and enjoyed Julia Glass's Three Junes when it came out, though I didn't really remember much about the characters. One of them, however, figures prominently in And the Dark Sacred Night, albeit posthumously: Malachy Burns, who died of AIDS. When he was just a teenager, he befriended a young woman, equally young, at a music camp they both attended, and she never picked up on the fact that he was gay. She fell head over heels in love with him and, it being the 1960s, decided to lose her virginity to him. He reluctantly went along, and she got pregnant. That girl, Daphne, now in her 60s, and their son, Kit, middle-aged, are at the heart of the story, which is really about secrets, family ties and identity.Daphne never told Kit who his biological father was, and because Kit has been foundering, his wife basically throws him out of the house to go see his stepfather and attempt to get the information he needs about his provenance. Embarking on a journey of self-discovery, Kit eventually meets his paternal grandmother and grandfather, aunt and uncle, and begins to forge a relationship with them, to the dismay of his mother.The story skips back and forth between different characters' points of view, between past and present, and the writing is masterful, as one would expect of an author of Glass's caliber. There were times, though, when it seemed to drag a bit, and certain elements seemed to be tied up too neatly in the final section. Hence my deduction of a star.But those are minor quibbles, and And the Dark Sacred Night is bound to please Glass fans and anyone who enjoys literary fiction.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RRAOIBB49EL2O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0307377938#wasThisHelpful","RRAOIBB49EL2O","A3G25AHB4CHEZ6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3G25AHB4CHEZ6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"...with emphasis on the intellectual part. The Blazing World is a complex, sometimes dense novel structured as a series of journal entries, interviews, memories, etc. concerning the life of the artist Harriet (Harry) Burden. Harry's journals are being published posthumously, and the editor has reached out to various people in her life--her children, lover, friends, hangers-on--to gain more insight into this enigmatic woman.Harry, the widow of a renowned art dealer/philanderer, has despaired of gaining any recognition for her own art, which she attributes to the fact that she's female. So she contrives a scheme wherein she makes art for three exhibitions, then persuades male artists to pose as the creators of her works. It comes off well enough the first two times, but the third is another matter, and the show is such a success that her front cruelly betrays her and claims her work as his. And no one but her friends and family believe her insistence that she was the artist.Siri Hustvedt is a gifted writer and her Ph.D. shows in the highly academic approach to her subject. Harry is something of a polymath, with a keen memory and extensive knowledge of philosophy, art, history and culture. It's that very knowledge, however, that sometimes bogs down the novel, even when the footnotes are couched in the context of the fictional editor making notations for the publication of Harry's journals.At least one other reviewer has noted that it's very hard to connect with any of the characters, and with the exception of Phineas, I have to agree. This is an accomplished work, but that doesn't mean it's easy to digest or, necessarily always an enjoyable read. There were large swaths of Harry's notebooks that I skipped over because they were just too academic and tedious.Three and a half stars.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3ME8U9L61A6YE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1476747237#wasThisHelpful","R3ME8U9L61A6YE","A3G25AHB4CHEZ6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3G25AHB4CHEZ6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It's hard to believe that author Violet Kupersmith only graduated from college in 2011 and that The Frangipani Hotel is her first book. This collection of short stories is so mature, confident and accomplished that a writer three times her age would be proud to claim it as his/her own. That she wrote many while still in college makes them even more remarkable.Each of the stories has an element of the supernatural, real or imagined, and all are reportedly based on traditional Vietnamese stories. Kupersmith is a fluent--and fluid--storyteller who knows how to capture your attention and then take you in directions you don't expect. Ordinary people leading humdrum lives cross paths with malevolent spirits, grateful shapeshifters, vengeful ghosts, yet often those encounters are subtle, fleeting and/or perplexing. Set both in Vietnam and America, her tales are haunted as much by the two countries' shared past as they are by the other-worldly creatures who inhabit them.Reading The Frangipani Hotel is like taking a vacation from the everyday, and I highly recommend it. Five enthusiastic stars and votes of confidence in this young, extraordinarily talented writer.

It's a bit strange having to switch the handles when I want to change resistance, but I've gotten used to it.

"Although I've been aware of Anna Quindlen and read her journalism from time to time, I had never read any of her fiction before picking up Still Life with Bread Crumbs. Since finishing the book, I've been asking myself why I waited so long. This is a lovely, adult story about a June-November romance, but it's also a whole lot more. In a way it's a coming-of-age story about the transition from middle age to encroaching old age. It's also about pursuit of artistic vision and about reinventing oneself when circumstances change. Quindlen has mapped out Rebecca Winter's story beautifully, and I could relate to almost every page. It's been a while since I've enjoyed a book this much.Rebecca Winter, a renowned 60-year-old fine art photographer,  is on a downslide professionally and financially as her work has lost its cachet and its market. Her mother is lost in dementia, and Rebecca is helping to pay for the nursing home she's in. That's just one of many major expenses she has, though, and her bank account has dwindled to almost nothing. To save money, she reluctantly sublets her beloved NYC apartment and repairs to the countryside, where she rents a rundown cabin near a small town. When a raccoon invades her attic shortly after her arrival, she turns to Jim Bates, a local roofer, who also has a host of other talents, including a knowledge of the local wildlife. A respectful friendship of sorts blossoms between them. As she struggles with the transition from big city life to country life, Rebecca also becomes a regular at a local coffee shop, known for its proprietor, Sarah Ashby, whose baked goods are legendary.There are many threads in the story--Rebecca's history and relationship with her parents, her failed marriage, her relationship with her son, her dealings with her not-so-supportive agent, Sarah's relationship with her ne'er-do-well husband, the back story of Jim's late wife and his sister. When Rebecca stumbles on some simple tableaux in the woods and begins to photograph them, her life takes a different turn.If you enjoy well-crafted literary fiction, I highly recommend Still Life with Bread Crumbs.

"I've read most of Jo Nesbo's Harry Hole books, and for most of Cockroaches, I was pretty sure I was going to give it five stars. Although only the second book in the series, it is well-written, with interesting characters, and unlike some of the later books (like The Leopard--yikes!), it lacked the really gruesome elements that had prompted me to briefly swear off future volumes in the series.But I'm afraid Cockroaches kind of fell apart at the end, so I've deducted a star.Harry in this book is the alcoholic but very talented Norwegian cop we've come to know, but here he's sent to Thailand to clear up the murder of the Norwegian ambassador. Thailand being Thailand, he has various encounters with the sex trade, drugs, corruption, etc. He's also working closely with a bald, half Thai woman named Liz, who's heading the investigation for the local police. The book has many twists and turns, and it completely held my interest, but the last few chapters, which encompassed the denouement, were confusing and hard to follow. It was kind of a let-down after the brisk pace of everything preceding it.While some reviewers have reported missing the frigid Norwegian settings of the later books, I didn't see that as a problem. Nesbo is just as good at describing the heat, humidity and breakneck development of Bangkok, and Harry is still Harry.Worth a read if you like Scandinavian noir in general and Harry Hole in particular. Just know it may not come together at the end quite as well as you'd like.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2AMRU8N08LOS2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0345807154#wasThisHelpful","R2AMRU8N08LOS2","A3G25AHB4CHEZ6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3G25AHB4CHEZ6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Line of Duty had me on the edge of my seat for all five or so hours of the series. (I'm hoping the fact that this is labeled ""Series 1"" means there's more to come.) It's British crime drama at its best--intelligent and complex, with well-rounded characters.The series centers around Detective Chief Inspector Tony Gates, who's got an outstanding record clearing up crimes, but the anticorruption unit of the police think it's too good to be true and are investigating his methods. Gates is a cop's cop, whose team is almost rabidly loyal to him. Heading up the investigation is Superintendent Hastings and a new member of his team, Steve Arnott, who's left his previous assignment under a cloud and who feels intense pressure to prove himself.A series of brutal murders take place, and as Gates investigates them, and anticorruption investigates him, it soon becomes clear that no one is entirely clean, and there are intricate connections among the various characters. What's real and what's merely suspicion--as well as who is behind the murders and why--keeps you guessing until the final episode.Highly recommended if you're a fan of the genre!","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R33T6CG8M3Z7T2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00D7AM2YW#wasThisHelpful","R33T6CG8M3Z7T2","A3G25AHB4CHEZ6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3G25AHB4CHEZ6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"It's no wonder why this Altec Lansing set of powered speakers for computers and MP3 players is offered at lower price.  The mid-range and high-range sounds are acceptable, but the lower range of the sub-woofer is boomy, not acceptable to persons who are used to listening to good speakers' sound.  This set of speaker might be okay for the below forty USD price, and free shipping.  Furthermore, this could be acceptable to younger persons who just use this for video games, but not for listening to good music.  The design of the two speakers (L & R), also has something to be desired due to obtrusive sharp corners, but it might be okay for non-discriminating persons. The power switch is located at the inaccessible back of the enclosure.  I do not want to return it to the seller that's why I modified the location of the switch by connecting a top-mounted black rocker switch on top of the box in ""series connection"" to the original switch at the back.  Moreover, I plug the bass reflex port (the hole in front) with a tightly rolled kitchen rubberized pad used for cleaning dishes to reduce too much booms of the sub-woofer.  Whoever designed this at the Altec Lansing should be sent back to a good design school in U.S. or European countries.  He or she is a bad engineer/designer who will ruin the good reputation of Altec Lansing Company. I hope this company will not go ""belly-up"" in the future for producing and selling below average merchandises.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1181VV7AEDRFA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0025VKUQQ#wasThisHelpful","R1181VV7AEDRFA","A2I7955ZFHEGUB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2I7955ZFHEGUB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Most of my older headphones are made by Sony and Sennheiser.

The trowel handle fits very well on my hand (I'm 73 years old), not like the feel on our old and wornout trowel with wooden handle.  The little hole will only fits on a nail, not on a large hook, but I'm not sure about the durability of the handle when left under the UV effects of the sun; only time can tell.  I inspected closely the weld that other user wrote about, but I can't tell at this time if the body of the trowel was really welded to the neck of the handle because it was so well-made, very smooth and shiny.  I have about four Fiskars brands of garden tools in my garage, and Fiskars tools gave me longer years of use compared to other brands.  However, I hope this maufacturer will shift their tools production back to the US to help our low-income families to send their kids to school.  This tool is made in other country, but most Americans are ready to buy products Made in USA even if items are about 15% or even 20% higher in price.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 1, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R19IU8WON4K8IT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00005YX2U#wasThisHelpful","R19IU8WON4K8IT","A2I7955ZFHEGUB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2I7955ZFHEGUB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The delivery of two sealing ring was fast and the packaging was excellent.  I was reluctant to order two rings due to some negative reviews saying that the sealing ring they ordered was not the correct size for their pressure cooker.  I ordered two rings, anyway, because I want my wife to have spare just in case the first one break.  I have been buying household items online from Amazon.com for a number of years, but I have not returned any item due to defect or not the correct size.  I therefore ordered two sealing rings, thinking that I can easily exchange them in case the ring will not fit.

"Sennheiser RS120 926 MHz Wireless RF Headphones with Charging Cradle The unit was deffective and would not play the music when I received it.  The problem that I fixed, and very simple to do, was the battery terminals were not tight enough to make a solid contact to the positive end of the batteries.  I'm a retired electrical engineer, and nothing to do the whole day that's why I tried to fix it rather than return it to Amazon.  I'm very satisfied with this headphones' stereo sound, and the low hissing sound is not present as soon as the music started.  It's a little heavy and bulky, and it will constantly slide downward whenever I bend down to pick up something on the floor.  I solved this problem that other users complained about.  I tied an old and clean shoelace at the back of the headhpones plastic bands, making sure that the slack is long enough to looop around the back of my head.  I hope Sennheiser will redesign this superb sounding headphones, and improve their quality control in China before they put their well known German brand name on this model of headphones.  One improvement could be a wider and thinner soft leather headband in place of the bulky and heavier plastic band with rubber foams.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 19, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R4IPQ4R479QW2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0001FTVEK#wasThisHelpful","R4IPQ4R479QW2","A2I7955ZFHEGUB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2I7955ZFHEGUB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was reluctant to buy this battery ""DMW-BCG10 Decoded Replacement"" mainly due to the title on the Amazon.com Ad that says for Panasonic LUMIX DMC-ZR1/DMC-ZS1/DMC-ZS3/TZ6/TZ7.  I found that my cameras was list at the last in their ""Descrition"".  My new camera is LUMIX DMC-ZS5, but at this price compared to the recommended and expensive Panasonic brand battery, I took chances and bought this battery to try it.  I fully charged it, and then measured the output voltage using my old voltage tester to compare it to the output of my original Panasonic furnished battery.  I found the outputs are the same, so I installed and used it for about a week.  It worked fine, and was happy with it so I ordered a second one just in case these batteries will not last long.  It's been about a month now using my new LUMIX-ZS5 around every other day, and these batteries are still working fine.  Currently I keep the original Panasonic battery fully charged in my camera bag as a reserve for my last back-up.  By-the-way, I'm a retired aerospace electrical engineer.  Probably the reader of this review is wondering why I cannot afford expensive Nikon cameras, as well as batteries like the expensive Panasonic batteries :)","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 15, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/RMVTROXEN3WIE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003EENZVK#wasThisHelpful","RMVTROXEN3WIE","A2I7955ZFHEGUB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2I7955ZFHEGUB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

There are cables in the market that are priced too high to get the money out of those people who are willing to pay the price.

"I bought this CD because we have the vinyl copy of this 4-Phase Stereo recording of Ronnie Aldrich.  From the original copy my family had enjoyed numerous hours listening to this amazing arrangement of Mr. Aldrich when stereo components are on their popularity during the early 70's.  The left and right piano can be distinctively heard from the left speaker, and then from the right speaker while playing the vinyl recording.  In this CD recording, one piano has a tremendous volume when it came in, and then the second piano can be heard in a very low volume as if the sound was coming from a very far end of the stage.  I tried to compensate the output by tweaking my balance knob, but it won't give me the desirable result.  There are also some low frequency rambles present at the first few selections, which I can care less.  To some listeners this might be annoying sound at the background similar to yesteryears vinyls.  However, the dynamics of the recordings are surprisingly excellent, and the seller sent me this item without any delay on shipping.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 23, 2010","http://www.amazon.com/review/R30VBBYLNH7Q97/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000ANDB9O#wasThisHelpful","R30VBBYLNH7Q97","A2I7955ZFHEGUB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2I7955ZFHEGUB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I did some research on the web before I finally bought these Flash Memory Cards.  I am a retired electrical engineer, and I do not just buy things on impulse.  I was looking for large-capacity cards for my video camera because during my last vacation I ran out of mini-digital cassettes.  My Canon mini-DV video camera runs on mini digital tape and my other still camera can take still pitures and video as well using a single large-capacity SD Card.  I have been using SD (Secured Digital)cards for a long time, and I like it due to added sliding button at the side of it to prevent accidental erasure of my store files.  If I want to erase some photo shots or even stored MS Word document, I can easily slide it back to open it for additional photos or files. I thought if I have these two 2GB Flash Memory cards with me as back-ups, I will have no problem again if I found that I have no more blank cassettes in my camera bag.  I bought these Flash Memory cards in late May, 2010 and tested the first one by loading all my still pictures that I took during my vacation.  I found no problem at all during loading and playback. The loading speed is acceptable for me.  The other one is still empty, and honestly I have not tested nor loaded anything to it until now.  I have 95% confidence on this brand, and will not hesitate in recommending it to my close friends.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 4, 2010","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2SUXLA0Y87RNU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000P5AJXI#wasThisHelpful","R2SUXLA0Y87RNU","A2I7955ZFHEGUB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2I7955ZFHEGUB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I checked the price of one-gallon size live plants in garden departments of home centers here in Houston, TX but it exceeds my budget of around $40 for my required 5 plants for my borders at the front of our house.  I found these seeds at the Amazon.com, and I believe the price at Hirt's Garden for 15 seeds is more than a bargain.  I'm not in a hurry, being retired engineer I have more time to wait, and can wait for maybe 3 years.  The packaging, although the price of S&H is higher than the seeds, was superb; in bubble-lined envelope.  The instructions for sprouting the seeds to germinate is very detailed.  Buyers of these seeds should allow at least 2-months to buy in advance prior to actual planting outdoor, this is due to the required two months of cold stratification inside your refrigerator.  I like the instructions of this store.  They do not like you to fail, maybe due to their no refunds nor replacements policy.Result after following the 2-month cold stratification inside the refrigerator:  It was a waste of time and money.  No seeds germinated after another 2 months in the flower pots.  I will buy these plants from the local nursery this coming spring of 2011.  This time I'm sure they are already growing, although the price will be higher.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 18, 2010","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2HF07YDBZZSNG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002Q7M8CI#wasThisHelpful","R2HF07YDBZZSNG","A2I7955ZFHEGUB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2I7955ZFHEGUB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The book description sounds good, but the actual book was less good. This was mostly because of the characters. Ben Croftner is basically the archetypical bad guy: evil but with no real motive. Sure, we understand he wants to marry Sarah, but why? What is it about her that he followed her halfway across the country?Jessica DuBois is no better. Yes, we get that shes jealous of Sarah, but Rand has promised to marry Jessica, and hes a man of honour. Hes not going to go back on his word, even if he does still love Sarah. Of course, by choosing to align herself with Ben Croftner, Jessica shows herself to be a poor judge of character, so perhaps she really doesnt understand she has nothing to fear from Sarahs presence. Anyway, we get that Jessica has this deep-seated hatred and jealousy towards Sarah, but her actions still dont make any sense. After all, all Jessica had to do was marry Rand and the Sarah problem would go away.As for Sarah, she's mostly decorative, a personality-less person who exists to serve as the inexplicable object of Rand's love, Ben's obsession, and Jessica's jealousy. She never does much except react to the events around her.This is the third novella in the A Journey of the Heart series, following A Hearts Disguise and A Hearts Obsession. Its better than the previous two, in that at least the plot arc comes to a satisfactory conclusion. However, it does raise the question of what (or who) the final three novellas are going to be about. Hopefully it will include characters who are a little more rounded.Thanks to Litfuse Publicity and NetGalley for providing a free ebook for review.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RH6ICE47E8P6W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0718031660#wasThisHelpful","RH6ICE47E8P6W","A3VKMXTPAUNUUB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3VKMXTPAUNUUB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A Love Like Ours is the third in the Porter Family series, and is Jakes story. Jake had a cameo in the previous novel in the series, and struck me as a fascinating character even then, a tortured soul suffering from PTSD following his Marine service in Afghanistan who now trains Thoroughbred horses on the family ranch.His childhood friend Lyndie James has recently moved back to Whispering Springs, and wants a job on the ranch as an exercise trainer. She finds Jake wounded, but theres still the connection between them there was two decades ago, the last time they met. But will Jake let her in?I thought Lyndie was an excellent character, a fascinating mix of horse-mad jockey, imaginative author-artist, and a woman of deep Christian faith. She had a quirky way of looking at the worldand Jake, who she described as Mr Tall, Dark and Brooding, a description which characterised him well.Jake was a harder character to get to know, but that was part of his character: his PTSD and survivor guilt holds him back from opening up from others, which means hes a more remote character than most fictional heroes in romance. But the tortured hero has an appeal, not least to the womanLyndiewho wants to fix him. There is also the appeal of a couple reunited after years apart yet still connected in some undefinable way, a reminder that true love is unconditional and never-ending.There were a two things about A Love Like Ours which bugged me. One was the way characters kept stating and interrupting each other (she stated, he interrupted) etc. It felt odd. The other was the secondary will-they-wont-they romance with Lyndies neighbour, Amber (who series fans might remember from the earlier books in the series, Undeniably Yours and Meant to Be Mine). It wasnt that I didnt like seeing Amber again, more than it detracted from Lyndies developing relationship with Jake, which is what I wanted to see.Despite these minor glitches, I thoroughly enjoyed A Love Like Ours. Lyndie and Jake are special and unique characters, and while I almost thought they werent going to make it, I need not have worried. It was a definite awww ending, with plenty of wonderful kisses in as well.Thanks to Litfuse and NetGalley for providing a free ebook for review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2XMVFX7P9Y3JX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0764211099#wasThisHelpful","R2XMVFX7P9Y3JX","A3VKMXTPAUNUUB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3VKMXTPAUNUUB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was asked to review Feast for Thieves months ago, and for some reason never got around to reading it. I was reminded of it again when I saw it was a finalist for the 2015 Christy Awards in the First Novel category, so thought Id better open it up and see what I was missing.I was hooked on the first page.Feast for Thieves begins with Crazy Ake and Rowdy Slater robbing the bank in the small town of Cut Eye, Texas, in the spring of 1946. Its written in the first person, from Rowdys point of view, and right from that first line two things are evident. Marcus Brotherton can write. And Rowdy Slater isnt your typical Christian fiction hero. After a near escape from death by drowning, Rowdy sees a vision Now, Ive read other books with fantastic opening hooks which simply fizzled out after that one fast-paced and original scene. But Feast for Thieves just kept going. Rowdy decides to return the money, which causes the Sheriff of Cut Eye a few problems. Sure, its good that he solves the crime, but the expense of a trial is sure going to put a dent in the county budget, and his chances of re-election. And hes got another problem: the town needs a preacher. So the Sheriff delivers Rowdy an ultimatum: spend a year as Cut Eyes minister, or go to jail.Rowdy knows nothing about God, preaching or running a church, but he knows enough about jail not to want to go back there. Besides, hes got other problems, and hes going to need a paying job to fix them. Its an excellent plot, with lots of twists, yet all making perfect sense, and tied together with a cast of true characters.Rowdy is an especially fascinating character. Hes a likable rogue, with a little too much rogue to make a good minister. But he has his own unique way of dealing with problemsserving in the Army during some of the toughest battles means he probably knows more about human nature than many preachers.But what really made Feast for Thieves stand out from the opening line was the voice. Rowdy isnt an educated man, and his language is earthy (but stops short of being vulgar). What makes him unique is his vocabulary and way of speakingI could hear every word in that Texan accent, yet there wasnt a single misspelled word to indicate accent. There was an Authors Note at the end in which Brotherton explained how he developed Rowdys voice, and it took a lot of research and a deep knowledge of the time and place. It took a lot of effort to make Rowdys voice seem this easy and this authentic.But its not all manly stuff. There is a solid and real Christian message in here, and even whispers) a little romance. I can absolutely see why Feast for Thieves was nominated for a Christy Award.

"This book contains the contact information and reviewing preferences of hundreds of book bloggers. Yes, that's a good thing, but there are thousands out there, so this is really just scratching the surface and will be more appropriate and useful for some authors than others. I was specifically looking for information on bloggers who review Christian fiction, and there were only couple of dozen (and just as many who said they never review religious books).A lot of reviewers say ""all genres"", but that's not especially helpful - do they really review conservative Christian fiction along side their hard-core erotica? I doubt it. However, for those who are looking for reviewers who are happy to review self-published erotica ... there are a lot in here. It also seemed to cover more fiction that non-fiction genres.The book is effectively responses to a standard questionnaire completed by each blogger or website, which is a good thing: it means they are all willing to be approached for reviews (unlike some Top Reviewer lists I've come across). There is also an excellent list of tips for approaching bloggers, and sample letters (trust me, these work. As a reviewer, I'm much more likely to accept your review request when it looks like the ""good"" letter.)I got this book as a free Kindle download. Would I have paid for it? Probably not, given what I was looking for. But you can see the list of reviewers in the free sample, so download that and see if they look like the kind of reviewers that would be interested in your book.

"This is a twenty-page picture book aimed at explaining the problem of the dangling participle to children. The typesetting is quirky and attractive, and the illustrations are beautiful, and illustrate the point well.Its an interesting concept, and one that has real potential as an educational tool for children. It starts by explaining what a dangling participle is, then moves on to providing solutions through a series of examples. Unfortunately, the examples fix one common writing problem by introducing at least two more problems. Heres one example of a dangling participle from the book:Melting in the hot sun, Ida rushed to finish her ice cream.This is accompanied by an excellent illustration of a small girl melting into the pavement as she eats an ice creamwhich is what the example sentence implies. The book then suggests an alternative sentence structure that removes the dangling participle:Melting in the hot sun, the ice cream had to be finished quickly by Ida.Im not an expert on grammar, but even I recognise this as weak writing. It's passive voice, in that the subject of the sentence (the ice cream) is being acted upon, rather than being the one performing the action (Ida). It mixes a present participle (melting) with a past participle (finished), therefore implying the ice cream continued to melt even after she finished it. It also adds an adverb, another sign of weak writing. The sentence would be better written as:Ida rushed to finish her ice cream before it melted in the hot sun.Unfortunately, almost every example in the book follows the same passive voice pattern. Some are worse, as they do not make the subject or object of the sentence clear. The examples of dangling participles are correct, but while the modified sentences are better, they are still not good writing. Five stars to the illustrator, but not recommended as an instructional tool.Thanks to Vanita Books and NetGalley for providing a free ebook for review.(Note: my review is of a pre-publication copy, so some of the text may have changed.

"Soaring Through Stars is the final book in a trilogy, following Swimming Through Clouds and Seeing Through Stones, and you really do need to read all three books in order. In fact, even giving an accurate book description will effectively give a spoiler for the first two books  but Ill try.The trilogy is the story of Talia and Jesse Vanderbilt, daughter and son of famous Chicago lawyer Gerard Vanderbilt  the man who killed their mother through control, abuse and neglect, and now controls his children through fear and pain. But Talia has a secretLagan, a boy at school who has befriended her. Her first friend. Thats the first book.Even from the first book I could see there was a sinister side to Gerard, and while there are further hints in Swimming Through Clouds, it is here that we finally find out more about Gerard and what a piece of work he really is. But the really scary thing is how the years of abuse affect his childrenits like theyve been programmed, and they have to fight to break free of that programming and pursue what they believe in. This control illustrates why so many abused women dont or wont leave their partners, and that is frightening. Its especially frightening to think that some women escape but are sent back to their abusers by well-meaning but deceived officials.This isnt a fun book, a light romance to download for your summer holiday (if thats what youre after, try Beth Vogt, Denise Hunter or Becky Wade). Rajdeep Paulus is more like Ginny Yttrup or Nancy Rue and Rebecca St James, in that shes not shying away from the difficult topics, yet without being explicit or gratuitous. Its well-written, sobering, and with subtle Christian undertones.

"hen wedding caterer Meadow Larsons kitchen roof collapses, her high school nemesis comes to the rescue, offering his barn as a temporary kitchen. While Colin McGrath never led the bullies in the popular crowd who made her high school years a misery, he never called them on their behaviour either. Now he says hes changed. Can she believe him?Yes, I can see that a person can change after high school. I can see that they might regret some of their teenage decisions and behaviour (who doesnt?). But I never got an impression of how Colin had changed, which meant I didnt get that he had changed. I only saw the almost-perfect Christian contractor he now is.I also didnt really get Meadow. If she hated high school and everyone in town bullied her, why did she stay? Heres the other thing I didnt get. She appears to be operating a commercial catering business out of her house, and when her kitchen is destroyed, she uses the home kitchen of her building contractor. Really?

"I didn't enjoy the first novella in this collection because the publishers description gave away all the key plot points. They didnt make quite the same mistake with this second book, but the description still covers the first two-thirds of the story (although this time I made sure I didnt actually read the book description, just in case).Im still not sold on the series. Rand is almost the perfect man, except for one error of judgement about the true character of the pretty Miss Jessica DuBois. Sarah was too wishy-washy for my tastes in the first book (A Hearts Disguise), but seems to have grown a spine on the trip to Wyoming. She also has a respect for the local Indian population that seems a little uncharacteristic for a sheltered woman of her time.The minor characters were, if anything, worse. We didnt get the opportunity to get to know either Ben Croftner or Jessica DuBois in any detail, which meant they came across as clichs. The plot moved along too quickly, in that the characters (Rand, in particular) had dramatic changes in their feelings without any logic or explanation. The other problem was the end: it was very abrupt, as though it was just cut off. Perhaps it wasafter all, there are another four novellas in the series after this one.Thanks to Litfuse Publicity and NetGalley for providing a free ebook for review.","2.0 out of 5 stars","April 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2BAKXNMKWY6HV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0718031652#wasThisHelpful","R2BAKXNMKWY6HV","A3VKMXTPAUNUUB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3VKMXTPAUNUUB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Twisted Innocence is the final book in a trilogy, and the three books do need to be read in order, and (I believe) in quick succession, because Twisted Innocence builds on and concludes the overall series story arc. While I have read the previous two books, it was several months ago, and I had forgotten most of the details. As a result, I found the first quarter of Twisted Innocence slow, as though it was trying to tell new readers what had gone before without falling into an excess of backstory that those who did remember the earlier novels would find tedious and unnecessary.Twisted Innocence focuses on Holly Cramer, the once-irresponsible younger sister of Cathy, Juliet and Jay. Shes now a more responsible woman: a single mother to five-week-old Lily who is working two jobs to try and earn enough money to cover her bills. She is mugged one night, and then finds out that one-night-stand Creed Kershaw knows he is Lilys father, and is wanted in relation to a drug-related murder. And it seems Leonard Miller, the man who murdered Cathys fiance, is back in town There were good parts and bad parts to the story. The pace picked up once I got past the first quarter, which made it easier to read. The whole subplot about Michael in prison seemed unnecessary, as though he was only there so someone could observe one specific incident (the scenes where Cathy was petitioning to have Michael released were particularly tedious).Overall, while Twisted Innocence was a good finish to the series, it would be better if Id read all three books in quick succession, as it didnt work well as a standalone thriller. Thankfully, now you can, and for the same price as buying one of the books: Zondervan has released a three-in-one volume, and I'd recommend that rather than the single title.Thanks to Zondervan and NetGalley for providing a free ebook for review.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RTZRY5VUDPNO5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00L0S6FAU#wasThisHelpful","RTZRY5VUDPNO5","A3VKMXTPAUNUUB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3VKMXTPAUNUUB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Ophthalmologist Dr Ryan Tremaine has a problem. Not only has he promised his ex-wife that hell look after their two sons for the summer while shes on a short-term missions trip, but hes also recently taken custody of Penny, his five-year-old daughter from the affair that ended his marriage. And Penny is a problem: she has FASD, Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder, and her behaviour has already run off three nannies.Carly Jo Mason is working at the Animal Factory while completing a PhD specialising in the prevention of FASD. A chance meeting with Penny and Ryan leads to a job offer: as Pennys new nanny. Carly is initially reluctant to get involved because of her own personal history of working with FASD children, but is persuaded to take the job  and ends up more involved than even she had anticipated.I thoroughly enjoyed Until I Found You, Victoria Bylins first contemporary novel for Bethany House, and I enjoyed Together With You even more. The plot, driven largely by Pennys issues as a special needs child, was a unique combination of entertaining and educational. I also liked the way the Christian elements of the plot were dealt with, particularly the conflict between Carly and Ryan, and the sympathetic and non-judgemental way FASD was dealt with.The characters were excellent, and it was good to see the stuffy and barely competent Dr Tremaine loosen up a bit as the plot progressed. The minor characters were also excellent, even Pennys Aunt Denise, who wants to have custody of Penny for herself. Its clever writing when the viewpoint character dislikes another character, yet the writing manages to get across a degree of sympathy for that unlikable character.One word of warning: if the cover puts you off because its a little too clich romance, think again. While Together With You definitely has a strong romance plot, its just as much a story about the consequences of bad choices, the difficulties in raising a child with special needs, and truly understanding Gods forgiveness.

"You are no doubt thinking that I live in New Zealand, so why am I reading a novella set in London as a book set in my hometown. There are two reasons. First, I dont really have a hometown in the way Americans refer to one, but I lived in London for longer than I have lived anywhere else, so I think it counts. Second, there simply arent a lot of books set in my part of the world. I can count on one hand the number of Christian novels Ive come across set in New Zealand or by Christian authors (something Kiwi author Kara Isaac discussed in a recent blog post).Anyway, on to my review. Beth Forrest works in the wedding department of staid London department store Pettett and Mayfields, where she spends her days serving posh clients and struggling to overcome her working-class background, something which has given her a serious inferiority complex. Beth is about to close up one day work ay when a piece of her past walks in: James Wetherton-Hart, the posh boy she once loveduntil his mother found out James was seeing a servant, and had Beth sent packing from the estate.The Wedding List was an enjoyable short novel that was a pleasant walk down memory lane of winter in London, particularly when it came to some of the locations, like Tower Bridge. It was also an enjoyable romance, even if I wasnt entirely convinced by the emphasis on class distinctions, or the fact she was ashamed of her working-class heritage (I always saw the real-life English working class, as generally proud of their heritage. It's the middle class who seek upward mobility). I also would have liked to have seen more character development, particularly with James.Overall, I liked the novel, but probably not enough to read more in the series.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3PS22XZUEWERE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N6RNRVI#wasThisHelpful","R3PS22XZUEWERE","A3VKMXTPAUNUUB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3VKMXTPAUNUUB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"After the murder of her brother, heiress Estella Everstone goes incognito as Elle Stoneburner, paid companion to an elderly widow. But she doesnt anticipate the job taking her to Everston, her favourite of her familys hotels, where she meets Mr Dexter Blakeley, the hotel manager  and Jay Crawford, her ex-fiance.The whole book is told in first person, by Elle/Estella. Shes an interesting character: people treat her differently as Elle Stoneburner, and she finds their attitudes quite different. It gives her the opportunity to find out who she really is, apart from the much-younger Everstone sister, the heiress. The first person gives it a gothic romance field, a little like Victoria Holt (for those old enough to remember her!).This is especially the case with Mr Blakeley and his mother, both of whom seems to have a low opinion of society women. Elle/Estella is attracted to Mr Blakely, and he seems to be attracted to Elle, but will he have the same feelings for Estella, given she represents so much he appears to despise?The Captive Imposter is the final book in The Everstone Chronicles trilogy, with each book telling the romance of one of the Everstone siblings. The Captive Imposter is a standalone novel, but features characters and situations from the earlier booksso if you plan on reading all the books, do start with The Hesitant Heiress.Ive read all three books, and they all have solid plots with excellent characters, feisty women with faith and attitude. The books are well-written, and I especially like the way they each include a strong Christian thread without being preachy. Having said that, I think The Captive Imposter is my favourite of the three books, because the plot is something a little different, and because the characters are so good--both well-imagined and well-portrayed.

"Kate Walker writes romance moviesnot exactly her life ambition, but it pays the bills. At least, it used to, while her scripts were selling. She has a new opportunity: to take a short-term trip to Africa to cover projects managed by the charity her late mother set up, but a tornado in her home town changes her plans. It also introduces her to her brothers college friend and ex-professional football player Colton Greene  who just happens to be looking for a writer to co-write his memoir. But Kate knows nothing about football, and Colton isnt willing to open up about the family tragedy which led to him growing up in foster care.Ive read and enjoyed a couple of Melissa Taggs other books, and while I enjoyed this, I didnt feel there was anything which made it stand out from the crowd. The main characters, Kate and Colton, were nice, even if their careers were a little clich. They all live in a lovely town where everyone pulls together in times of adversity (like bad weather). Everything was nice, which made it all a little too bland for my taste. The most interesting character was the bad-tempered coffeeshop owner (who I can see having a major role in another book in the series).Overall, From the Start was an enjoyable summer read in which everything happens just as it should, providing a fun read and a satisfying ending.

"Yes, the title is a little clich, but thats what we expect from Heartsong Presents (where references to billionaires and heiresses are almost obligatory). However, the plot is a welcome turnup on the more typical clich of the pretty female falling for her rich male boss.Julia Radcliffe has taken a temporary job as church secretary while the current secretary is on maternity leave. Its a change from her previous roles, but shes enjoying the challengeexcept for the website work. The church hires an IT person, who turns out to be Sean Mitchell, the bad boy brother of her best friends husband. Julia soon finds Sean has changed and developed a faith in God, although hes still as attractive as the last time they met.Sean has the same trouble with Julia as he does with his parents: they dont believe hes changed, and they dont believe hes good enough. Its a good reminder to see that while on one hand none of us are good enough for God, He loves and forgives us regardless. Its a lesson Sean and Julia each have to learn, in their own different ways.Winning Over the Heiress is a sequel to Her Tycoon Hero (Ryan and Cassies story), but can easily be read as a standalone novel. Its an enjoyable way to spend a summer afternoon, with an almost-perfect combination of romance and Christian truth.Thanks to the author for providing a free ebook for review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1GEX68MIIWABI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SGP5AQU#wasThisHelpful","R1GEX68MIIWABI","A3VKMXTPAUNUUB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3VKMXTPAUNUUB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Kirra Jacobs and Reef McKenna have been paired as volunteers supporting the annual Iditarod race in Alaska, but they quickly find themselves working together on quite a different kind of project after Kirras Uncle Frank doesnt report in after one of the early stages. They locate Frank, who tells them Kirras cousin, Meg, has been kidnapped, and they need to find her before the end of the nine-day race so Frank doesnt have to complete the job. And no cops, or Meg dies.What follows is a fast-paced race against time as Kirra and Reef search for Meg and try to find why she and Frank have been targeted. Both Kirra and Reef have to address to some aspects of their past they are less than proud of, which adds a depth to the overall plot. It's hard to say anything more about why I liked it without giving away important plot details, so I'll just say I thought the suspense elements were excellent, and I loved the way the romance developed over the course of Sabotaged. Ah, Reef ...Sabotaged is the fifth and final book in Dani Pettreys Alaskan Courage series, each of which follows the story of one of the McKenna siblings. Romantic suspense is one of my favourite genres, and Ive enjoyed them all. Dani Pettreys writing style is similar to Dee Hendersons, and Id definitely recommend Sabotaged (and the rest of the Alaskan Courage series) to fans of Hendersons OMalley series.Thanks to Bethany House and NetGalley for providing a free ebook for review","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2WKRR4BUDKTIC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MBTYFV8#wasThisHelpful","R2WKRR4BUDKTIC","A3VKMXTPAUNUUB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3VKMXTPAUNUUB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Heaven Help Heidi is the second novel in Sally Johns Family of the Heart Series, although you dont need to have read Between Us Girls first (althoughas with most seriesit is best to read them in order to avoid spoiling the storylines relating to the recurring characters). The series is set in San Diego, in the Casa de Vida Cottages in the fictional Seaside Village. As with Between Us Girls, the story starts with a young woman who needs a new start moving into Casa de Vida, befriending one of the existing residents, and finding the answers to questions she didnt know she had.Heidi Hathaway is a successful real estate salesperson, but horrific injuries sustained in a car accident mean she cant drive and she cant navigate the stairs in her beautiful three-story condo. Piper, a business acquaintance, invites her to move into a vacant cottage at the one-level Casa de Vida. Heidi accepts, mostly because she has no other options. Her ongoing health issues mean she cant work to the capacity she used to, which means Val, her friend and boss, is having to take on more and morebut Val has problems too. Piper has her own issues. Her fiance died four years ago, and although she still misses him, shes finally learned to cope without him.What I thought lifted Heaven Help Heidi above Between Us Girls was the hidden linkages between the characters. Heidi moving into Casa de Vida is the catalyst that forces some of the minor characters to reconsider their perceptions of the past, and to look for reconciliation, and I enjoyed this aspect. The novel has underlying Christian themes, but while several of the characters (especially Liv) are Christians, its not in-your-face preachy Christian fiction (in fact, the Christian aspects felt a bit understated at times).There is also a touch of romance in the novels (well, perhaps more than a touch). Part of me would like to see more on-page development of the relationship, but I think I see the point Sally John is making by keeping the romance low-key. We cant rely on a man to come in and fix our lives. We have to sort through things with God first, and then we can come to a place where we are ready to share our lives with someone else. Its not that were fixed (are we ever?), but that we know who we are in ourselves and in God. That knowledge and security allows us to open ourselves to new personal and professional possibilities. Thought-provoking.I really enjoyed Heaven Help Heidi, and Ill be looking forward to the next book in the series.Thanks to Harvest House and NetGalley for providing a free ebook for review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2186ZGT804VJF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RYB9NJW#wasThisHelpful","R2186ZGT804VJF","A3VKMXTPAUNUUB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3VKMXTPAUNUUB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When Kelli Huddlestons father and stepmother die in an accident, she is left with nothing and no oneor so she thinks. When cleaning out the house before it sell, she finds an old envelope containing newspaper clippings about the presumed drowning of David Waters and his infant daughter, Darcy, from the small town of Shoal Creek, Tennessee. But the photo is of her Kelli travels from California to Tennessee to see if she can meet the surviving members of the Waters family, Alison and her two children, Max and Beth. She wants to know if theres a reason her father leftand decide whether she introduces herself as their long-lost sister/daughter, or whether she leaves them to go on with their lives. She also meets her fathers ex business partner, Ken Moore, and his son, but finds the trip raises more questions than answers, and forces her to re-evaluate her life in more ways than one.This is the first novel Ive read by Kathryn Cushman, but it wont be the last. I liked her writing, especially the subtle way she wove Christianity into the plot in a way that made it central and realistic without being intruding. I thought the plot was an excellent combination of mystery and romance, and the subplots did an excellent job of supporting the main story; Kellis dilemma.Kelli was faced with a difficult decision where there was no right choice, which made her a fascinating character. I thought it was a convincing portrayal of how someone would act in such a situation, where everything theyve been told while growing up turns out to be a lie, creating huge cracks in the memory of a perfect childhood. Going deeper, it also shows us how difficult it is to break those beliefs we are raised withand the need for forgiveness.

"Tara Faulkner is marring Seth Grissom: her brothers best friend, the son of their pastor, and the guy shes loved for ten years. But they have a strange argument three weeks before the wedding, and when she returns to discuss it with Seth, she finds him doing something awful. He promises hell change and never do it again, and she wants to believe him. After all, the alternative is cancelling the wedding. But when she finds he lied, she does just thatbut he makes her promise not to tell anyone why, which leaves her dealing with all the fallout, not least two families blaming her for the cancellation.One Last Thing is written entirely in first person point of view from Taras viewpoint. This normally only works for complex characters, and Tara wasnt complex, at least not in the beginning. She was the perfect pampered Southern princess, and while she hasnt lived an entirely sheltered life, her family is financially stable and shes always been given the best of everything. She attends church with her family, but there was little indication she had any personal faith: something thats normally a must in Christian romance.At first I was a little frustrated that Seth, a Christian man who worked for a mission organisation, was planning to marry a woman who had little or no personal faith of her own. But as the novel progressed, Tara began to search for God  and it explained why Seth was prepared to be unequally yoked. The explanation was misogynistic, hypocritical (or possibly both), but it worked, and it worked without making me feel as though my emotions were being manipulated. Thats strong writing.The more Tara digs into Seths issues, the more she finds out, and the more secrets she has to keep from her friends, her family, and from Seths family. The only person who has any sympathy for her is Seths younger sisterwhos seen as a troublemaker. She is helped in her troubled journey by a disparate group of ladies she meets while working in a local coffee shopher first-ever job.Tara slowly discovers Seths issues, and strangely, this allows us to move from repugnance to sympathy for his problems while still acknowledging Tara did the right thing. Seth acknowledges that he has to take responsibility for his own actions, especially when they have hurt others, and I see this as a positive thing.Publisher Thomas Nelson has caught some criticism recently for publishing books with inappropriate content for a Christian novel. I suspect theyll catch a little more over One Last Thing, from people who would like to believe this kind of thing never happens to proper Christians. I wish it didnt, but it does, and One Last Thing does an excellent job in sensitively fictionalising a growing problem in society. Its not easy reading, and its not nice. But it is real.

"Its hard to review this novella. I usually read the book descriptions when I request a book for review and have often forgotten it by the time I come to read the book. But this time I hadnt, because the book description was right there in the frontwhich was a shame, because it wasnt a teaser. It was a plot summary.The result was a novella where I kept waiting for something to happen. And waiting. And waiting. The writing was good, and the characters had potential, but the two plot twists in the story (Rand being alive, Ben hiding that from everyone, and Ben trying to kidnap Sarah) were covered in the book description, which took away any suspense the story might have had.This is the first of six novellas in the series, being released each month for the next six months. After reading the description, theres no point in reading this novella. Ive signed up to read and review the whole series, but I wont read any more of the descriptions. Maybe that way I will be surprised and enjoy them.Amazon is already offering a 6-in-1 volume which goes on sale in September.

"My husband and I have a wide variety of toys and novelties to add spice to the bedroom - and we had always toyed around with the idea of a slave collar - but never found one that we liked - but when I came across this one we decided to try it because it looked appealing and the reviews were mostly positive.I will say that I was impressed with the quality of this collar as soon as I took it out of the package. It is made of a very thick durable leather and you can tell this thing was meant to take a beating. It is very unlikely that regardless of how rough you and your playmate get in the bedroom - you are not going to break, rip or damage this collar in any way. The collar fits around the neck easily - and will fit both men and women - there are several sizing notches on the collar so that the fit and tightness can be adjusted to your personal preference. It does take a minute of fanagling to get it on and fit properly - but once it's on it stays on and it looks pretty impressive. Strap this buddy on and you look like you are ready to go to a fetish party.The collar also comes with a metal chain lead leash with leather handle - which can be attached or detached at will. It was a nice touch -Not all collars come with that extra accessory. The collar is reasonably comfortable to wear and is very well padded on the inside - so you don't have to worry about marks or bruises even if you are tugging on the leash.In the spirit of leaving a completely honest review - the only critique I have for this collar is I wish that it were a little thinner width wise. When worn it literally covers the entire neck area - so if you or your partner have any weight on you it will create a double chin. It can be ignored obviously - I just think it would be more comfortable and aesthetically pleasing if it were a bit narrower. This is the reason I gave it four out of five starsOverall though - this is a very sturdy, durable product that is an excellent addition to any BDSM/Slave/Fetish collection. Very high quality, well made and comfortable to wear.I received this product free in exchange for my honest review. I have not been compensated.

"We love straws in my house. But I really hate buying the plastic ones because they seem like a waste of money to me. You can wash them - but most of the time they end up chewed on or accidentally thrown away. A pointless effort. When I came across these glass eco-friendly straws - I jumped to order them.They came in a nice sturdy box - it can easily be used to store and protect your glass straws when not in use - the box is slim and can easily be tucked inside a drawer. Mine fits nicely in my silverware drawer beside the silverware tray.At any rate the set comes with four class straws that are gently curved at the top which makes them easy to drink out of. You don't have to try to get your face above the straw like you have to with the ones that are completely straight. The straws are well made and perfectly smooth - no sharp edges or corners. And the glass is decently thick so you don't have to worry about them shattering from you handling them - i wouldn't recommend testing their durability by dropping them on the floor but they are decently durable.The set also comes with two cleaners - they resemble tiny bottle brushes. They are thin with bristles at one and and a metal handle on the other - you simply feed the cleaner into the straw and wiggle around to clean - and then repeat from the other end of the straw- and rinse through with water. Super Simple. You could also put these in the dishwasher if you were so inclined but I worry about them getting crushed by other items in the load.

"I am a huge fan of essential oils- I use them for everything.. and I know good oil when I use it. I have had experience with the Aviano brand in the past and have used many of their products. They have yet to let me down - so when I discovered they made a chamomile variety that I did not already had - I jumped to order it.It came in a 10ml bottle - as many oils to - but unlike many other affordable oils - a little goes a long way. A few drops in a diffuser can easily scent an entire area of my apartment. It certainly doesn't seem to be cut or diluted with anything. It's really a quality product.The chamomile has a lovely airy, clean floral scent to it and is an amazing choice for diffusing or using in a home made oil blend. I am a huge fan of chamomile because I suffer from anxiety and one of the main pulls for chamomile is that it is supposed to be calming. I pair this with lavender in a carrier oil and diffuse. I also dab it on my pressure points when needed - I really feel like it helps me avoid anxiety spikes.I really enjoy this product - I also like that they install dropper caps in these bottles - makes dolling out thee appropriate amount a bit more simple. Overall, this is a great product - fragrant and super easy to use.I received this product free in exchange for my honest reivew. I have not been compensated.

" 1:30 Mins I have a wide variety of toys at home - both for personal alone time fun and for spicing things up in the bedroom with my hubby. I have tried Bombex toys in the past - so when I came across this dynamic gizmo - I had to have it.The sizing of this thing is near perfect. It has an insertable shaft length of 6"" and a girth of 1.4"" - so it will likely be comfortable for most. The shaft has a series of rotating beads that operate in both directions and at numerous speeds - and they create a unique sensation that I have not experienced with any toy in the past. The insertible part of the toy and the rabbit shaped clitoral stimulator are both fashioned from what appears to be flexible silicon. It is smooth and seamless for comfortThe toy has a multitude of functions. MULTITUDE. Take that in - the controls are located on the lower part of the toy - one set of buttons and one set for vibration and one for head and bead rotation - this is an awesome feature because it allows you to change it up and find a setting your really like - and no two settings feel the same - this is not a toy you are going to get bored with in a few days and toss aside. This toy will likely be your new best friend.The device works on 4AAA batteries which are easily inserted in the batter compartment under the toy. This device doesn't eat up batteries either which is convenient. Like with any other toy - I recommend pairing with a waterbased lube for comfort.This little bugger will get you where you want to go in a hurry. Great for solo play time or for fun with a friend! It's also waterproof so feel free to take your new friend to the shower with you - just be careful your knees don't go weak! That's not an injury you want to explain to the doc in the ER. Love this product. It's getting 5 Stars from me!I received this product free in exchange for my honest review. I have not been compensated.

"I have a lot of little boys in my extended family - so when I ran across this multipack of CAT Caterpillar Construction Toys - I didn't know what i was going to use it for - but I went ahead and ordered it.This kit is pretty stellar - it's a twelve piece set that includes 3-Dump Trucks, 3-Bulldozers, 3-Wheel Loaders and 3-Excavator - each are packaged individually. All have moving parts and are exact models of the real thing. The pack also comes with 12 paper construction hats.My first thought was that these would be great for a little boys birthday parties. There are plenty of trucks to use both on the cake as toppers and to give to each child-guest as a favor. Plus, the hats would be super fun for the kids to wear.On another note - because the pieces are individual - these also make great stocking stuffer Christmas toys for kids! Seriously! They are small and so much better than stuffing a stocking full of candy and junk food!The toys are well made and after tugging on all of them and playing with them - both by myself and with kids I have found them to be pretty durable. It must be noted though that there is always a possibility that these may break - and they do have small parts so definitely mind that ages 3+ warning for safety.Definitely a great product for the price and with a multitude of uses - this party pack is definitely something to order and store away for when the need arises.I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest unbiased review.

"I am a huge fan of handmade, eclectic Jewelry -  especially pieces that are inspired by other cultures. So, when I came across this Sandal Wood Big Bead Bracelet from Qitian Jewlry - It was definitely something I wanted to add to my collection.The bracelet is definitely handmade - you can tell that the knots meant to keep the bracelet together are done in such a way that it would be very hard for a machine to accomplish it in the same fashion. The bracelet very closely resembles bhuddist prayer beads - which if you have ever seen authentic ones are absolutely stunning.These beads are genuine wood. They were a little darker than I would expect normal sandalwood to be - but I'm guessing they were probably stained because they have the color tone of something closer to a dark cherry style wood. They are perfectly round and smooth and some of the wood grain swirls are actually visible which is very aestethically pleasing and adds to the bracelets appeal in a positive way.The bracelet is made on a stretchy, durable cord material. Easy to get on and of without having to struggle. It's also super comfortable to wear - and the band is stretchy enough that if you need to lay your wrist down the bracelet can easily be pushed up the arm.Stylish, sophisticated and possessing a very boho/earthcentric style and feel - this bracelet is definitely one I am certainly happy to own! I love it. It can be paired with so many outfits and accessories - and I love versatile jewelry so this is really perfect for my collection. Well made and beautifully crafted. I definitely recommend.I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review. I have not been compensated.

"I have a large size trash can in my kitchen pantry - and the problem with that is that I absolutely hate buying trash bags. They are so expensive and even when you splurge to buy better quality - you only get a few in the box. Why would I pan't to pay $10+ for 8 Trashbags? I don't. So - most of the time I either purchase the really cheap sack style bags (that really suck) or use the plastic bags they pack things in at the grocery store, tie the bag up and simply toss it into the larger can. The problem with that is it makes it a lot harder to take out the trash. I live in a small apartment and we actually have to tote our trash out to the dumpster in the parking lot. Which is inconvenient at best. So - taking into consideration how much trash my family normally makes - when I came across the roll of 12 gallon bags from Homeproduct that had 120 on the roll - it looked like the perfect solution.These bags are perforated at the end so they tear easily off the roll. They can be opened without hassle and are very roomy. Like I said these are 12 gallon bags so there no trying to stretch and fit the bag into the can. It simply falls right into place with more than enough bag left over to hand over the rim of the can and tie in place to keep it from moving.These bags are pretty sturdy - I mean I wouldn't recommend filling it with 20 pounds of trash and expecting it not to break - but for every day purposes these are perfect. They are easy to change and replace. I have not had one incident where the bags ripped, leaked or broke while changing or carrying- which is important to note because I have a one year old and we throw away a lot of diapers - so a leaky trashbag... is just not acceptable.Overall - for every day purposes - these bags really hold their own - they are sturdy enough to hold up to what I need them for plus they are affordable. Definitely a product I will be re-ordering in the near future.I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review. I have not been compensated.

"I work from home mostly to be with my one year old - but there are times when I have to work on the go - and it means my laptop has to come with me. I have had a lot of laptop cases in the past - and while they serve their purpose - I just find that they are a pain because they are typically single function and lack the ability to be used for anything else. Most only have room for the laptop and cord - so when I came across the slim laptop backpack from Observ- it looked like it might be an item that I could really get some use out of.Yes, it absolutely protects my laptop. It's backpack style so you simply need to unzip and slide your device into the main pocket. Which is quite spacious might I add. But beyond that - the reason that I am giving this product 5 stars is because it is so versatile and user friendly. Like I said - I have a kid. Said kid takes two arms to hold - so if I need to take her and the laptop with me ... I am either making multiple trips to a car  OR I am throwing the backpack on my back and carrying my kid. HOW SUPER AWESOME IS THAT.Additionally, this back pack really has a lot of space in it - it is perfect for me when I am on the go - I can also pack additional necessities in it for working purposes - pens, a few notepads - calculator..etc. etc. there is plenty of room in there for me to store what I need without having to worry about the extra items causing damage to the laptop.The bag is extremely well padded on the inside - so I also do not have to worry about my device getting scratched or dinged. Plus - like I said - I really digg that this product is actually a backpack. Makes transport super simple. I really think this bag would be perfect for any college student, freelance worker or on the go business person. It's affordable - modern looking and really does a great job protecting my device.

"Honestly, I wasn't quite sure what to expect when I ordered this threading tool. I have both waxed and plucked in the past - and while they can be painful - the appeal to them is that you can target areas and get things done in a hurry. Typically I use waxing for larger areas and tweezers for specific or stubborn hairs. I have not owned a threader tool like this in the past - but it seemed like a unique beauty tool so I decided to give it a shot - I really didn't have anything to lose.The product is basically a glorified spring that you bend gently to open the coils and pinch all your hair before twisting the ends to basically rip the hair out of your face. In all actuality - the product does work - I personally am not a huge fan of it - but because it functions as described I am giving it four stars - no need in punishing a product because it personally was not my cup of tea. Here's the breakdown.ProsThe product does work - it takes a few tries to get the motion down and learn which angles to bend the coil at to capture the most hairs without catching your skin - but it does sucessfully remove both dark coarse hair on the face as well as fine peach fuzz. The tool is easy to use in concept - and is compact and can easily fit in your makeup case.The ConsUsing this tool to remove all of the fine hair on your face is time consuming - especially if you are unaccustomed to using this type of product. Another issue is that you will catch your skin at least once or twice - and it does hurt. I mean it's getting pinched by a coil - no way to sugar coat that. Also, it is a bit hard to target specific hairs.Overall - for me personally - waxing and tweezing are much more efficient for facial hair removal. This threading tool absolutely does work - which is why I am giving it four stars. But for me  - it seems more of a novelty item. Definitely glad I tried it - it's a cool thing to have and maybe keep in your purse in case you need to defuzz on the go and dont have tweezers handy - but I certainly wont be replacing my normal hair removal tools with this one.I received this item free in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.

"I live in a small one bedroom apartment so don't ask me how my tiny family of three makes so much trash - I'm guessing the majority is caused by my constant cleaning and the fact that I have a one year old in diapers. At any rate- I actually boycotted trashbags for some time because I am on a limited budget and quality bags tend to be expensive. I was actually filling up tiny plastic grocery bags and then tying them and putting them in our large can in the pantry - it was working but it was inconvenient - especially when we would run out of bags. So, when I came across these 8 Gallon bags from Homeproduct in a roll that had 120 bags on it - I decided to give these a shot.The bags were the perfect size for out kitchen trash can. The bags are perforated on the roll and pull away easily. They open with out a struggle and are both wide and long enough to easily fit inside the can with plenty of bag left over at the top to drape over the sides - which makes changing super easy.One of my favorite things about these bags is that they are sturdy - I have to carry the bag from my trashcan all the way outside to the complex dumpster and I have not once had a bag split, rip, tear or come untied. I haven't had them leak either which is super important in my household where we throw away a lot of diapers.The only thing I will say about these bags is that they are thinner that those big heavy duty kitchen trash bags - they do not stretch and are not meant to overload - but for every day purposes they are perfect - you can actually double bag heavy trash for a stronger hold and an extra level of protection.Overall - these bags have been a godsend in my house. No more plastic sacks for us. These bags are dependable and with 120 bags per roll - This is an expense that I am willing to handle.I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review.

"I am really big into essential oils. I use them for so many things. I clean with them, I diffuse them, I make lotions, air fresheners, perfumes, tinctures the works. So, needless to say - I know good oil when I use it. A lot of the 'affordable' brands of oil out there are so watered down and diluted that you really get ripped off if you think you are buying pure oils. I have been using Aviano oils for some time - and have always had wonderful experiences with them - but I never knew they made oil blends. I had only ever seen straight scents.. lemon, bergamot, cinnamon etc. So when I came across the Top 6 Oil Blends Set... I had to have it.The set includes  Breathe Again, Dreamy Sleep, Health Guard, Mellow Mind, Romantic Paradise andTropical Island. These oil blends are creative. Some of these combinations I have never experiences. They are amazingly strong and aromatic. When I use these oils you can tell as soon as you open them by both the consistency and the aroma that they are quality. A few drops really goes a long way. A few drops in a diffuser will easily scent my entire home for hours. Much more economic than constantly buying aerosol air fresheners and candles. Plus, these are so versatile - there is so much you can do with them. You can mix a few drops with a carrier oil like coconut to use in an aromatherapy massage - add a few drops to some shea butter for a rich aromatic lotion... the possibilities are endless. These are definitely high quality and I am happy that I found them. Aviano has not let me down yet!I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review. I have not been compensated.

"I'll admit it. I'm a cheapskate. I am a stay at home mommy and we live off one income. So, I don't like buying tupperware. It's expensive. So yeah, I'm one of those save the lunch meat and butter tubs for storage. The down side to that is that you cannot separate things when you store them and they take up a massive amount of space in my fridge. So, when I was offered the opportunity to try out the Premium 3 compartment stackable containers from California Home Goods.. I was elated. They looked like they could really be useful to me.I really like these containers. They are stackable when not in use and easily fit in my cabinet. There are ten of them so I have plenty when it comes time to pack away left overs. The compartment sizes are generous and you can literally fit more than a pound and a half of food in these (depending on the food.) I really liked that when you go to put them in the fridge they can be placed one on top of the other without having to worry that they are going to bend and fall through.My only grievance with this product (and the reason I am giving it four out of five stars) is that I wish the plastic on both the container and the lid was a bit thicker. They can easily be microwaved without issue - and it says they are dishwasher safe... but I choose to hand wash mine because over time dishwashing will compromise the integrity of the material. I just wish they were less flexible - especially if you pack a lot of food in them .. it would just feel sturdier to me.Overall though I love this product. they make life in my house so much easier. Especially since I can pack food and snacks to go on a whim in my trusty compartment boxes. A must have for any kitchen.

"I have very long, thick and naturally wavy/curly hair. Traditional hairbrushes and I don't always get along. I have to use an amazing quality conditioner when I wash my hair to be able to get a brush through it wet and then I don't usually brush it once it's dry because it just breaks and frizzes and I look like a really poofy lion. #curlyhairproblems. LOLAt any rate - when I came across the detangling hair brush from Petunia Skin care - I decided it was definitely worth a shot. I have tried several 'detangling' brushes in the past but they pretty much broke, fell down on the job or were just not high quality. But, since everyone in the world seems to be raving about this style of brushes there had to be one out there that actually works.. I was hoping maybe this one was it.Overall - I was impressed by the function of the brush. Unlike traditional brushes the bristles on this one are varying lengths which helps to prevent hair from tangling as you brush it. This brush works extremely well for me when my hair is wet. The knots come apart a whole lot easier and makes brushing a whole lot less time consuming.As for dry brushing - the bristles just didn't do the job for me - like I said my hair is very thick and it seemed like the brush only permeated the top layers of my hair because the bristles were not long enough to get through all of it. But that is just my personal experience. I really think that this type of brush is much better suited for someone who doesn't have as much thickness and volume to their hair as I do.My only genuine critique of this product is that for me - the handle is a big hard to keep a hold of because of the way it is shaped. This is especially so when my hands or hair is wet. I wish it had a more profound cylindrical handle. It is for these reasons that I am giving the product four out of five stars. It is a good product I just think it is better suited for certain hair types and thicknesses over others.I received this product free in exchange for my honest review. I have not been compensated.

"I am a huge fan of essential oils. I use them for nearly everything... cleaning, diffusing, making bath and beauty products, the works. They are incredible - but I am very picky about the oils I buy and use. I have had wonderful experiences with Aviano products in the past so I was hoping that their Kashmir Lavendar Essential Oil would be up to my standards as well.This Lavender oil is amazingly aromatic. Unlike other 'affordable' oil options I have tried in the past this one actually has a strong smell. It doesn't seem to be diluted or watered down which is great because it means that it stretches further and lasts longer. I only have to use a few drops in a diffuser to scent my whole house. I really like putting a few drops on my wool dryer balls because it is amazing at scenting laundry.. and the scent lasts a super long time - even after it's been folded and put away. So much cheaper than traditional fabric softeners.If you are looking for a lavender oil - this is definitely a great product to consider. Very high quality.

"My husband and I are huge coffee drinkers. I like to try new blends and brands occasionally -- but my husband is a bit of a stickler - he likes his Folgers and not much else. When I came across the Moka variety from Resilient Coffee Roasters - I had to try it. I personally have tried their espresso blend in the past and it was amazing - so I was hoping this variety would be up to par as well.The first thing I noticed when I got this product was how aromatic it was. You can smell the very rich smell of moca infused coffee even before you open the bag... and it will wow you when you do open it. It will definitely take your senses for a joyride. You can tell just by smelling the coffee how fresh it literally is. I really loved that right there on the front of the packaging it tells you WHEN your coffee was roasted.. and where. How cool is that. The date on my coffee was within two weeks of deliver. So, yeah. I was impressed with the freshness.One thing you need to know before you order this product is that it comes in the form of whole beans. You will need to be able to grind the beans yourself to brew the coffee - so an electric or hand grinder is a must have. The beans are dark and rich and do take a little bit of time to break down in a hand grinder - but it is so worth the added effort. The flavor of this coffee when brewed is amazing. Very rich and savory. I am usually a huge creamer gal. I will normally use a lot of sugar and a lot of creamer to make coffee taste the way I want it to. I do not have to do that with this product. A little bit of sugar and I can drink this and enjoy it. The flavor is very smooth with light hints of moca here and there. Quite delightful. A very high quality product. It is certainly a new favorite in my household. I was surprised it was such a hit with my husband considering how brand snotty he is. At any rate - it is definitely something for every coffee lover to try.I received this product a discount in exchange for my honest review. I have not been compensated.

"These are a really cute novelty gift.

"We have tried so many different foods for our lab Macy trying to find 'the one'. It is important to me that her food is both tasty and nutritious. I was recently given a free sample of the Purina One Smartblend Dry Food from Smiley360 and Purina in exchange for my opinion and review of the product.I have to say - I have been quite impressed by this food! My dog no longer turns her nose up at dry food which is a huge milestone for us. Macy is a bit spoiled and because she didn't take a liking to dry food as a pup I always added gravy or mixed in wet food to make it more tasty for her. She used to refuse plain dry food - but for some reason with this brand she will eat it solo. You have no idea how amazing that is. It makes it less expensive on me and a lot quicker to get things done at her meal time.I compared the ingredient label against several other brands in store and I was amazed at all of the awesome nutrients this food is packing. The pieces are small and easy for her to chew and the food does not give her horrendous gas - which has been an issue with other brands in the past. Since starting her on this food I have noticed that her coat is shinier and she seems to have a lot more energy! This is definitely a pet food product I would recommend. This stuff is really high quality and has everything your pup needs to be full, happy and healthy. Definitely worth trying if you haven't already!I received this product free in exchange for my honest review. I have not been compensated.

"I never had any issues with yeast infection until after my first child was born - my doctor said that it was caused in part by my hormones being out of whack and over time I would have less of an issue with them - which was a relief - but it sure didn't fix the discomfort of the problem. So, when I came across the Candida Cleanse from Healths Harmony and saw that other people were having positive experiences with it - I decided to give it a go.The pills are easy to get down - which is a huge bonus for me. I have a problem taking anything powder pressed but these are encapsulated so they are smooth and easy to swallow. They have a bit of an after taste - but easily goes away with a few sips of water. These pills are extremely effective for treating a yeast infection and heading them off. At the first sign of symptoms I take a dose of these and within a few hours I start to notice some relief - If taken for a few days you can ward off a full fledged infection all together. If you start taking them after symptoms get bad it will help clear things up a whole lot faster than other standard OTC treatments alone.This product really is something I would recommend all women have in their medicine cabinet - it will definitely help save you from days of discomfort.

"I have a wide variety of adult novelty toys and accessories at home. My husband and I are all about keeping the spice and intrigue in our sex life so we are always down for trying new things. I have had a few similar style vibrators in the past - most of them get thrown away after just a few uses - mostly because many of them are cheaply made - drain batteries in a hurry or break suddenly after not having had them very long. When I came across the Shibari 7"" Multi-Speed Vibrator however, I decided to give it a shot. I have purchased several products from this line in the past and they have yet to disappoint me - so I was hoping this toy would follow suit.The vibrator is very sleek and modern looking. The device is shiny like chrome and made out of a cool-to-the-skin metallic material. This toy runs off of 2AA batteries (not included). The batteries are super easy to insert - you just need to unscrew and remove the bottom dial piece to expose the battery compartment - insert the batteries and screw the knob back on. From there you can turn the product on and it is ready to use. The black dial knob on the bottom controls the speed and power of the vibrations.As far as function goes - this toy works extremely well. The length is adequate and the girth is comfortable and on par with what you would expect from this type of toy - plus the adjustable settings make it easy for you and your partner to spice things up along the way and also enabling you to find the perfect setting to meet your needs. Definitely a toy worth having in your repertoire. It is also completely water proof which makes it great for solo shower play or fun with a spouse.

"I am an outdoorsy girl. I like roughin it with the guys and hanging out in the woods, going camping, hiking, etc. Unfortunately - the fact that I have a vagina often made these activities somewhat difficult if they were over long periods of time and far from a rest room. I mean yeah I have squatted in the woods before - but every time you do you risk an insect bite, ticks and brushing your lady biz with poison ivy. No bueno. So, when I came across the Kleango Disposable Female Urine Directors.. my first thought was HELL YES. These looked like the perfect solution to an age old problem. I had to try them out.I took these on our most recent camping trip - and I have been very much impressed with this product. Essentially the product is a funnel that is fashioned out of thick, durable and disposable cardboard. They come individually wrapped and sealed in plastic so they stay fresh and sanitary until you are ready to use - when you open the package you simply unfold the funnel and pop it open. From there you are ready to use -  All you need to do is hike the front of your pants down a bit and cup the wide open part over your lady parts and do what you gotta do. The funnel carries the urine in whatever direction you point it and AWAY from your body. Super simple - I have used this product several times and never so much as got a single dribble on myself or my clothes which is a huge plus. When you are done fold back up - stick in the plastic bag it came in and toss or seal up and stick in your bag to throw away at your next convenience.These funnels are super convenient and do not take up much space at all - they can easily be put into a purse, back or fanny pack so they can be used when necessary. These are also great for use in public restrooms if you have issues with it's sanitation or to keep in your glove compartment in case you break down on the side of the road. Of course - I do recommend keeping some baby wipes or a napkin handy to dry yourself  for comfort purposes.Overall, I really love these Kleango Funnels - super convenient and easy to use - I definitely recommend this for any woman to keep in their emergency arsenal. I give it two thumbs up!I received this product free in exchange for my honest review. I have not been compensated.

"Apart from the very catchy single ""Everybody Knows"" I dare say that ""A Short Album About Love"" has more in common with Scott Walker and Frank Sinatra than with the Brit-pop brand which has often been attached to Hannon. Eg. You only really notice the precense of the guitar on a few of the tracks.Although the big musical arrangements have been part of the groups / Hannons music since ""Liberation"" the big orchestral sound is on this album very pronounced. As the title indicated its an album with focus ""Love"" in various forms. Hannon is an unusually gifted songwriter who both melodically and lyrically is on par with greats such as Ray Davies of the Kinks.It took me some time to get used to the slightly pompous orchestra sounds, but eventually the fine songs convinced me  and, of course, Hannons vocals - he can croon without being too much.Besides ""Everybody Knows"", I will highlight the grandiose ""Someone"", the ballad ""If"", the catchy ""If I Were You"" (Bacharach style) and the fine final track ""I'm All You Need"".Definitely an album that wins on closer acquaintance","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1T8M6NVVL6TLG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0040DP63Y#wasThisHelpful","R1T8M6NVVL6TLG","A1XP7P3X9MRE5H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XP7P3X9MRE5H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""Sweet Fanny Adams"" is often considered one of the strongest Sweet albums - if not the very best. Part of the explanation for this might could be due to the fact that it was on this album that the group really took responsibility for their music, and in which direction they wanted to go. Songwriters Chinn and Chapman previously had been responsible for the bulk of the group's songs - especially the catchy and pretty light-hearted hits such as ""Co-Co"" and ""Funny Funny"".Now the group wished to emerge as a more serious band - though they did not intend to leave the glam-rock brand completely, and Chinn and Chapman continued writing songs for the group's singles.""Sweet Fanny Adams"" comes out as a reasonably solid rock album, often with reminiscences of Queen and Uriah Heep The majority of the songs were written by the group members themselves - and hats off to this. The problem is perhaps that songwriting is generally not very original and both musically and lyrically  ample use of some of rock's most hackneyed cliches may strike you.There is no doubt that the group know their craft, and both production and performance is very tightly knit. Among the original album songs tracks like ""Set Me Free,"" ""Heartbreak Today,"" ""Sweet Fanny Adams"" and ""Restless"" for me come out strongest, but I must also recognize that it is bonus-tracks with singles written by Chinn_Chapman that steal the show in the end. ""Blockbuster"", ""Hellraiser"" and especially ""The Ballroom Blitz"".Very much ""a period piece""  unlikely to impress new listeners of today. Paradoxically, the light hits such a ""Little Willie"" may in reality be far more viable than the more ambitious output from the band.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3HXRRVIMEGZCJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0006SNK9E#wasThisHelpful","R3HXRRVIMEGZCJ","A1XP7P3X9MRE5H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XP7P3X9MRE5H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"David Crosby's first solo album from 1971 was recorded with great help from prominent friends; especially Nash and Young. Also members of the Grateful Dead appear on several songs, and although the album may not contain really great songs, it is an album characterized by both the atmosphere and harmony  - not least vocally -  like Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young.In fact, the opening song, ""Music is Love"" could be recognized as a CSN&Y song - written with Young and Nash, and with only Steve Stills missing the recording. This song is also one of the more catchy - Crosby's own songwriting was rarely distinctly melodic or catchy.On the lenghty ""Cowboy Movie"" Crosby shows surprisingly strong and powerful vocals  he is usually known as fine harmony singer with a slightly tenuous solo voice. ""Cowboy Movie"" could be compared with both Neil Young's ""Southern Man"" or Donovan's ""Season of the Witch"" - but unlike these two great songs ""Cowboy Movie"" come out somewhat unresolved.Several of the songs have a certain improvisational character and are often built around by only two chords. But still also characterized by fine vocals and melodious acoustic guitars. For people unfamiliar with this period in music, the album may appear a bit  well, boring.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R10HUHH5P4P996/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004USRKX8#wasThisHelpful","R10HUHH5P4P996","A1XP7P3X9MRE5H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XP7P3X9MRE5H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Men at Works debut album from 1982 is among the best catchy and intelligent pop music to come from the 1980s. With roots in classic pop / rock with a touch of reggae and fine vocals  the group created a special and recognizable sound. Moreover the group was able to write really good songs, often with intelligent and humorous lyrics, and it is still a pleasure to listen to their best songs, some of which can be found on the ""Business as Usual"".The group had in its relatively short life of several big hits around the world. No less than four songs from ""Business as Usual"" did very well as singles; such as ""Who Can it Be Now"", ""Be Good Johnny"", ""Dr Heckyll and Mr. Jive"" and especially ""Down Under,"" which went to number one in several places around the world.In addition to these numbers, it is worth highlighting the upbeat ""I Can See it in Your Eyes"" and reggae-pop song ""Catch a Star"". Most prolific songwriter Colin Hay has, apart from being a fine musician, also unusually charmed smokey vocals.The bonus numbers are fine and demonstrate that the group was also a highly competent live band.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1E1GFEWUETGA8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000088SYA#wasThisHelpful","R1E1GFEWUETGA8","A1XP7P3X9MRE5H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XP7P3X9MRE5H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"REM's debut album ""Murmur"" from 1983 is in many ways a musical milestone. First of all, naturally,  because it is an excellent album, but also because it was one of the first albums which to great distinction, put together elements of folk, country and punk and thus was trendsetting for many bands in the middle of the 1980s. At the same time it is an album characterized by intelligent songwriting, and it comes out very confidently in its expression that one may find it hard to believe that it actually is a debut album.The album is well produced, although it may not quite have the crisp sound that characterizes most of the group's later albums.The highlights are many; not least catchy upbeat songs like ""Sitting Still"", ""Shaking Through"", ""Laughing"" and of course the single "" Radio Free Europe ""- yes this was before the fall of The Iron Curtain. There are very melodic songs like ""Talk About the Passion"" and the different ""We Walk"".There are also songs that may not be as readily recognizeable; in this category you might put  ""Pilgrimage"" and ""Moral Kiosk"".In short: ""A milestone"" which still seems appealing and relevant.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RES6BTGVG9JKQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000001I0A#wasThisHelpful","RES6BTGVG9JKQ","A1XP7P3X9MRE5H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XP7P3X9MRE5H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Leigh Nashs new album shows a whole different side of the artist than her otherwise excellent debut album ""Blue on Blue"" from 2006. Where ""Blue on Blue"" in many ways sounded like a Sixpence None the Richer ""album (Matt Slocum did contibute a little to that), ""The State I'm in"" is an album with deep roots in the classic country (Cline, Williams a.o.) and past pop. Nash is a co-writer to all the songs in collaboration primarily with Jesse Hall and Stephen Wilson.Most songs are lyrically based in themes such as longing, love and deceit. Musically, the album is catchy and several songs may have potential as new classics in the genre. Many would have fitted very to Patsy Cline, who apparently has been an inspiration for Nash. Vocally is Nash as always on top, and if you are into this type of country music, you probably wont find it much better.Personally, I prefer the songs that have a little more modern flair and more resemble her previous releases. Eg. ""The Promise Break,"" which could have been a Sixpence None the Richer song from an album like ""The Divine Discontent"". Also ""High is Better"", which sounds a bit like a Dolly Parton song, is fine.All songs are in their own way listening worthy, but as mentioned, for the most part rather different from what you may have heard from Nash before.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2QEYE0VJBY14O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0130HW82C#wasThisHelpful","R2QEYE0VJBY14O","A1XP7P3X9MRE5H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XP7P3X9MRE5H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This new album from the Indigo Girls shows that the duo is far from finished and run out of new ideas. Both women, Emily Saliers and Amy Ray have written fine new songs with great melodies and lyrics which in various ways have something to say.Most often, Amy Ray is behind the most rocking songs, and this is also the case of ""One Lost Day"" where ""Happy in the Sorrow Key"" and ""Olympia Inn"" are almost pure rockers - both very catchy. Among Rays more melodic and soft songs ""Texas was Clean"" is a really fine song, maybe a little in the vein of ""Moment of Forgiveness"" from ""Become You"".Emily Saliers, on the other hand, most often is responsible for the more melancholy and sensitive songs; often with very melodic and catchy melodies. Several of Emilys songs, however, this time have also got a little more""power"" than what is normally the case. Musically, ""Learned it on Me"" shows the duo expanding their normal expression. Very fine lyrics also from Emily.Emily's opening number ""Elizabeth"" is probably the album's most catchy and must be a sure future live favorite.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R31MOTCVM1W0JF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VRMEN3K#wasThisHelpful","R31MOTCVM1W0JF","A1XP7P3X9MRE5H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XP7P3X9MRE5H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Sonny of Cher's third Atlantic album, ""In Case You're in Love"" in 1967 and also the weakest and least interesting of the three. One reason is that Bono himself this time  only contributed five songs. In addition to the two fine hits ""Little Man"" and ""The Beat Goes On,"" which I wont hesitate to call a ""beat-classic"", it is the two good, but also somewhat ordinary, ""Monday"" and ""Living for You"" while ""Podunk"" directly silly.Most of the cover songs are decent, but nothing more. The exception is Bob Lind's fine ""Cheryl's Going Home,"" which the duo gives a fine version of. ""Misty Roses"" is at the same time pretentious and boring - very typical of the time - and not in a good way.The absolute highlight is, of course, ""The Beat Goes On,"" which in many ways draws a picture of pop music anno 1967. A pity that the duo did not pursue this more soul influenced style on their subsequent releases, instead of the pure pop entertainment style they embarked upon after signing to the MCA label.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2JNT7AE73SRSF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00D3OV0P4#wasThisHelpful","R2JNT7AE73SRSF","A1XP7P3X9MRE5H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XP7P3X9MRE5H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Unfortunately I cannot help being rather disappointed with Lana del Rey's new album. The individual songs may be quite good, but they do have very similar arrangements and pace of the songs is generally very slow, making the whole thing quite hard to get through.There are, of course, a few songs that rise out of  anonymity but at no point the album comes close to the heights of ""Born to Die"" and ""Paradise"" - unfortunately. The song that may be the first to stick out from the rest is the quite catchy ""High on the Beach"", but on the other hand it probably does not have long lasting qualities.Otherwise, my favorites must be ""Music to Watch Boys To"", ""Religion"" and ""Salvatore"". The cover version of ""Dont Let Me Be Misunderstood"" I find outright tiresome.I was actually also a little disappointed with ""Ultraviolence"" but will now rate that album higher than ""Honeymoon,"" which I so much feel lacks energy.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2A6XJTU3RV9TX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0147IF63Q#wasThisHelpful","R2A6XJTU3RV9TX","A1XP7P3X9MRE5H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XP7P3X9MRE5H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Unbelievable that the old rock veterans from the Pretty Things can find motivation and energy for one more album. I believe this new album is their 12th studiowork since the debut in 1965, so one can certainly not blame them for having doused market with their always energetic and usually fine music.On this new album, ""The Sweet Pretty Things"" we find two original members, singer Phil May and guitarist Dick Taylor, and both still take part in the songwriting supported especially the younger member of the group, George Woosey.The music is mostly classic rock, the way it often sounded early 1970s. The more refined arrangements and melodies that characterized some the group's major albums such as ""Parachute"" and ""Silk Torpedo"", there is not much left of here in 2015  it is really back to basics. Vocally youll notice that Mays voice has changed over the years - deeper, but still with a lot of strength.The album is generally very solid, but you might with some justification, argue that it lacks a couple of really great tunes. Strongest I think  find the opening track ""The Same Sun,"" written by Dick Taylor and producer Mark St. John, and the dark and droning ""Dirty Song"" written by May / Woosey.A couple of interesting cover versions have also found a place; an unexpected Byrds song ""Renaissance Fair"" has been given new life, with  some quirky vocal harmonies, and  the old Seeds number ""You Took Me By Surprise"" is revisited once again.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RG8RUVBUQJ0KS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XPMHQ20#wasThisHelpful","RG8RUVBUQJ0KS","A1XP7P3X9MRE5H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XP7P3X9MRE5H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Sonny and Cher's first album is in many aspects quite solid and interesting. Of course, first and foremost because of their classic hit ""I Got You Babe"", written by Sonny Bono and the almost equally strong ""Just You"" also written by Bono. Besides these two pearls Bono wrote for the album two more songs, but otherwise, it consists of a number of cover versions of some of the popular songs of the time, produced by Bono in Phil Spector style; mostly good but perhaps never really interesting. Best among these I find""500 Miles"", ""Let it Be Me"" and ""Why Do not they Let us Fall in Love"".The two singers quite different voices blend very well together, and the whole thing is performed with a good deal of charm.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZY4NE7OKY97D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000S0Y9JU#wasThisHelpful","RZY4NE7OKY97D","A1XP7P3X9MRE5H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XP7P3X9MRE5H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Keith Allison may be unknown to most people, but besides being a relative to the Crickets drummer Jerry Allison, he played an important part in a great deal of the career of Paul Revere and the Raiders.Allison, like Paul Revere and the Raiders, was among the the artist in the television show, Where the Action is, which ran in the mid-sixties, and he optained some recognition and popularity through this show. He was released one album, ""In Action"" on Columbia Records in 1967, and a handful of singles in the period from 1967 to 1970, all of which should be on this 23 tracks release.Its obvious that Allison had a lot of contact with Paul Revere and the Raiders which is revealed through ""Louise"" and ""Good Thing"", where he allowed to the same backing tracks as this group used their own releases. In addition, you will find the album ""In Action"" the original version of ""Freeborn Man"" which he wrote with Mark Lindsay. Also ""Wednesday Child"" from his last Columbia single was written with Lindsay, who also produced Allison's last three singles. Allison later became a regular member of Paul Revere and the Raiders, and wrote for the group several fine songs. In fact, is his last single very much sounds like this group, and for fans, this CD definitely is very interesting.Allison is a fine musician, and he also shows fine vocals, although he does not quite measure up to Lindsay.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3F4O7J0UPUXI7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00I4F0IZU#wasThisHelpful","R3F4O7J0UPUXI7","A1XP7P3X9MRE5H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XP7P3X9MRE5H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This was the last album released in the name of The Electric Prunes before the reunion several years later. There are no members left from the first two classic albums ""The Electric Prunes"" and ""Underground"" from 1967. The style is also quite different. No more whimsical psychedelic, but more earthy and heavy blues / soul rock - a bit in the style of what Spooky Tooth and similar bands played around 1970.Usually the album is not counted as anything special, and although it maylack truly memorable songs, it is on the other hand quite solid. The strongest track is probably bassist Brett Wade's slightly psychedelic ""Silver Passion Mine"" . The group did have ambitions to break through as a band that could stand on its own feet, which is testified by the fact that all songs are originals written by group members. Unfortunately they lacked the last bit that could separate them from countless similar bands, and the group never managed to repeat the commercial success of the first singles from 1966/67.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3TSXYVU2Y53VW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0030CK46U#wasThisHelpful","R3TSXYVU2Y53VW","A1XP7P3X9MRE5H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XP7P3X9MRE5H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was recommended this album from Neutral Milk Hotel, with the addition that it was to some extent in the same vein as ""Funeral"" by Arcade Fire. I can easily see the similarities, especially in the textual area, as both albums are marked with somewhat sinister, ambiguous and not easily accessible lyrics. I will not go into interpretations of the texts; others have done this quite outstandingly, but concentrate on the music. One reviewer described it as folk-punk, and this designation is really quite apt  for many tracks at least. Some songs are, however, only Jeff Mangum on vocals backed up by his own acoustic guitar. There are on several songs unexpected and unusual horn pieces which make you never really think in terms of folk music.Unlike the aforementioned album by Arcade Fire, this album predominantly a less warm sound, and I have not yet reached the point where I feel that ""In the Aeroplane over the Sea"" can compare with ""Funeral"". It is certainly a very original and evocative album where songs such as ""The King of Carrot Flowers pt. One, """" Two Headed Boy "","" Holland 1945 ""and"" Ghost ""especially strike me.A pity that the group (in reality mostly a Jeff Mangum solo project) was so short-lived - there were no real albums after this.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2IJASBP6PWFWF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FT11IBK#wasThisHelpful","R2IJASBP6PWFWF","A1XP7P3X9MRE5H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XP7P3X9MRE5H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""Through the Morning, Through the Night"" was the second and final album from the Dillard & Clark group. The musicians on the album's are mostly repeats from the first album, but a significant difference is that singer Donna Washburn plays a big part on several songs. She's not a bad singer, who with a little good will might remind you of Emmylou Harris. Anyway, her presence gives the album another character.Another significant difference between the two albums are the relatively few original Clark songs found on ""Through the Morning, Through the Night"". One of the reasons that ""The Fantastic Expedition of Dillard & Clark"" is ususally assessed very highly is not least Clark's fine songwriting.No surprise that is it Clarks songs that primarily lift ""Through the Morning, Through the Night"". The title track is a moving piano ballad sung by Clark supported by Donna Washburn. ""Kansas City Southern"" is a fine melodic country song while ""Polly"" is another nice ballad that could easily lead the mind towards Emmylou Harris and Gram Parsons.Among cover versions, I think especially the Everly Brothers song ""So Sad"" works really well .Some songs are a little ordinary; and changing ""Dont Let Me Down"" into a country song is not really a good idea.The two bonus tracks ""Why Not Your Baby"" and ""Lyin 'Down in the Middle,"" both written by Gene Clark, are on the other hand really great. Isnt there a little bit ""Bittersweet Symphony"" in the end of 'Why Not Your Baby ""?No more albums came from the group after this, but luckily Clark continued to write and record fine music for many years onwards.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3RRM8B2TXIUZN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0000011SW#wasThisHelpful","R3RRM8B2TXIUZN","A1XP7P3X9MRE5H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XP7P3X9MRE5H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Like its predecessor ""Indian Reservation"" The Raiders' last album ""Country Wine"" is a disparate mix of many different genres. Unfortunately, the group chose not to pursue the line that was laid with the excellent 1970 album ""Collage"".On ""Country Wine"" there will probably be some songs appealing to most people, and the group exhibits both ability and versatility. This versatility unfortunately is also a bit of a problem as ""Country Wine"" since never really comes out as an ""album"". It seems more like a scrape together of recordings to supplement the two singles ""Country Wine"" and ""Powder Blue Mercedes Queen"". The two singles in themselves are also extremely different; the former is a highly commercial popsong while ""Powder Blue Mercedes Queen"" is an excellent gutsy rocker, a bit like Bad Company and Free. The number was written by singer Mark Lindsay, and one can only fret about the group not adhered more closely to this style. A little in the same vein is the solid ""Take a Stand"" also written by Lindsay with bassist Keith Allison. Lindsay / Allison are also behind the fine folkish acoustic ""Golden Girls Sometimes"", which is another highlight of the album.The rest is a mixture of soul-pop and pure family pop  unfortunately - solid;  but not really interesting.Lindsay and the group continued to release singles until 1975, of which most(all?) are found as bonus tracks on this version of ""Country Wine"".Like the album, these are also quite different. The best of them are actually really good. ""Song Seller"" is a fine pop-rocker; almost in the group's original 1960s style. B-side ""Simple Song"" written by Lindsay / Andrea is almost as good. Another B-side ""Goodbye No. 9 ""is a nice quiet ballad in the style of John Sebastian.The group had another album ready for release and three tracks from this album are also to be found as bonus tracks. All three point towards a more soul-oriented style, which the group in many previous cases had touched upon. From this ""lost"" album at least four numbers remain to see the light of day.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3OM5WGNCV48ZN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004JWWT5E#wasThisHelpful","R3OM5WGNCV48ZN","A1XP7P3X9MRE5H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XP7P3X9MRE5H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It was initially not a very good idea to release an album of ""modern"" church music in the name of the group ""The Electric Prunes ''; but to release a two was murdering the group, and its reputation as one of the progressive psychedelic bands of the late1960's.The actual group was put out on the sidelines by manager Dave Hassinger and composer David Axelrod. While the first album ""Mass in F Minor"" had its moments, where you could feel a bit to the original group, ""Release of an Oath"" is really a dead duck. Dull and weak compositions arranged with strings which in most cases are outright annoying in their annoying high-pitched sound and unexciting harmonies. The lyrics are, perhaps logically, unattractive, but since they In this case, are in English they easily come out proselytizing and intrusive. The singer is at best best, decent. Bassist and drummer are talented and both do their best to save this hopeless project which really cannot be rescued.Positive with the ultra-short playing-time -  less than 25 minutes  at that time that could make an album.","2.0 out of 5 stars","July 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R19JT6NFYJY3DY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001229088#wasThisHelpful","R19JT6NFYJY3DY","A1XP7P3X9MRE5H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XP7P3X9MRE5H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This first Dillard & Clark album, is a really nice acquaintance, which also deservedly has gained cult status as one the first country / rock albums; somewhat on a par with The Byrds' Sweetheart of the Rodeo ""and the first Flying Burrito Brothers albums. ""The Fantastic joggers of Dillard and Clark"" is, however, probably more conventional sound and arrangement than the other two bands.Former Byrd Gene Clark, appears as the album's big personality, with his fine voice ( that can be reminiscent of  both Roger McGuinn and Michael Stipe ) , and not least as a songwriter on the majority of the tracks.Some of the songs are not surprising related with The Byrds' early folk period and several of them one can easily imagine recorded by them. Not least the fine Clark song ""Out on the Side"" would have fitted well with the Byrds. Dillard & Clark, with such fine names like Bernie Leadon (The Eagles) and Chris Hillman (The Byrds) in the line-up, however, give convincing versions of Clark's songs, which indeed in most cases were written in collaboration with Dillard and Leadon .The album's most well-known song is probably Clark and Leadons ""Train Leaves Here This Morning,"" as The Eagles later recorded with Leadon as a member.This shortlived group was a great acquaintance which in a great way combined folk, country and bluegrass.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2RPL6FY2C6OOK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005FLX39Y#wasThisHelpful","R2RPL6FY2C6OOK","A1XP7P3X9MRE5H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XP7P3X9MRE5H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"""Alias Pink Puzz"" was the second 1969 album from Paul Revere & the Raiders. The line-up for the album was unchanged since the previous,  ""Hard 'n' Heavy"", which was probably the closest they came to releasing a bubble-gum album. A few tracks on ""Alias Pink Puzz"" could also come into this category, but the album is generally stylewise more varied, also perhaps with a slightly harder edge  on some tracks at least.As with the predecessor it contains only new original material, written by Mark Lindsay, five of htem in collaboration with bassist Keith Allison.The most famous song is without a doubt ""Let Me"", which was played quite a lot in the radios and performed well in the singles charts. Interesting to hear the long album version here. Otherwise, a significant song is the fine Simon & Garfunkel-like ""Frankfort Side Street"".As on most Raiders albums there are some nice ballads, of which ""Here Comes the Pain"" and ""I Need You"" are pretty good. Among the more hard-hitting tracks are ""The Original Handy Man"" is fine solid soul-rocker.Like most Raiders albums, this album is very well performed and well produced on the basis of good songs - in many cases even really good songs. Here especially, ""Let Me"", ""Frankfort Side Street"" and ""The Original Handy Man"".Fine bonus tracks can be found on Repertoire version.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R11I8USMBUNFZE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00005QE56#wasThisHelpful","R11I8USMBUNFZE","A1XP7P3X9MRE5H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XP7P3X9MRE5H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""Hard 'n' Heavy"" was Paul Revere & the Raiders' follow-up to the fine album ""Something Happening"" which consisted entirely of original compositions and which was very nicely produced by the group's singer and songwriter Mark Lindsay. Memorable songs on this album were, among others, ""Too Much Talk,"" ""Observations From Flight 285"" and ""Happening 68"".Without quite reaching the high level of its predecessor ""Hard 'n' Heavy"" comes as solid successor. Again the group provides eleven new original songs, where Lindsay as songwriter is getting help from the new Raiders members Keith Allison, Freddy Weller and Joe Correro. Musically, the group has moved towards a lighter the more pop-oriented style, with some elements of bubble-gum  this is, however, presented with both charm and a twinkle in the eye, and since the songs are basically well-written you easily live with this.It is worth noting that the incidentally fine singles ""Mr. Sun, Mr. Moon"" and ""Cinderella Sunshine"" are found here in completely different and longer versions. The same applies to the B-side ""Without You"".Between some tracks there a short sille sketches which might annoy some, but in a way help to create an unpretentious and easy mood.While light pop style characterizes many of the songs, room has also been given for a couple of tracks pointing back towards the group's ""garage"" past; the fine ""Time After Time"" is the most obvious example of this . A little country style song is also to found; ""Hard and Heavy 5 String Soul"".Otherwise, I would highlight the quiet ballad ""Trishalana"" where Lindsay, accompanies the song on the harpsichord.Overall it's a solid album without really weak tracks; on the other hand some would probably argue that it has too few really memorable songs.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R9YN4HXM2Z9RA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000046PUG#wasThisHelpful","R9YN4HXM2Z9RA","A1XP7P3X9MRE5H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XP7P3X9MRE5H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Faithful was Dustys planned third album for Atlantic Records recorded in the first half of 1971. Two singles from the sessions were released, ""I Believe In You"" / ""Someone Who Cares""), and ""Haunted"" / ""Nothing Is Forever"" in the U.S.. Due to poor sales of the singles the album plans were abandoned and Springfield left the label for ABC/Dunhill.The title Faithful comes from one of the greatest tracks one the album, ""I'll Be Faithful"", which would have been a much better choice for a single; the song written by Albright/Sloes/Soles has quite a lot in her classic Son of a Preacher Man.A fire at one of Atlantic's storage sites was thought to have destroyed the 'Faithful' session tapes, but at some point in the nineties the album's producer, Jeff Barry, revealed that he had kept completed stereo mixes of all the tracks. Many of the songs were released as bonus tracks on the Rhino/Atlantic deluxe remastered edition of Dusty in Memphis in 1999, but now Faithful has been released as a proper album.Though the album does not quite compare with her classic Dusty in Memphis it really has some great tracks. Dustys vocals are as always perfect, but some songs are a bit ordinary and forgettable.Besides Ill Be Faithful, the quiet Live Here With You stand out; also a song credited to Michael Soles with Gilbert Slavin, these two were also behind a third highlight; the soul/gospel song I Found my Way Through the Darkness.Charming is the light All the Kings Horses, and the version of Youve Got a Friend is nice, without adding much new to the original Carole King version.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3UY2WFU0VSNGC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TPVW2A6#wasThisHelpful","R3UY2WFU0VSNGC","A1XP7P3X9MRE5H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XP7P3X9MRE5H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"After the rather disappointing album ""Goin to Memphis"" Mark Lindsay and the Raiders returned in the best way with one of their finest albums, ""Something Happening"". Do not be fooled by the unadventurous and cream puff-like cover  this is a great album. Producer Terry Melchior wanted was no longer there and production responsibilities were shifted to Lindsay, who also wrote all the songs on ""Something Happening"".The group had during most of their career had some trouble keeping pace with the rapidly changing trends in those years, and their American Revolutionary War soldier costumes did not help if you wanted to be taken seriously. Now many years later,  these things mean less and one can only note that ""Something Happening"" is a fine album which measures with the best pop-psych from this period. Musically the Monkees from their most psychedelic period including ""Head"" easily come  to mind, but there is also much in common with groups like The Nazz, Amboy Dukes and of course the Beatles.Most songs are catchy without being predictable and boring. The albums opens beautifully with ""Happening Intro / Too Much Talk"". ""Too Much Talk"" was also a single hit for the group, but the version is quite different  a lot of ingenuity and energy has been put into this track. There are lots of phasing and fuzz guitars on tracks like ""Communication"", ""Get Out of My Mind"" and ""Free"". There melodic ballads that would have fitted perfectly to the Monkees' Davy Jones; eg. ""Happens Every Day"" and ""The Good Times"". Donovan hippie style can be heard on the light ""Love Makes the World Go Round"" while ""Burn Like a Candle"" lyrically belongs in the more serious end.Very evocative is the quiet ""Observations From Flight 285"".The three singles ""Too Much Talk,"" ""Dont Take it so Hard"" and ""Happening 68"" are all strong and actually quite different. The former is a distinctly psychedlia number, ""Dont Take it so Hard"" is catchy pop, while ""Happening 68"" is irresistible pop-soul.All in all, a very well produced album full of fine songs where Lindsay got a very good opportunity to show his versatility as a singer and a songwriter.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2O9KG9KPO7A4X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00005QE55#wasThisHelpful","R2O9KG9KPO7A4X","A1XP7P3X9MRE5H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XP7P3X9MRE5H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Arcade Fire's first album is an exciting, but also a bit dark, concept album about loss and growing up. Musically it is based in many genres, with clear roots in both classical music and rock music as it was played by bands like the Velvet Underground and Talking Heads.Although the songs are thematically tied together, most of the mare so strong that they can easily stand alone. It is not an album that necessarily graps you at first listen, but you wont be in doubt that you are dealing with something special. It is an album that can withstand repeated listening, and personal favorites may easily change over time.I am very excited for the subdued and melodic ""Une Anee sans lumiere"" and ""7 Kettles"". Among the more upbeat tracks, I believe ""Tunnels"" and ""Rebellion"" stand out.The instrumentation is very varied and exciting with various strings and wind instruments all on a solid base of rock. On the vocal side, the group is perhaps a little limited; especially the female vocals may seem a little thin.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R26UNDY518UQ10/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0002IVN9W#wasThisHelpful","R26UNDY518UQ10","A1XP7P3X9MRE5H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XP7P3X9MRE5H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Goin' to Memphis is in reality very much a Mark Lindsay solo album. Lindsay wrote half of the songs on the album, which was recorded in Memphis with a group of Memphis studio musicians and Chips Moman as the producer. Only one song, the single Peace of Mind, features the Raiders and producer Terry Melchior. Musically its an album where Lindsay explores his abilities as a soul singer, but even though he does have a strong soulful voice and the musicians are extremely professional, the whole thing never really manages to excite. Lindsay does not really add anything new to the cover versions, and his own songs more or less sound like something youve heard before  maybe the one good exception the Raiders song Peace of Mind.Its not really a bad album, but for a Paul Revere & the Raiders album it is rather disappointing.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1P35DBD4GH5ZN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HAPS1GS#wasThisHelpful","R1P35DBD4GH5ZN","A1XP7P3X9MRE5H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XP7P3X9MRE5H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""Everything Must Go"" was the first album by Manic Street Preachers after lyricist and guitarist Richey's Edwards' mysterious disappearance in February 1995.Stylistically, the group has moved in a direction of the more polished, with string arrangements on several songs and the group in general seems more than before influenced by the Brit-pop wave. The music is still strongly marked by distorted guitars, which stand as an exciting contrast to the mostly melodic songs.The album is often reckoned as one of the group's best and the album is characterized by solid and dedicated songwriting which lyrically touch upon both political and personal themes. The group shows willingness and strength to move on after the loss of the distinctive personality Edwards who, however, actually contributes by having written lyrics to five of the album's best songs such as KevinCarter, ""Small Black Flowers That Grow in the Sky"", The Girl Who Wanted to Be God"" and ""Removables""Other songs I wish to highlight are the three catchy hit singles ""A Design for Life,"" ""Everything Must Go"" and ""Australia"" also the somewhat heavy closing track ""No Surface All Feeling,"" which features guitar work from Edwards.

"This beautiful Raven Records release contains five of the best albums from Paul Revere & the Raiders. The sound is really great and the fine productions especially the last three albums really come to their right.The group had in its heyday an image that was often often a bit problematic, as they (especially Mark Lindsay) had the ambition to be taken seriously as creative artists. Producer Terry Melchior was the man who helped stimulating and realizing these ambitions.There is a clear development to discover from ""Here We Come"" from 1965 to the highly ambitious ""Revolution"" of 1967. All five albums are in their own ways worthwhile, with the first two perhaps belong most to the category og garage rock and the three following could rasther be called psych rock. The melodic catchy element is consistent on all five albums.There are fine notes with background information on the group written by Ian McFarlane on the 12 page booklet. No bonus tracks are included for any of the five albums, so if you want interesting non-album releases, too, I can recommend the 3 CDs set ""The Complete Columbia Singles""","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R379QPYTFPSIOV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00B1MSIFU#wasThisHelpful","R379QPYTFPSIOV","A1XP7P3X9MRE5H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XP7P3X9MRE5H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This 1966 album was Paul Revere and the Raiders 4th album with Terry Melchior as the producer.In the recording-studio the group's music was increasingly the result of Mark Lindsay and Terry's Melchior's creative ambitions. Logically a lot of attention was on what was happening around in this exciting period of rock music history; especially what came from pioneers like The Beatles, The Beach Boys and the Byrds. This is very obvious on this album, where most tracks are characterized by a great care spent on both arrangements and production.Aside from the hit single ""Hungry,"" a Mann/Weil song, and the fine ""Louise"" written by Jesse Kincaid, are the songs are original Raiders compositions, with Mark Lindsay as the most prolific contributor.The biggest hit on the album was the rocking but also vocally polished ""Good Thing"" written by Lindsay and Melchior. Great  Beach Boys vocals on this altogether very interesting and varied rock composition.The album's third and smallest hit was the Stones inspired ""The Great Airplane Strike"" credited Lindsay/Melchior/Revere  has a great deal in common with The Stones  The Under Assistant West Coast Promotion ManGreatest ambitions might have been loaded into the album's ballads which contain Eleanor Rigby strings arrangements, nice acoustic guitars and great vocals. Some may feel that lyrically some of these may not quite live up to the music.Group members Philip Volk and Michael Smith each contribute a nice number. Volk's melodic ""Why, Why, Why"" is characterized by great guitar and fine vocal harmonies, while Smiths ""Our Candidate"", could be considered a garage classic, recorded by The Standells among others.Only major objection to this fine album is its short playing time - many albums at this time played under 30 minutes. Fortunately, there are versions where ""Spirit of 67"" is expanded with good bonus tracks; also the album can be found on the Raven release ""Evolution two Revolution"" where ""Spirit of 67"" is joined four other fine Raiders albums.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2IH37YYLV1I60/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000003GZJ#wasThisHelpful","R2IH37YYLV1I60","A1XP7P3X9MRE5H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XP7P3X9MRE5H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Charlotte Gainsbourg has a somewhat thin voice that may remind you of more well-known singers such as Suzanna Vega, Dido or Francoise Hardy. Though her voice may not be that strong, there is something very captivating and relevant over it, and her way of conveying the songs is quite convincing. Musically, she draws a great deal on the avangarde tradition which artists like Nico, Eno and others began in the 1960-70s, but there is, of course, also kinship with her famous father Serge Gainsbourg.This CD release consists of two parts; a studio part with outtakes; preferably from the ""IRM"" sessions and a live branch, where she with a great band deliveres a fine and intense eleven tracks set.The first four studio tracks are written by Beck, and their techno / avant-garde style never really captivate me. The duet with Charlie Fink ""Got to Let Go"" is on the other hand very nice and  catchy, and the two quiet songs ""Out of Touch"" and ""Memoir"" are also great tracks.On the live part the songs are selected from Gainsbourgs two fine albums ""5:55"" and ""IRM"". On the former, Jarvis Cocker was frequent contributor as a songwriter and most of these are really great; especially ""Jamais"", ""AF607105"", ""The Operation"" and of course the very catchy ""The Songs that we Sing"" are favorites. From this album comes also Dylan's ""Just Like a Woman"", which Gainsbourg gives a fine and personal interpretation.Beck's songs from ""IRM"" are generally less melodic but of course fine; My favorite among these is ""Heaven Can Wait""No question that Charlotte Gainsbourg with this set comes out a fine and original performer","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RT8RTZ05YSGZS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005ZXBAPQ#wasThisHelpful","RT8RTZ05YSGZS","A1XP7P3X9MRE5H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XP7P3X9MRE5H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Two original Sam Cooke albums plus 16 bonus tracks on one release cannot be a bad purchase. Especially the predominantly great bonus tracks are very enjoyable. They include many of Cooke's largest single-hits such as ""Wonderful World,"" ""Chain Gang,"" ""Sad Mood,"" ""Bring It On Home to Me"" and ""Nothing Can Change This Love"" - the last three numbers songs that contributed to establishing Cooke's reputation as the creator of soul music.""Twisting the Night Away"" is among his best albums, with several original Cooke songs, with favourites like Twisting in the Kitchen, Whole Lotta Woman and Somebodys Gonna Miss Me.The 1962 album ""My Kind of Blues"" contains exclusively cover versions of other people's songs, most of them pompously overproduced and really an album with few memorable recordings. Unfortunately the packaging of this release is quite cheap, with only little information on Cooke and individual songs.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1SFMGQ5FZGXSK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OU39CQG#wasThisHelpful","R1SFMGQ5FZGXSK","A1XP7P3X9MRE5H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XP7P3X9MRE5H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Nenas 1992 album Bongo Girl has its moments, but compared to most of her other releases it is quite disappointing. Several songs are pretty banal and predictable, while others are directly weak or tiresome. This applies, for example the Afrikans inspired tracks ""Conversation"" and ""Bongo Girl"". Some of the more rocking numbers suffer a bit from too much hero-guitar and the production is generally not on par with most other Nena albums.Fortunately, there are a handful of numbers which , after all, save the album. ""Ohne Ende"" is a beautiful ballad that also offers fine Hammond organ playing. ""Was dann"" is a smooth and catchy rocker. ""Mach dir keine Sorgen"" has a fine intro and some nice mandolin playing. The quiet Keine Lgen mehr "" is also among the best numbers.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R35RBLSUC12LG4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00000B976#wasThisHelpful","R35RBLSUC12LG4","A1XP7P3X9MRE5H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XP7P3X9MRE5H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Patti Smith's debut album has long since achieved both cult and classic status. With its release late 1975, the album came out briefly for punk-wave broke through and thus radically changed the music scene. The cult status of the album may to some extent be seen on that background, as a pre-punk release. Had it been released two years later it had hardly received the same attention. It has been some years since I last listened regularly to ""Horses"" and I must admit that for me part of the magic has evaporate.""Gloria"" is obviously still magical  not least the haunting intro line, ""Jesus died for somebody's sins but not mine."" Also the long build-up to the redemptive six letters GLORIA has retained its tension.Some of the other songs are still good, while others probably somewhat have been overtaken by time. The good songs are for me the reggae-like ""Redondo Beach"", ""Break It Up"" (great chorus) and to some extent ""Kimberley"".The bonus song ""My Generation"" is actually somewhat annoying, and does not contribute positively to the whole.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R13H9IDGGWMGNQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000002VQQ#wasThisHelpful","R13H9IDGGWMGNQ","A1XP7P3X9MRE5H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XP7P3X9MRE5H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Sam Cooke perhaps never released the perfect studio album, but he did release some very good ones  - and unfortunately also a couple very disappointings ones, too. Twisting the Night Away certainly belongs to the first category. Not least because Cooke as a songwriter, unlike on several of his other albums, here plays a major role. Although the theme of ""Twist"" is repeated in many of the songs this really doesnt play any major role for the music asthe twist was merely a particular way of dancing. Cooke gives these pop tunes a fine touch of soul which has made the viable. The title track, ""Twistin 'in the Kitchen with Dinah"" and ""Whole Lotta Woman"" are obvious candidates for an ""Ultimate Sam Cooke Collection"", while ""Sugar Dumpling"", ""Soothe Me"" and ""Somebody Have Mercy"" are winners in the long run - the latter may remind you of his more famous ""Sad Mood"", which on certain releases of this album can be found as a bonus track.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R32RKBQCF3ILC6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00E2276EA#wasThisHelpful","R32RKBQCF3ILC6","A1XP7P3X9MRE5H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XP7P3X9MRE5H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This 2 CD release is somewhat of a come-back for Nena and her band. Though she has never really been away for a longer period and that there several worth-while tracks on all her albums, there was a kind of renewed energy on her anniversary album from 2002, Nena Featuring Nena, which contained some really great re-recordings of some of her best early songs.This energy continues on this CD and the good thing is that this time there is a bunch of new really great songs.The single Liebe ist was a deserved big hit for her, but songs like Und jetzt steh ich hier und warte, Immer Weiter and Ohne Liebe bin ich nichts are classic Nena style in the very best sense  produced by Uwe Fahrenkrog-Petersen who is the co-writer with Nena on most tracks on CD one (red), which is a regular studio album; CD 2 (orange) are looser jam recordings, but they are in no way sloppy.I like Nena best when shes doing her classical pop/ rock style, but must admit that some of the more disco/techno tracks like Willst du mit mir gehn, Lass mich and Vitamine are also quite good.It takes some time to really get into the orange CD, and some tracks are perhaps a bit too long; I guess that is really a question of temperament and taste.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3QXV9R905T7HA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0007UPSXC#wasThisHelpful","R3QXV9R905T7HA","A1XP7P3X9MRE5H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XP7P3X9MRE5H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This comprehensive and Seekers box contains virtually complete released recordings done by the during 1964-1968.In addition to the original Seekers releases the box contains four 1967 Judith Durham solo tracks and a previously unreleased outtake from ""Seekers Seen in Green"".Some of the recordings may today might seem a bit aged; especially the early recordings, which were primarily traditional folk/country songs. The groups original material preferably written by guitarist Bruce Woodley and producer Tom Springfield is still, however, a real pleasure to listen to. Everything is remastered and sounds really good.The packaging,unfortunately, leaves a lot to be desired. The accompanying booklet is in just eight pages, and the information about the individual songs is printed in very small typing that even using a magnifying glass leaves it difficult to get an overview of where the individual recordings come from and who wrote them.

"Sam Cookes 1961 album My Kind of Blues sounds to me more like a jazz record than a blues album. I would have preferred to hear Cooke give stripped down blues versions of these songs instead of these Las Vegas big band versions which in some cases start of off quite nicely but end up burying Cookess great vocals with way too much brass.None of the songs are Cooke originals, but pop/jazz standards of which some could have been quite good, while others are really forgettable.

"This 1965 album, I believe, was the fourth studioalbum from the Seekers and the first on which contemporary songs played played the major role on the tracklist. Guitarist in the group, Bruce Woodley, would for the nexts albums contribute some of the really great Seekers originals, and here he is the man behind the fine songs Two Summers and Dont Tell Me Mind, both written in the typical Seekers folk-style.Highlight on the album is producer and songwriter Tom Springfields title track, which was also a big hit for the group. Another big favourite is the version of Jo Staffords hits from the 1950s Allentown Jail.There are two Bob Dylan cover versions, Dont Think Twice and The Times are aChangin  both quite nice but not significant.Like with their early albums there are traditionals like The Leaving og Liverpool and more recent folk/country songs by writers like Woody Guthrie and Bob Gibson. So to sum it up, this album could be described as transitional  between the early traditional Seekers and the more modern Seekers, focusing  more on contemporary and commercial songs, and here I clearly would argue that in the latter category is their most successful.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1HTA3HQEQ0130/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00130MMWA#wasThisHelpful","R1HTA3HQEQ0130","A1XP7P3X9MRE5H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XP7P3X9MRE5H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"""Stranded"" was Roxy Music's first album without Brian Eno; one of music history's great and original personalities. Reportedly it did not work very well with both Eno and Bryan Ferry in the group, so Eno started instead his long and multifaced solo career.It is often stated that the loss of Eno clearly can be heard on ""Stranded"" and that the group has become significantly more commercial; I really dont think this is the case.""Street Life"" was the big single on the album - a great rock song that may well lead thoughts toward Britpop and Blur.""Serenade"" is a song more or less in the same genre, and a song that could easily have worked as a second single.The album has a nice pair of slightly quirky ballads, where especially ""Just Like You"" is a favorite. Also ""Mother of Pearl"" with its two very different beats is among my favorites.""Amazona"" which Ferry wrote with guitarist Phil Manzanera has a great guitar riff; the track develops at a rather skewed direction before it returns to the starting point again - thankfully.Some tracks may well be felt a little long; could be the case for e.g. ""Psalm"" and ""Sunset"" - perhaps also to some degree ""A Song for Europe"".","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R33OTR4Y5KT1RU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0000256KM#wasThisHelpful","R33OTR4Y5KT1RU","A1XP7P3X9MRE5H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XP7P3X9MRE5H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Come the Day from 1966 was the Seekers first album to contain only contemporary songs; no traditional folk or country songs this time.Only one official single was taken from the album, the Georgy Girl which was actually the title song to a movie featuring Lynn Redgrave. The song written by producer Tom Springfield and Jim Dale became one of the groups biggest world-wide hits.The album has a handful of coverversions of contemporary hits such as Yesterday (Beatles), All Over the World (Francoise Hardy), California Dreamin (The Mamas & the Papas), Turn, Turn, Turn (The Byrds), The Last Thing on my Mind, (Tom Paxton  not really a hit) and Red Rubber Ball (The Cyrkle). The last one was written by Seekers member Bruce Woodley in collaboration with Paul Simon. Most of these covers are pretty unncessary/uinteresting   Except, of course, ""Red Rubber Ball"" which the group with good right good can call their ownThe highlights of the album is precisely the group's original songs; both those written by guitarist Bruce Woodley ( Come the Day, I Wish You Could Be Here and Red Rubber Ball ) and the two from producer Tom Springfield (Islands of Dreams and Georgy Girl )  Logically Woodley contributed even more to the following album Seekers Seen in GreenFor the album the group recorded Bob Gibsons Well, Well, Well in a fine and much better version than the one they included on their 1964 album Hide and Seekers.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2JXZWSHBOQT9X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00130O5QQ#wasThisHelpful","R2JXZWSHBOQT9X","A1XP7P3X9MRE5H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XP7P3X9MRE5H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Roxy Music's debut album from 1972 is a highly original release giving the world a kind music that was never really heard before at that time. The band mixed basic rock'n roll with avantgarde with Andrew Mackay's personal saxophone and oboe playing which often goes beyond traditional harmony rules. Also Ferry's unsual way singing was of a kind that made people stop and listen.Now after so many years, is there still life and qualities to enjoy the songs. Of course, the answer must be yes, although individual songs today may appear more interesting than really good.For me, the single ""Virginia Plain"" is the standout, but also ""Would You Believe"", which at once is both a ballad and a rocker is a song that sticks with you. Other favorites are the almost country ""If there is Something"" with its fine horn sequence and the melodic ""2HB""; both gems in Roxy Music catalog.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2HP59HIQI4HT0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0000256KG#wasThisHelpful","R2HP59HIQI4HT0","A1XP7P3X9MRE5H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XP7P3X9MRE5H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Midnight Oil wrote and recorded in their heyday during late eighties and early 1990s on albums such as ""Blue Sky Mining"" and ""Earth and Sun and Moon"" many beautiful and catchy songs. However, there has always been elements of ugliness in the bands way of expression, especially characterized by frontman Peter Garrett's vocals that often stood in stark contrast to the harmonious and catchy choruses. This, of course, is naturally linked to the group's lyrics which often have much to say in terms of political and critical messages.Not least on ""Redneck Wonderland"", the group has a lot in mind and the ugliness may be more apparent than before. This does not mean that the final result is bad, just dont expect an easy listening album. Many fans actually saw the album as a step back on track after its predecessor ""Breathe"", which many felt lacked inspiration and did not live up to group's usual standards. Personally, I think, however, that ""Breathe"" has a fine and worthy place in Midnight Oil catalog, and I will also rate it higher than ""Redneck Wonderland"".""Redneck Wonderland"" certainly has  fine songs, and you definitely can not talk about lack of inspiration and enthusiasm, as on most tracks fired vigor on both guitar and vocals.Although the group is experimenting with new and differents kinds expression, you are never in doubt that you are in the company of Midnight Oil, and some songs could easily have been taken from one of group better known albums.

"""Wenn alles richtig ist, dann stimmt was nich""  from 1998 does not contain any of Nena's big hits and the album is hardly well-known outside her native Germany. Nena could with some justification be called Germany's bid for a Sheryl Crow, and several of the best songs are arranged in the best Sheryl Crow style. Especially the catchy ""Was hast du in meinem Traum gemacht?"" and the rocker ""Das ist Normal"" could easily go for Crow songs, if it had not been for the German language.There are several other fine ballad-like songs like ""When fiel mir auf"" which has bite in both lyrics and tune. Also the song ""Meine kleine rock Welt"" stands out positively by having a very sweet choruses and quite trippy verse.The final track ""Heil dich bei mir aus"" is a great finale with acoustic guitar and delicate vocal harmony.The pop-rocker ""Es muss raus"" is also fine, while a handful of songs do not quite keep level; especially a couple of the rockers.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1UFYPEFUI64LQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000024A3Q#wasThisHelpful","R1UFYPEFUI64LQ","A1XP7P3X9MRE5H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XP7P3X9MRE5H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""Seekers Seen in Green"" from 1967 was the group's last studio album before the group disbanded, in part because lead singer Judith Durham at this time was beginning to feel locked in with the group's image as a nice folk-pop group who just desired to please and entertain. Actually, it was a big shame that this happened, since the group was experiencing musical development, and was increasingly beginning to record their own original songs.Thus, no fless than nine of the twelve songs were written or co-written by one of the group members. Guitarist Bruce Woodley ecomes out as the most prolific, and he proves, as he had previously done, ato be a very good songwriter. ""Rattler"", which has since been recorded by several other artists  including Herman's Hermits, Lulu and Cliff Richard is one fine example. It is also Bruce himself who takes care of the lead vocal on this track. Interesting too, that Woodley was a good friend of Paul Simon and that they wrote songs together. Best known among these is probably ""Red Rubber Ball"" from the previous album ""Come the Day"". On this album is ""Cloudy"" an example of their cooperation. For this album the group have also recorded a fine version of Paul Simon's ""Feeling Groovy"".The other guitarist Keith Potger wrote the upbeat optimistic ""All I Can Remember"", while Judith Durham's is a co-writer on ""Cant Make Up My Mind"" and ""Colours of My Life"", which both are fine songs.Tom Springfield, who is a brother of Dusty Springfield, who wrote some of the group's greatest hits such as ""I'll Never Find Another You"", ""The Carnival is Over"" and ""A World of Our Own"", contributes with a new fine number, ""Island of Dreams""In fact, this album is pretty rock solid and only the somewhat pretentious ""If You Go Away"" written by Jacques Brel seems unnecessary clumsy. Overall, I would rate it as the group's most solid and consistent.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R27UR98UCY3Q15/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002JMTAEY#wasThisHelpful","R27UR98UCY3Q15","A1XP7P3X9MRE5H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XP7P3X9MRE5H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"""Before and After Science"" is the last of the quartet of vocal albums recorded and released by Eno in the 1970s. Since this album has Eno mainly dealt with the instrumental music mainly in the genre of ambient music.""Before and After Science"" points, as its predecessor ""Another Green World"" both toward Eno's later career and back towards the more basic rock; However, with great desire to explore and push the limits.In a way, the album feels semi-detached with a first half with strong roots in classic rock (e.g. Roxy Music), and the second half more subdued, often with similarities to Pink Floyd.From the first part both ""Backwater"", which reminds me a lot about John Cales way of handling rock, and the almost punk ""King's Lead Hat"" are clear favorites.""Here He Comes"" is one of the nicest pop / rock songs Eno has ever released, and in that way a pretty unusual Eno song.

"Eno's debut solo album from January 1974 is one of the truly original albums in rock history. The music can be very difficult to label, and some may argue that it is not really rock. The music is at once marked by melody, different instrumentation, harmony and dissonance. Enos lyrics are often both mysterious and thoughtful. Whatever label you might want to put on the music, there should probably be no doubt that this album is the one which comes closest to the style Eno helped create on the first two Roxy Music albums and in fact it is perhaps also the most easily accessible.  At any rate it contains a wealth of fine numbers which have shown strong durability.If I was to compile a 80 minutes Best of Eno"" exclusively from his vocal albums, there is no doubt that ""Here Come the Warm Jets"", will be strongly represented; in the close competition with the sequel ""Taking Tiger Mountain""""Needles in the Camel's Eye"" is almost pre-punk, a little in the style of David Bowie's ""Heroes"" - an obvious choice for a ""best of"". The same applies to the second track ""The Paw Paw Negro Blowtorch"" which is rock, very much as Roxy Music style. ""Baby's on Fire"" is a bit weird and crass, and a track I would probably choose to omit. In turn, the Lou Reed-like ""Cindy Tells Me"" is a completely obvious choice.""Driving Me Backwards"", with its very strange noises and loose structure, sounds like something from a soundtrack - too weird for a ""best of"". There seems to be a bit of Phil Spector inpiration on ""On Some Faraway Beach"", which has a very long instrumental intro, but which, eventually turns into being a vocal track; and a very fine one, too. ""Blank Frank"", written in collaboration with Robert Fripp again is highly experimental and over in the crass department. Experimental may also be called ""Dead Finks Do not Talk""; this track, though, has also both charm and melody, and is thus an entirely obvious song for a selection for my best of Eno.Melodic is also ""Some of Them are Old"" which has a somewhat strange interlude, but otherwise is a relative classic pop / rock composition. The title track is a punk instrumental has something alluring about it and the number may easily with your mind.If I were to compare Eno with other originals in rock during this period names that come to mind are Syd Barrett and Alex Chilton, and fans of these other great artists, I would think are likely to fall for this exciting album.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3G67OR6US5GBU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00022M518#wasThisHelpful","R3G67OR6US5GBU","A1XP7P3X9MRE5H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XP7P3X9MRE5H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Nena's 1983 debut album is probably mainly known for contain her big breakthrough single ""99 Luftballons"". However, this milestone is far from the only significant number from this, as a whole, very solid debut album.Longtime concert favorites as ""Nur getrumt"", ""Volmond"" and ""Leuchtturm"" are other strong songs that have shown durability and which are titles Nena later chose to re-record in new exciting versions.Among the lesser-known track the opening track ""Kino"" is also worth noting.Nena, who over time has evolved to become a very competent songwriter, are here credited for the lyrics of ""Nur getrumt"" and ""Leuchtturm""; latter also as a composer.A very fine debut album, which has a versatility and freshness that keeps it worth listening to still after more than 30 years.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1WNBLQBNXRI8Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000024C92#wasThisHelpful","R1WNBLQBNXRI8Y","A1XP7P3X9MRE5H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XP7P3X9MRE5H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This CD compiles some of the best and most famous tracks from Nena's first four albums, released during 1983-86. The last handful of tracks on the CD are live recordings also dating from the 1980s, and CD overall gives a very good impression of Nena and her bands great versatility and fine songwriting.Nena chose in 2002 to re-record a large portion of these songs for the album ""Nena Featuring Nena"", and with all due respect to these charming originals, Nena actually succeeded in to lift these fine songs to new and different levels.A big shame that Nena is not more known outside her homeland, Germany, for she has throughout her long career  proven her great talent as a songwriter, and her vocals are both charming and strong - can sometimes actually sound a little like Sheryl Crow.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2HT23WSOUIH3X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00429DET4#wasThisHelpful","R2HT23WSOUIH3X","A1XP7P3X9MRE5H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XP7P3X9MRE5H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have long been waiting for news from Moi Caprice, whose last regular album ""We Had Faces Then"" was released back in 2008. Now, lead singer and songwriter Michael Moeller has formed a new group, The Mountains "", with the brothers Frederik and Fridolin Nordsoe . Whether Moi Caprice has split up or if the group is just pausing is unclear at time of writing.There is no doubt that Michael Moeller new band-mates are excellent musicians, who also have a penchant for grandiose but also somewhat sterile sound and production. For me, this is my major issue with The Mountains.The album opens with the great title song ""The Mountains"", which is a great composition and the production actually works with the song. The second number is probably the closest you get to something that really lsounds like Moi Caprice, and ""They're Too Many"" is obviously another favorite on the album.A string of nice sounding but also fairly anonymous tracks follow, and I find it difficult to maintain interest in the music. It lacks the charm and spontaneity that characterized most of Moi Caprice's numbers.""The Valleys"", ""Can We Make IT Work"" and ""The Lakes"" are good numbers in their own rights, but it does not change the overall feel of a sterile and somewhat toothless album; unfortunately.","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R291M06IB2Z2QH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MTJTJ2K#wasThisHelpful","R291M06IB2Z2QH","A1XP7P3X9MRE5H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XP7P3X9MRE5H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Usually it does not stir particularly interest when an artist chooses to re-record his/her best and most famous songs. Often the result is a bit flat and disappointing.  This is not the outcome in Nenas case; on the contrary.Nena has chosen to give twelve of her best songs a new interpretation; most of them from the early years of Nena Band. Many of the songs have got a very different approach, and in most cases actually a change for the better, which in itself is an achievement, as the original versions were really good. When this is possible it is due to the course that Nenas songs actually have more qualities that many pop songs havent.In short, this is an album with no weak points. I shall venture, though,  to give individual tracks a few words to. The major breakthrough ""99 Luftballons"" has been slowed down a bit in pace and has got a little heavier treatment. It works incredibly well - a completely different number.""Anyplace, Anywhere, Anytime"" is a duet with Kim Wilde - great energy at this rousing number. The two girls give it all in a mixture of English and German. The number is in reality the same as ""Irgendwie, irgendwo, Irgendwann"".""Nur getrumt"" also has become heavier - almost  punk. Again rousing energy.The same applies to ""Leuchtturm"" comes out with new strenght both in arrangement and not least in Nenas vocals. ""Fragezeichen"" was originally my favorite Nena single and the original is not easy to beat - this new version comes really close, though.Nena's perhaps strongest song ""Wunder Geschehen"" from her first solo album, is here to find in two duet versions. Both very fine, emphasizing what a great song it is. Nenas original from 1989 is still the ultimate version.Also the moving ballad ""Jetzt bist weg"" has become a duet; here with Udo Lindenberg. A number that has the qualities to become a classic.""Lass Mich Dein Pirat"" is arranged with acoustic guitar and orchestra. A fine song which does not exceed the original.""Es Regnet"" is a little melodic slow number. Very fine also something unusual arrangement that clearly surpasses the original version.""Lichtarbeiter"" is a little different choice to re-record as the number actually comes from the previous album ""Chokmah"". Does not really remind me of anything I have heard before from Nena.""Vollmond"" has got a quiet and slightly jazzy treatment in this new version, which is generally not as markedly different. ""Ich Bleib Immer Noch an Dir"" has a completely different beat, but is not so far from the original either.A great release that deservedly gave Nena a comeback.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R18AGQIPI8PSP1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00008CR1S#wasThisHelpful","R18AGQIPI8PSP1","A1XP7P3X9MRE5H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XP7P3X9MRE5H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I believe that ""Accelerate"" from 2008 must be the most punk album REM ever released. From start to finish the band is blazing through eleven tracks that, with few exceptions, are characterized by energy, lyrics with something to say and distorted guitars. Despite the hard-hitting expression that characterizes most songs, with REM there is almost always, both sensitivity and a good dose of melodic approach.I do not regard this of one of their best, but certainly one of the most energetic albums. Among the few less hard-hitting songs you will find the almost folky ""Houston"", which at once is typical of the group and atypical of the album. The song is one of my favorites. Less significant, but also in the subdued end, you will find ""Until the Day I Die"", which is also a fine song.Among the hard-hitting tracks ""Mr. Richards "", stands out, having most of the group's great qualities. Also ""Supernatural Superserious"" is a number to remember and one youre likely to want to return to.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R7DHX4GDOK72Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0013BNY2Q#wasThisHelpful","R7DHX4GDOK72Y","A1XP7P3X9MRE5H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XP7P3X9MRE5H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Nena's 1989 album ""Wunder Gescheh'n"" is possibly her most perfect album release seen as a whole; especially perhaps because of the exceptionally beautiful title track, which she remade several times since. This original version, however is for me the ultimate version; even if some might think it a little too much 80s sound to it.80s sound characterizes in general most of the album, but in most cases, in a good way.""You Bist berall"" is a more traditional popballad, but still fine song. ""Hero"" is, like the title track, a very personal song that goes straight to the heart of the listener; the only English-language song on the album, by the way.""Schlaflied"" is a little short lullaby - a bit anonymous.""Weisses Schiff"" is another highlight; a very nice melody with lyrics almost written in a narrative folk song style.""Im Rausch There Liebe"" is a very typical 80s pop song; not bad but perhaps a little too typical of the time.""La vie c'est la chance"" is an unexpected song in French; nice low-key arrangement of the fine tune convincingly performed by Nena.On ""Keine langeweile"" we are back in the classic Nena band upbeat style. A real good-mood number that may make feel like both singing and dancing. ""Steht auf"" is a bit of the same genre, yet without having its predecessor's charm.On the final track ""Abschied"" Nena flirt a bit with the jazzy; the track I could best do without. Nevertheless an incredibly strong and consistent album, which deserved greater recognition; especially qua the title track ""Wunder Gescheh'n"" which has obvious evergreen qualities.It should also be mentioned that Nena on this album stands out as a highly competent songwriter, with her credits on all songs except ""Weisses Schiff"" which was written by Thommie Bayer.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R5SKIR0VGNZBI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00000DB3M#wasThisHelpful","R5SKIR0VGNZBI","A1XP7P3X9MRE5H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XP7P3X9MRE5H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""Taking Tiger Mountain"" from 1974 was Eno's second solo album and in my, not too extensive, knowledge of his albums I believe it to be one is one of his most easily accessible.One senses in glimpses a legacy of Roxy Music; especially in the songs ""Mother Whale Eyeless"" and ""The True Wheel"", which both are rocking greatly. Completely streamlined, however, none of the songs come out, and though many are actually quite catchy, they have, to various degrees edges in the form of quirky harmonies, different instrumentation and , of course, Enos very special lyrics, which at times can be quite difficult to interpret.Besides the two mentioned ""rockers"", the opening track ""Burning Airlines Give You so Much More"", which has a slightly psychedelic feel and is both catchy and exciting.Eno mixes several different genres, and on ""Put a Straw Under Baby"" he comes close to a children's song; a track I think Nico also successfully could have recorded. A couple tracks are probably a bit too weird and edgy for my taste, but as a whole the album stands strong and consistent.A fine finale with the quite grandiose title song ""Taking Tiger Mountain""","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1YYNG4CF6O6N6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00015TOCY#wasThisHelpful","R1YYNG4CF6O6N6","A1XP7P3X9MRE5H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XP7P3X9MRE5H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have to admit that my interest in Eno applies primarily to his vocal recordings. Of course, much of his instrumental music is both innovative and exciting, it just only hits me to a minor degree. The vast majority of Eno albums are instrumental, and thus actually only five or six albums are within my field of interest.""Another Green World"" from 1975 was Enos third solo album and also one of his most acclaimed releases. He is among others supported by prominent names like John Cale, Robert Fripp, Phil Collins and bassist Percy James from The Soft Machine.It is understandable that Eno originally created attention with his unorthodox songwriting, his strange harmonies and weird sound effects. Only five of the tracks are vocal, and apart from the very harsh opening number ""Sky Saw"" it may be no surprise that these are my favorites.""St Elmo's Fire"" is a funny number with Eno's charming Syd Barrett-like vocals and Robert Fripp on  a guitar which recall the sound of Queens Brian May.""I'll Come Running"" is by far the most catchy number, and probably some of the closest Eno is coming to pop. Very charming and a song that also would have been a perfect fit for Nico. ""Golden Hours"" is another number where you can easily come to think of Syd Barrett - a fine and also a bit mysterious number. The same applies to ""Everything Merges with the Sun"", which again through Eno's vocals is one of the album's highlights.The rest of the album is, as mentioned, instrumental and in varying degrees reminiscent of sound backdrops. For me the most interesting is ""Becalmed"" with its mournful strings.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3U3WGR42HIWR0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00022M51I#wasThisHelpful","R3U3WGR42HIWR0","A1XP7P3X9MRE5H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XP7P3X9MRE5H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
