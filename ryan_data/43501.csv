"If you're looking for an extremely abstract film that doesn't express itself with direct human interaction but the perception of it and many dream like connections that flow into one another in mysterious ways that don't make much sense unless (or if) you decide to watch it again, then this may be the movie for you to watch. Think of The Machinist, only a lot harder to follow.The story is very tough to follow because we don't really have a protagonist to connect with since we know so little about them to begin with. The movie doesn't care to let us know enough since hardly anyone speaks in the movie. Gosling's role is bare bones. He is great in Drive (also from this director), but here he's given almost nothing to work with as his scenes are just flashes of him frozen in thought, but almost no action afterwards.It shows him with clenched fists for a minute with explanation, then cuts to a scene with a brutal police boss attack criminals.Very strange film. At the end, I could see the point, but only after listening to the commentary. Too abstract for the storytelling and entertainment I was looking for. Abstract, dreamlike and a very experimental film... Not for me anyway.","2.0 out of 5 stars","August 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RKO4727EH07VH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00E1LO5J6#wasThisHelpful","RKO4727EH07VH","A2JFKSHR0WQB8C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2JFKSHR0WQB8C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Ant-Man is not your typical hero. He starts off as a criminal (with good intentions) and ends up as a Super Hero wearing the Ant-Man suit, which shrinks him down to the size of an insect. But even as a tiny ant, Paul Rudd gives us a role filled with character and heart, combined with the great dead pan comedy delivery of Michael Douglas, with the strong woman portrayal of Evangeline Lily as his daughter and potential romance interest for Ant Man. Trouble starts when the main villain, played by Cory Stoll, finally unveils the secret to micronization, the ability to shrink down or expand at will. Posing a great threat with plans for a massive army of Yellow Jacket army suits, it's up to Ant-Man and his team of comical side kicks to save the day. Lots of dry comedy keeps the film a joy to watch while also poking fun at the imaginative concept at the same time.The 3D in Ant-Man takes you down to the micro size and intensifies the effects tenfold. I didn't see a lot of things popping out but the depth and spatial distance between objects onscreen is a sight to behold. Fans of three dimensions, this is a sure bet purchase in 3D.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3TMXVZPF53DLG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZGDIGZ2#wasThisHelpful","R3TMXVZPF53DLG","A2JFKSHR0WQB8C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2JFKSHR0WQB8C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Pixels:  For video game enthusiasts looking for their favorite Arcade Classics digitized into the real world to assault humanity.The movie includes:Pac ManFroggerDonkey KongGalaxian/GalagaTetris, Q*Bert, Joust and a whole host of video game heroes making cameos, only this time, as villains.The 3D presentation is outstanding and exciting. There are many objects that fly out of the screen often, and the 3D goes deep into the screen also. While the movie doesn't offer a very compelling story, which seems to stall out after each confrontation, it is a welcome homage to the 80s Arcades, but something I wouldn't want to watch often.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R4W8L7J2VGU9M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012DWS874#wasThisHelpful","R4W8L7J2VGU9M","A2JFKSHR0WQB8C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2JFKSHR0WQB8C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Usually when I buy a multi movie action pack, I'll temper my expectations, knowing the majority on the pack will probably be movies that are lacking in story and action, but with the 12 Film Action Pack from Millennium Entertainment, I'm surprised at the quality of films and the stars included that this set contains. While not every film is a hit in my book, many of the 12 movies I thoroughly enjoyed from start to finish.THE ICEMAN-Stars Michael Shannon, the guy who plays General Zod in Man of Steel, in a Mafia drama that would fit well with the story telling of a classic like Donnie Brasco. With a list of stars including Captain America's Chris Evans (as Mr. Freezy, a freelance Mercenary), Ray Liotta (of Goodfellas), Winona Rider (Edward Scissorhands), James Franco (Annapolis) and more, each giving great performances in this story about a cold hearted Hitman. With a soft side for his family, with great story telling that resolves most loose ends in a compelling way. 9/10DIRECT ACTION:Dolph Lundgren (Universal Soldier) gives a solid performance in Direct Action, where he plays a street cop who's determined to do what is right against a team of corrupt Unit cops, even after being threatened repeatedly at the cost of his life. Cool martial arts, great storytelling abound with a classic 80's style of directing. 9/10STOLEN:In one of his best performances in recent years (which says a lot for Cage, who sometimes dials in dull performances), Nicholas Cage (Con Air) returns to hero action form, on a quest to save his kidnapped daughter after a partner from a past robbery coerces him to pay up or else. 8/10THE CONTRACT:Morgan Freeman (Batman Begins) leads a team of assassins on a secret mission when everything goes wrong and he ends up a prisoner of the law, only to escape and be held captive by John Cusack (2012) and his son, who were on a camping trip turned upside down as the assassins target them to save their crooked boss. 8/10WAKE OF DEATH:In an emotional performance by Van Damme (Hard Target), he's a club bouncer turned vigilante on his enraged quest to avenge his murdered wife from a ruthless Japanese Crime Boss who has zero compassion for women as he kills them without mercy as he hunts for his runaway daughter. Van Damme teams up with his three hard edged friends, only to go it alone in the end in an effort to save his kidnapped son. 8/10BLITZ:Jason Statham (The Transporter) playing a hard nosed cop, returns in an interestingly paced thriller, tracking down a ruthless cop killer dirtbag on the loose who finds ways to twist the laws so he gets off the hook each time only to kill again. Statham doesn't get to use much martial arts sadly, but does beat up and shoot the bad guys with force. 7/10RAMPART:In an interesting story of a low life cop who ruthlessly bends the rules always in his favor, even with his broken family, Woody Harrelson (2012) fights the law in his quest to rid the city of crime. The question is, does his brutal approach pay off in the end, or put him into deeper turmoil with the city against his tactics against criminals? Star cast with Ned Beatty, Ben Foster, Anne Heche, Ice Cube, Sig Weaver, etc. 6/10TRESPASS:Nick Cage (The Rock film) returns as a businessman husband of Nicole Kidman (Eyes Wide Shut) and foolishly opens the door for the wrong people, now at their mercy in a half baked robbery attempt. This is one of those films where you think ""That was a dumb decision"" one too many times. Most of the film takes place in their house. Decent performances hampered by a silly script with questionable criminals. This would have worked better as a comedy than a serious crime thriller.  4/10WAR INC:Comedy about corruption as John Cusack and the lovely Marisa Tomei (The Wrestler, My Cousin Vinny) team up to take down the system. 5/10AVENGING ANGELO:Stallone (Rambo) sets out to protect a woman who is being hunted by hitmen. Nothing all that exciting for Stallone here sadly. Plays more like a comedy than an action movie, since there's hardly any action and the tone is light hearted.  5/10CYBORG SOLDIER: In the style of Universal Soldier only not as interesting or exciting. Bruce Greenwood stars. 4/10DESERT SAINTS: Kiefer Sutherland is a half hazard hitman without a heart, who kills any newly attained female partner who might bumble up his schemes of assassination. But is he smart to accept the help of a new female stranger looking for a cut of the pay? 5/10While there are some duds, the winners in this affordable collection are movies you'd expect to see sold separately and of AAA quality in most respects. Do not pass up this collection.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQPSHLRAPB9T8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WR531Q6#wasThisHelpful","RQPSHLRAPB9T8","A2JFKSHR0WQB8C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2JFKSHR0WQB8C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Thinking of how some low budget cover art shows epic views to summarize the movie and then the movie doesn't have any scenes remotely like it, but in the case of Spiders 3D, there actually is a giant Queen Spider that giant size in the movie, and even the explosions and helicopters are present in the movie, which was a nice surprise for this low budget horror movie.Are there lots of spiders, small, medium to large? Yes. Lots of humans get bit and die from the spiders. That's what most people pay to see when they watch giant arachnids take over the city and this movie delivers the goods. A little bit of gore, but not much.Special effects are CGI and not too bad for a low budget film. If anyone goes into this knowing it's low budget and expecting AAA effects, hopefully they learn their lesson to keep expectations realistic. What's here is fun, simple and effective in showing giant monsters attacking people. Some good interactions where the spiders lift people up and eat them. The main actor? Great performance.The low budget 3D conversion is kind of a mix of poor, average and sometimes potent 3D, but mostly the 3D is just about there, so I wouldn't recommend it for those looking for the best 3D. Some good pop outs. This conversion of the 3D has a lot of technical issues, like varying highlights of subtle light in each camera on the characters and scenery creating conflict when both eyes combine the images into one. Other problems with the 3D would include conflict between the depth of the CGI and live humans, which sometimes aren't on the right planes of depth, and it just looks weird sometimes. For low budget, it's passable 3D, but has lots of room for improvement. 3D is mostly there for the exciting scenes (sometimes good 3D) and then is forgettable the rest of the movie.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2P9MJPIIQLDNU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AO06N5M#wasThisHelpful","R2P9MJPIIQLDNU","A2JFKSHR0WQB8C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2JFKSHR0WQB8C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Batman: Arkham Knight is a must have for any fan of the prior games for several reasons.+Single player game is entirely playable offline. Internet broadband only needed for DLC content.+Large, open world city lets you progress as you wish shortly into the game, choosing missions or secondary goals at will.+Smooth controls, responsive and effective on foot and in vehicle.+Batmobile is a worthy new addition to the series and very effective against many enemies and obstacles Batman alone couldn't handle. It acts as a major assistant, showing up when you need its help. Control by remote control or directly as a driver. Tank mode or car mode.+City is 5+ times larger than Arkham City. 2 sections unlocked shortly after the Ace Factory is dealt with. Night time setting most times.+Ascend to the highest building to jump off and glide, or assess the city from above.+Environmental puzzles require cleverness to solve. If an entry is blocked, think of the tools available to help you.+Challenging fighting game combat with all new moves and abilities.+Depending on the situation, many playable characters to control.+Surprise character plays a big part in the story of Batman.+Robin lends a hand to help out at points in the game, along with other allies.+Clear out the city of ground tanks to explore on foot more safely, aside from gangs.+Bat seat from your vehicle launches Batman high into the air for maximum gliding exploration.+Easy, normal, hard difficulties.+Mission variety is great. Many different goals to progress through the game at your pace.+Grappling hook can catapult Batman high into the air when ascending.+Control layout very similar to prior games. Batmobile may take time to learn the new controls.+Graphics very detailed as in prior games, and 1080p this time. 49 GB minimum installation. Unreal Engine used for graphics.+Huge game with lots of unique, fun and challenging missions.+Nice variety of locations, interiors, underground areas, etc. City blocked off by bridges after story evacuation.+Fight against famous enemies. Scarecrow, Penguin, Two Face, Riddler, Poison Ivy, and more.+Lots of classic voice actors return, including Batman's Kevin Conroy.+PS4 version includes DLC: Scarecrow Nightmare Missions in a nightmare version of the city, and 3000 Batman & '60's Adam West costume.Only negatives I can think of at the time:-Early on, the rain doesn't let up, as it constantly pours hours into the game without any sign of slowing down till you advance further.-Outer city limits in the distance can't be reached, so you'll see basic city background buildings, but it's inaccessible.-Not all prior areas are present from past games in this expanded city, but that's a minor complaint.If you enjoyed Arkham Asylum or Arkham City, also from Rocksteady, this Batman is a must buy to complete the trilogy. Awesome game.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R36HRKX15FYGUD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IQCRKT8#wasThisHelpful","R36HRKX15FYGUD","A2JFKSHR0WQB8C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2JFKSHR0WQB8C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Fans of the Jurassic Park series and large, hungry dinosaurs will find plenty more to enjoy in Jurassic World, set up much like the first film that it even revisits the Restaurant Lodge from the first film. Taking the spot light is a new cross bred Dinosaur that is more ferocious than most, and as intelligent as a Raptor. There is no small brain in this giant T-Rex like Dino as it out-thinks the humans at every turn, sparking lots of dinosaur chaos one more time in the theme park of Dinosaurs. Chris Pratt, a Raptor trainer, gives a convincing performance in his urgent goal to stop the new dinosaur at all costs.The 3D in Jurassic World is immersive and exciting. There are many key pop outs that will truly make you jump back in your seat, but also a thorough level of dimensional depth from things up close to far away. All of these 3D elements join to bring 3D fans a spectacular 3D experience equivalent to some of the best modern 3D films available. This will be a perfect 3D edition to any Jurassic Fan looking to get the fullest experience from Jurassic World.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R350JZNXLXRNFG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NYC65M8#wasThisHelpful","R350JZNXLXRNFG","A2JFKSHR0WQB8C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2JFKSHR0WQB8C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Richie Rich is a classic show about being so rich that you have any type of handy invention or gadget imaginable to thwart the villains who try to steal Richie Rich's Riches. This classic show was originally aired combined with the entertaining Scooby Doo and Scrappy Doo mystery series, which includes Scooby and Scrappy and Shaggy as the stars this time. Colorful animation, great voice acting and music abound in this must own cartoon series. Richie Rich was originally based on a Comic Book.

"San Andreas, starring Duane Johnson (The Rock) gives an emotionally effective performance in his efforts to rescue his wife and daughter separated by one of the most explosive, massive earthquakes the world has ever recorded in history, causing unforgiving devastation throughout the cities of Los Angeles and San Francisco. Buildings topple left and right like lumbering giants, crushing all in their path. A huge Tsunami smothers and destroys everything in its path, the Golden Gate Bridge just a tiny obstruction to be bowled over in a wash of deadly sea water.The Rock's journey into the heart of chaos is matched with heartfelt family bonds made stronger through the nightmare. Entertaining and well told.The 3D in San Andreas is equally effective, essentially bringing you into the destruction with powerful 3D dimensions of objects, people and debris in each sequence. Rarely does the 3D let up, resulting in a thrill ride that doesn't disappoint. With a good amount of out of the screen scenarios, the 3D gets in your face as one would hope for a movie of this destructive caliber. Exciting movie and 3D for fans of the apocalypse.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RN34J5SUW6KM1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YHRMLAY#wasThisHelpful","RN34J5SUW6KM1","A2JFKSHR0WQB8C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2JFKSHR0WQB8C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"For the PS4 version of Witcher 3, CD Project Red offers players the chance to enter sprawling, giant landscapes to quest through while dispatching many dangerous bandits, monsters and flying beasts along the way. The presentation includes the blu ray game disc, a music CD in sleeve, a map, stickers, Manual and World Compendium explaining the characters. If you get the Comic Amazon Version, you also can acquire a hardcover, full color Witcher Comic Book (true scale is about the size of a PS4 case).Pros:+Single player, offline massive adventure.+Highly detailed maps of nature that are many miles long. If you demand naturalistic scenery, graphics don't get much better than Witcher 3's.+Controls take time to remember for certain features, but are reliable and smooth. Weak attack, strong attack, magic, parry/block, roll, run.+Control the Witcher with the left analog, move the camera with the right. Zoom in with the crossbow or Witcher Sense for a closer view.+Expansive story line with very realistic faces up close as you'll discover later in the game.+Hundreds of hours worth of content to discover and unlock.+Plenty of choice. You can ignore missions and do your own thing freely.+Day and night change very gradually and also includes the ability to pass time as you wish.+Geralt's appearance can be changed to your liking with plenty of customization in clothing, armor, weapons and even hair.+Save the game at any time? Yes, provided you're not in the middle of a battle. Plenty of save files to create.+Plenty of options to adjust to your liking.+4 difficulty levels to choose from. Easy, medium, hard, and very hard.+Boats are available early in the game. Horses can be called with a whistle. L3 x2.+A jump/climb button is included.+Swimming and diving underwater with a generous breath meter.Cons:-Some minor glitches I've experienced, though they are producing a patch. The few glitches I've had are not game breaking so far.-Map is separated by different zones that load separately, so while it's still open world, imagine it as several worlds to unlock. Disappointing but manageable and still very playable.-Map limits are unseen till you're right up on them. You warp back to the safe zone if you've gone too far past the unseen border.So from my extensive game play sessions thus far, it's safe to say The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt is a spectacular final chapter for Geralt and the Witcher series as of now. Recommended for players of Medieval inspired adventures.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R376R6TVUROQJP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WTI3JPE#wasThisHelpful","R376R6TVUROQJP","A2JFKSHR0WQB8C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2JFKSHR0WQB8C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Starcom, the complete series includes great animation for a TV Cartoon from 1987, running 4 hours and 46 minutes spanning 13, very entertaining and interesting episodes. Lots of space action and a unique story line each episode.

"Run All Night centers around a retired, boozing hit man (Neeson) who's limousine driving son (Robocop's Joel Kinnaman) ends up on the wrong side of the Mob headed by Ed Harris' Boss character for reasons I won't reveal. It spurs the action forward, as Neeson pulls off a very entertaining and fun to watch night lit street chase with lots of high speed smashing and crashing that goes on for a good few minutes. Soon after, all heck breaks loose as the Mob and the entire police force are on a desperate search to kill or capture these renegades on the run, with plenty of satisfying movie action, shootouts and hand to hand fights. The ending kept me satisfied along with the grim but entertaining story, with most questions answered about the duo's decisions through the danger filled night of NYC, where every turn could end up as their last. Nick Nolte makes a surprise appearance as Kinnaman's uncle. Though the story has good pacing and well shot action, it is smart enough to take a breather and reflect on the father son strained connection, as Neeson tries to repair the damage he's caused his son.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RE4UXVFUDX3Q0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UNONQSQ#wasThisHelpful","RE4UXVFUDX3Q0","A2JFKSHR0WQB8C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2JFKSHR0WQB8C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Woman in Black continues the story many years after the first film (with Radcliffe) with Hammer's The Woman in Black 2, and offers plenty of creepy atmosphere and the horrific, looming presence of the vindictive, never forgiving woman in the black dress, forever haunting the isolated mansion. The story did a decent job explaining why a school of orphans would reside in this house during the war, and when the horror begins, the evil ghost doesn't spare anyone, though she does take her time. If you're looking for more scares and a decent storyline to continue this theme, the Woman in Black is worth a look, with an interesting plot starring a female teacher who discovers the evil entity and attempts to get everyone out before it's too late. There were a couple scenes that were horrific and generally frightening, satisfying the search for horror in this film. (Trivia: The original star of the outstanding made for TV movie The Woman in Black makes a guest appearance in this film).","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1YP9VR1LXJ69K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TI5RQL4#wasThisHelpful","R1YP9VR1LXJ69K","A2JFKSHR0WQB8C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2JFKSHR0WQB8C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Captain Scarlett, the man the series is centered around, is a special Agent of Spectrum, sent to investigate any warning sent from the Mysterons from outer space, and their puppet, Captain Black. Scarlett's special ability? He can never die, no matter how severe the cause, as he has a secret that always brings him back to life. This is central to the series, as every episode revolves around Captain Scarlett's ability to find the danger and rescue anyone he can before time runs out with his right hand friend, Captain Blue.The Mysterons begin each episode by first destroying, then replicating any ship or human they wish to manipulate. They are always unforgiving, and hold a strong grudge on the Earth for one serious mistake caused by one or two agents. Rather than negotiate, they seek the destruction of mankind and it's world president.The puppet marionettes here are brilliantly controlled with nice articulation and features, with realistic faces and costumes. The personalities of each character are unique, and each contributes to the success of the show. Lots of story development, matched with plenty of sci fi action, space ships, take offs, landings, model ships, cars and landscapes in this excellent series from the late Gerry Anderson. Fans of realistic puppets won't want to miss this series.

"Seventh Son offers a very expansive world filled with large beasts, special effects and swords and sorcery in a smorgasbord of entertaining Fantasy cinema, with the talents of Jeff Bridges, Julianne Moore and more. Fans of Medieval Fantasy Movies will find much to enjoy in Seventh Son, which involves the recruitment of Tom Ward, the reported Seventh Son, with special powers soon to be harnessed and revealed through the guidance of the feisty and ornery old Jeff Bridges, as John Gregory, a Hunter of sorts, determined to spell the end of the evil Witch Malkin (Julianne).The movie includes a lot of escapades as Ward and Gregory quest through forests filled with dead souls, a castle with a red eyed demon knight, a prison room with a gargantuan man Bear Beast, a bursting driller Giant, waterfalls, gorgeous scenery that reminds one of Middle Earth (New Zealand), Dragons, Trolls, Witches, an expert swordsman with four arms, Creatures of all kinds, a beautiful princess, towns, cliffs, hills, mountains and much more in this sprawling epic fantasy. If these features have you interested, don't pass up Seventh Son.The 3D special effects are powerful during much of Seventh Son, and make you feel like you are there, looking over a pouring waterfall with depth and dimension 2D could never capture. While not every sequence is full blast 3D, the ones that count are plentiful and thrilling. The outstanding 3D really adds to the excitement of Seventh Son.

"In 2002's Blade II, directed by Guillermo del Toro himself, many of the concepts he created about the Reaper plague from that film are fully fleshed out and envisioned to their utmost horror in The Strain, which has 10 hours or so to tell the story. While Nomak may have been Patient Zero in Blade II, The Master, a super fast, cloaked Nosferatu-like monster variant, is the origin of the strain here, and is unleashed on the city of New York with precision and planning for infecting as much of the population as possible with the parasitic vampire worms.A single scratch and there is no hope, as the worms develop and turn your organs into parasitic ones, designed for the sole purpose of infecting others while drawing out all of their blood. Abraham (much like Abraham Whistler from Blade II) sets out to fight the strain once more, with a welcome number of origin flashbacks to 1944, as he fought his way out of the concentration camps and the Master's reach, learning how to fight this evil along the way.A few later episodes strongly resemble a zombie apocalypse setting, where a small band of survivors, led by the elderly Abraham and his concealed silver sword cane, must barricade themselves from the hordes of reapers attacking them. Lots of silver bullets, flames and decapitations abound in this horror series.With flawed characters learning from their mistakes, they feel more vulnerable in this horrific nightmare expertly told by del Toro and his creative team. Lots of blood, stingers that have much longer reach than the reapers from Blade II, and some cool turns in the story keep the horror fan captivated in practically every episode, here uncut and uninterrupted. A must see for fans of parasites and the most blunt kind of vampire imagined. Brilliant. Season 2 hints at more developed fighting skills as the band of rebel researchers continue to hunt The Master and his growing breed of monsters.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2MS8S0LM6RS9J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LT9S0OO#wasThisHelpful","R2MS8S0LM6RS9J","A2JFKSHR0WQB8C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2JFKSHR0WQB8C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Story:The Hobbit: The Battle of Five Armies concludes the epic journey of Bilbo Baggins of the Shire and his legion of Dwarves led by Thorin Oakenshield, under the guidance of Gandalf the Wizard, with a powerful, emotional finish. It begins right where part II left off, and wastes little time building towards the incredible war that is about to take place for the treasures of the Lonely Mountain.Thorin must decide if he should live in his Grandfather's footsteps and horde all of the gold that is rightfully his, or listen to his solemn friends at the end of their dangerous journey to reclaim their home. The Bard and his townsfolk want only enough of the treasure to rebuild their fire scorned town, while the Elves want their cut of the diamonds, and yet the Orcs and Goblins, led by Azog the Defiler, wish to claim this Mountain fortress for its strategic position in the land, under their master Sauron, who is confronted by Galadriel, Gandalf, Elrond and Saruman. When the Dwarf army enters the fray, war becomes inevitable despite the pleas of the burglar Hobbit, Bilbo and his golden ring of invisibility. Tamriel (smoothly weaved into the story and an original character not in the J.R.R. Tolkien Book) lends her support along with the expert marksman Legolas, as she must decide if Kili, the Dwarf she is taken with, will be worth pursuing during this great war.The expertly filmed battle endures through most of the film, yet keeps the audience compelled as we fight alongside our heroes and villains, while their stories unfold one last time.3D:The experience of the 3D itself adds to the immersion into the film's world, matched with the high frame rate technology that increases the sense of being there, watching these characters battle for their very lives in smoother real time it seems. Throughout each sequence, the 3D remains consistent, with an average but effective depth of three dimensionality to enhance the spacing between objects beyond what a 2D film can do. There are occasional pop outs that add to the excitement, coupled with key shots of increased 3D depth and form. This is perhaps the most effective use of 3D in the trilogy, thanks largely to the overwhelming battle scenes that takes place, and all the layers of troops involved.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2KEPF5OE67CB7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00R3DODWI#wasThisHelpful","R2KEPF5OE67CB7","A2JFKSHR0WQB8C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2JFKSHR0WQB8C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Pinwheel's vocal energy, lyrics and melodic, powerful riffs are not to be missed. Any fan of Tool will recognize the similar style on display, but more of a great thing offered here, is not a bad thing, especially when presented in the brilliant way Pinwheel has captured with Reset.

"John Wick, starring Keanu Reeves is about a lone hitman who seeks vengeance for crimes committed against him and his personal attachments, which in the hitman business, one should detach from so no leverage can be held against him in a tight situation as they say. In the film, John Wick is hailed as a legend, feared and respected by most of his cohorts in the Russian Organization. If they hear he's on the way, they either run, or arm themselves heavily for the tsunami that is about to strike.Keanu does most of his own stunts here, and the stylized expertise with which he performs his gun kata and martial arts is impressive. Rarely does he make a mistake, and when he does, he's prepared for the consequences most times, resulting in a hero who doesn't disappoint; a guy who knows what he's doing. That is a hero to root for.Tons of slick, intense action throughout this great action film highlighted by a great sound track in sync with the onscreen action. John Wick is a blast for any big action fan, though the film is admittedly light on story motivation. Revenge is understood, but for the audience, it doesn't always hold the emotional impact or conviction of accomplishing this ultimate task to take down the Mob, as it would resonate had it been Mr. Wick attempting to save someone still alive, or a higher motivation like freeing the city of this sinister organization altogether. In the end, John Wick is still a lot of fun to watch, and ultimately, that is what most action fans pay for in the first place. A fast paced, brilliant showcase of action.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1T8I9TA2H86BH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OV3VGP0#wasThisHelpful","R1T8I9TA2H86BH","A2JFKSHR0WQB8C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2JFKSHR0WQB8C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you're looking for epic battles of 25 Orcs versus one powerful Ranger with Wraith powers, with brutal, merciless combat in an open world game (including 2 maps, Mordor Wasteland and Mordor Grass Cliffs), then look no further than the exceptionally fun Middle Earth: Shadow of Mordor. The game shines on PS4, with incredible detail to the main character and Uruk Kai Orcs.Game play includes riding Graug giants and Caragor dogs. Lots of incredible fighting abilities to unlock for archery, swordfighting and stealth attacks. Time of day set at will and you can set your own checkpoints in the large, open maps. Unlock the 2nd map after completing the main missions in the first map.Great game and hopefully there is a sequel with a combined open world and more enemy types aside from the great variety of Orcs here.

"Sleeping Dogs Definitive Edition PS3 vs PS4 Review:Owning and completing the PS3 version, here is a review of the PS4 version. A quick summary is, this is the PS3 game in 1080p, with some very minor improvements, but the best looking version you can own. 1080p looks great, but it's still a PS3 game and unlike Watch_Dogs on PS4 (which looks and feels like a PS4 game) versus PS3 versions, this PS4 version uses mostly all of the same low res PS3 textures, which is disappointing despite their claims of higher resolution textures, which is largely for the text billboards. But get past that initial disappointment, and you'll most likely enjoy the PS4 edition if you loved the PS3 game. Just think of it as 20/20 vision versus the semi-blurry vision of the 720p PS3 version.GAMEPLAY:-First 30+ minutes are all story based, no freedom.-Great PS3 inspired graphics upgraded from 720p to 1080p for sharper clarity and detail. It's a very noticeable difference and reduces blurriness and pixelation. The game looks great when it rains at night.-After first few missions, the game opens up to a giant Hong Kong replica.-Walk, run, slide, climb and hop over objects and walls. Great fun.-Great selection of music, much of it catchy and well done. Great music channels and theme music.-Fun little unlocking puzzles to figure out.-Eat, drink, sleep, wash hands, use the restroom.-Buy fish, plants and more for your apartment to customize it.-Change clothing, buy lots of stuff to alter your look. Certain combinations add power to Wei.-Excellent fighting system still in place. Counter as in Arkham, and defend against many enemies around you. -Basic but fun and responsive vehicle controls, with ramming and air jacking another vehicle.-Large city to explore, along with boats and the ocean areas.-Lots of side missions and abilities to unlock.-Day/night cycle.-Beautiful rain effects with water on pavement and reflections.-Swimming.-Detailed interiors like night club bars, delis, hospitals, homes, etc.-Overall less blurring of farther buildings.-Tips: If you're not big on complicated moves to remember, spend your credits on simpler moves and bonus abilities, like slow motion, easier car jacking, etc.-During fights, grab the grab-able enemies and throw them into something to knock them down faster and eliminate their numbers quickly.UPDATED IMPROVEMENTS:-Thanks to 1080p, the game, aside from textures, appears sharp and crystal clear in most aspects. The game already looked great on PS3, and this is the best looking version aside from PC.-Wei Shen's face, only if very up close, has some facial hair and detail noticeable, but nothing to write home about. It's very minor. Polygon count difference appears imperceptible to the average gamer.-Sportbikes handle more realistically. Not as loose as PS3 version.-Slick packaging includes Concept artwork booklet, very nice illustrations.-Wei Shen's and other's hair moves and shifts as the head moves.-Cutscenes look okay, using in game graphics.-Characters are okay upgrades. Nothing very noticeable but smoother edges.-Graphics are sharper, but clearly a game made for PS3.-Fights are as great as ever.-Reflections of water on ground looks great.-Menu button icons updated for PS4.-Most posters and billboards updated with higher res images.-Fire, explosions and fireworks special effects updated to look better.-Without nitpicking, in normal character view zoomed out, the graphics look really good despite the lower polygon counts.-Plants have more leaves and higher detail. Much better.-Water of Ocean looks even better than the nice PS3 water effects.-Feels like a longer braking distance in rainy streets.-Lights seem more volumetric, more realistic.-The weird motion shake effect is gone in this version during high speed.-DLC content included on the disc. No downloading required.-It's nice Square Enix offered a higher res version, but not at full price. If this decides if a sequel is given a go ahead, they should base it on past PS3 sales first.-Nightmare at NorthPoint DLC is a freeroam night version of the main game, where you complete missions against evil spirits to save your girlfriend. The pedestrians eyes glow, but otherwise, they go about their own business, driving, talking and doing normal stuff as in the main game, which is disappointing, considering they could have made them like more zombie like to give the game an entirely different mood. These are not zombies in any way. The city is always foggy and night time. You can ride vehicles. There are new enemies, including hopping vampire ghouls and demons that appear on missions, but not freely in the open map until prompted-Year of the Snake DLC includes additional missions and story content also in an open city. What is great about it is you play a uniformed Police Officer instead of undercover as in the main game, so you act the role, eating donuts and protecting citizens after completing the initial missions. It's a really nice compliment to the main game. You can ride in police vehicles and bikes and activate different police patrol duties like catching crooks. Keep in mind, this is night patrol, and the time of day depends on the missions here. You can arrest pedestrians at will and cuff them instantly with the grapple button.CONS:-Wei Shen and other main characters have minor improvements, and look largely like they were as in the PS3 version.-Not all textures updated. Mostly just text billboards. 95% are clearly PS3 quality, with a blurred look. Disappointing. Wei Shen's first apartment is a perfect example.-Pedestrians only slightly better in appearance. They have a low polygon count and their arms bend at the shoulders awkwardly as a result.-In normal free roam, pedestrian count not noticeably increased, nor is traffic.-Pop in still occurs for boats and some objects.-Distant view still blurred as it was on the PS3. Mostly a stylistic decision.-Wei still hops off a boat completely instead of letting you explore the boat. And he'll choose to hop into the water every time instead of onto the dock. A big oversight that wasn't fixed.-One camera view still for vehicles. They could have added more, like an interior dash view, which would have been welcome. Even so, you can later acquire an aim button that lets you zoom in closer and aim while driving.-Day into Night cycle still only 24 minutes.-Many wall ledges still not climbable, even though they are within reach.-For minimal improvements beyond 1080p resolution, Square Enix made the wrong decision to charge full price for this game, if their goal is to gauge the response to an already great open world game.-Vehicle polygons looks the same as the PS3 version, comparing them side by side.-There is a weird glitch where out of nowhere, someone yells at such a high volume as if speaking through a loud speaker. It's very annoying. Reboot the game from your PS4 to hopefully get rid of it.-There is a slight delay when you click on a menu option.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R28756DQCSKRT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MA5TSFQ#wasThisHelpful","R28756DQCSKRT","A2JFKSHR0WQB8C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2JFKSHR0WQB8C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is Southern Rock at its best thanks to the incredible voice of C. Johnson, who belts out a tremendous range of vocal harmonies in this musically action packed rock album.For fans of Chris Cornell's gritty, ranged vocals from Soundgarden and AudioSlave, Caleb Johnson's voice has a lot of striking similarities, to the point it made me play Cornell's music just to see how closely the voices match. The range is there, though Cornell does have a little more gravel to his gritty voice. Caleb is very close and has the power to match.Much of the album is thankfully fast paced to suit his voice.1. Sailing Away 5/5 Hard Rock, great start.2. Save Me 5/5 Awesome Chorus.3. Let Me In 5/5 Great melody.4. Only One 4/5 (medium paced song)5. Fighting Gravity 5/5 (slower song)6. Devil's Daughter 5/5  Hard rock awesome.7. Another Life 5/5 Sounds great.8. Change 4/5 Range of vocals. Slow song.9. Testify 3/5 Not bad. Lyrics are heavy handed.10. As Long As You Love Me 5/5 Very catchy song.What is great here, is that Caleb has written the majority of songs here, which include a hard rock, Southern Rock style, where his voice is given the full range of tightly sung verses and soaring vocal choruses. The album is mostly fast paced and exciting, and eases up to allow for more vocal acrobatics that will please fans of gritty powerful vocals.The songs here are shoe stomping intense, and even drift into the metal style of music from time to time. I'm very much looking forward to Caleb's next album after this premiere and hope he matches the musical intensity offered here.The biggest challenge will be to survive separation from the Idol connection and possibly stand among the greatest vocal artists of our time with this incredible rock voice. Caleb; Keep bringing this intense style and I'll be a lifelong fan.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1RGE0BIXSXL62/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LDCJ104#wasThisHelpful","R1RGE0BIXSXL62","A2JFKSHR0WQB8C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2JFKSHR0WQB8C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Guardians of the Galaxy 3D, much like James Gunn's Slither, presents it self consistently with the goal of fun and adventure, capturing the lighthearted, energetic spirit of the first Star Wars film, A New Hope. Every character plays out in this goal, even the villains with their more serious tone, are contrasted by confrontations by humorous characters like StarLord, who begins dancing when all other options were exhausted.The special effects, action, very funny character interactions and plot are outstanding here, along with the amazing 3D which is comparable to films like Avatar much of the time. Lots of stuff flying out of the screen and some great 3D dimensions. If you don't like having fun while watching a movie, then give it a pass. Otherwise, Do not miss the 3D or this sci fi adventure film.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RUEW9O7BQ2F7X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009NNM95Y#wasThisHelpful","RUEW9O7BQ2F7X","A2JFKSHR0WQB8C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2JFKSHR0WQB8C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Having grown up with the Turtles since the beginning, I went into the theater with the hopes of seeing a fun movie that captured the spirit of the Turtles, along with their martial arts antics, knowing they may have dangerous weapons, but since it's a kid's themed concept, rarely ever use them to dismember or kill their enemies. Also with the hope of seeing Shredder and Splinter play big roles. I wasn't worried how April O'Neil was portrayed too much, since she's not the character I'm paying a ticket to see.I was not disappointed. After hints of the Turtles leaving their mark, we finally get to seeing the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles about 1/4th into the movie. After establishing their origin from a laboratory study of a special anti virus mutagen, the Foot Clan and Shredder, now equipped in a super, high tech Armored Uniform, attack the Turtles to harvest their blood for a sinister plan to infect NY City, and then hold them hostage with the possession of the only cure.Raphael plays a major part here, underplaying the significance of Leo, who is normally the boss in charge in the various cartoon series. Donatello has lots of equipment knowledge, but we don't see any major devices highlighted that turn the tables on the enemy other than their standard equipment, and Mikey's role here lives up the pizza loving, skate boarding, Cowabunga style he's famous for. Splinter is a tough master here, and highly skilled with his tail as a whip, which was a nice trick.So while your exact expectations may not be fulfilled, remember that the Turtles go into every fight with plenty of attitude and the spirit of having fun, which this movie captures really well. The story plays out clearly and the action scenes, especially after the halfway mark, are a blast of high energy, great martial arts, and cool special effects. Action scenes included a fight in the sewers, a fight of Raphael vs Shredder, Splinter vs Shredder, the turtles vs the Foot Clan, the turtles in a very action packed race down a snow mountain, and a great ending fight of Shredder vs the Turtles.The 3D was an outstanding compliment to the film too, and matches the 3D power of movies like Avatar for comparison's sake. 5/5 for the 3D for certain. Lots of stuff flying at you too.The director and film crew got a lot of things right here, even if many diehard fans point out all of the things that didn't match the original history of the turtles and lost out on the fun to be had here because of it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2F17A0H605NLH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MI1X58S#wasThisHelpful","R2F17A0H605NLH","A2JFKSHR0WQB8C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2JFKSHR0WQB8C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Note: Amazon has the same item under two separate choices: This one labeled ""DVD"", the other choice was/is ""DVD-R"". There are 3 discs, each about 3+ hours worth of episodes, an average of 25 minutes per episode. This was a daily series during the weekdays to account for so many episodes, 65 total, but this being the first volume of 35. Volume 2 now available thanks to Warner Bros.Challenge of the Gobots, the animated Series (First 35 Main Season Episodes) offers plenty of varied adventures in every episode, with some of the best voice acting in the cartoon industry, including Frank Welker (Uni and many other voices). Peter Cullen, voices from Voltron, etc.The quality of the remastering of this series is exceptional. The colors are vibrant and don't bleed into one another, with a clear image in practically every frame. Amazing considering each disc contains about 3 hours and 40 minutes, or about 10+ episodes on each disc of 3 total.Most episodes center around Leader 1 (jet), Scooter (red scooter) and Turbo (red car) versus the notorious and very evil Cy-Kill (red white motorcycle), Crasher (black car) and Copter (blue helicopter). The good news is, these are very well developed characters over the series, who have to handle a myriad of difficult situations and interactions. In one episode, both good and evil are forced to work together to unite against a more powerful force hindering their future. Many other new Guardians and Renegades make appearances throughout the series. Many planets are visited, including a snow land where the good Gobots' Tranport ship resembles an AT-AT Walker from Star Wars. There are quite a few nods in this show to Star Wars, like plan for the attack on the Death Star as another example in another episode.Cy-kill, the main villain, really shines in this series. Voiced by a now deceased voice actor, his range and villainy oftentimes steal the show, as he connives one devious plan after the other, sometimes succeeding while ultimately losing to the good of the Guardians and their three human friends. Leader 1 is great as I remember him, and Scooter is an endearing character who is not as wimpy as one might first imagine, even with his unique, strange voice.The great news is, Challenge of the Gobots includes great sound effects, music and animation for an animated series from the 80's. The transformations are plentiful and really well done, and usually serve a purpose for the situation. The special effects are nice too, with glowing lasers and blasts in every episode.I can't say enough good things about this series, which has gone far beyond my expectations, having only seen a few episodes as a kid.

Very colorful game and the time of day variations are really nicely done this time.+The great camera set up of the first game returns, making you feel more like you're in the game and playing as Spiderman thanks to the closer, over the shoulder view, which backs off a bit while webslinging.+More comics to collect through the city, to unlock actual comics to read in Stan Lee's Comic Shop. His shop also includes collectible figurines of characters, a Spider Man arcade that lets you brush up on your fighting moves, a poster gallery, bonuses, etc. 14 comics to unlock and read in all of actual Spiderman Comics.+Stan Lee appears in the game and does voice acting which is a nice addition considering the great history of characters and stories he has originated with Marvel way back when.+Explore freely on foot your apartment and the comic store, among other interiors.+Great ambient sounds of the city that captures the sense of being there.+Time of day varies based on the missions for the first playthrough so far.+Graphic sharpness looks great on the PS4. 1080p.+auto save system.+The awesome webrush move returns, allowing you to target your next place to sling to for more precise controls through the city.+Lots to see and do in the city, and more interesting with the Hero Meter, which depends on whether you want to fight bad guys committing crimes in the city or not. If you help the city, you get more rewards. If not, some minor penalties begin.+Great soundtrack and good voice acting most times.+Nice animations most of the time.+15 or so suits to unlock and wear each with unique bonuses.Negatives that could use refinement include:-First off, the game begins on the title screen with literally a PS3 movie playing of scenes in the city, which had me very nervous at first. Thankfully, that was only a movie and the actually PS4 game looks much better than the PS3 version shown there. But...-This game was clearly made with the PS3 as the foundation. Textures are sometimes pixelated and polygons are often squared off at the edges. Not a big deal most of the time, but with the PS4, I was hoping they'd increase the quality as with other games, but they may have been pressed for time.-The first Shocker boss was a bit frustrating, since the game suggest doing certain moves, but you're better off just jumping away from him instead of trying to pull off the suggested moves, which more often than not get you hurt from my first playthrough.-Some of the fights lose sight of the enemies, resulting in cheap hits offscreen from bullets. Targeting enemies takes more getting used to this time than the first game's set up.-+While the webslinging update is nice with more control of the left and right swing, it's also more realistic and takes a learning curve to adapt to, compared to the ease and fun of the first game's web slinging. Some may enjoy this, but I keep looking for places to attach my webs while falling, and if there isn't a building close by, find one before you lose momentum. I think I will appreciate it more after a few more days of play.-+ When you hit a building, you don't automatically stick to it this time, so be sure to press the triangle button quickly, which can be a bit cumbersome when both fingers are on the analogs controlling SpiderMan. Not a big deal though, and offers more control, so that's good.I was expecting PS4 textures as Ghost Games accomplished with Need For Speed Rivals compared to the PS3 version, but other than that, the game does look like a super high res and much more detailed PS3 game running on a PS4. Good, but they really could have done more with the graphical power of the PS4.Even so, I do recommend any fan of super hero games to play The Amazing Spider Man 2 for some classic game play and open city action.Gameplay: 9/10Controls: 8/10. Not always easy to adapt to, but very good.Graphics: 7/10. Nice detail but PS3 textures on PS4.Story: 8/10. Interesting.Action: 9/10. Lots of action.Freedom: 9/10. Choose to explore or play missions.Sound: 9/10. Great music and sound.Fun: 9/10. Mostly fun.Replay Value: 9/10. With an open city, lots to do and see.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2NTX0XKOHMK92/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FRESY4I#wasThisHelpful","R2NTX0XKOHMK92","A2JFKSHR0WQB8C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2JFKSHR0WQB8C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Dennis the Menace, a classic cartoon series inspired directly from the classic Comic, is finally available on video thanks to Mill Creek Entertainment and DHX Media, with 33 1/2 hour episodes for a runtime of 8 hours and 7 minutes.The Video Quality is good, but you can tell it's transferred directly from a Video Tape, as the colors, though varied and colorful, tend to bleed into each other slightly, as video is known to do, compared to a remastered and newly cleaned update as with other cartoon series. Even so, it's better to have this series as it was broadcast back in the 80's, than nothing at all.The 33 episodes are split up into 3 discs, spindled neatly onto a patented new DVD disc design that locks in tight, one disc on top of the other (be careful and remove them one by one, pressing in on the center to avoid scratching or damage to the discs). About 11 episodes each disc and they look good considering that fact. Likely double layered DVDs. Also included are 3 bonus Umigo Music Videos, unrelated to this show.If you're familiar with the comic or the live action black & white TV show from the 50's or so, you'll know the set up of each episode: Dennis visits his ""Greatest Friend in the whole wide world, Mr. Wilson!"" Much to the regret of Mr. Wilson, who usually ends up in the hospital after Dennis the Menace gets through with him, innocently unaware at the havoc and punishment he gives to poor Mr. Wilson. Thankfully, there is plenty of adventure and antics that take place all around the neighborhood, and not just in one location.One of the Funniest episodes is when Dennis leaves his skateboard on the porch and Mr. Wilson steps outside, right onto it. Barrels of slapstick comedy reminiscent of The Three Stooges at times, ensues and is made even more hilarious thanks to the oblivious nature of Dennis, who has no idea he's causing Mr. Wilson such grief.A great cartoon show finally returns to video. If you're a fan of Heathcliff the Cat, Dennis the Menace (from this 1986 series) includes plenty of slapstick comedy the likes of which is hard to find these days.

"The Crystal Method takes no prisoners on its 2014 self titled release, cranking out some vicious and heavy electronica tunes with some incredible, ranged melodies. Though there are some tracks that take a breath and feature really well done female vocals, lowering the intensity, most of this album rocks hard, only using electronic synths instead of metal guitars. Very creative and exciting, this is the Crystal Method I love to hear. Heavy, fast and filled with hard edged electronica. The opening Track Emulator will give you a great idea of the other sounds in this album.

"I was very skeptical about getting another Spiderman game until I took the time to learn more about Beenox's newest effort, which was 2 years in the making, so it's not a rush job.That good news aside, this is without a doubt one of the best super hero games I've played. This game borrows heavily from Batman from Rocksteady, but to great effect. This has many moments where you feel like you're playing Spiderman with a Batman: Arkham City Template underneath. In an early mission, it even has a Correctional Prison Facility with crazy Asylum inmates. Rather than write a bunch of paragraphs to filter through, I'll save you some time reading and just mention some key highlights below:-Positives:-Controls are buttery smooth and responsive with plenty of freedom to swing, sprint up walls, evade, leap, freefall and more. Incredible job. No twitchy on foot as in Spiderman 2.-The behind the shoulder camera view is excellent and for the first time in an open city Spiderman game, makes you feel like Spiderman, seeing things from a close but comfortable 3PV, increasing the intensity and the sense of ""Being there"", in the game compared to previous efforts where Spiderman was a tiny character onscreen. Think of the views from Batman Arkham City/Asylum.-Fights are modeled directly after Rocksteady's Batman Games and are a blast because of it. Spidy is no push over with some amazing martial arts acrobatic fighting skills. Fast and action packed.-The swinging skills are fast and fluid. Spidy's a pro from the start.-Plenty of Batman-like upgrades for Spidy's skills to upgrade.-Crackdown like leaping/jumping fun, collecting comics instead of orbs.-Plenty of major villains with clever boss battles.-Reasonable representation of NYC's Manhattan.-interiors look good along with the main characters.-Plenty of traffic, but needs Driver:SF dense pedestrians to feel like NYC streets.-Manhattan is a very large playground with streets, parks, and plenty of skyscrapers to leap from and climb.-3 difficulty levels. Casual, Medium, Hardcore. Decent options.-Nice city sound FX for ambience.-Very responsive and helpful look camera from all angles.-Spiderman's trademark moves captured to near perfection with comic book style.-Assassin's Creed like platforming/vaulting.-Sight see easily on helicopters.-Awesome sense of freefalling.-Solid voice acting and interesting story.-Plenty to see, do and explore with freedom and side missions.-Home base is your apartment, and you can replay interiors.-Great draw distance for the city as far as the eyes can see.CONTROLS: Left analog move, right analog look, X is jump, square is punch/attack, triangle is interact with objects, circle is web shoot, Right shoulder is web target travel (very cool and intuitive), right bumper is web swinging, select is map/upgrades, start is pause menu.-Negatives:-Here's a big one for Spiderman Geeks who must have everything absolutely realistic and within reason: Remember in Spiderman 2, how you can earn the ability to sling a web ahead of you into the air, and then pull jump forward to it quickly? Just pretend you had the same skill here, to explain the fact that Spidy can fling webs into the air and swing from them, provided you're within distance of a building. Just pretend he's flicking up a web parachute and it's more believable. Once I got over this misrepresentation of believability, the swinging became a blast. I still say they should have Spidy hit the buildings and not the air above to swing on.-Arkham City rules in terms of graphical power. This game is larger, but the city graphics, although with some nice, gritty details, garbage cans, litter and so on, could've been better. Think Driver: San Francisco city graphics for an idea. Decent at best. Interiors look the best. Characters look good, Spidy mostly.-No day night cycle. Missions determine when daytime changes.To say this is a drastic improvement over Spiderman 2 and 3 would be an understatement, as groundbreaking as Spiderman 2 on the PS2/XBox was.If you ever wanted to feel like Spiderman exploring an open city at will, this is the closest you're going to get on current systems until the next game. Highly recommended and surprisingly a great licensed Movie Tie In game that feels like it's own game because it is. BUY IT if you want a great Spiderman Game, despite any ill will you might have towards Activision.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 26, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2C733MXT54AD6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005VKRGXI#wasThisHelpful","R2C733MXT54AD6","A2JFKSHR0WQB8C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2JFKSHR0WQB8C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"For those interested in the 3D, foremost, Prometheus 3D was filmed with 3D cameras, not converted from a 2D source. The filmmakers did a splendid job with the parallax (3D layers) in most scenes, but don't search for pop out of the screen moments, as this isn't designed as such. Depth reaches far into the screen as would be expected with any 3D film.The 3rd dimension surely gives this horror/sci fi film an extra layer of dimension, transporting you into the exploration of these scientists searching for the origin of the human species, as they so grimly discover. The plethora of gory horror moments are as real as they can get thanks to the well implemented and very effective 3D.Does the 3D look as good as Avatar 3D? No, but it's a very pleasant 3D experience for sure, and a few good notches above most average quality 3D movies. There are scenes that really highlight the 3D, and most of the film conveys impressive 3D layers.For the movie itself, if you enjoyed the original Alien, there is no reason you won't enjoy this patient but tense horror/sci fi film, fairly reminiscent of the original nightmare discovery of Weaver's crew in many aspects.3D: Strong 3D throughout.3D Parallax: Nicely done.3D Depth: Good depth.3D Pop Outs: Few if any to remember.Overall 3D: 9/10.Thoroughly enjoyed the movie and the 3D. Recommended? YES","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 15, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RG0TPTESCV5EH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0085Z8F4A#wasThisHelpful","RG0TPTESCV5EH","A2JFKSHR0WQB8C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2JFKSHR0WQB8C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The 3D in Men In Black 3 3D was generally better than most 2D to 3D conversions, and is several notches above the very average 3D seen in Wrath of the Titans 3D, which also featured otherworldly creatures. If you're looking for better than average parallax 3D layers, good depth, some effective pop out moments, this one is a great purchase.3D Overall: 4/53D Depth: 4/5 Nice distance into the screen.3D Parallax Layers: 4/5 Good separation of objects.3D Pop Outs: 3/5. Not many.3D Volume: 3/5. Objects generally look good and have some depth.3D Consistency: 5/5. Most of this movie has consistent 3D strength.3D Highlight Moment: J (Smith) jumping off the building towards the ground in 3D.Worth a 3D purchase? Absolutely. Recommended.Quick Movie Review: MIB 3 continues the adventures of Will Smith as J, and a younger version of K played by Josh Brolin, who does an exceptional job capturing Lee's performance. The plot is fairly basic, go back in time to prevent a disaster, and the main enemy is challenging enough. If you enjoy the series, this one is worth a buy. Not a whole lot of action, but fun overall, with some light hearted comical moments.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 30, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1GLNB4G4WFTPW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005LAIHQS#wasThisHelpful","R1GLNB4G4WFTPW","A2JFKSHR0WQB8C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2JFKSHR0WQB8C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This review is for those interested in the 3D for Avengers 3D.AVENGERS 3D:The 3D in Avengers 3D is good overall, and generally has the best 3D moments in the final epic action sequence, where the 3D, usually on par with Captain America 3D, steps up the depth, parallax 3D layers, and Pop Out Moments closer to the strong 3D level. If you are a 3D fan, this one is worth a purchase for the 3D.3D Highlights:All of the Avengers combined their powers to take down the enemy by the final act, with each 3D shot looking great in 3D featuring:Iron Man jetting past buildings,Thor slamming his 3D hammer into the back of a soaring beast,Captain America tossing his shield into the screen towards the enemy foot soldiers,The Hulk smashing rock into rubble as it flies out at the screen,and plenty more 3D worthy moments including Loki, Jeremy Renner and Scarlett Johannsen in 3D kicking butt.Does the 3D enhance the movie? If you want an extra dimension, with characters like Thor or Iron Man, standing out apart from the background, as though you were almost seeing them in real life, then this is the closest you'll get for now. Would it have been better if it was filmed in 3D instead of post converted from a 2D source? If done right, yes, but what is here is done really well.3D overall: 4/5. (not an average) Better than average, but there is room to increase the 3D power in the sequel.3D Parallax Layers: 4/5. Good. But Great by the lenghty end battle.3D Depth: 4/5. You can see deep into the screen generally.3D Volume: 3/5. Characters look generally lifelike with depth to their features.3D pop out: 3/5. The pop out moments by the end are nice.3D Consistency: 3/5. The end really stood out strongly, the rest was good.3D Highlights: The end battle throughout, the outer space stairs.3D strength similar to: Captain America 3D, Thor 3D, not as strong as Avatar 3D, which was mostly filmed in 3D, the others converted from 2D.3D Worth a Buy? Yes. Recommended in 3D. If you have a 3D TV, don't miss it.Quick Movie Review: With plenty of great action moments throughout, Avengers is one of the best action movies I've seen in years, thanks to one of the most epic, action packed, and incredible ending battle scenes gracefully combining all of the current Avengers working together to take down the overwhelming enemy, under Loki's command. The best thing about Avengers, despite a slow build up, is the well done balancing of showcasing each lead hero, offering them plenty of time in the spot light to feel like they each contributed a very important role to the movie. This is how to do it. Rating: 9/10 for the movie. Awesome.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 30, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1YP5O6M4JJ8LU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001KVZ6HK#wasThisHelpful","R1YP5O6M4JJ8LU","A2JFKSHR0WQB8C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2JFKSHR0WQB8C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Hammer Films, well known in the past for their Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee Dracula films, returns with Woman in Black (also see the excellent home adaptation for TV, if you get a chance), starring Harry Potter's lead actor, Radcliffe, who plays a real estate agent sent in to collect the papers of a deceased old woman, who died in her mansion in the middle of a wide open marshland.The tide rolls in as our lead investigates the hell house, and experiences many chilling moments, leading to a boiling finale that will make the hair stand on the back of your neck as only any horrific sequence of images and sound can do.Many frightful moments build the tension as Arthur grudgingly explores this hellish home of the dead woman, with an ominous, evil presence determined to end the lives of any one foolish enough to trespass. A well told, building horror tale not to be missed by any fan of haunted ghost movies. Many dark, very disturbing moments abound.Highly recommended.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 17, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RUD7X2WNY6CVB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005LAIGP0#wasThisHelpful","RUD7X2WNY6CVB","A2JFKSHR0WQB8C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2JFKSHR0WQB8C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a review of the 3D in the movie, for those interested in 3D:With Clash of the Titans 3D, movie goers new to 3D were excited to see the next big 3D movie starring Sam Worthington (also from Avatar) shortly after Avatar 3D hit theaters and became a world wide phenomenon, igniting a new wave of 3D entertainment in theaters and at home.Prime Focus had the task of converting Clash on an extremely short, tight schedule to meet a deadline, and the results showed in the execution, which paled drastically in comparison to the strong three dimensions seen in Avatar 3D. Clash 3D didn't live up to the expectations of how great 3D can be, as seen in Avatar 3D, as Clash 3D offered a generally weak 3D experience, with very little 3D parallax layer separation, resulting in a flat look.So with Wrath of the Titans 3D, the expectations were much higher with better 3D software and more time to convert the 2D film (again, a 2D to 3D conversion instead of being filmed in 3D), because how could they go much lower than Clash 3D afterall?Wrath of the Titans 3D is thankfully a step up from Clash 3D, but not by much. The 3D is apparent throughout, and fairly consistent from shot to shot, but don't expect Avatar strength 3D here. Yes, it is a conversion, where they have to duplicate a single film into two separate files, then offset one eye file to create three dimensions, filling in the gaps as they progress.Unfortunately, they didn't push the offset far enough, and the results are average 3D at best. At no point did the 3D ""wow"" me like Avatar 3D did. That translates to 3D that doesn't take things very far, and we end up with low to average parallax layer separation, with minimal distance between foreground to background objects and characters. It's not bad at all, it's just not as great as it could have been. Most of the film feels a bit flat, but some shots stand out, in particular the finale. Maybe we'll get strong 3D for the 3rd film. Ultimately, worth a look if you enjoyed the first film, Clash of the Titans 3D.3D Overall: 3/53D Parallax Layers: 3/53D Depth: 3/53D Character Dimension: 3/5STORY: The story here is pretty basic, a quest adventure with a small team led by Worthington's character, the son of Zeus, with the aid of his father played by Liam Neeson, on their way to confront Hades and his evil companion determined to re-ignite the father of all gods, a lava giant.

"I'm a fan of Liam Neeson, and he and the other actors did a fine job here, no qualms there. The problem I had was with the story. It was mostly a character development showcase, and featured very little adventure or action.The characters were being picked off one by one, and surrounded by a huge pack of wolves. They set up a camp fire and for what seemed like the majority of the film, spent time telling crude campfire stories to keep their sanity. With that fire, they could've lit up the forest to keep the wolves at bay, but they were too busy quarreling with each other to consider such options. I found it tough to relate to anyone here but Liam's character.Well acted? Yes. Dramatic film? Yes. Exciting adventure? Hardly until the end, when things picked up pace slightly. It wouldn't be fair to compare this to the other well known forest adventure ""The Edge"" with Anthony Hopkins and Alec Baldwin trying to escape a killer Grizzly, but don't go in expecting something similar, and you may very well enjoy this film. Otherwise, heed the warning. This is NOT an adventure movie and wasn't designed as one, as the trailers seemed to have suggested... Very disappointed.STORY: 3/10PACING: 2/10CHARACTERS: 5/10ACTING: 9/10ADVENTURE: 2/10OVERALL: 4/10 is my opinion. Not my style of movie to be fair.

"This is a review of the 3D from the movie John Carter (of Mars) 3D.First, I enjoyed the 2 hour movie quite a bit and was warped into the world thanks to a like-able, well acted cast of characters and aliens, along with some great adventure as John Carter sets out to solve the mystery while choosing to sacrifice his freedom or not, regarding the princess, who needs his reluctant help.3D REVIEW of JOHN CARTER: Note: This is a 2D to 3D conversion with 3D CGI computer graphics. This suggests only the live action was converted.First, the parallax 3D (the layers of objects and the depth between them) is top notch here. The different characters really stand out strongly from foreground and background. If you value clearly separate layers of depth in your 3D movie, this one delivers throughout from beginning to end on an impressive level. The characters themselves also show good volume, so they are not flat cardboard cutouts. That's important.Next, the depth reaching into the screen, is also present. You can look far into the screen without any trouble.As far as pop out (objects moving outside the screen towards you), there are a few nice pop out moments here or there, but mostly, the film keeps things within the confines of the screen.3D Layers: 9/103D Depth: 8/103D Pop Out 5/103D OVERALL: 9/10 (not an average). This movie looks great in three dimensions.If you value 3D adventure movies, John Carter 3D is one to really consider adding to your collection. 2 hours of excellent 3D.

"To the point: This action/horror hybrid was filmed using Red Epic 3D cameras on the set for most of the film, and the result? Good 3D in Underworld Awakening. When the movie starts, it's in 2D highlighting the previous films, but then it switches to 3D and wow. For 3D, I consider it great when the foreground, mid ground and background pop very clearly from one another in depth so there's no mistake it's 3D. This is clearly the case with Underworld Awakening during many scenes, but sometimes, the 3D pales and looks a bit flat during non action moments. The 3D is comparable to Resident Evil Afterlife 3D, which used the Fusion Cameras as Avatar 1 did.Underworld Awakening 3D: Top notch 3D that has excellent depth and pop, as well as some 'pop out' moments with Selene's famous throwing stars and the Lycans attacking the screen. Very slick and stylish action throughout and Kate Beckinsale is fun to watch. The main storyline takes place 12 years after the 2nd film, Underworld Evolution.Movie: 8/10 Story was basic, but reveals unanswered questions.Action: 9/10 Plenty of stunts, blazing guns, martial arts and monsters. Nicely done.3D: 8/10 This was filmed in 3D using 3D cameras and looks GREAT at times.Recommended: YES, if you like this genre of movies.

"If you need another cool action movie with an epic ending battle sequence that lives up to the hype, coupled with some great 3D, The Immortals 3D is the disc to buy.3D: Great depth, where the foreground, mid and background are all separate from each other most of the time. The movie doesn't look flat, but pops out nicely. Granted, it was converted by a stereographic 3D team using the 2D film, but what's here is well done, even if there are a few minor flaws here and there.Action: If you enjoy the well filmed, easy to follow and very stylish action and slow motion sequences of Watchmen and 300, you'll enjoy this. The last fourth of the movie is practically all out brutal action.Story: The lead god has a son and trains him to be a hero, to defeat the evil Empire.

"I have been attuned to the Reiki master level. This book was assigned to me to read before I received the 3rd attunement.What it has going for it:* It covers each level's information and techniques. Many of the techniques I had never heard of nor conceived before, and they were easily practiced.* It gives several versions of the 5 Reiki Principles, including a photograph of an authentic calligraphy written by Usui himself, and translated. It also offers commentary on each.* It gives many insights into the process and struggles of running a Reiki business.* It describes as many types of Reiki as one could find on the Internet; it lists information and resources to find out more.* It has multiple illustrations showing hand positions, both touching and not touching clients.Each of these things are described in concise terms, easy to read and apply. There are review questions and activities at the end of each chapter, in case this book is chosen as a text for Reiki classes.This is a great Reiki reference. It does not give any symbols, but it does describe them, and their uses in clear and practicable terms.If you want a good reiki reference, get this one. Aside from not showing the actual glyphs of the symbols, this is a comprehensive Reiki manual, just as it claims.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1OO8X43XRPTA1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005ERIJRA#wasThisHelpful","R1OO8X43XRPTA1","A1B50WJ0J86M2B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1B50WJ0J86M2B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"What is the mantra? According to the Author, it is Abba, the name Jesus set forth in The Lord's Prayer.Why am I telling you plainly?I have been researching mantras for the past few months, trying them out. I wanted to know The Christ Mantra. So I started reading. I wanted to know, too.I soon realized that without the right thoughts, without the right relationship to God, the mantra is nothing, has no power.As a Maserati is pointless for a man who does not know how to drive, this mantra is worthless to the Magic Word crowd. Abra Cadabra is another example: supposed to be the key to magick, but to the uninitiated is gobbledygook.Read this. I don't think the Author has everything correct (i.e. calling sahasrara ""the eye of the mind""), which knocked his 5 stars to 4, but this is a worthy read.Just be careful. Read, think, try it out, consider and research it all. Have a copy of the Bible with you, too. The Author uses imagery and background that emphasizes things different from 99.9% of Christianity.

"I thought this book would be instructional. I wanted to know about crystal healing with chakras. So I got it.Positives (why this book received 2 stars):Information: it had descriptions of various chakras which seemed consistent with other sources. It gave names of crystals and stones which are supposed to correspond to each chakra.Negatives:1). Poor Presentation: Google translate seemed to have been used, because syntax and word choice were just ""off"" quite a bit.

Any native English speaker would be able to tell this was a Translate problem, and not an ""I'm an idiot with a word processor"" problem. It was distracting.2). Lack: It gave absolutely no information about healing, or the process one may undertake, or experiences that may occur, or which stones/ crystals would work better for which manifested condition, or which chakras were necessary to employ stones with them, at which times.... I really have no background with chakra-stone healing, but these are questions I'd expect answered by a quality resource.3). Lack: the book just... Ended.

"The first couple of chapters are devoted to ""Surrender"". Letting go. Allowing the mud in your puddle of consciousness to sink to the bottom, so you may think clearly. This is very important, and I was glad the author opened this instructional book with this. Surrender is not a subject ""shiny, happy, popular"" or more famous faces like to address, because it gets messy quickly, for people to open up and forgive... themselves... others... God.These two chapters are worth the two stars out of five. However, from chapter three up to the last two pages of the book, information is typed out in a style which clearly broadcasts that all of it is actually transcribed Q&A conversations of instructor-to-paying-customer, where terms are either undefined, loosely defined, or written as if instruction has already taken place, and the reader just ""misses out"" because they weren't in California at the right hotel for two days in the same forum as the questioners.The last two pages are extant apart from his wandering waffle of instruction in telepathy: They are clear, concise, and practicable if the reader is fortunate enough to have a partner who doesn't care if you try to invade their mind just before they go to sleep. Let me draft a summary:1. Find someone willing to co-practice reading each others' minds.2. Write a bunch of different emotions out on separate slips of paper. Place the slips into a proverbial ""hat"" to be pulled out by one of you.3. Sit 5 feet apart, facing each other.4. One person pulls an emotion slip out of the ""hat"".  A) they facially act out the emotion. The other person guesses it. (This is supposed to align the pair of consciousnesses.) Cycle through all the emotions.  B) they cycle through all the emotions at random again, physically masking half of the details, but mentally projecting memories of these emotions to the other person.  C) again, cycle through them at random, but giving no physical clue what is supposed to be projected.5. Take notes on what worked or did not work. Compare them.

"Okay, okay: read the first few pages, there are a few nuggets in them. When you get tired of idiosyncratic use of words and phrases that may not fit anyone else's preferred pattern of speech, skip to 58%. You will miss out on inappropriate use of contractions, sentence fragments, and unnecessary comma placements throughout an aimless waffle of redundant chatter loosely based on the topic of meditation.After that, the author does share GOLD. I've meditated for two decades, and never considered some of it. An example: hand posture, what some may call ""mudras"". I have 5 books on the subject, but never considered WHY some of it works, and the way he explained two examples was so ""common sense"", I marveled that I had never seen it before, and felt that half of the book's cost was worth that alone!The author clearly knows his subject, and just as clearly has some good stuff to say. What keeps this book from being five stars is 1) the overall lack of organizational flow, and 2) the conversational tone was too loose for a non-fiction book.However much I may or may not like the presentation, though, the ""meat and vegetables"" of this dish were too good not to give a decent score. Sort of like getting a 5-star restaurant to deliver their food in McDonald's wrappers.Overall, I'm glad I read it.

If you haven't heard of him, lucky you. If he's heard of you, you're either dead, undead, or you cause people to be one or both of them...In the opening chapters, we see his connection to a few deaths (work related), learn the process of the Supe investigations involving a White/Grey witch, wizards, goblins, and become wary of the intrusion of a 16th-century wizard turned vampire who just might be more than an innocent bystander....Get it. If you like the Dresden Files, the Iron Druid, or Rachel Morgan, you'll be very pleased.

"This is both a good primer for those yet unaccustomed to the discipline of meditation AND a refreshing take on a popular spiritual topic that ""practiced"" individuals will like; instead of being touchy-feely, the author describes the process, common issues and solutions, and uses simple (yet effective) imagery.For ""old hats"" to meditation: In the 20 or so years I've given over to mental disciplines, the strategies, goals, techniques, and ""levels"" expressed in this work really are unique. I found myself making notes about them, more so than the last 15 books I've purchased and practiced through. Chances are you'll find many ""take-with-yous"".A small sticking point for me: It makes strong claims of ""quick"" advancement (months instead of years), but as there is no way to prove one's own growth (with whom could you or I compare such subjective results?), the claims would be difficult to verify.That said, the author spells out what to do, possible ways to do it, what to look for, and WHY the Rose Way process works. Give it a whirl.Chapter headings include:1. Introducing the Rose Way meditation (RWM)2. An overview of the basics3. Preparing for the RWM4. The RWM up and down the chakras5. The level of the Rose6.

"The author starts out with personal testimony that seems common:1. Fat man looks for change agent.2. Fat man finds change agent, and commits to it.3. Not-so-fat man gets pulled away from change agent due to life events, time constraints, or insufficient benefits.4. Fat-again man repeats steps 1-3.Then he realizes how to stream-line the yoga process. Spiral Up Yoga is the result.His premise is this: even if Something is good for you, if it costs you too much time or inconvenience, you won't follow through. And millions of my fellow Americans' waistlines are testimonies to this. And let's face it: he's right.So he stream-lined yoga to 5 to 10 minutes a day, incorporating parts that bring your body, mind, and soul into alignment.I've done yoga off/on for ten years.

"As the author says a few times, in the last two decades there was a lot of fascination with this stuff. I grew up on Indiana Jones and the Stories of Lost Nazi Occultism.

Pick it up, give it a whirl, if you like this kind of stuff. You won't regret it.Why only 4 stars?

"I ate up all the other books in the entire series. As much as a 30-something conservative male can appreciate female teen drama, I liked the premise and development of the storylines.Until this one.IDK why, but the characters feel flat, predictable, and terribly immature, even the older immortals portrayed. Complaining, petty, morose, weepy. Every vamp character's comment motivated by internal vindictiveness.As every other title in the series took me less than 3 days to finish (in limited personal time), I have tried to read this several times uncounted; I flip pages twice and get turned off by some silliness.I'm only 17% of the way through. I'm sure my curiosity for the story's resolution will eventually outweigh my peevish reception of this printed version of the authors' imaginations. Too bad for me I can't stand their concerted voice....","2.0 out of 5 stars","April 2, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2XOSJ6ZY90UGH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007IM0PRQ#wasThisHelpful","R2XOSJ6ZY90UGH","A1B50WJ0J86M2B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1B50WJ0J86M2B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have deeply appreciated Mr. Ashe's prior works. They detailed arcane information in straightforward terms. So, when I saw this one, I bought it immediately.Well, this book is more a booklet (641 Kindle locations). Also, it wasn't as much instructive as commentary. First disappointed, I realized that my difficulty lay more in my expectation than in what was promised and delivered.Practically: Anyone wishing for instruction in the various esoteric concepts presented should look elsewhere. (1 star) However, those in search if commentary on familiar qaballistic concepts written in decent tone will be pleased with it. (5 stars).So, the 3 stars is not a reflection of content, but of personal utility. I understand my review may get a few more ""no"" votes than ""yes"" for usefulness.

"I purchased this book because I am increasingly interested in the ""Energy Matrix-manipulation"" concept, and thought the take on it from a ritual viewpoint was an incredible idea. So many authors are choosing to self-publish, and I was excited to dig in to a fresh garden of ideas. Besides. For $2.99, what could I lose?Turns out, I could lose $2.99. Trying to write a topic sentence for my review, I had several ideas. I couldn't settle on one. ""Why?"" I asked, self-reflectively.I realized I was using the text of the book as a whole to compare the point of my review. The author, while having a good Intention to write an instructional book, did not execute well.In reflection upon her words, I saw that she assumed a few things about her audience, the major three being: 1) the reader already had experience with ritual terminology and schema; relatively few of her terms were defined, and the book has a general tone of a Spiritualist community member speaking at a Wicca/Pagan festival (I understand she stated clearly, multiple times, that it wasn't a book of witchcraft, but there aren't too many practices out there utilizing all the tools of witchcraft without espousing it... see Assumption #3). 2) the reader wanted to know her views on various topics indirectly related to her chapters' headings, and 3) the reader was tolerant of her idiosyncratic use of ""common"" metaphysical ideas without identifying their relation to the Energy Magic practical set of ideas (it IS a ""Guide"", right?). I will attempt to show these wrapped in commentary about each successive chapter.Chapter 1, ""Tools"", had an eclectic synopsis of various points of view on seemingly random ideas. Not until the ninth paragraph did she begin to enumerate the tools, and only after commentary on eclectic musings did she start: altar, elemental totems, grimoire, container. Yet she neglected to include what importance each of these things had specifically for her concept of energy magic. Lacking in appearance in this Number 1 chapter of Energy Magic was... ENERGY! And a definition of Magic! And what ritual had to do with either concept! And why each tool listed above HAS to be there for Magic's efficacy to be highest possible (something she reports she spent considerable time poring over...).Chapter 2, ""Meditation"", had a few ""warm-up paragraphs"" of commentary (difficulty, what to expect, common issues) before she detailed three paths to experiencing altered states. She ended the chapter with the assertion that ""MEDITATION IS THE MOST IMPORTANT PART OF RITUAL"" [sic], but if it IS, why wasn't Altered State listed among the tools of ritual in chapter one? (Recognizing by assumption, of course, the magus' number one resource in magic is Mind... also not enumerated above.)Chapter 3, ""Ritual"", had a cleaner start: only four warm-up paragraphs of commentary. However, none of her terms were defined (sacred space, modifications, candle ritual, basic ritual [used in comparison with an undisclosed, subconsciously understood ""normal"" ritual], ""really basic"", the addition of ""interesting details"" later on, etc.), and their relations to the viewpoint of Energy Magic were not elucidated.Ritual steps as penned in this book: 1. Assemble altar; 2. Meditate; 3. Create sacred space; 4.raise/gather energy (this is the FIRST mention of Energy in the entire book, whose premise is... ENERGY! And according to the Kindle locations percentage bar, we are exactly 33% of the way through it!); 5. Charge your tools (no mention of this in the warm-up paragraphs of prep), 6. Use your tools; 7. Empty the Sacred Space; 8. Ground; 9. Clean up.For someone not wanting to present a book on witchcraft, she goes through a standard Wicca 101-type ritual, complete with asking cardinal directions to come into a circle... not their personification, or anthrorepresentative (I just made that word up to cover my concept), but the actual Directions of North, South, East and West. There is quite a bit philosophically wrong with this practice alone.Anyway. Chapter 4, ""specific Rituals"". She annotates her previous ritual layout slightly. Energy is seldom mentioned, and not as a focus concept.Chapter 5, ""timing"". There are only four instances when energy is mentioned, and none of them are the focal point of the topic, neither are they described in practical detail. Example: paragraph 2, ""times when ritual is powerful"". Quote: ""raising energy and sending it out to heal the world sounds simplistic... but every bit of positive energy helps.""Chapter 6, ""Stars and planets"". Absolutely no mention of Energy at all.Chapter 7, ""Rocks and Plants"". The author asserts ""Energy exists in everything."" But other than saying that different objects have ""special"" or ""specific"" energy that you should ""connect with"", the entire chapter has nothing to do with it. Chapter 8, ""Spirits and Deities"" is written in the same style.Overall, this book was not written in keeping with its premise.I do believe the author had an incredible premise, and she clearly has experience working with the concepts she so wanted to cast into words. I want to read this book when the author has clarified her purpose in EVERY paragraph.","2.0 out of 5 stars","April 2, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R8HV33ZNPZD05/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00C1T0TFY#wasThisHelpful","R8HV33ZNPZD05","A1B50WJ0J86M2B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1B50WJ0J86M2B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I followed this story through the weekly newsletter releases, but I have to say I thought it was much better reading it as a whole.  I was able to get into the story in a more emotional way.Teagan is Bryn's baby sister, and she has come to tour with the band much to Bryn's displeasure. From the moment she lays eyes on Jax she is drawn to him despite his bad boy ways.Jax is lead guitarist for Ruby Riot, he is full of himself when he is in rock star mode and has a no holds bar approach to living his life in that persona.But one girl, one smart, beautiful, and take no prisoners girl is about to bring him to his knees.  Of course it won't be that easy for him to grow up, he has a belief of what being a rock star is and it is hard for him to live a normal life.Being together is not easy for them, from those in their lives against it to the rabid violent fans making Teagan's life hell.  Add in Jax's out of control partying and Teagan's fears that she can't trust him, and it sounds like a recipe for disaster.But sometimes, even young love is the strongest.  Sometimes you find your soul mate where you least expect it.  And sometimes, you fight for what you know you can not live without.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RTGZXP7424ZJL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B017GYYDV4#wasThisHelpful","RTGZXP7424ZJL","AXMNLUJHA9RG7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AXMNLUJHA9RG7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"If you've followed the series you know Gavin and Dixie's history.  This book leads off with Dixie discovering Gavin has been lying about where he was and not contacting her when they were in the same place.  Now you would think that she would be done after that.  But not Dixie, the girl is as stubborn as they come when it comes to those she cares about.Gavin has secrets, ones he'd rather Dixie never know about.  But in order to get her back he is going to have to come clean and hope that she forgives him.  Some of his secrets were doozies, not that he filled her in on the graphic details.The Liam storyline, I can understand why that had to be in there but I really questioned whether Dixie's obsession was unhealthy.  Yes, she wanted him to be safe and happy but I just don't see that it had to be her or nothing.There was a HFN finish to wrap up the series.

"This is now in the tight running for my very favorite steel water bottle, neck and neck with the Contigo one. For me, 16oz is the ideal size -- anything larger and it's awkward to hold and probably doesn't fit in my car drink holder, and anything smaller seems to disappear in a gulp or two. Just like the Contigo one, this does a great job of preventing spills, even if you are as klutzy as I am. One of the things I love about my Contigo is that I can even drink water from it while lying down in bed without splurting water all over my face (a blessing while on bedrest, let me tell you!) -- this Aladdin mug isn't quite that adept, but I only have to raise my head a little bit. This Aladdin mug also has two advantages over the Contigo one -- it is easier to get the lid/mouthpiece totally clean, and it doesn't do that ""release of pressure spurt"" that the Contigo one sometimes does when you push the button. Other pluses here:* The coating is very smooth and nice to touch, and it doesn't freeze my hand straight out of the fridge like many steel mugs/bottles do.* The color is gorgeous, and it seems to hold up well to every day drops and bumps. I've had other steel water bottles that within days showed every scratch and ding in the color, but this one seems much sturdier in that regard.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R24833VXPDCF1I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0142JR5YI#wasThisHelpful","R24833VXPDCF1I","A3H9FJL67HJA3D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3H9FJL67HJA3D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is one of those products where you can actually trust it to be exactly as described. It's a thicker, more durable material than your typical re-sealable bag, and it is indeed super easy to get completely closed with the sliding lock. I've had unfortunate experiences with generic versions of this in which the plastic slider kept the bag from quite sealing closed that last two milimeters, and that can lead to problems since air gets in and liquids can leak out. With this one, though, no such issues. The only minor challenge I encountered is that because the material is thicker, it is a little bit more work to get all the air squeezed out (which I generally try to do when freezing things).

I've left it where it is because the cats do seem to enjoy watching it from the windows, but it would probably look quite a bit nicer in a better kept part of the yard. That said, there were some definite pros and cons here:On the upside --* Super easy to assemble and install -- it only took a few minutes, and I don't think it would have taken even a child much longer.* Thus far, it's held up relatively well to the elements.

My grandmother probably would find it so, as well.On the downside --* It's not quite as 3-dimensional as I'd thought from the picture. Admittedly, I didn't look or read closely enough, because I was expecting something a bit more globular in shape. Instead, this is has two 2-dimensional circles parallel to each other and spinning in opposite directions. The butterflies tweak out a bit in different directions, which both gives it some shape and allows the wind to catch it better, but it's still very much two plates with their backs to each other rather than a 3D globe.* It's almost too bright and cheerful for me -- almost as if it will start shooting out Hallmark greeting cards at any moment.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1LOB850KVI6EB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012CUOKNS#wasThisHelpful","R1LOB850KVI6EB","A3H9FJL67HJA3D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3H9FJL67HJA3D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Medicine balls really don't need anything fancy to be functional, and so going ""generic"" with AmazonBasics totally makes sense for something like this. The weight is distributed nicely and evenly, which was definitely not the case for the brand name medicine ball of the same size I'd picked up at Sears and returned. I like that the material is just grippy enough that it's easy to hold (even with sweaty hands), but not so grippy that it would pick up lint and cat hair and such (which my yoga mat totally does). I also like that the colors are bright without being flashy or distracting.

"Although I usually like my books to be densely packed, so that I can feel like I'm getting my money's worth, I really appreciate that this particular book is paced more gently with double-spaced text, plenty of white space, and great water color illustrations. I'd always found the idea of birdwatching tempting -- I get a great variety of birds in my yard, and my hiking pace is perfect for birdwatching (i.e., slow with plenty of breaks). But the various field guides and such that I'd picked up all seemed to assume that I already understood the basic mechanics of bird watching, and so I never felt quite sure what I was doing or what I needed to be looking for.This book does an excellent job of going step by step -- and not in a patronizing way, but in a clear and enjoyable way. The steps are ""bite sized"" enough that this book would work well across a wide age span, or for a family venturing into birdwatching together. (As a side note, this book would be truly first rate for a family wanting to do Charlotte Mason style nature study together). So the book doesn't just have information for you, it also has activities at each step -- for example, there is information about the different types of field guides, and then activities around buying a field guide and becoming familiar with it and learning to use it. There are other guided activities on a range of topics, including using binoculars, sketching birds, creating a bird-friendly yard, and becoming involved in online birdwatching communities and their efforts in tracking birds and species.My only minor beef with this book is that the font they used makes the page numbers hard to read at times -- but while that would be a serious hassle with a field guide where you are referencing the index frequently, it is only a minor irritation here.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RWMRLXGSEQ2A4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1624141188#wasThisHelpful","RWMRLXGSEQ2A4","A3H9FJL67HJA3D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3H9FJL67HJA3D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Although I love zip-up swaddle sacks because of how easy they are to use -- and how blessedly quiet they can be in the middle of the night -- these SwaddleMe swaddle wraps are probably the easiest way to get a dependable swaddle with a custom level of snug-ness. You can also customize how tight and snug a swaddle is with a regular blanket, but that can be more challenging to do in the middle of the night (especially if you don't have a good space for blanket origami), and it can be pretty easy for some babies to wiggle loose from. With the SwaddleMe, it's easy enough to get the baby swaddled up as snug as you want them, even in total darkness and in limited space, and the velcro keeps the swaddle exactly as you set it. Although some babies are going to be strong enough to Houdini themselves out of the SwaddleMe, those babies are also likely rolling over already -- and once a baby can roll over, it's no longer safe to keep their arms swaddled at night.The packaging on the SwaddleMes claims that you can easily remove the legs from the swaddle for a diaper change, and while that's kind of true, I haven't been able to figure out how to make it happen without undoing the middle velcro (the one that attaches the legs pocket to the first wing at the baby's chest). The've used a relatively strong velcro to hold the swaddle firmly, but that means that it takes some tugging and makes some considerable noise to undo -- and then once you're done with the diaper change, it is a little awkward to re-fasten that way, since you're having to sneak a layer of fabric under the velcro and then fasten it there. There definitely are other swaddle wraps out there that make for much easier late night diaper changes than this one. On the plus side, as the velcro goes, I really appreciate that they have stay-put tabs for the velcro to fasten on to during laundry, which keeps the velcro from snagging on the other clothes in the load.Lastly, I will say that the cotton knit fabric these are made from feels a bit rougher straight out of the packaging than do some other types of swaddle wraps, but they do soften up considerably with washing.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2UXX2H3YFM4ZS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0100O60W2#wasThisHelpful","R2UXX2H3YFM4ZS","A3H9FJL67HJA3D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3H9FJL67HJA3D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have several other puppets from Folkmanis at this point, so I inevitably ended up comparing this one to those. And you know, there are ways in which I would expect a T-Rex puppet to differ from a monkey puppet, and Folkmanis did not let us down in that respect:* Whereas my other Folkmanis puppets are all soft and fuzzy (even the pig), this T-Rex is sleek and glisteny, which really works.* It has very visible teeth, all ready for a big roar. My only concern about the teeth is that they are made out of stiff felt, and I'm not totally confident that they will hold up as well or as long as the rest of the puppet. This T-Rex may eventually need some dental and orthodontic care.* The proportions are a little different, in that it's not quite as heavily foreshortened as many of the other puppets I have. The only odd thing about the proportions for me is that if I try to have my fingers in the arms and in the mouth at the same time, the neck/shoulders area basically collapses down because my hand isn't quite big enough to reach. That may be less of an issue for those of you who don't have my tiny mutant hands, or who aren't trying to operate the head and hands at the same time.All in all, it's a good T-Rex puppet. I will give the heads up (in case it isn't super obvious from the item picture) that this puppet is more of a ""fierce"" dinosaur than a ""happy and friendly"" dinosaur like Barney -- while some kids would absolutely love it all the more for that reason, this puppet comes across as just fierce enough that it has scared a few little ones.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1PXMBJWI6C7U1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0002EH3IQ#wasThisHelpful","R1PXMBJWI6C7U1","A3H9FJL67HJA3D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3H9FJL67HJA3D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a great pig puppet. Unlike a real pig, it is made of this deliciously soft plush. That said, I appreciate that they tried to make it a more realistic pig rather than a ""cute"" pig -- it's a little on the funny side, the the grunting noise it makes when you squeeze his haunches is a a nice deep, throaty grunt, and nothing like the squealing oink you hear from so many toy pigs. The hands and head are quite easy to manipulate --- I just don't have quite the right fingers to do a great job of manipulating the mouth on this one, although that may improve with practice.

"This is such a very awesome puppet. I love how very soft the plush is, and that it's big enough to be convincing. I was also thrilled that instead of the typical puppet mouth movement, with this one you can turn the head around just like a real owl. When I first tried it, I couldn't get the wings to flap realistically, but then I tried using it with my hand inserted palm up -- it was just as easy to manipulate that way, and the movement looked awesome. In case it's helpful, I have relatively small hands (i.e., I wear children's gloves), and was still able to use this just fine.I am sure that people might have many reasons for wanting a snowy owl hand puppet -- but I can tell you that this one will be a truly excellent Hedwig for anyone dressing up like Harry Potter. :)","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ZETCJMEIXKXB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00000K5F9#wasThisHelpful","R1ZETCJMEIXKXB","A3H9FJL67HJA3D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3H9FJL67HJA3D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It's entirely possible that I would have enjoyed this game more if I wasn't -- like so many other reviewers here -- comparing it to the version that I played as a child. In comparison, this one is not only a lot easier, but there are a couple of things about it that are frustrating:* The tweezers you use to extract the items from the body are attached to the game board with stiff plastic rope -- not only does it make it hard to get just the right angle for some of the spots, but the rope also flops awkwardly across the board.* This may sound petty, but I was irritated that so many of the pieces now aren't really linked to the body part in an interesting way. In the original game, there was a mix of actual body parts (bones and such) and pieces derived from the common name for things -- like an apple at the Adam's apple. This version has things like a cell phone to extract from the hand, etc.* And as far as why it's easier, I think there are a couple of things. Almost all of the pieces have handy ridges in the middle that make it extra easy to grab with the tweezers, even if you can't reach any of the edges. On top of that, the slots they are in on the game board are larger, and so it's pretty easy to use the tweezers to move the piece around until you have a good spot to grab.While I was pretty disappointed with the game, I still think it will be fun enough to have around for parties and such -- which is why I'm giving it a 3-star rating instead of 1-star.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R16BRLHZZZBBS2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SDJG6MG#wasThisHelpful","R16BRLHZZZBBS2","A3H9FJL67HJA3D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3H9FJL67HJA3D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Given my food allergies, I was all excited to find a new nutritional shake powder that was soy-free and dairy-free.

"This is an incredibly moving book, with a lot of historical depth and detail, delving into the stories of the women from many different backgrounds who ended up in a Nazi concentration camp that was specifically for women political and social prisoners. I loved that it went into the stories of the women you don't often hear about in the plethora of WWII histories, biographies, and memoirs -- women whose stories were often overshadowed by their male colleagues, or even by the overwhelming tragedy of the Jewish genocide. I also appreciated that the book tried to pull together all sorts of side threads -- the stories of the women who worked at the camp, the stories of the prisoners in their lives before and after their time at the camp. Another strength of this book is that it manages to hit a good balance: it doesn't skirt from describing the atrocities or the emotional weight they carry, but it doesn't seem to go into detail purely for the shock value, either. More than most books of this sort, this one also seemed to make real effort to not look at things with a black and white lens; almost no one is presented as a caricatured hero or villain, and there are shades of grey everywhere.That same strength also became a struggle, though. The sheer mass of non-linear threads was clearly really challenging to weave together in a cohesive way. If the book was aimed purely at research scholars, this might not be as important -- the book could be an organization of facts and evidence. But because this book was trying to reach a broader population of readers, the author seems to try to pull these threads together into a story. At times, that works, but there are a lot of places where the cohesion really struggles. The end result is a book that is difficult at times to read because of the emotional weight of the content, and difficult at times because it may have needed a firmer editing hand. Still very much worth reading, just know that it may take some dedicated effort.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R19TDMGJ4C0WCX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=038552059X#wasThisHelpful","R19TDMGJ4C0WCX","A3H9FJL67HJA3D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3H9FJL67HJA3D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I enjoy watching trashy reality TV -- including shows about child beauty pageants, the Dallas Cowboy Cheerleaders, and crazy dance and cheer moms -- so I figured this book would be up my alley. The cover copy made it sound like the book was very much inspired by Honey Boo Boo and her family, and perhaps it was.And the thing is, I still think that someone could take that exact set-up and create a hysterical and compelling book out of it. Unfortunately, that wasn't what happened here. I won't go so far as to say that the book has no plot -- I've seen that claimed elsewhere, but I actually think there is indeed a plot about self-delusion, denial, and still hanging on to love amidst all of that. It may not always be an interesting plot, but the story does indeed evolve and move forward. The characters may be overly cliche in places, but have some unexpectedly interesting depth to them at times as well -- especially the older daughter (Bailey) and the teen girlfriend (Courtney). So that, plus some truly entertaining moments sprinkled in throughout, were enough to keep me reading and enough for me to give this book 3 stars instead of 1 or 2.That said, I actually found myself stopping to think at the end of every chapter whether I actually wanted to keep reading or not, and it was a near thing almost every single time. More than anything, it's because the book reads as if every decision -- every line of dialogue, every action each character takes, even every description of the setting -- was driven solely by the answer to the question, ""What would be the trashiest possible option right here?"" That might make for a very useful writing exercise in a workshop, or even for some awesome scenes within a book that didn't hit every single thing with the same hammer. For me, at least, that meant that the book soon became tiresome instead of funny, icky instead of shocking, and dripping with pathetic instead of pathos.","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Y760VQM9FB90/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250049725#wasThisHelpful","R1Y760VQM9FB90","A3H9FJL67HJA3D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3H9FJL67HJA3D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"As with some of the other reviewers, I don't find it to be 100% accurate. I have never learned to do flip turns, and every now and then my push off from the wall isn't strong enough for it to register it as a new length of the pool. And while it is good at differentiating between free and breaststroke for me, it tends to log backstroke as free and fly as either free or breast, depending. I'm sure that is largely because my form sucks, especially as I get tired, but it's still frustrating, especially because I have yet to find a way to correct the data.That said, the swim swatch is still absolutely worth it for me -- what data it does capture correctly still gives me clear and tangible evidence that my endurance is improving and my speed is improving (even if my form and efficiency are not), and that is what it takes to get me back in the pool again every #@&$@! day.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1KD899F1BYMV5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008EFU5T4#wasThisHelpful","R1KD899F1BYMV5","A3H9FJL67HJA3D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3H9FJL67HJA3D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"One on hand, I love that Tyr puts out swimsuits in plus sizes that look like the athletic suits the swim team always had. And I love the bright retro colors. So I give them props for that, and I give them 2 stars rather than the 1 the suit deserves for functionality alone.Unfortunately, the suit pretty much fails at actually functioning as an athletic, lap swimming suit, despite seeming to fit perfectly fine (size 22) when I tried it on at home. First of all, the padded cups have relatively thin pads (which can be a good thing in an athletic suit) that aren't anchored in -- they basically ""float"" within the breast liner. While that works with the big thick pads that some suits have, these pads are thin enough that they end up bunching up, moving around, folding in half, etc., which means that they are never actually in the place where they're supposed to be, even if they start there at the beginning of your time in the pool. So not only is that uncomfortable, but you can end up looking like you have origami stuffed inside of the top of your swimsuit, because the folded or bunched up pad can stick out in oddly sharp angles. Secondly, if you swim with even a very small amount of speed, gravity pulls the cups backwards, which means they quickly end up bunched underneath your breasts, and basically encouraging your boobs to leave the safety of the swimsuit. Combine this with the fact that the straps are set a little too far apart (and no racer back or anything else that would hold the girls in firmly here), and you really have a disaster waiting to happen.Unfortunately, swimsuits can't be returned after they've been worn -- so follow my heed and don't buy this one, as there are much better options out there.

"I'm sure the other reviews have mentioned this, but just as a heads up -- this package does not include any glucose strips at all, not even the small starter sample of 5-10 that I'm used to getting with new meters. Secondly, it probably is not a surprise that you can't use this without an iPhone to plug it into -- but what you may not expect is that you can't use it at all the first time unless your iPhone can connect to their servers to register your account. The first several times I tried to use it, their servers kept timing out -- and so I was not able to get past the login screen to actually use the device until a few days later. The other iphone-enabled health devices I have all let you use the device itself even if there isn't any wifi/data access right then -- it just may not log your data long-term in the normal way. So not being able to start using it at all at that point was frustrating. It also encourages you to register via Facebook, which I personally found a bit creepy. I'm someone who keeps a lot of websites and apps integrated with Facebook, but my medical data just shouldn't be among them. Then, once I finally was able to get logged on, it couldn't proceed to actually taking a measurement because it kept being unable to scan the QR code on the bottle of test strips, so I kept getting an error message telling me that it couldn't scan the QR code because the device wasn't plugged in correctly. Apparently, the Align is incompatible with a wide range of iPhone cases, because it's too wide to access the headphone jack appropriately, which is how it plugs in -- in fact, it wouldn't work with any of the iPhone cases I had in the house, despite the fact that all of those cases work just fine with every headset I have.So with the case off, I was finally able to use it. The test strips are a little more finicky in terms of insertion into the device than what I'm used to, and the lancet device is definitely not one I would be using on an ongoing basis -- I'd just stick with the one I have left over from my previous meter, as the lancet is both awkward to use and oddly inconsistent in whether it works correctly. The way it tracks the readings is somewhat odd as well, and if you accidentally hit ""snack"" instead of ""meal"", it wants to count the reading as a fasting reading and irritatingly won't let you edit that later (again, different than my other logging readers like my OneTouch Ultra) -- which meant that it nagged me for having a ""very high"" reading of 131, which is a completely normal post-prandial reading by any stretch of the imagination.Other things I noticed:* While I like the cute little colorful silicone sleeves for the reader, it was a pain having one more thing to take apart and put back together for every reading, and I have to think I would end up losing it relatively quickly.* The app does, however, create decent looking graphs, even if they are accompanied by slightly patronizing smiley and frowny faces denoting your progress or lack thereof.","2.0 out of 5 stars","January 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RTJR20RJLE73R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N4T3CRM#wasThisHelpful","RTJR20RJLE73R","A3H9FJL67HJA3D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3H9FJL67HJA3D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I will admit up front that I loved the first ""Princess Academy"" book, but was much less enthusiastic about the second one. So I started reading this book with hope, but also with some trepidation. Luckily for me, I found this one almost as engaging as the first. The characters were just as compelling, and I wanted to root for Miri and her friends just as hard. Miri is sent to a serious backwater swamp to start a new ""princess academy"" on her own with some unwitting ""royal cousins"", to prepare them for a marriage that might save the country from war -- and finds things not quite as the King and Queen had told her. The only thing that kept this from being a 5-star book for me was how many things just really stretched believability. I'm totally ok in a book like this with the premise that Miri can communicate and see past memories via the linder stones; but it's much harder to believe that some of the serious hurdles the girls faced would have been solved so easily, or that the King would have been too dimwitted to have taken better precautionary steps from the get go.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R20OC2T3POSWIS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1619634856#wasThisHelpful","R20OC2T3POSWIS","A3H9FJL67HJA3D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3H9FJL67HJA3D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

But while I'd been all excited about the flaps that open so that you can drink while the cap is on -- and potentially prevent spills, etc. -- the reality is that the ridges and protruding bits of plastic on the cap make it relatively uncomfortable to drink from, since they jut into your lip and nose when you go to drink.

"I came into this one without having read the first volume of the series Children of Fire- as such I couldn't be sure whether or not the piece was going to be somewhat enjoyable or a total disaster.  While the author and publisher surely advise jumping into a fantasy series anywhere other than at the beginning, the end result was firmly somewhere between the two extremes.The bad news, in this instance anyway, is that there is absolutely no effort to provide any sort of recap of the prior volume here.  The piece literally opens with a prologue, written in present tense oddly enough, detailing some exiled Slayers feelings just prior to an assassination attempt.  From there its into the (much more fluid) past tense adventure prose so common in fantasy literature.I suppose the greatest strength on display here would have to be Karpyshyns pacing.  For a multi-part fantasy series, his writing is surprisingly concise and not overly flowery.  This is certainly welcome, especially in the early-goings of the tale as, and Im not trying to be overly critical when I say this, not a lot actually happens.For those of us just coming into the fold, the author does a pretty solid job introducing the fairly robust cast of characters at this point without making it feel like standard introduction fair.  Of course the downside to this is that readers who already know this entourage from the first book may find the minutia a bit more intolerable.By about the 3/4th point onward, the payoffs do begin to come together pretty nicely and that decent pacing carries right on through to the books conclusion.As is so common in fantasy prose, the story is told across multiple character viewpoints; some more consistently interesting than others.  Again Im reluctant to criticize developments that I wasnt enamored with here simply because I cant speak intelligently on which threads carried over from the first book.  Its entirely possible some of the character angles I found rather dull are actually important plot developments that readers have been waiting on since the first books release.All in all, The Scorched Earth is an enjoyable fantasy romp that somehow manages to avoid becoming bogged down upon itself.  The second book in a series is often credited as being the most difficult to deliver cleanly because, by all facts and circumstances, it contains neither a genuine beginning or end.  However, The Scorched Earth doesnt seem to concern itself too heavily with this reality.  Rather, it marches along at the beat of its own drum until, by the end, most of the threads introduced are wrapped up pretty satisfactorily.  Plus the magic is undeniably interesting throughout.I cant go quite as far as to say I was intrigued enough with the characters or plot to continue on with the series (or in this case backtrack to the beginning) but solid plot structure and efficient prose do have me interested in taking a look at some of the authors entries into the Star Wars universe.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R28R9L3YWOZ2OS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0345549368#wasThisHelpful","R28R9L3YWOZ2OS","AHF97M45JFCB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AHF97M45JFCB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Let me begin by professing my adoration for the fantasy literature medium.  Like so many others, I began with Tolkien in my middle school youth, followed that up with Le Guin, Brooks and on to the heavier hitters as my tastes matured: Feist, Jordan, and more recently Hobb and Martin.  I not only enjoy reading fantasy novels in my spare time but I also like to keep current on the scene itself.  And while I can claim an obsession for fantasy books, I cannot, however, say that I know much about the Live Action Role Playing (LARPing) movement other than vague awareness of costumed individuals attending themed events at regular intervals.As such, it was more my love of fantasy reading and studying of TORs 2015 catalog that directed my attention toward The Sleeping King over its ties with the Dragon Crest LARP universe created by Bill Flippin (on which this book is based).Since youre reading my review for the book itself, Ill cut to the chase with my thoughts there- this tale is rife with potential, the likes of which could excite fantasy fans and adventure aficionados alike, but falls pretty well short of expectations in my opinion.Strangely enough, it starts out on a very promising note.  The reader learns of an omnipresent empire built upon psychic tyrannical rulers and is thrust directly into the politics and corruption taking place on the highest levels there.  Its never made clear if this is our own world (called Urth by its inhabitants), things start to take on a flavor of complicated political intrigue when suddenly things shift gears at Chapter 2.  Drastically.Instantly were transported across sixteen years, several geographical miles and and an entire literary genre.  Gone are the politics of the Empire and in their place the trials and tribulations of a bunch of teens with elven ties.  We have Will, a good-natured, if overly flat-footed (in terms of character development, not literally his feet) lad with a family secret.  Weve got highborn elf teen Raina and her pal Justin, who have to take flight due to plight.  Theres Rosana and smuggler elf Cicero.  Yes the politics in the beginning come back to weave a part in the tale but the tonal shift is such that one almost has to wonder if Bill Flippin was charged with writing and developing the Imperial portions of the book while romance author Cindy Dees handled teen romance duties.However it actually came to be, the finished product doesnt transition very well.  Further complicating matters is the fact that were introduced to boatloads of races (from psychics to elves, from orcs, to goblins and ogres) with nary a descriptor as to how this universe defines each.  Sure you gather little things like orcs having green skin and elves possessing pointy ears and a talent for magic, it is very wise to go into this one not expecting even a tiny fraction of Tolkiens penchant for demonstrating the nuances between varying staple cultures of fantasy.  Elves come off as, well people with pointy ears.  Orcs, just like goblins, ogres and any of the other baddies are mindless brutes.  One hates to use the term fantasy tropes but its hard to imagine a more fitting descriptor to encompass the generic, copy & paste style fantasy culture on display here.Then theres the dialog.  Most of the time its passable but there are some moments where Dees seems to forget entirely that shes working within the realms of fantasy.  Modern terms, expressions and slang make their way into the fold with regularity.  Not to suggest we need all of our fantasy to be written in Old English of course, it is rather difficult to suspend disbelief when you pause to note phrases like, It isnt as dire as all that in your fantasy dialog.The narrative slips in and out of rhythm too- often asking rhetorical questions of the reader.  To provide a quote: So hard to read, elves.  All elegance and urbane sophistication on the outside, but who knew what went on between those pointed ears of theirs?  This, coming from the character viewpoint of an elf!I have heard others label this book a difficult read and I concur but not for the usual reasons of difficulty in fantasy:  Never mind the overly verbose nature of Wheel of Time, the complexity of lineage in A Song of Ice and Fire or the lack of setup in The Malazan Book of the Fallen, The Sleeping Kings complexity lies entirely within its text.  Literally.  Sentence structure is flat at best and incorrect at worst, flow is choppy and the prose- well, lets just say Dees likes to leave a lot to the readers imagination when it comes to providing sensory details concerning the planet Urth.All in all, the piece does have its moments.  The patient reader who can overcome the basic prose, choppy transitions and cobby interactions will likely enjoy how the seemingly unrelated story threads connect by the end.  Additionally the integration of various Guilds is rather well done.  Death, interestingly enough, is a very temporary state here as magic wielders possess the ability to resurrect individuals on the cusp of leaving the mortal coil and even new bodies can be generated for those specters whose flesh is simply too tattered to attempt a return.  Yes, it could be argued that this is the natural extension of the role playing mentality, I personally appreciated Dees' explanations for such things here.Of course it could be argued that the flip side to this is that wounds tends to heal remarkably quick in this world and the threat of death is merely an annoyance so there isnt really too much risk to the characters on their quest either.  If George RR Martin can be criticized for killing off too many of his characters, Cindy Dees could be faulted for not killing enough of hers.In conclusion, The Sleeping King will most assuredly disappoint die hard fans of fantasy though I suspect the young adult crowd and fans of the LARP experience on which this piece is based will be far more forgiving.  I think my own problem going in was that I kept encountering claims of The Sleeping King being TORs latest epic fantasy series when in fact its much more a complicated young adult adventure in its delivery than it is the next Wheel of Time.  Going in with such expectations will certainly make the experience a more enjoyable one.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R17J7KTWEGS1N8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=076533514X#wasThisHelpful","R17J7KTWEGS1N8","AHF97M45JFCB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AHF97M45JFCB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The trouble with reviewing a film as hyped and popular as Big Hero 6 is that there isnt much about the piece that hasnt been already said.  I suppose the place for me to start would be to confess that Ive been a little leery of the Disney acquisition machine.  If theres one thing the business world teaches us its that monopolies are dangerous.  Disney has been on a tear in the entertainment industry of late, scooping up entire powerhouse studios like Marvel and LucasFilms.  And while its true that they have pockets deep enough to do the properties they are inheriting justice, some of their sensibilities and practices are worthy of skepticism to be sure.That said Big Hero 6 alleviates any such concerns quite convincingly and in fact can be viewed as one of the finer outings of either of the two companies of late.Based on a lesser-known Marvel Comics title with strong anime ties and set in the fictional but scarily detailed city of San Fransokyo, we follow the exploits of young robotics wizard Hiro Hamada (Ryan Potter) and his big brother Tadashi (Daniel Henney). After a series of events, Hiro ends up inheriting is older brothers masterwork; an innocent inflatable vinyl nurse robot named Baymax (Scott Adsit) as well as his brothers student colleagues from a prestigious robotics institute.From there the plot takes a decidedly simplistic narrative turn in the great tradition of Scooby-Doo whereby a masked villain appears with evil intent that only the likes of a group of teenagers and their dog, er I mean vinyl nurse robot can foil.  However, while this would ordinarily sound like a slam, the fact of the matter is rich character development, beautifully placed (and timed humor) and one of the richest environments in the CG medium to date can make the fairly straight-forward plot motivations forgivable.Even still there are a few pretty nice twists to keep viewers guessing and while the actual hero group itself doesnt quite evolve past the introductory phase, the core of this one hinges on the sincere relationship between Hiro and Baymax.  And what a relationship it is.  On the surface it is one of learning, growing together and the alternating roles of caretaker and receiver but dig a little deeper and there are themes of robotic ethics, the dangers of artificial intelligence and love that can transcend the definition of what we can consider an inanimate object.Comparisons abound between this one and Pixars much ballyhooed The Incredibles but I tend to fall into the line of reasoning that these are two very different approaches to CG animated super-heroism film (much in the same way you could throw DreamWorks Megamind or Universals Despicable Me into the class).  This is a geek-laden robotics film with a slant toward the value of friendship first and foremost where the group superhero dynamic slowly manifests by the end.  The Incredibles, to my way of reasoning, was more like a superhero commentary film from start to finish.  It took a lot of the cliches and tropes of the genre and used them to create humor against the family dynamic.At the end of the day though all that really matters is that its very difficult, if not impossible, to come away from the 108-minute visual feast that is Big Hero 6 without some manner of appreciation for the genre as a whole.  When viewed on its technical merit alone, the piece absolutely dazzles from the opening frame to the last shot (which takes place after the closing credits by the way).  Just a decade ago Pixar went on record as stating they shied away from trying to animate humans because there was far too much that could take away from the believability.  Yet here we have a piece that absolutely banks on the believability of its human characters expressions, mannerisms and interactions.  Not only that but it succeeds on a level so subliminally as to earn what is perhaps the greatest accolade to a good animated film in my opinion: at times its easy to forget that what you are watching is in fact an animated film.I suppose my biggest complaint about the piece (and its pretty minor in the grand scheme of things) would have to be that the marketing potential for this thing is off the charts and its pretty difficult to not envision a world packed with BH6 action figures, backpacks, lunch boxes, bed sheets etc. Not to mention the underlying sensation that this film must surely be positioned to serve as the introduction to a franchise/ series.  Aside from these minor distractions, Big Hero 6 is a wonderful experience for viewers of all ages and proof that, unlike in the world of business, a Disney monopoly may not be such a bad thing after all.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ACZ73QEAABJ5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QUG7R9A#wasThisHelpful","R2ACZ73QEAABJ5","AHF97M45JFCB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AHF97M45JFCB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have to admit that I came into this film with fairly high expectations even though a majority of the reviews about it have been pretty negative.  The reason I figured Khumba would succeed despite the criticisms had all to do with the studio behind it (Triggerfish) and the CG film they released prior to this one- Adventures in Zambezia.While Zambezia hadn't exactly forced Pixar back into becoming a software company, it did offer quite a bit of charm, had a stellar cast and somehow managed to dazzle visually despite a fairly modest budget.  Naturally, when I learned the same team was hoping to follow up the bird-centric Zambezia with a CG epic based on an outcast zebra forced into an exodus across the desert to achieve his destiny, I had pretty high hopes.  Suffice to say, I was indeed slightly disappointed with the end result but we'll get to that in a moment.  First let's take a quick look at the hard facts.Released in October of 2013 and built on a budget of roughly $20-mil, Khumba (pronounced ""coom-ba"") tells the 85-minute tale of a half-striped zebra born into a superstitious herd from behind the shelter of a fence of foliage they built for protection.Fearing his lack of hind-stripes as a bad sign (in this case a cause for drought), Khumba is rejected by most of his peers and elders and only in the dying breaths of his mother does he assemble the (fairly forced) trappings of a quest to find himself.Taking on a self-exodus of epic proportion, the titular character (Jake T. Austin) sets forth from the comfort and shelter of the zebra safe-hold as well as the company of his father (Laurence Fishburne) and tomboy/ peer Tombi (AnnaSophia Robb) into the unforgiving and vast Karoo region.Of course he is alone for nary a moment and ends up facing his destiny with a wide variety of odd cohorts including a shady wild dog named Skalk (Steve Buscemi), a  maternal and resilient wildebeest (Loretta Devine) and a moody ostrich (Richard E. Grant).  All the while he and his small band of like-minded travelers are pursued by the half-blind (but radar capable) leopard Phango (Liam Neeson).There are many things Khumba does well and I can't stress the importance of this as a production.  First of all the models and textures look, once again, fantastic.  There are many different routes a studio can take when it comes to the concept of talking animals in CG.  Triggerfish opted for specimens with a wonderful blend of photo-realism and personification.  The visual appeal isn't limited to the characters either; the environments, effects like sunsets and lighting are all top notch as well.  Truly the look of the film is truly never in question when finding fault.You also get some beautiful voice acting from some of the globe's top talent and, because the film was designed around the English-speaking cast, no concern of mismatched mouth flaps or mistimed dialog segments.  The well-cast performances are spot on and lend weight to the film right from the onset.Now for the bad news.  The quest itself is fairly typical in its build, tension and resolve and, if I may be frank, a little less inspired than expected.  Sure there are grander themes at play here like the notion that beauty is more than skin deep, that it's wrong to judge others because they may look differently and the alienation that comes with teen-hood can be cured by seeking out a magic watering hole.  Wait scratch that last one.  Anyway, the point is that the plot structure is very copy/ paste by its nature and it falls victim to its own lack of cleverness on multiple occasions throughout the film.  Perhaps not the least of which is in the pacing, which makes the 85-minute run-time feel much, much longer.Lessons come off as heavy-handed and unnatural and there are hints of some deeper plot threads floating about (like a wise mantis watching over Khumba's trek and the appearance of a gecko around every corner) that are never fully fleshed out.I'm of the opinion Triggerfish knew the meat and potatoes of the narrative were sorely lacking and they did what they could to compensate for this by integrating multiple attempts at humor into the fold (to varying degrees of success).  As a result we get a weak musical number from the ostrich about being ostracize, an encounter with a wacky over-the-top sheep named Nora, some sort of tribal hierarchy rodent society etc.  These do provide brief distractions from the fact that we are trekking across the desert in nearly real-time on a pretty ridiculous mission but the experiences are largely forgettable and strangely vacant.All in all, Khumba is loaded with great intentions and can be viewed as a decent family movie accordingly so long as the viewer(s) enter the film aware of the fact that the storytelling is absolutely nothing like we've come to expect from studios like Pixar, DreamWorks, Blue Sky and so on.  The film doesn't commit any major crimes so much as it brings nothing new, surprising or terribly interesting to the equation.

"Once in a while a CG animated feature arrives with a foundation so steeped in passion that the viewer simply cant help but get swept away in its purity.  Book of Life is precisely such a film.  I place it up there with A Monster in Paris in terms of being a wonderful surprise hit that gets lost in the proverbial shuffle of the industry; one where the deepest pockets usually determine the popularity of a given project.Book of Life is actually the feature directorial debut for Jorge R. Gutierrez, though youd never know it was his first attempt by watching it.  There are layers of sensibility integrated here that industry veterans struggle to find and often come up short.  Anyway, the films marketing has banked heavily on Guillermo del Toros name as producer.  And this isnt a bad thing either as it is sure to attract viewers to the fold who may otherwise scoff at the assumption that CG works are childrens territory only.While 20th Century Fox handles distribution of the project (yes, the same guys now handling both Blue Sky and DreamWorks catalogs), it is Reel FX Creative Studios (Free Birds) who did the visual and design work.  And what a job theyve done.  From lead characters modeled to appear as living wooden figures to the incredibly rich colors and revelry of Mexicos Day of the Dead Festival, there is so much detail and majesty layered here that multiple viewings are essential just to try and absorb a fraction of it all.The tale, which I suppose could be classified as a fable, centers on a love triangle between two very different men and a beautiful woman forced to choose between them.  Among these we have the good-hearted Manola (Diego Luna), a lad who comes from a long line of legendary bullfighters who is expected to pick up the family mantle despite the fact that he has no desire to harm a living animal.  Also vying for Marias heart and hand is the boastful mustachioed Joaquin (Channing Tatum), a military hero who is also living in the shadow of family expectation.Rather than a one-dimensional female character with nothing better to do with her time than to consider which of the two stud-muffins she has quarreling over her, we get Maria (Zoe Saladana), daughter of the villages aging general; a headstrong, independent woman who not only knows what she expects in a man, but has no trouble one-upping both of the suitors doing their best to impress her.Where things really get interesting, however, is that amidst the trials and tribulations of the lead characters, the multi-tiered structure of the plot also involves int intervention of a pair of dueling married deities who decide to make a wager on which of the two men Maria will decide to marry: La Muerte (Kate del Castillo) the angelic sugar skull who places her stakes on Manolos purity of heart and her husband Xiabalba (Ron Perlman), her devious counterpoint who feels the vanity and confidence of Joaquin will prove irresistible to Maria.In the middle of the two extremes we have the jovial Candle-maker (Ice Cube) who interjects some well-placed humor and balance to the grander themes of good and evil being presented.The voice acting is spectacular with nary a miscast character in the entire ensemble.  Pacing and comedic timing is wonderfully natural and the balance between narrative and prose delivery is spot-on.So what results here is a 95-minute journey where the surface experience is rife with humorous moments, gorgeous visuals, good music and genuinely memorable characters. Below the surface viewers are treated to a philosophical and spiritual quest with the type of timelessness one usually associates with an ancient Greek tragedy.Perhaps most impressive is that the Mexican themes and flavor of the film are no mere gimmick or shtick to make Book of Life stand out in the ever-deepening pool of modern CG animation but rather the quintessential cultural backdrop for a beautifully balanced view of existence.All in all I came away from the piece completely enamored with its charm and feel that it is nearly impossible to take it in without some appreciation for the scope of the project and the success Jorge Gutierrez manages to capture within.  Dont miss this, his debut to the medium but surely not his last.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1OL13Y9VCM9UZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Q5998XK#wasThisHelpful","R1OL13Y9VCM9UZ","AHF97M45JFCB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AHF97M45JFCB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"To my way of reasoning, 2008 represented a pretty interesting time in computer generated animation as Disney found itself in the tail-end of an identity crisis in effort to differentiate themselves from Pixar.  A mere two years prior (Jan of 2006), the two companies merged but this came after several tumultuous years of failed negotiations, to the point where Pixar threatened to seek distribution elsewhere.  As a result of this period, Disney released several substandard CG films in part to show the general public that it was vested in the emerging media but also surely to prove to Pixar that they could make a go of it with or without them.Among these we got The Wild, Chicken Little, Valiant, Meet the Robinsons and Bolt.  Yes its 2008 release places it well after the merger but the average development cycle for a CG feature film is 4 years.  Not to mention it is well known that in 2006, after having become the Chief Creative Officer at Disney, John Lasseter (along with other directors from Pixar) viewed early cuts of Bolt and provided then-director Chris Sanders notes on how to improve the story. According to Lasseter, Sanders was actually replaced on the project because of his resistance to the changes that Lasseter and the other directors had suggested.Anyway, looking back on Bolt now, it bears the unique distinction of feeling equal parts original Disney and Disney-Pixar collaborated.  It introduced the non-photo-realistic rendering (NPR) style that would go on to define the look of Disney CG pieces like Tangled and Frozen; which in essence combines life-like animation cycles against backgrounds that almost look hand-painted.  It's also rife with charming animal emotion/ expressiveness but with a story just clever enough to suggest the Pixar school of influence.Bolt tells the story of a celebrity canine, left purposely in the dark to the concept that prime-time television is in fact fictitious for the sake of getting authentic emotion, who is dropped into the real world and forced to fend for himself not only unprepared but unaware of the simple reality that he is, in fact, just an ordinary dog.Of course by ""the real world"", we mean the beautifully rendered digital real world where animals have the ability to talk to one an other but oblivious humans hear only barking, squeaking meowing etc.Celebrity dog Bolt, voiced by real-life celebrity John Travolta, encounters the rough and tumble realities that lurk beyond the walls of the studio set accompanied by a cynical abandoned cat (Susie Essman) named Mittens and overzealous hamster-in-a-ball named Rhino (Mark Walton).In the end he learns a thing or two about the true measure of a man, er I mean a dog and that the definition of a hero entails much more than simple props and special effects.Perhaps the piece's greatest strength lies in the fact that its laced with satire that adult viewers will appreciate while the kids clamor to the clean visuals and adorable animals.  In NY City Bolt encounters a trio of pigeons copied and pasted from Brooklyn's mean streets, in LA he must contend with aspiring screenwriter birds with lame ideas and too much enthusiasm.  As his journey across the continental US is based upon a children's map from restaurant chain Waffle World, we are given a glimpse into the comings and goings of Waffle World patrons on a state-by-state basis.The pacing is brisk, with scenes never meandering around aimlessly or dialog extending past what's necessary to get the point across.  While I prefer this to the opposite type of exposition (one that feels longer than expected or a plot that develops casually), it does feel a tad concise as only can be delivered by countless corporate board meetings and story board sessions to make every onscreen dollar spent count ala Disney or DreamWorks.All in all Bolt is an enjoyable trip to take for viewers of all ages even now, some 7-years after its initial theatrical run.  At the end of the day it strikes all the right chords yet somehow doesn't quite capture the majesty or mastery of the craft as had been expected from contemporary Pixar; perhaps explaining why it had been nominated for the 2008 Academy Award for Best Animated Feature, which it would go on to lose to Pixar's WALL-E.  Apparently Disney realized a simple reality that still holds true today: They can't lose by having Lasseter compete with himself.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R12CSZM38VW2HP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001OMU6UM#wasThisHelpful","R12CSZM38VW2HP","AHF97M45JFCB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AHF97M45JFCB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Heres the reality about Phase 4 Films- consistency is never a priority.  They go and acquire the English rights to foreign CG films and franchises and sometimes keep things faithful to the source material, other times not so much.  What we know as Bold Eagles is in fact the latest edition in a long-standing Norwegian childrens staple called Pelle Politibil.  Pelle is a talking police car who has been around since the 1980s and has recently made the transition into 3D CG with a couple of films.  Now interestingly enough, Phase 4 has already brought one of these films over here under the name Police Patrol back in early 2013.  Rather than call this one what it really is; the next Police Patrol movie, they opted to ditch any and all reference to Pelle in the marketing material and instead pawn this one off as a bird-themed talking animal flick in the vein of Rio or Open Season.Of course this would be fine and good except for the fact that very early on, in a world attempting to mix regular human beings with some (but not all) English-speaking animals, we have an anthropomorphic talking police car named Radar cruising around.  It fits into the prose with all of the subtlety of Pixar deciding to integrate Lightning McQueen into Up.All of that being said, Bold Eagles is the tale of a beautiful park/ nature preserve under attack by an RV-driving female poacher and her daughter.  Theirs is a mission of simple money-making by killing and having stuffed all of the animals they encounter in the park to be sold off as monuments to the wealthy.  The bad news is the Princess of Norway(?) opens the film by proclaiming that were anything to happen to the resident mother eagle and her egg, the park would be shut down.  While the human police officers are bumbling fools, Radar is on the case with an absent-minded otter the likes of which could make Finding Nemos Dory seem scholarly and what ensues is 72-minutes of pretty juvenile CG antics.Thats not to say the film is completely without its charms, however, and a few of the textures are very nicely done (among these eerily lifelike brown water in the lake and animals that sometimes appear to be almost claymation).  For an English dub over a foreign vocal track, the lip syncing is surprisingly decent, even if some of the choices for character accents are very strangely out of place. (Why does the Princess sound like shes from Texas?)In all, Bold Eagles doesnt commit any major crimes so much as it does nothing redeemable to make selecting it as a purchase or rental over a similarly priced DreamWorks or Disney piece a realistic option by any means.  Fortunately the pacing here is much more consistent (and less painful) than a lot of other domestic released CG DVDs made on the practice of slapping English over a foreign film.  Even still, though, its tough to get past the sheer oddity in this ones plot structure, thanks in no small part to the fact that this is at its core a story about a beloved talking police car that just so happens to have some eagles in it (not the other way around).  If youre set on trying to make the most of the character/ franchise for the young ones, youd probably be best off to start with Police Patrol then work into this one as a continuation of the universe established there.  The rest of us would probably be better just avoiding the whole thing altogether.","2.0 out of 5 stars","February 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3NDWPU33DHEWV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LGQVBXC#wasThisHelpful","R3NDWPU33DHEWV","AHF97M45JFCB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AHF97M45JFCB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Pirate Fairy is the 5th and (at the time of this reviews writing) most recent entry into Disneys CG animated Tinker Bell series.  The 6h film known as Legend of the NeverBeast has been announced and is already deep in production.I have to say, as an individual who has followed the entire series thus far (with the only absence coming in the form of The Secret of the Wings for whatever reason), I have to say that Pirate Fairy is to date the strongest entry into the series by far and easily much more deserving than the apparent lack of hype associated with it.Tinker Bell and the Pirate Fairy actually did receive a domestic theatrical release on February 13, 2014 and made it to the home market on DVD two months later on April 1st as just The Pirate Fairy.  Though budget information was never released publicly, estimates place production cost of the film somewhere around $55-million, having come from the DisneyToon division, the team who specializes in direct-to-dvd animated films (these are the same guys who ended up striking gold with the Planes franchise).  The Pirate Fairy grossed $65-mil at the box office alone but the real appeal, as per the rest of the Tinker Bell film series, was the home market.  Though a success on both fronts, I am of the opinion that with a bit more promoting, this one could have been a pretty big box office smash for Disney.  Perhaps not quite Frozen levels of supremacy but certainly on par with Planes.To my way of reasoning, the closer the Tinker Bell franchise comes to its Peter Pan roots, the stronger its becoming in terms of prose and interesting characters.  Not to suggest that the fairies and their daily coming and goings about Pixie Hallow arent interesting by themselves, they certainly are.  There is a fantasy element present here that is worth exploring regardless of age or what kind of movies you typically enjoy.  The bigger problem, at least as far as I can tell, has to do with the fact that the films undeniably appeal to girls; a reality only further driven home by the Tinker Bell branding, which, can actually cause many boys to steer clear entirely regardless of how well the story is told.The Pirate Fairy is the first to do away with the Tinker Bell moniker in its title and the material is finally coming together in a manner where Peter Pans integration into the mythos is on the horizon.  For me, these are some triumphs worth celebrating.This time we follow along on the exploits of a a misunderstood dust-keeper fairy named Zarina, who steals Pixie Hollow's all-important Blue Dust, in a bid to join forces with a small band of pirates from Skull Rock.  Tinker Bell and her cohorts put all of the pieces together and find themselves little choice but to embark upon a quest upon the high seas in effort to return the crucial Dust to its rightful place in Pixie Hollow.Comedy and new challenges arise when, in the midst of their pursuit of Zarina, Tinker Bell and her pals respective talents become switched.  The normally confident and in-control group are suddenly out of their respective elements in a hurry and the resulting antics are definitely enjoyable.Its 78-minute runtime is by far the quickest paced of the current five and with visuals moving away from the innocent forestry setting of the Hollow and into the vast world beyond in undeniable style.  From rolling sea foam to the most generous (and convincing) dust effects to date, The Pirate Fairy is definitive proof that Disneys acquisition of Pixar in 2006 is yielding small dividends all the way across the boards.The vast majority of the voice talent is unchanged from the rest of the series with the only notable newcomer Christina Hendricks as Zarina.  Her work is spot on and the incredibly talented but consistently underrated Jeff Bennett delivers what it perhaps the most convincing interpretation of John Rhys-Davies as Fairy Gary to date.All in all I came away from The Pirate Fairy impressed; especially when compared to the earlier entries into the franchise.  The pacing is stronger, the pirate themes (and timeline) approaching the long-awaited integration into the Peter Pan mythos and the fact that Disney is smart enough to recognize that the Tinker Bell label is costing them serious revenue from the XY-chromosome set is encouraging as well.  5th entries into any series are almost expected to have weakened from the original as to be diluted into incoherence yet somehow Disney seems to be becoming more focused with each installment.Factor in some catchy musical numbers (including an original theme song by Natasha Bedingfield) and a back story reveal sure to delight fans of the original Peter Pan and you have the formula for quite an enjoyable CG-animated romp.  Heres hoping Legend of the NeverBeast manages to carry on in this tradition.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2CCQMYH76IOT4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00H5RYIBI#wasThisHelpful","R2CCQMYH76IOT4","AHF97M45JFCB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AHF97M45JFCB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"They say imitation is the sincerest form of flattery and were you to read the summary of 2011s Kung Fu Rabbit, youd be convinced DreamWorks should be very flattered indeed.  The story tells of a a portly and dumpy rabbit named Fu who makes a living in the restaurateur sector (making sweet cakes), who inadvertently gets swept up in the world of Kung Fu mastery when a true master (Shifu no less) passes on his skills and knowledge after a fatal assault.  Oh and if all of this werent enough to make you think youd accidentally stumbled upon a summation of Kung Fu Panda with a few typos, perhaps youd be interested to discover that the bad guy is in fact a large panda in need of a good stomping.  A nice tag-line for this film could well have been, Take That Katzenberg.Of course with its budget of roughly 12-mil and a 2013 direct-to-dvd release here in the States by Lions Gate that pretty much failed to register so much as a blip on the populations collective radar, its pretty safe to say Jeffery Katzenberg and the rest of DreamWorks didnt lose too much sleep over the concept of lost revenue to Kung Fu Rabbit.It should be noted however that the production caused a bit more of a stir abroad, having been produced in China and playing on the slant of better cultural authenticity and more spectacular martial arts than the Panda film from the US, Kung Fu Rabbit actually earned itself a theatrical run in several markets abroad including both Asian and European.Interestingly, and what is apparently commonplace, when dubbed into English, not only did the film receive a new cast but many editorial changes as well, apparent when looking at a translation even of things as simple as the characters names.  Master Shifu here in the American version is known only as Master in the original script (as apparently shifu is synonymous with master, meaning Master Shifu of Kung Fu Panda fame would in fact be akin to saying Master Master), lead character Fu was in fact Tu, and daughter Penny here was Peony in the original and led to a long running shtick where Tu mistakenly believes her name to be Pony.  Even the title, here Kung Fu Rabbit is the more original Legend of a Rabbit in its native release.  This is relevant simply because one can only hope that a lot of the blatant Kung Fu Panda rip-offs were more the result of American marketing looking to cash-in on the fact that a lot of consumers just skim the covers and back descriptions of animated DVDs and blus before making a rental or purchase rather than a Chinese film companys legit offensive against a beloved global franchise.Beijing Film Academy and Tianjin Film Studio are the groups responsible for this film, which comes in a run time of 89-minutes and wears a PG rating due to some questionable language and animated violence and weaponry.I suppose all of this is fine and well but doesnt do much to explain what watching the film itself is like and to that there is a single word that does a nice job covering it: Drab.  The visuals are pretty decent, environments rich and characters nicely detailed but the story feels an awful lot like Kung Fu Panda stripped of just about everything that made the franchise so endearing.  While Po was never in danger of nomination into Mensa, he is a mastermind when compared to Fu (voiced earnestly by genuine funny guy John Heder).  Many of the gags concerning his low IQ and clumsiness stretch on for entirely too long and make suspension of disbelieve all but impossible.  Shifu has to show up into Fus dreams literally twice just to make him understand that he's been given the gift of Kung Fu despite his having explained it when the transfer initially took place and the skills literally manifesting within him as the movie goes on.The remainder of the characters face a similar fate, the only real depth coming in the form of the short-lived Shifu (Tom Arnold); who actually manages to appear wise and kind without resorting to cliche Confucius Say style accenting.About the only area the piece succeeds is through a couple of well choreographed Kung Fu fight sequences (and, believe it or not, a few instances of Fu preparing food).  Other wise the film is rife with slow pacing, minimal character motivation and cliches aplenty.  The character models are literally cut & paste from the Kung Fu Panda school of art and just shuffled around in the hopes that playing different roles may confuse potentially viewers to the lack of originality:  This time the master is the monkey, the bad guy the panda, Tigress has a clone, well two of them as they happen to be twins.  The bad guy minions are oxen, pigs and so on.  I didnt spot an equivalent to Mantis in this one but perhaps I simply didnt study the backgrounds hard enough.All in all, the end result (despite how it may seem in reading this) doesnt quite feel as Kung Fu Panda-ripped-off as expected though that isnt to suggest it is good by default as a result either.  What is here is an hour and a half of substandard plotting, average visuals and some sequences that drag on to the point of tedium.  Look into this one only if youve watched both Panda films, all of the holiday specials, and the entire Legends of Awesomeness animated television series and find you still crave some anthropomorphic animals performing Kung Fu in ancient China.  And even then it would be wise to go in with low expectations.","2.0 out of 5 stars","November 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R387HT08WAZ23Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DOQ8EYQ#wasThisHelpful","R387HT08WAZ23Z","AHF97M45JFCB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AHF97M45JFCB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Not to be confused with the 1927 silent war film or long-standing unrelated sitcom series of the same name, Wings is the 2012 Russian CG animated film known as Jets for most of the world.  Perhaps the name change was due to the fact that given its uncanny similarity to the much more popular (and just better in general Disney franchise Planes), so similar a title encroached upon copyright infringement.  I suspect if theres one thing LionsGate would like to try to avoid in the situation, it would be Disneys legal department.  And while comparisons are inevitable, the inferior Wings isnt quite the train wreck (plane crash?) it could have been given the deplorable method of its domestic existence.Wings, like countless other films in the direct-to-dvd CG film genre before it, is in fact a foreign film that receives a dubbed English vocal track, a new name and is pawned off as an original movie.  In the event that this is the first of my reviews youve encountered, let me just summarize years worth of complaining on the subject into a single sentence: Rarely does this technique work.  On its simplest level- there is the matter of matching mouth flaps of another language into English so that the whole piece doesnt resemble a Godzilla movie from the 1960s.  On its most complex, there is the issue of cultural difference and the timing of natural conversational flow.  More often than not, films created of this manner are forced to rely upon heavy exposition, narrators, subtext and all sorts of cheap-out techniques just to make sense.  Young viewers, of whom films of this nature are designed to appeal to first and foremost, are often most sensitive to the clumsiness of this practice and lose interest very quickly.All of that being said, Wings is an at least watchable example of the technique.  Does that mean it can give Planes a run for its money?  Absolutely not.  However, when compared to some of the more painful examples of the practice out there (look into Legend of the Sea as an example of how wrong it can all go), this one is at least watchable if not enjoyable.Wings tells the tale of Ace; a lowly fighter jet whos job is to apparently change the weather over some crop fields by disrupting the clouds above (yes, I realize they couldnt make him a crop duster for legal reasons mentioned above, but really?) who aspires to be a prestigious stunt jet.  A few weeks before a big airshow competition, Ace gets tricked into believing he was invited to take part in the competition.Determined to be the next champion, Ace ventures out to find and train with the elusive Colonel, a legendary retired aircraft trainer.  Long story short Colonel reluctantly takes Ace under his wing (pun- too much?), Ace nearly quits along the way but is forced to dig in deep, a villain in the form of Cyclone tries to foil Aces ambition, the day of the competition comes and the true definition of a hero is discovered by all.  There is nothing new under the sun here, and in fact, when viewed back to back with Planes, perhaps Disney need fear a mole leaking animation info across the pond like some Cold War era spy; which, by the way, would have made for a much more interesting movie.The piece comes in at a runtime of 88-minutes and wears a G rating.  Also like most foreign-turned-domestic CG efforts, this one manages to secure a pretty solid vocal cast for dub duties: Josh Duhamel as Ace, Hilary Duff as love interest Windy, Rob Schneider as the loyal but annoying chicken sidekick Dodo, Jesse McCartney as the villain Cyclone and Tom Skerritt as Colonel.However, all the acting talent in the world cant save the film from its biggest downfall (yes theres one even bigger than the lack of originality here): a muddled plot.  In summary like above, it seems straight forward enough but the way the plot unfolds is very odd.  It almost feels as though there are pieces to the story missing; the ones necessary to justify the character motivations.  The plot is riddled full of happenstance and odd directorial choices.  Well suffer through 15-minutes of unnecessary dialog but the scene where Cyclone finally gets his come-uppings happens so insanely fast and nonchalant as to appear an afterthought.  So much for dramatic resolution.Then, and this may be nit-picking, there is the little annoyance that manages to totally undo the brilliance of Pixars Cars/ Planes universe that may go unnoticed by younger viewers but was glaring to me:  The reason these films work is the lack of biologic lifeforms preset.  Were to suspend disbelief on account of the fact that everything in these worlds is anthropomorphic inanimate objects; a metaphor for society if somehow we werent involved in any capacity.  Wings almost gets it right but then interlaces biological animals to the formula.  We have blackbirds, insects, chickens- that apparently can talk for whatever reason and speak to/ understand the vehicles.  A minor complaint, sure, but small questions start to surface before long- are there other talking animals in this world?  Are there people in this world?  Could these talking animals communicate with humans as well if so?  Just more sloppiness to make the experience a tad less enjoyable.Finally I suppose I should mention the visuals as, surprisingly, they are by no means the weakest link to this chain.  The character models and textures are surprisingly solid.  In fact, there are moments (like when the farm vehicles wake a sleepy Ace) where its almost easy to forget you arent in fact watching a Cars or Planes film.  The backgrounds definitely take a hit though when compared to the above examples and the mechanics of motion arent nearly as precise.  Objects move far more stiffly throughout the frames- the concept of flight nowhere near as lifelike as the latter.  However, all in all, creating and animating objects as stiff and non-biologic as planes, cars and tractors is definitely a wise move on behalf of the smaller studios, as it takes a lot less detail work to look convincing as say an animal or human character.In conclusion, unless you are a die-hard collector of film involving anthropomorphic vehicles or your little ones simply cant get enough of the stuff despite there being at present two Cars films, a series of Cars Toons, two Planes (with a third one on the way); Wings and its abysmal sequel (Wings: Sky Force Heroes) are probably best left to collect dust in the bargain bins.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3UTJDV7QLAQ5N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EFJFUVG#wasThisHelpful","R3UTJDV7QLAQ5N","AHF97M45JFCB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AHF97M45JFCB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A very strong argument could be made that Disneys whole CG catalog received a much needed boot in the proverbial backside upon the 2006 absorption of Pixar/ John Lasseter.  Prior, Disney tried doing the CG thing their way and what resulted were films like The Wild, Valiant, Chicken Little and so on; passable pieces, sure but a far cry from the glory days of Disney animation gold.Post 2006 has witnessed a steady increase in quality that was really felt in 2010s Tangled, continued in 2012s Wreck-It Ralph and absolutely rife in 2013s Frozen.  Side note: This team and their unmistakable tradition of excellence has also since carried on in 2014s Big Hero 6 but as my backlog of reviews has only now reached Frozen, I suspect itll be a while before we get to that one.All of that being said, Frozen has recently had the distinction of becoming the highest grossing animated film of all time.  Stop to think about that for a moment- the distinction doesnt belong to Snow White, Lion King, Shrek or Toy Story.  Frozen, the musical-based retelling of the classic Hans Christian Andersen fairy tale The Snow Queen has become the first billion-dollar film for Walt Disney Animation Studios and its first film to receive the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature.  If youve been around the web in most any capacity of late, youre surely aware of the fact that the Frozen momentum just keeps on building like a runaway snowball down the side of the Swiss Alps; an analogy not entirely displaced given the material at hand.The story, set in comical contemporary laced classic Scandinavian mythos, tells of a pair of princess sisters, Elsa and Anna, beginning with their closeness as children.  Elder Elsa, it turns out, has the ability to turn anything to ice and snow from her fingertips and it is this power that works against her when in playing, she accidentally blasts her sister in the head, nearly killing her in the process and permanently streaking her hair white.Our of fear of their daughters uncontrolled abilities, the king and queen close off the gates to the castle and insist that Elsa remain gloved at all times to prevent similar accidents from taking place in the future.  The confused Anna is hurt and mystified by her older sisters distance/ reclusive nature.We are then transported to Elsa's coronation at age 18, and the two sisters awkward and uncomfortable reunion.  The perky Anna (Kristen Bell) is of course excited and vocal about both seeing her sister again and the reason for the celebration while the reserved and icy (forgive the pun) Elsa (Idina Menzel) remains composed and distant.The entire affair is nearly a success except for one snag-  A charming visiting prince (Santino Fontana) asks for Annas hand in marriage and manages to greatly upset Elsa in the process.  If a single inadvertent blast could almost kill a person, imagine the chaos when her emotions truly run rampant!  Thus it is when Elsa manages to instantaneously plunge the sunny, blissful kingdom into perpetual winter (and being from Buffalo, I am all too aware of the reality of perpetual winter).  Flustered and afraid, Elsa flees the scene into a sentence of self-imposed exile complete with requisite fortress of solid ice.Ana, with the help of an unexpected ice merchant Kristoff (with his own reindeer sidekick Sven) sets off on a quest to retrieve her older sister in the hopes of restoring peace and warm weather to the land.So what makes the film so successful, if not just from a financial perspective but from a narrative one as well?  For starters, this is precisely the type of material that nobody but Disney should better understand: Princess-centric classic fairy tales.  Secondly it capitalizes on the subtle beauty and attention to detail that can truly only be accomplished in the computer-generated medium.  Third it wonderfully integrates the lessons learned from past films while managing to sidestep virtually all of the snags associated with so ambitious an undertaking.  Lastly it resurrects the tradition that seems to have gone largely forgotten in animated films of late: the appeal of the musical.Speaking of, I wont lie and try to hide the fact that Im generally not a fan of musicals (animated or otherwise).  To my way of reasoning, pausing the narrative to break out into a song and dance number, even if said number is pertinent to the material, is an interruption.  Im a subscriber to the theory that the goal of any film is to envelope its viewer so thoroughly as to make them forget that they are in fact watching a movie. Interruptions in narrative, be they from commercials, intermissions, musical numbers or DVD pauses to grab a snack/ relieve the bladder never fail to force the system of detaching and allowing the movie to sweep me away into starting over.That said, Frozen does a pretty nice job of balancing its musical integration with the flow of the narrative; especially in the second half of the piece.  In fact by the time Olaf the snowman makes his appearance, the comedic timing and rhythm of the prose come off as a well-oiled machine.  Right up until the films conclusion, everything seems to come together so flawlessly as to be subliminal.  This is especially interesting when you consider that the films writers confess to having pitched the ending first then worked their way back to the beginning.  I hate to say it but it actually shows.  The first quarter of the film seems to flounder a bit when compared to the later portions with a lot of rather drab exposition and political set up.  One almost gets the impression that they collectively realized they were nearly done with the film and had a lot more songs to integrate so they slid as many into the first quarter as they could.  It is in the early-goings that the music seems the most forced/ interrupting to the natural flow of the story but once they overcome this hump, everything comes together beautifully.In fact I would go as far as to say when the formula works in Frozen it manages to actually surpass the flawless integration of musical narrative witnessed in Disneys Tangled, which, until now, has been my choice for the most effective use of the medium.The visuals are spectacular throughout; reminding that while thoughts of winter usually center on white and gray, the charm of CG allows for stunning ice, snow and particle effects.  Interesting, and like with Tangled, Disneys been experimenting with a hybrid technique of incorporating 2D animation cycles with the computer generated imagery.  In fact, a live reindeer was brought into the studio for the animators to study for the motions and mannerisms of the character Sven.  Disney and its unrivaled attention to detail in action.Its rather interesting to witness the diversion between Disneys CG films and Pixars now that the two brands have, for all intents and purposes, become a single entity.  While Pixar has demonstrated time and time again that the most complex of subjects can be reached through the simplest means possible, Disney is finally learning to use the CG medium as a contemporary tool for weaving the stories that put the brand on the map all those years ago.  Frozen is the latest in a long tradition of Disney princess fairly tale feature films with gorgeous visuals, memorable characters and tunes guaranteed to get stuck in your head.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R21S8JHX62KC8Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00G5G7EXY#wasThisHelpful","R21S8JHX62KC8Y","AHF97M45JFCB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AHF97M45JFCB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"You would certainly be forgiven if 2013s direct-to-DVD Koala Kid from 20th Century Fox failed to register a blip on your CG radar.  In a year known for films like Despicable Me 2, Monsters University, Rise of the Guardians, Epic and so on coupled to the fact that the DVD was initially available only through Wal-Mart as part of an exclusivity deal, its a pretty safe bet to say Koala Kid went largely unnoticed.  And considering the fact that this is one of many examples of a CG feature that actually begins life as foreign film, gets a dubbed English vocal track (and a new name), and is released domestically, overlooking this one didnt seem too big a crime.  However, after finally having a chance to devote the 85-minutes required to go along for the Australian adventure last night, I can conclude this one is actually one of the stronger entries to the genre.Koala Kid actually began life in 2012 as a South Korean/ American collaboration titled The Outback for most of the world. Built on a surprisingly low budget of $5.3 million, the film managed to return $4.6 mil at the Chinese box-office alone.  From there it began distribution on the home market, arriving in the US as Koala Kid thanks to 20th Century Fox the following year (April, 2013).Coming in at a run-time of 85-minutes and wearing a PG rating for mild action, peril and some rude humor, the film centers on a rare albino koala bear named Johnny (Rob Schneider) who, because of his difference in appearance, is bullied and outcast.  He ends up aligning himself with Tasmanian dev Hamish (Bret McKenzie) and photographer primate Higgins (Frank Welker) and together the trio manage to make a small name for Johnny as an attraction at the local carnival freak show.A wagon accident on roue to the carnivals next stop results in their becoming entangled in the struggles of an oppressed population of billabong dwellers being controlled by a malevolent croc named Bog (Alan Cumming).Of course grander themes of bullying and, if you really read into it, the narrow minded scope of racism are present within the prose though in delivery, the lessons are subtle enough not to feel force fed.  The story presents itself as one of adventure with some comedic moments scattered about for good measure that kids will be sure to enjoy more so than it is a thinly disguised cautionary tale.In order to differentiate itself from a market full of other talking animal CG pieces, Koala Kid makes use of a unique color pallet that is difficult to define though unmistakable just the same (even the DVD box art manages to capture it).Pacing is quick and efficient and the script offers up some decent humor that is, and this is extremely rare in its own right, actually enhanced by some of the onscreen humor (one of my favorite moments in the film comes when the characters crash their circus wagon into a ravine and the monkey, Higgins, still battered from the resulting impact, manages to snap a photo of Johnny for publicity purposes).Adding to the big budget feel of the piece, there is a well presented musical number in the middle of the film set to a (well done) remake of the staple Australian anthem Down Under from the Men at Work.Sure, fastidious CG aficionados accustomed to the type of attention to detail that has made Pixar films so endearing may question little nuances like why can all of the animals talk except for the monkey (which, I suppose could arguably be considered the most intelligent of the animal species chosen here), or why the English vocal directors seemed to go the extra mile to avoid casting anyone with an authentic Australian accent (perhaps the films meager budget couldnt secure the likes of Hugh Jackman or Nicole Kidman).  Overall though, these are minor nuances that detract little from the viewing experience.In conclusion Koala Kid represents a nice change of pace in the generally abysmal arena that is the direct-to-dvd CG animated feature film.  The fact that 20th Century Fox, the company now responsible for domestic distribution or all of Blue Sky and DreamWorks CG DVDs/ blu-Rays, opted to distribute this one says a lot about their own belief in the project.  It isnt as easy to track down as some of the more popular titles released on the label but those who do locate it wont be disappointed by adding it to their CG collection.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Q12WP95WYQM8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CQPRYDS#wasThisHelpful","R1Q12WP95WYQM8","AHF97M45JFCB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AHF97M45JFCB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Planes is a bit of an odd franchise no matter how you slice it and the latest addition to the proposed trilogy, Fire & Rescue really doesnt do much to deviate from the oddity of it all.  Part of what makes the series as a whole so odd is the way it came to be: beginning with the Pixar mega-franchise Cars, Disney had decided to go the direct-to-dvd route with a trilogy of films taking place in that same universe, just a little higher off the ground.  Then, because there was a gap in their CG animated theatrical feature schedule, Planes was given the silver screen upgrade at the proverbial zero-hour; an unexpected move turned even more surprising considering the Planes films were done by DisneyToon Studios, the 44-employee outfit known for specializing in direct-to-video projects.Long story short, the original Planes somehow defied the odds and proved a very lucrative theatrical run.  That leads us to Fire & Rescue, the middle child of the Planes trilogy.  Or the first sequel to the spin-off of Cars.  When viewed under these circumstances, logic would suggest this piece to be an utter disaster and yet it manages to deliver on some pretty lofty story telling ambitions.  No, its never quite able to capture the military-like narrative precision weve come to expect from Pixar or even Disney itself of late (with films like Tangled, Frozen and Big Hero 6), it does put together enough elements to get the job done.The story continues on the exploits of lowly crop duster turned global race champion Dusty Crophopper, though, almost as quickly as his meteoric rise to racing stardom, turns him into a forest fire battling SEAT this time around (thats single engine air tanker for those not overly familiar with aerial firefighting terminology).Spread across 84-minutes, Fire & Rescue starts almost like a direct continuation of the first movie, recapping some of Dustys aerial antics on route to racing victories.  However, it doesnt take long before we learn of a new Achilles heel for poor Dusty, having apparently completely recovered from his fear of heights in the first film, this time his engines internal gearbox seems to be failing and thus preventing him from achieving optimal speed.At the same time as his apparent inability to continue racing, a new dilemma in the airports fire safety protocol allows for an opportunity for Dusty to train with a dedicated firefighting crew.  From there the film pretty steadily balances training segments with action-laden firefighting and rescuing.The good news in all of this is that the tired-beyond-measure racing plot element with underdog beating the odds and winning has not been recycled again here.  The bad news is that the films pacing is quite inconsistent; starting out slow, building fairly steadily then concluding entirely too quickly and formulaic.  What this leaves the viewer feeling in the end is a sort of waiting for something to arrive that never manifests.  Younger viewers will likely be far more forgiving; adults used to the Pixar touch felt throughout the production will certainly pick up on the feeling of sloppiness.Children, especially those enamored with playing with toy planes, trucks and trains will undoubtedly marvel at the action sequences here.  Visually the film suffers from many of the same complaints of the first- with fairly lackluster textures more commonly associated with direct-to-dvd affairs (which is to say slightly above CG television series standards but not quite the photo-realism of the big budget features) but this time the bar has certainly been raised with blazing wildfire sequences and some stunning water and spray effects.The scripting is certainly sharp and witty at times, albeit rife with rapid fire puns that were surely thrown in to keep adult viewers in the fold while the youngsters marvel at so many talking vehicles.  Lines like She left me for a hybrid. I didnt hear it coming or a cheesy-pickup-line touting pickup truck will surely elicit a chuckle.  But perhaps the pieces truly cleverest layered humor comes in the form of a 1970s-style take on the cheesy cop series CHiPs starring helicopters called CHoPs.  Sure, there is no way the younger set will have any idea what this particular segment is spoofing, it does make for some welcome adult appeal.In all, fans of the original film will likely enjoy the fairly straight-forward ride Planes: Fire & Rescue offers.  Even though this one boasts a bigger budget than the first, some slicker animation scattered about and a lot more characters (too many to keep track of at times in fact), I was unable to shake that uncanny made-for-dvd feel this time around.  Perhaps due in no small part to the final portion of the film, which really packs a bit too much into too little time and concludes in a user-friendly nature that promises sequels galore.  The shame in this is that there are some interesting themes and undertones being explored in this one; outliving ones usefulness, the finality of death (even for a machine), the untamed and terrifying power of nature, the true definition of a hero, yet the end result comes out feeling like a promise that Disney is far from done milking this cash cow just yet.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RNZO9LF6DPA1K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MMUXOLS#wasThisHelpful","RNZO9LF6DPA1K","AHF97M45JFCB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AHF97M45JFCB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Having just completed the 79-minutes required to complete this monstrosity of a film, Ive decided to pen up a review immediately before the awe of its substandard delivery has fully worn off.  And just so were clear- I read the overwhelming number of negative reviews even before purchase of the DVD and thus went in with low expectations.  Even still this one managed to disappoint.  Articulating where things went awry here is a bit overwhelming in the where do we even begin? variety.  That said, lets take a brief look at the hard facts.Released September of 2013 in the UK under the name Sir Billi, the film represented some fairly promising firsts; namely it was the first CG animated feature made entirely in Scotland.  It also marks what was intended to be a triumphant return to the screen for accomplished actor Sean Connery, who not only voices the titular character but also executive produced the project.  It was given a name change and shipped over here to the US in April of 2014 as a direct-to-dvd affair by Cinedigm.  It should be noted that the domestic DVD release is not rated; though it certainly seems to fall under PG-13 territory due to language (there is repeated cussing throughout) and some themes that the smaller set may not be prepared for in an animated film (like early on when a deceased beaver is picked up and discarded roughly into a crate).The story, or what tries to be one here, tells of an aging, skateboarding retired veterinarian who goes above and beyond the call of duty fighting villainous policemen and powerful lairds in a battle to save an illegal fugitive - Bessie Boo the beaver first from exportation then from drowning.  When this, the last beaver in all of Scotlands life becomes endangered, Sir Billi and a horde of animal pals step into action even though a raging river, a Russian submarine and an obsessed animal control officer all stand in their way.If this summary sounds a little odd, rest assured that it is a very accurate depiction, then, of the experience that is Guardian of the Highlands.  The narrative fails to ever present itself as a singular tale so much as it meanders from scene to scene and situation to situation in the hopes of becoming a movie somewhere along the way.  In fact many of the staples of the prose (like Billi being a retired veterinarian or why in the world there no beavers in Scotland) are never even made clear in the film itself; but rather are established only in summaries and movie reviews.It turns out (through extensive research of my own mind you, perhaps a special feature on the DVD explaining this would have made far too much sense) that the idea of a beaver-free Scotland stems from a bit of historical fact in that beavers were apparently hunted nearly to extinction in the area about 4-centuries back.  Its never even clear whats going on with the beaver relocation sequence that opens the film.  Critics seem to think that what the filmmakers are trying to say is that beavers were then illegally reintroduced to the area by activists are hence being rounded up by the Scottish government to be exported to Norway.  But again, these are things that they maybe would have wanted to explain a little better being that it is the crux of the story and all.Of course it doesnt even really matter because the film is structured so that conflicts arise, become settled (in this case I guess were just supposed to accept that Bessie, the last beaver is happy being orphaned to live with a bunch of rabbits, who, at least in one scene seem to want her to fail) only for new conflicts to become shoehorned in for the solving.Characters come and go with absolutely no sense of continuity.  In one scene we see a family driving down the road led by a naval admiral no less, who seem to know who Bessie is and recognize her being carried down the rapids of a raging river.  Thats it for them.  How do they know her?  Is this guy really an admiral?  Why should we care? Events seem to happen at random throughout, many of which do little to nothing to advance the already-floundering plot.Then theres the animals- they all wear clothing here and can speak and be understood by the humans; so much for historical accuracy I guess.The acting is a step above the plotting, which is to say still substandard in comparison to what we expect in animation circa 2013.  Though expect heavy accents galore and one of the sleepiest performances from Connery this side of a 5am call in to room service.Finally there is the matter of the visuals themselves.  I often say in my reviews that solid graphics do not a good movie make; however in this case, a poor movie is made even poorer with some of the more inconsistent modeling/ animation youre going to encounter anywhere.  Some elements are surprisingly decent: the water in the bay, some of the skies, the background details (a fish shop in one scene is called The Codfather).  Others are substandard at best, creepy at worst.  The models in particular are misshapen, disproportionate and animate clumsily.  The lack of fluidity with motion sequences and facial animations make the entire film feel a lot like a video game cut scene from a few years back.All in all this is a very difficult film to recommend to anyone of any age.  Its tough to tell whether the project was born of great intentions that it simply failed to live up to or if it was a production train wreck from the get-go, but the finished product certainly leaves a lot to be desired!  There are a few references scattered about that hint toward the notion that this project was supposed to be an an animated homage to Sean Connerys storied acting career but the delivery is so muddled that any brilliance found in that concept really cant be recovered.","2.0 out of 5 stars","October 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RYA07LPGRVF4B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HRUQBHM#wasThisHelpful","RYA07LPGRVF4B","AHF97M45JFCB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AHF97M45JFCB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"2012s Rise of the Guardians represents the middle of three William Joyce books that were turned into CG animated feature films (the others being Disneys 2007 Meet the Robinsons and Blue Skys 2013 Epic) and is the only one to come from DreamWorks.Unfortunately the film has the dubious distinction of losing money for the powerhouse studio- to the tune of an $83-million writedown for the quarter and the layoffs of 350 employees.  This sad event would occur a year later with release of the film Turbo.Perhaps the biggest tragedy is that by no means is this trend the fault of the film itself.  Rise of the Guardians is a masterwork in the CG medium with remarkably interesting (if slightly miscast) characters, slick narrative, and a worthy moral inter-weaved tastefully throughout.The story is primarily told through the perspective of an amnesic Jack Frost (Chris Pine) as he happens upon an ancient struggle for the power of belief from human children. When Pitch Black AKA The Boogeyman (Jude Law) resurfaces after being absent since the Dark Ages, humanitys last hope, The Guardians, must reunite to prevent the balance between fear and hope from becoming forever lost to darkness.  However, these Guardians are no mere mortals- comprised of Santa Claus, the Easter Bunny, the Tooth Fairy, and Sandman; the power of magic that comes from the belief of children everywhere is certainly on their side.There has been some public dismay with the portrayal of some of these iconic characters here; particularly the Santa (Alec Baldwin) figure; given forearm tattoos (one arm representing naughty, the other nice), a Russian accent and a pair of swords and the Easter Bunny as indicated by a sarcastic, boomerang wielding sharp-tongued Australian (Hugh Jackman).I would counter such complaints by reminding that we are being treated to a view of a rare side to these icons; that the core of this story is their value as resistance to the fear and darkness of doubt.  The jovial and good halfheartedness of each of the characters is never discounted here, so much as were simply given the added perspective of their no-nonsense sides in times of crisis.That being said, the film paces magnificently well and delivers its narrative with conviction.  A few action segments feel a bit contrived so as to show off the muscle of their pixel-processing power/ potentially dazzle moviegoer with 3D effects, but as a whole the pieces of the film come together beautifully to make suspension of disbelief a very naturally occurring affair.Then there is the look of the film.  While impressive visuals do not a good movie make; Rise is proof that they can make an already good film amazing.  DreamWorks accomplishes a feat here thats only been attempted successfully a couple of times in the past even by masters-of-the-art Pixar: Life-like human models.  So wonderful are the facial expressions and visual emotions of Jack Frost that at times it becomes easy to forget that what you are gazing upon is in fact just a computer graphic.  Additionally texture work is impeccable from the spreading of ice crystals to the golden and black grains of dream sand, truly this is a piece that could only have been done justice in CG rendering.There is no getting around the fact that this is a DreamWorks film, though, as unlike say Pixar; who make it a habit of crafting intricate plots out of the simplistic and mundane, this one requires loads of exposition and dialog across nearly every frame to get its message through.  However, this is also only a film that DreamWorks could do properly; the weight of even one of the characters involved here is enough to send most filmmakers running, much less all of them bunched up into one tale.  Yet somehow the piece finds a pretty interesting balance between them all.I would like to conclude this review on a slightly higher note than it began- while its true it was considered a financial bomb in the box office, it did eventually overcome its initial budget (though failed to make a return on the money DW sank in marketing & promotion).. It did, however, end up bringing in a very lucrative return once it came to small screens in DVD and blu-Ray form.  In fact, having cleared well over 5-million DVD unit sales by the end of 2013 alone, theres a good chance many of the laid-off employees were once again able to return to work.All in all, Rise of the Guardians manages to deliver a lush and genuinely interesting fantastical world for adults and children alike to escape to for a solid hour-and-a-half.  A shame that its lackluster box-office performance is the most common association with the film because, when judged on its own merit, Rise of the Guardians is certainly a worthy entry in the CG animated feature film genre.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2F1K5G9ZMSJE2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00947N6D8#wasThisHelpful","R2F1K5G9ZMSJE2","AHF97M45JFCB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AHF97M45JFCB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Lets get the obvious out of the way immediately: Freedom Force is perhaps one of the most misleading slip-covers in the history of animation.  With a title like Freedom Force and a picture depicting 4 adolescents in high-tech suits with their dog companion, one immediately thinks this is a superhero-themed animation in the vein of The Incredibles or Megamind.  Guess what? Its not. Not even close.What it is however is one of the stranger animated comedies youre ever going to encounter.  Before we get into that, lets take a brief look at the nitty gritty shall we?The name Freedom Force itself is limited only to what part of the world you happen to call home. Its also known as the Fantastic 4orce in some markets and The Illusionauts in most.  Regardless of which generic movie title it goes by, there is remarkably little information on the film available. Even the omnipresent Wikipedia lacks an entry for the production in any of its many names- even more startling when you stop that it received an official North American DVD release.About all that can be found on the picture is that it was released in Peru back in 2012 under the name Los Ilusionautas, was directed by Eduardo Schuldt and released by Aronnax Animation Studios.  It received its US release as a direct-to-dvd affair in November of 2013 from Vertical Entertainment and comes in at a runtime of 81-minutes.  It wears an appropriate PG rating and, aside from a trailer, contains absolutely no special features whatsoever.While all of this sounds fine and well, things start to get ugly fast we take a look at the story itself.  Calling the plot behind this one odd does the word injustice!  Ill do my best to summarize it in as coherent a few paragraphs as possible.In France, the President and his flamboyant wife are attempting to devote a day to honor reading; particularly the science fiction works of Jules Verne.  This would be fine and well except for the fact that a madman (complete with prolonged scenes of maniacal laughter to emphasize the point) has sabotaged Vernes works by traveling back through time in a device known as the Imaginaseum; enters Vernes imagination, deletes key characters, turns the plots into nonsense and so on.Fortunately there is a loophole in the flow of time that states so long as any changes made are corrected within 48-hours, they wont be permanent.  The French Special Forces are immediately sent out to recruit a crack team of hotshots for the specific purpose of traveling back through time as well to right the wrongs within Vernes own imagination.It turns out this quartet of operatives (known collectively as Operation Freedom Force) are all 12-years old, because, well that was the age Verne began writing and each have some tie with the legendary author.  Among these is Aristotle, the tech wizard, bookworm Peter, martial arts master Nicole (who happens to be a distant descendant of Verne himself) and Profiterole because, well he has a lot of gas.  Whats that?  Surely that last one is typo you say?  Afraid not.  The explanation given is that Jules Verne, too, was apparently gassy.  Dont worry, your suspicions of this character being inserted strictly for the opportunity for many flatulence jokes are spot-on and will be confirmed almost immediately and entirely too often.From here its a romp through several iconic story settings: Twenty-Thousand Leagues Under the Sea, From the Earth to the Moon, Five Weeks in a Balloon and so on in effort to discover the hidden reset switches within each tale to set things straight.This part of the tale is, as expected, perhaps the most ambitious and adventurous but the hackneyed science that got us this far becomes entirely ludicrous in short order when things like the giant octopus in 20,000 Leagues escapes into our world and, as were told, cannot be destroyed by conventional weaponry as it is merely a figment of ones imagination- yet seems to be able to inflict all the very real damage it wants.Somehow the producers of the English dub managed to snag Christopher Lloyd and Sarah Michelle Gellar to voice the mad scientist who invented the Imaginaseum and Nicole respectively but even their talent coupled to a few genuinely witty lines of dialog scattered about do little to save the train derailment that is the strangeness of this plot.  Factor in character models with strangely vacant eyes, tons of inappropriate gags, and a climax that makes even the rest of this goofy tale seem brilliant and you know youre in for a long 81-minutes!  I will say that unlike many small CG films that lack major studio backing, this one is at least watchable but that shouldnt be mistaken for being an enjoyable experience either.","2.0 out of 5 stars","October 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RUBQBOQKZOZOQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GB0OUHW#wasThisHelpful","RUBQBOQKZOZOQ","AHF97M45JFCB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AHF97M45JFCB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Despite a rash of previews that looked promising, I was slow to get around to Turbo; no pun intended.  From the looks of it, it appeared to be a plug & play kids film package- lowly snail, known for lack of speed, ridiculous dream of being one of the fastest creatures on earth, laughed at by all, in a mishap becomes fast, series of events lead to his becoming a global hero thanks to his speed.  And guess what?  That's exactly what it is from start to finish.  But even going in with that mindset, coming away feeling fulfilled by the experience is completely possible thanks to the attention to detail that only DreamWorks brings to the table in these situations.Turbo is a 2013 American 3D computer-animated comedy sports film produced by DreamWorks Animation and distributed by 20th Century Fox. It wears a PG rating and comes in at a run-time of 96-minutes.What's really interesting is how the film came to be.  As most anyone on the planet is fully aware, computer generated (CG) feature films are BIG business.  Successful films often go on to rake in hundreds of millions in their theatrical runs and some companies (some that start with D for example) are masterful at merchandising the snot out of these films; lunch boxes, action figures, Halloween costumes, bed sheets and on and on.  In short, a winner in this industry means unimaginable profits.  By and large DreamWorks brings some pretty interesting concepts to the genre and has struck gold time and again with franchises like Shrek, Kung-Fu Panda, How to Train Your Dragon and so on.  Even still, they occasionally find themselves in a slump for fresh concepts.Enter David Soren, a lowly DreamWorks employee and one of dozens who were invited to partake in a company competition to submit a single-page pitch for the next big CG film franchise.  He combined The Fast and the Furious with snails and ended up being selected as the winner.  Though, and pardon the endless pun potential here, the idea crawled along at a snail's pace for roughly 5-years before DreamWorks finally decided it was time to take the project seriously.  Soren actually got to make his directorial debut on the piece and well, here we are.  Having been head of story to such pieces as Shark Tale prior, it's safe to suggest this one could have went either way.There are a lot of parallels between Soren and the titular character, come to think of it, particularly the idea of a low man with a big dream. However while the character goes on to win big in the end, the film hasn't been a commercial success.  Produced on a budget of roughly $127-mil (plus $175-million in marketing) Turbo has since gone on to rake in close to $300-million.  One doesn't need to own stock in DreamWorks to realize that's the kind of return shareholders don't like to see.  In fact the studio took a $13.5 million write-down on the film; This marked the second film in two years that DreamWorks Animation has lost money on after Rise of the Guardians.As for potential sequels, no official announcement yet but DreamWorks does have a very rich history f turning successful films into successful franchises after all.  Additionally a 2D animated series has spawned from the film on Netflix known as Turbo: FAST.Anyway, all of this, while riveting to be sure, really doesn't tell you anything about whether or not you might like the film itself, allow me to get back on track here.  That could be another pun too but I digress.Turbo tells of a a speed-obsessed garden snail with dreams of becoming an Indycar racer who, by the magic of an unfeasible accident, becomes saturated with nitrous-oxide and thus extremely fast (and not just fast-for-a-snail but fast period; 226mph kinda fast).  From there it's a meteoric rise from racing against other snails right to the big leagues: participation in the Indy 500.  Never mind such nuances as it would probably be more believable for him to enter a biological-being race, like the Boston Marathon rather than one designed for machines; realism was clearly not the mandate on this one.What ensues, really, is a series of enjoyable character interactions along the way.  This is the real meat and potatoes of the film. DreamWorks is nothing if not very cast savvy and choices like Ryan Reynolds as Turbo, Luis Guzmn as a taco slinging Latino, Samuel L Jackson as the roughest snail this side of the tracks and Snoop Dogg as the burned out, fuzzy pink dice sporting mollusk Smoove Move make this reality very clear.The story breaks no new ground and in fact, can probably be assembled using pieces and bits of other animated films before it like Antz, Cars and Disco Worms but again, what this one lacks in originality, it actually makes up for with some charming characters and genuine humor that will appeal to viewers of all ages.DreamWorks' greatest strength, perhaps, is their ability to integrate perfect character archetypes to keep the pacing razor sharp throughout the story-arc and this film is no exception.  Turbo may lack Pixar's cleverness and Disney's infallible marketing schemes but it does offer a solid hour-and-a-half's worth of animated entertainment loaded with visuals that are oft downright stunning.

"Sometimes a film comes along and manages to dazzle so thoroughly that it really reminds its viewer of the magic and charm possible in the whole motion picture concept.  For me A Monster in Paris is precisely such a piece.  Despite oodles of hype associated with it since its initial release back in 2011 and fairly high expectations going in, I enjoyed every frame of the film and am left with renewed vigor for the unbelievably time consuming art of crafting quality CG.A Monster in Paris is a 2011 French 3D animated musical adventure film directed by former DreamWorks director Bibo Bergeron based on a story he wrote.  Coming in at 87-minutes in length and wearing an appropriate PG rating (for some action-heavy scenes and gunplay), the film moves along briskly atop a beautiful soundtrack featuring the vocal work of Sean Lennon.The story, which has been criticized for its sheer oddity, tells of a small group of cohorts in Paris circa 1910, shy and insignificant Emile (Jay Harrington) and his pal Raoul (Adam Goldberg) who inadvertently create a gorgeous-voiced monster by messing around with a professor of botanys litany of laboratory potions.  Oblivious to the panic theyve caused, reports begin surfacing of a monster terrorizing the citizens of Paris.In time we discover that the monster isnt quite the malevolent creature the media is portraying when he encounters stage performer Lucille (voiced by the absolutely luminous Vanessa Paradis).  All the while the city commissioner, one Maynott (Danny Huston) sees opportunity to win over the publics affection (and hopefully votes) by slaying the monster.Sure its a bit unique from a traditionalist sense, the story is actually a lot less convoluted in its delivery than it sounds in summary.  In fact, there are many small details integrated throughout that suggest mastery over the art of exposition (like one where the viewer actually witnesses the transformation and initial confusion through the eyes of the monster itself).The animation and visual work, while nothing overly flashy or gimmicky, can be quite magnificent at times; particularly the soft hues and lighting that never allow the viewer to fully lose touch with the era of the piece.The vocal cast is absolutely top notch; delivering performances that are spot-on for the emotions of the characters and as if their acting delivery werent solid enough, the musical numbers (something I typically despise in contemporary animated films) are brilliant.  This could be one of few examples in the CG animated feature film segment where care in assembling a vocal ensemble went far beyond simply putting together a host of A-list celebrities in the hopes of their mere involvement boosting ticket sales.The true heart of this tale is encapsulated in character interaction; beginning with the opposite mentalities of Emile and Raoul (which harkens back to some of the finer moments between Tulio and Miguel in prior Bibo Bergeron film The Road to El Dorado) and progressing to the interesting dynamic between Lucille and The Monster itself.In the end, all of my acclaim for the piece is not without a few minor caveats.  First, the film doesnt particularly bend over backward in terms of cuteness, slapstick or other such gimmicks to hook younger audience members.  Rather, most of the humor here is classy and dialog oriented.  I personally am a fan of this approach, as an adult who has been forced to slog through countless mind-numbing animated films that keep youngsters entertained only through visual gags and cheap laughs.  This one will appeal to adults first and foremost, with kids likely becoming bored about midway through.  Though in all fairness there are charming elements like a sign-wielding monkey and a gadget-laden jalopy to break up the dialog-heavy sequences.  It is very reminiscent of the type of sophistication in childrens storytelling common in the 1980s 2D era (think An American Tail or Secret of the Nimh) but with far quicker pacing sensibilities for this ADHD generation.My second complaint comes in the fact that both the blu and DVD release of the film are as absolutely bare-bones as it gets:  No behind the scenes, interviews, commentary tracks, nothing.  There is a trailer, some setup options and the feature itself.  If, like me, you usually enjoy exploring the personalities, inspirations and aspirations of the individuals behind the magic, be forewarned that very little exists of such things on the net and absolutely none on the disc.All told, I thoroughly enjoyed A Monster in Paris despite fearing that a film about a signing monster bopping around turn-of-the-century France would never fall under my personal definition of cinematic brilliance.  What I came away with, however, was an appreciation for all of the subtleties and abundant attention to detail that make this one a most worthy example of how effectively the CG animated medium can be used to tell a character-driven story.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3FX9H0QKVV82N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AWHDFLW#wasThisHelpful","R3FX9H0QKVV82N","AHF97M45JFCB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AHF97M45JFCB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Should you happen upon this computer-generated film on DVD, it's pretty easy to want to compare it to some of the bigger studio releases of similar theme (like Hotel Transylvania or Igor to mention a few); and in doing so, it's a sure-fire way to find disappointment in Dear Dracula.  However, once you realize that this was a made-for-tv affair that originally aired around Halloween-time on Cartoon Network a few years back, it becomes a lot clearer what the intentions were here.  It also explains the ridiculously short 42-minute run-time of the feature (the 60-minute claim on the package includes an added extra of the program Artzooka); as it would have been a full hour program on network television when you factor in the commercials.The story itself, surprisingly, is based on a graphic novel from 2008 of the same title that came out through Image comics (Shaowline imprint) in attempt to bring younger readers to the sequential art fold.  I should disclaim, however, that the film is a much more simplified variation of the 48-page source material; chief among the cuts is a thread whereby the lead character has ambitions of becoming a vampire for Halloween like his hero Count Dracula and begins to reconsider the request only after discovering that his diet of hamburgers and pizza would be forever replaced with visits to the blood-bank.The story here makes things even more all-ages friendly by offering up a plot where main kid Sam, a huge classic horror movie buff, catches a commercial for a new Drac action figure that he absolutely has to have.  His grandma recommends he write Santa so as to get it for Christmas but Sam instead decides to write the Transylvanian Count instead.  What results is a surprise visit from the father of all vampires on Halloween night.  This would be a dream come true except it turns out our ol pal Dracula is suffering through a bit of an identity crisis of his own in that this modern generation simply doesn't fear him as they once did.  Almost like Rodney Dangerfield getting no respect complaints, a Halloween party being held across the street from Sam's house becomes an opportunity for Drac to find his lost mojo and for Sam to, uh become more confident around the fairer sex.  Wait, wasn't this the same dude just writing a letter to Santa concerning a toy? Oh, never mind all that.The point here is that the setup becomes an ideal situation for the pair to learn a valuable life lesson and if the viewer comes away with same- mission accomplished.The visuals are fairly simplistic and overly caricaturized but this is expected on a made-for-tv budget.  The younger viewers will likely be enamored enough with the tale not to notice and in all honesty, there is some hidden charm scattered about to keep the adults interested as well (the movie takes shots at contemporary films like Twilight & Saw, Dracula, voiced by Ray Liotta happens to call Sam a Goodfella and so on).Of course, this shouldn't be mistaken for the type of mastery over the CG craft that we've been getting from Pixar, DreamWorks, Sony and the like; but it is an honest attempt to bring something clever into a modestly budgeted film.In conclusion, Dear Dracula isn't going to challenge the supremacy of any of the leaders of the genre and aside from being a tad bit too user-friendly (if such a thing exists), it concludes a little briskly and anticlimactically presumably due to the light run-time.  Not to the point of plot-holes per se, but be prepared for final resolve to happen quickly and not entirely satisfyingly but again, the younger set will likely be far more forgiving about such things.All in all, bargain bin pricing, especially around Halloween make this one fairly easy to recommend, especially if you're looking to keep some young ones entertained for a little over a half-hour.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R13MZKHQA9UHY9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00B6U4XW4#wasThisHelpful","R13MZKHQA9UHY9","AHF97M45JFCB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AHF97M45JFCB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Space Dogs follows suit in a long line of computer animated feature films that tell of earthen critters being sent into space prior to mankinds own journey to the stars (check out Space Chimps or Fly Me To The Moon for further examples in the genre).  While all of the above films claim to be based on some degree of historical fact, Space Dogs represents the first animals to have survived a Soviet launched orbital space trip; particularly from the fictional perspective of real-life canines Belka & Strelka.If youre very familiar with contemporary CG film catalog, it could best be described as a cross between Sonys Open Season 2 and Starz Space Chimps.  If that means nothing to you, read on for a more in depth breakdown of the film on its own merits.Released in Russia back in March of 2010 as    (Belka n Strelka), the film wears a G-rating, comes in a run-time of 85-minutes and was created on a budget of roughly $35-million.  Phase 4 Films gave it the English dub treatment, burned it to Region 1 standards and released it to DVD and blu-Ray as Space Dogs a couple of years later (June 10, 2012).The story, which is far more simplistic in summation than its 85 min-run-time demands, tells of a stray and a circus dog who are in essence kidnapped into military service, which begins with rigorous training for what will be controlled space flight.  Since, at its core, the story could probably be told in about three to five minutes, what you really get is quite a bit of fictional back story in attempt at character building among the many talking animals involved in the tale.Additionally, the films pacing seems a tad askew as a result: the vast majority of the tale centers on the dogs training with only a couple of minutes dedicated to the space flight itself (and even then its a bit curious in terms of the Belka & Strelka repairing the original Sputnik with a flashlight battery or Strelka suddenly taking control of the ship, flying it through an asteroid belt and so on).  Perhaps Im being overly critical concerning elements that were surely added for the visual enjoyment of children.  History buffs, youve been warned.The films visuals are also a bit lackluster for what was possible by 2010 in terms of computer generated animation.  The animal models themselves are certainly passable enough but the textures throughout are simplistic and drab, and the animation rather stiff.  The human models seem to represent the production crews biggest challenge and are thus absent almost entirely throughout the picture (though it is only fair to mention that a brief appearance of JFK in the beginning both looks and sounds great).Of course all of this criticizing surely makes the film come off as unwatchable and in truth, it does many things well deserving of mention.  For starters, the dub is surprisingly solid.  For a film not originally created in English, Phase 4 did a bang up job adapting the mouth flaps to the sentences of the new script.  This is more than just a timing accomplishment; as making a coherent film is more than just having words and mouth flaps match, credit is due in designing a script that manages to tell the story accordingly, keep the flow of conversation natural and so on.  Space Dogs certainly succeeds here.Additionally, while kids young enough to get the most out of the films gags will likely care little for the fact that the story is based on some semblance of history, the actual footage of the dogs (and even rodents) involved in the spaceflight during the closing credits is certainly a nice touch; especially appreciated by older viewers who find the space race and the science behind it interesting.In conclusion, Space Dogs is a cute little film that does its best not to offend but never really strives for excellence in any arena either.  Younger viewers will be a lot more forgiving of the fluff but that abounds to fill its run-time and everyone else who enjoys it may also want to give 2008s Space Chimps a look.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 3, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R35XRUVQUS0SLW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006QWC33S#wasThisHelpful","R35XRUVQUS0SLW","AHF97M45JFCB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AHF97M45JFCB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you have any experience in the realm of animated feature films, you're already aware of a simple reality:  The good ones are generally really good.  Pixar, DreamWorks, Disney, Sony; they've all spoiled us with massive budgeted, butter-smooth animated, touching storied works of art.  The bad ones, on the other hand, are typically very bad.  How can one tell the good ones apart from the bad at a glance?  The bad ones are direct-to-dvd affairs and you've likely never heard about them before happening upon them in the Redbox, on Netflix etc.So what makes the bad ones so bad you ask?  Simply this: 99.9% of the time they are actually foreign films, created for a foreign market that the rights are bought up for and shipped over here to the US of A as a direct-to-dvd deal.  They are then slapped with an English dub voice track, given a name similar to something you have heard of (Know of Frozen? Meet Frozen Land.  Familiar with Kung Fu Panda? How about Chop Kick Panda?  Like Happy Feet?  Perhaps your kid will be confused into picking up Tappy Toes.)  There are literally dozens of these on the market and more released on a weekly basis.So what's the problem with that?  Well simply this- timing.  Since the viewer expects the mouth to actually move with the dialog, this puts the English dub crew into a terrible predicament.  More often than not, dialog becomes ridiculously simplistic, redundant, and you can forget comedic timing; or for that matter even natural conversational flow.  Scenes feel disconnected, the pacing of the film feels somehow off, younger viewers get bored.  Older viewers start to contemplate the meaning of existence.  In short, it's ugly.All of this brings us to Tad the Lost Explorer from Studiocanal and brought to the US as, you guessed it, a direct-to-DVD affair from Vivendi.  Yes it's a foreign film imported (originally Spain's 2012 Las aventuras de Tadeo Jones).  Except here's where things become a shocker: It's actually good!  Good for an import?  Nope, just good period.The story, in my spoiler-free summary, follows the adventures of one Thaddeus ""Tad"" Stones; a Chicago bricklayer with aspirations of becoming a world-renowned archaeologist.  One fateful day, however, a series of events result in his being mistaken for a real professor of archaeology and our hapless hero (and his dog Jeff; short for Thomas Jefferson) find themselves on a flight to Peru in search of the Lost City of Paititi.There he expects to meet with the genius Professor Lavrof and his beautiful daughter Sara to unite two sections of ancient tablet believed to be the key to the fabled city.  Factor in a robotic-handed German accented villain names Kopponen and the shady Odysseus corporation who seek the riches of the ancient city for themselves and it's high adventure in the steamy south the moment Tad steps off the plane.If the setup sounds like something out of an Indiana Jones film, rest assured, that's exactly what it intends to be (do keep in mind the original character's last name was even Jones, changed to Stones here presumably to avoid legal trouble).  And while the concept has enough merit to be cute, the film actually manages to play out like a genuine big-budget Indy adventure rather than a silly spoof.  They even cleverly integrate an Indy reference when Tad receives his trademarked hat and careful viewers may even catch a hint of the Indiana Jones theme song (used with permission) during one of the action sequences.The visuals are gorgeous, the animation spot-on and even the pacing, usually the biggest faux pas of foreign films turned domestic, is flawless.  I came into this one expecting a lot of silly slap stick visual gag comedy and pun-filled dialog but was pleasantly surprised to find neither being the case.  The humor is, at times, quite layered to appeal to audiences of all ages.  Some of the subtle stuff is the best stuff.Now the bad news, yes there is a little of that too I'm afraid.  The film makes use of a couple appropriate words/ phrases on occasion.  Words like ""crap"" and ""hell"" work their way into the dialog so if these are things you wish to prevent younger viewers from exposure to, be advised.  Additionally it seems the rather buxom proportions of the female lead Sara have managed to offend more than a fair share of female viewers in particular though in all fairness, it's no different from anything you'd see on primetime television these days, on the cover of the tabloids or the latest issue of Cosmo.  She's always fully clothed and drawn in at tasteful angles.All in all, this is perhaps the first film I've encountered in my travels that actually manages to succeed in an area where I previously didn't think possible:  It's that rare foreign animated film that comes off so spectacularly in action that it's easy to mistake it for an inflated budget domestic piece.  While the intricacies of the plot and the dialog will keep more mature viewers interested, the pair of pets (said dog Jeff and a parrot that uses signs to communicate like Wile E Coyote) should keep kids involved.  Factor in a cleverly done mummy at the end and all of the ingredients are preset for success.With the price of the DVD release of late in bargain-bin territory and a hardy 80-minutes of genuinely entertaining CG animated action, it's very easy to recommend this one.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 3, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3G5FUSHYZLK5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FOLGVYY#wasThisHelpful","R3G5FUSHYZLK5","AHF97M45JFCB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AHF97M45JFCB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If one were to judge Phase 4 Films on the size of its CG feature film catalog alone, it would be clear that the company is making a serious push in North America to rival the works of industry giants like DreamWorks, Disney, Pixar etc.  Of course it could also be argued that they are taking the quantity over quality route but thats not to say there arent a few decent pieces scattered about their library as well.The Missing Lynx is perhaps one of their stronger entries, though, as my star rating indicates, is still a middle of the road film on its own merit.  But before we get into the films strengths and weaknesses themselves, lets take a moment to look at the facts of its production and how it came to be.The Missing Lynx (in Spanish: El Lince Perdido) is a 2008 Spanish-British computer-animated action comedy film produced by Spanish studios Kandor Graphics, YaYa! Films and none other than one Mr. Antonio Banderas (known in CG circles for his portrayal of another feline; Puss in Boots from DreamWorks).The film was directed by Raul Garcia and Manuel Sicilia, and written by that duo as well as Jose E. Machuca. It is presented by Banderas himself; which is to say there is a little segment featuring him and a few of the animated characters in a theater before the movie begins.  This has also made its rounds as the official trailer for the picture on other Phase 4 titles.  It was released in Spain on December 25, 2008 in Spanish and reached United States audiences on March 9, 2012 in English thanks to Phase 4 Films.It comes in at a run-time of 100 minutes and wears a PG rating for some mild action/ peril and some rude humor.So what about the film itself you ask?  Well I suppose I should start with the good.  The process of taking a foreign film, slapping an English dub vocal track onto it and calling it a day is usually a train wreck.  Dialog is usually nonsensical or overly simplistic in effort to match up with mouth flaps, natural conversational flow is almost nonexistent and never mind solid comedic timing.  Missing Lynx manages to somehow avoid most of these pitfalls.  In fact, a viewer would be hard pressed to recognize that the film wasnt originally created for English-speaking North American audiences.  This is definitely a very good thing indeed!Thats not to say it doesnt fall victim to a bunch of other children film cliches; the gecko has a nerve-grating voice, moronic evil henchmen abound, certain themes are driven home to the point of redundancy etc.However, all in all, the piece is watchable and the younger set will likely enjoy the bright, colorful visuals.  Character animations are nice for the most part and a majority of the humor is derived from the slap-stick, in your face variety.Adults may not be quite so forgiving, especially those of us who have been spoiled by the likes of DreamWorks & Pixar into realizing just how far this medium can be stretched in terms of layered plot, flawless pacing and so on.The story here revolves around the idea that a bunch of animals from Doana National Park in Spain are trying to save other animals kidnapped by a mysterious group of evil humans.  We do get a little plot twist in the latter portion of the film revealing that said humans ambitions arent entirely malevolent (a welcomed change of pace to the dozens of films out there pounding home the message that all humans are destroyers of nature/ must be stopped).So simple a summary doesnt fully capture how the plot meanders around and sometimes feels like it isnt entirely sure where it wants to go next.  Fortunately the ending does its best to redeem that sensation with a cute conclusion.Speaking of cute conclusions, mine is that this is certainly a watchable film and worthy of the cost of a rental.  It is in no danger of costing DreamWorks any fans but it does hold up fairly decently among the ever-increasing Phase 4 Films catalog of CG movies","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1G4465XTZYD0Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003J7HO6O#wasThisHelpful","R1G4465XTZYD0Z","AHF97M45JFCB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AHF97M45JFCB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"To be completely honest, my first taste of western mythos combined with eastern animation practice came in the form of 2008s Gotham Knight.  When the film(s) concluded, my own conclusion was that the practice of combing the two elements was anything but a smooth one.  It was rather interesting to witness what anime masters were able to do with the long standing DC franchise but as a whole it felt too dark, disjointed and frankly strange to warrant a repeat viewing for my taste.Enter 2010 when the practice of combining American comic material with Japanese anime would surface once again.  This time it would be Marvel properties, four of them to be exact, produced in collaboration between Marvel Entertainment and Japanese animation studio Madhouse. The four twelve-episode series were based on Iron Man, Wolverine, X-Men, and Blade respectively.As anyone who follows anything about Wolverine likely realizes, his backstory makes for perhaps the smoothest transition into anime material; after all, according to 1982s  limited comic series Wolverine by Chris Claremont and Frank Miller, we learn of a whole period of Logans life spent in Japan following events taking place in WWII.  It is this era that Wolverine the anime covers (it is also this era that was used in the 2013 live action film The Wolverine).To summarize the plot concisely and without spoilers, Logan learns that his true love, Mariko Yashida, who disappeared a year earlier, has been taken to Tokyo by her father Shingen Yashida, the head of the Japanese crime syndicate Kuzuryu to be wed to crime boss Hideki Kurohagi. Wolverine goes on a quest to rescue Mariko and hack, slash and otherwise dispatch a whole plethora of opponents along the way.I realize that sounds alarmingly simplistic but truly, that is the plot.  Madhouse takes its time spanning 12 twenty-two minute episodes (284-minutes total) to tell this tale in a manner that only anime could.It goes without saying that there are notable differences in philosophy between the American and Japanese approach to animation and perhaps nowhere are these differences clearer than in an instance like this; where a long standing American institution, one we have all seen animated dozens of times over throughout the years, is subjected to the full anime treatment then brought back to the US with your choice of original Japanese dialog track, English dub and the option to run subtitles beneath either.Right off the bat I have to confess that some elements work here in the format, perhaps even succeed while others fall flat.  Lets take a look at some of these nuances in the hopes of determining whether this collection is right for you.  Well begin with the pacing of the piece; which can only be described as anime.  If that means nothing to you, imagine an episodic story that is serialized in the strictest sense of the term.  Episodes can (and frequently do) end on absolute cliffhangers with no hope of resolve until future episodes in the arc.  Minimal time is spent catching the viewer up on past events.  In short, this is a single tale broken up into 12 individual chapters rather than 12 separate episodes comprising a single season as is common here in the US.Furthermore anime takes a very methodical and plodding approach to its storytelling, often giving the impression that it is under no pressure whatsoever to hurry the prose along.  As such its not uncommon to encounter entire episodes that advance the overall plot no further than 18-minutes of a fight sequence (complete with blood and intensity).  Again, not right or wrong, just different from the western school of thought on animation.Visually the piece is all eastern; which is to say beautiful throughout.  Never mind super saturated color pallets or anything cartoony for that matter.  The look of the show is almost like portrait art set into motion.  Madhouse truly spared no expense in bringing its renowned artistic quality to the franchise.Exposition falls onto the show not tell side of the coin and as a result dont expect abundant dialog here.  Many episodes contain only a handful of spoken sentences and are instead visually intensive with multiple flashbacks and points of view to consider.I have to say that about my own biggest complaint to the series stems from the fact that the titular character is portrayed in a light that long-standing fans of the material may find askew.  The bestial, short, stout and foul tempered Logan/Wolverine of comic lore is absent entirely here and in his place is a tall, lean mullet-sporting mutant.  Yes theyve included his extra-sensitive sniffer, fangs and trademark adamantium claws, but the character is rife with the cold, quiet distantly disturbed quality that seems to be a staple among lead anime roles.  Combine this with the minimal dialog and (with the English actor especially) a delivery that sounds forcefully monotone and emotionless and you come away with a Logan who is equal parts Cloud Strife and Neo from the Matrix.All in all, despite how it may seem by my critique, I do find the process of witnessing the translation of a beloved franchise through a different philosophy of animation to be an enjoyable one.  The price is certainly affordable to warrant adding the complete anime to any collection though I dont suppose it will be loved by any and all fans of the Wolverine/ X-Men franchise.  Going into it expecting anime that just so happens to involve Marvel characters makes it far more enjoyable than expecting Madhouses interpretation of say X-Men Evolution.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R5QJUTULT7Y0N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007IKKSNY#wasThisHelpful","R5QJUTULT7Y0N","AHF97M45JFCB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AHF97M45JFCB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Ill be completely up front going into this critique, Im one of these guys who would have told you straight up before having gone into this series that nothing coming out in 2008 could have rivaled the awesomeness that was the 1994 Animated Series.  Now that Ive completed this two-disc dvd set, I am pleased to have been wrong.  Of course the tragedy surrounding this show is that unlike the aforementioned Spider-Man: TAS, Spectacular only lived to see a pair of 13-episode seasons before its untimely demise despite original plans to have it match The Animated Series benchmark of 65.If youre new to the Spectacular way of doing things, a few notes of interest are 1) Just like X-Men Evolution before it and Iron Man Armored Adventures after, Spectacular Spider-Man takes the long-standing characters and situations and turns them into a high-school angle. 2) The art style is deceptively bright and simplistic, especially when compared to animated incarnations of the franchise in the past.However, I can state with confidence that neither of these facts should justify overlooking this gem (as I nearly did).  Perhaps because Peter Parkers geekiness outside of costume lends itself so perfectly to the nerdy guy at school and perhaps because overly detailed and rippling muscles have never been what this hero is about, Spectacular succeeds far better in its delivery and prose than it has any right to (and certainly succeeds over the other high-school aged Marvel franchises mentioned).The events of the series are all based upon original comic book story threads but are presented in a manner where story-arcs are been condensed and reconfigured in order to include classic and important characters who originally appeared much later.  Another possible reason for the formulas success here is that characters like Mary Jane Watson, Gwen Stacy, and Harry Osborn are depicted not as direct equivalents to their older counterparts from the comics, but rather as characters who will in-time evolve into their respective roles.In keeping with the theme of unprecedented attention to detail, the two seasons of the series are each set during a semester of Peter's high school year, with season one running from September to November and season two from December to March.Now the problem with the fact that the show only went two seasons is twofold as well.  First, it becomes clear very early on that the shows creators were pacing themselves in terms of introducing larger running story arcs under the assumption that theyd have a lot more seasons to weave the larger prose together. (I for one found the Tombstone back story to be very intriguing).  Secondly, the releasing of the two seasons to the home market has been confusing and not entirely logical.First they dropped DVD collections containing a few episodes each that formed smaller story arcs.  Then in July of 2009, the collection being reviewed here, The Complete First Season finally came out which had fans of the series hopeful a complete second season DVD release would follow shortly thereafter.  Unfortunately that never happened and in fact it was beginning to look like the second and final season was never going to get a home release at all.  Then in April of 2014 The Spectacular Spider-Man: The Complete Series was released on Blu-Ray only.  This set would contain all 26-episodes comprising both seasons once and for all.  While this is certainly great news for fans of the show, it puts those of us who purchased this DVD in a rough spot.  Our only option really is to purchase the new Blu-Ray and in essence buy the first season over again to get the second one.  Ive been burned by this technique countless times in the past.  My advice to those considering ordering the DVD being reviewed here, to avoid this mess, do yourself a favor and just pick up The Spectacular Spider-Man: The Complete Series on Blu from the get-go.All in all though, its truly a shame that the show had never been given a chance to stretch its proverbial wings.  It manages to accomplish a lot of magnificent story telling in a surprisingly few amount of episodes.  In fact much of the backlash generated by Marvels more recent Ultimate Spider-Man series stems from the fact that it replaced Spectacular.  Perhaps IGN praised it best when it named The Spectacular Spider-Man the 30th in the Top 100 Best Animated TV Shows (even outranking the 1990s Spider-Man: TAS in the process) as well as having ranked it # 22 of the Greatest 25 Cartoons for Adults.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2WGZVFHEH14I8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002A5EBLW#wasThisHelpful","R2WGZVFHEH14I8","AHF97M45JFCB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AHF97M45JFCB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Allow me to begin this review by clearing the air on one important issue of note- there are a lot of critiques littering cyberspace faulting this film of falling short of the precedent set by the DCU and specifically when compared to the Justice League animated features that have preceded it.  To such complaints I do remind that nowhere is this feature even titled Justice League but rather the JLA Adventures (JLA of course representing Justice League of America).  This is important simply because Warner and the individuals responsible for this piece are making sure to differentiate the film (and those intended to follow it) as entirely separate off-shoots of the Justice League fans of come to know and love.So what then are the JLA Adventures specifically?  The short answer is what would happen if you modernized the universe, characters, plots and animation of the 70s/80s Hana-Barbara series Superfriends.  In fact this film is loosely based upon a 1978 episode titled ""The Secret Origins of the Superfriends"".The plot, summarized as concisely as possible without giving away any spoilers, works off the idea that if Lex Luthor and his fellow Legion of Doom members were to go back in time to intercept the unanticipated arrival of young Kryptonian Kal-El before his being adopted by Martha and Jonathan Kent, there would be no Superman and thus no Justice League to stand in their way.  Never mind such plot holes as if such mastery over time truly existed, there would be a near-infinite number of more effective means of achieving world domination; do keep in mind this is all based upon screenplay work for children's Saturday morning television in the mid 1970s.  Then it becomes clear to simply be grateful that the powers that be decided to omit the Wondertwins and Gleek from this film.Beginning with the look of the piece, it's safe to say that the Superfriends have never been presented in finer detail.  Truly the colors, animation and fight sequences are all top notch.  Nearly equal to contemporary Justice League feature films from the DCU and easily on par with the JL series efforts of the early to mid 2000s.The casting and vocal work is solid as well, if a tier or two below what we've come to expect from the DCU and the DCAU before that.  Peter Jessop performs the voice of Superman and manages to capture some of the authority and good nature of the character (albeit not nearly as effortlessly as say Tim Daly) and Dietrich Bader reprises his Brave and the Bold role as the Caped Crusader (again, passable but vastly inferior to the spoiling Kevin Conroy has provided us throughout the years).The remainder of the League (exception, Robin) do adequate work considering what they are given; Wonder Woman, for example, has nary a complete paragraph of dialog throughout.  Surprisingly, Kevin Michael Richardson, veteran Lex Luthor actor in the DCAU after Clancy Brown, is on cast but used to voice Solomon Grundy and Black Manta while Fred Tatasciore voices a fairly lackluster Lex.Superfriends fans will delight at the use of such long standing cues as the Legion of Doom's Darth Vader head spaceship/ base of operations and even the title sequence, which borrows from the Season 3 opening.  The cast is pretty spot-on for what plot-points exist here as well, with notable absentees coming in the form of Green Lantern and Hawkman.Pacing, as can be expected for a film that completes in under an hour, is remarkably brisk and leaves very little time for such nuances as character development or in-depth back story (though in all fairness, it absolutely puts to shame the total development Superfriends managed to accomplish in its entire 13-year run).Special features here are limited to a bunch of WB trailers and two Superfriends episodes: The Mysterious Time Creatures (season 2) and Elevator to Nowhere (season 5).  While both of these episodes were surely selected on account of the fact that they deal with time travel in some capacity, the episode most closely resembling the plot of Trapped in Time (season 3's Secret Origins of the Superfriends) is absent.All in all, it makes sense that as the DCU has raised the bar in their previous releases to such a level that anything shy of sheer storytelling perfection comes under immediate and heavy scrutiny.  Perhaps more clearly labeling JLA Adventures: Trapped in Time with a subtitle to the effect of ""A Modern Incarnation of the Classic Superfriends"" could have saved many a potential customer some grief and backlash.  Going into the film with this ideal certainly makes the experience a lot more enjoyable.  In fact, I've discovered a technique for achieving the ultimate satisfaction with this film: watch the two included Superfriends episodes on the disc first.  Suddenly JLA's weaknesses become a whole lot less glaring!The reason for my 3-star rating then, as I vowed not to fault it for harking back to a simpler time in both society and superhero animation, stems from the fact that the release is fairly pricey (I paid $14.99 for it upon release) for a film that isn't even quite an hour (not to mention devoid of special features/ commentaries & so on) and the fact that the ending is such where sequels are inevitable.  This film absolutely reeks of its potential as a two-episode pilot for a weekly animated series, which truly makes one wonder if that's not how it had been originally intended.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3MBH7N5TSCKK4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00I40K6RU#wasThisHelpful","R3MBH7N5TSCKK4","AHF97M45JFCB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AHF97M45JFCB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It was only a matter of time before Id succumb to the charms of the motion comic genre and now that Ive finally purchased and watched a few, I can firmly attest to the fact that Astonishing X-Men Gifted is a success on all fronts.To begin, do try to ignore all of the negative reviews that bash products like this one and the many other motion comics on the market (easily identifiable in Marvels thanks to the Marvel Knights branding right on the package) for poor or choppy animation. This is a motion comic after all, not an animated series.  Thats like faulting a box of Kraft Mac & Cheese for not being spaghetti.Anyway, if the idea of a motion comic means nothing to you, think the actual pages of the graphic novel on which the story is based scanned into a computer one panel at a time and Photoshop used to move limbs, turn heads, make mouth flaps match spoken dialog etc.  Never does this claim to be nor replace traditional animation practices.Instead (as the commentary on this particular DVD eloquently confesses), this is an entirely new entertainment medium altogether.  One that bridges the gap between the static panels of a comic and the acting/ motion of a film or cartoon.  As such, the experience of viewing is pretty unique and quite enjoyable.  Truly it captures the tone, look and feel of the comic like no other medium Im aware of but does so with just enough energy to keep it very separate from say, reading a comic book on the Marvel app.I personally found myself noticing its uniqueness for the first few segments of the first episode (there are 6 contained on this disc in total/ based on issues # 1-6) but by the end, had forgotten entirely that this was in fact a motion comic and not simply a TV series.  Perhaps some of this can be attributed to Joss Whedons engaging story-line, which, in the event that you havent read the graphic novels on which these Marvel Knights Astonishing X-Men motion comics are based, is quite impressive.Without giving up too many spoilers, the plot introduces a ""mutant cure"" designed by Benetech scientist Dr. Kavita Rao, who was secretly sponsored by the gladiator alien Ord. The prospect of ""real"" humanity arouses the interest of a heavily mutated Beast, who visits Rao only to discover that the drug is the product of illegal human experimentation and all the while the lines drawn between society and mutant-kind are becoming venerable walls.In short, now only is the plot intriguing and rich but the dialog is spot-on as well, with witty quips and awesome character exchanges aplenty.  Pacing is entirely too quick though for my taste as the 6 roughly 10-minute episodes are over just as the action is heating up.Which brings me to my only complaint, to get the story in its motion comic entirety, one must purchase separate DVDs for Volume 2 (Dangerous), Volume 3 (Torn) and Volume 4 (Unstoppable).  At around $10 a pop, youre looking at close to $50 to enjoy the tale in its entirety.  Worse still is that Marvel Knights isnt stopping with just Joss Whedons take on the X franchise either as already Ultimate Wolverine Vs. Hulk, Wolverine Vs. Sabretooth, Wolverine Origin, and Weapon X Tomorrow Dies Today have already been released.  Building up a Marvel Knights motion comic collection can add up really quickly and its addicting enough to warrant doing so.  It would really be nice if Shout! Factory, at the very least, would have bundled up all of the Joss Whedon arc of the franchise into a single DVD box-set rather than forcing buyers to pick up 4 separate releases to get the full story.  Note that since the time of this reviews writing, that have done exactly this for the Blu-ray edition of the material calling it Marvel Knights: Astonishing X-Men BluRay Box.That single complaint aside, its very easy to recommend picking up Astonishing X-Men Gifted to dedicated comic fans and neophytes alike.  Truly the experience is entirely unique even from those as seemingly similar as the various animated incarnations of the franchise throughout the years (and certainly much more loyal to the source material than all of the live action films combined).Gifted represents my first foray into the motion comic genre and will certainly not be my last.  Im already quite interested in picking up InHumans and Black Panther in my next binge.  Exciting news for all, but perhaps most so to my credit card company.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2YUJ5H6VG4US7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003NHMYJ2#wasThisHelpful","R2YUJ5H6VG4US7","AHF97M45JFCB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AHF97M45JFCB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Youd certainly be forgiven if 2010s A Turtles Tale: Sammy's Adventures slipped by you without notice.  In a literal, uh, sea of competition, STUDIOCANALs take on the oceanic talking-animal CG thing didnt make the biggest splash.  And unlike a variety of the underwater films flooding the market at the time (Finding Nemo, DreamWorks Shark Tale, The Reef (and Reef 2), Dolphin: The Story of a Dreamer, Sea Level and ultimately ending with the abysmal Legend of the Sea; I would place in that order from best to worst); A Turtles Tale was surprisingly enjoyable.  On my make-shift hierarchy, I would place the first Turtles Tale probably between DreamWorks Shark Tale and The Reef.It was only natural then that the creative force behind the film would give it another go and on August 15 of 2012, A Turtle's Tale 2: Sammy's Escape from Paradise hit Belgian theaters.  Coming in at a runtime of 93-minutes (up from 88 for the original), the sequel picks up right where the first film leaves off with lead characters Sammy and Ray supervising the new generation of green and leatherback turtle hatchlings and their quest to cross the beach to reach the ocean.In short an attack by seagulls, who want the hatchlings for food, results in the adult turtles collective distraction from approaching poachers.  As a result they get captured and end up on a fishing boat that deposits them in a one of the most beautiful aquariums in the world.From here the formula actually starts to resemble classic prison break films thematically with the (admittedly adorable) hatchlings doing the best they can to assist their captive grandfathers in escaping back to the open ocean.Interestingly while the first film spanned a period of 50-years, the sequel tells of an adventure that couldnt have lasted for more than a week or two.  Director Ben Stassen, founder of nWave Pictures, returns for this sequel but shares the director credit with Vincent Kesteloot, who makes his feature-length debut in this piece.  Perhaps as a result of this collaboration (or maybe even in spite of it), the pacing of the film isnt quite as fluid as the first.  This isnt too suggest there are superfluous or unnecessary scenes or segments that do little to advance the overall prose so much as a lack of cleverness makes itself felt in about the middle of the film that never fully dissipates by the conclusion.It appears as though the filmmakers realized this too and went the extra nautical mile to create some interesting coconspirators in the aquarium; among these a lobster with multiple personality disorder, a bug-eyed blobfish with a penchant for playing dead named Jimbo and a gangster seahorse named Big D just to mention a few.  The bad news is even such a unique group of characters cant distract the viewer from the simple fact that, not unlike Finding Nemo, Back to the Sea and a dozen other films before it, the core of the tale is the captive characters attempting to flee a tank.  Of course, and as is becoming standard fare in these types of films, eco themed environmentalism is one of the major themes incorporated into the onscreen antics.  Big D may be the superficial villain of the piece but is quite harmless when compared to the human threats, which come in the form of poaching, imprisoning, polluting, killing, ingesting and so on.In the plus column, the films soundtrack dazzles and makes use of a track that has been inconspicuously absent from all the underwater films preceding this one: The B-52's Rock Lobster.All in all, the film is by no means unwatchable and theres always the possibility that youngsters will enjoy the big-eyed characters and bright background visuals.  Adults will likely find themselves glancing at their watches from the middle onward.  However, created on a very modest budget of $10-million and having grossed $69.5 mil at the box office alone, theres the very good possibility the filmmakers will have an opportunity to atone when they revisit Sammy and all his underwater pals in future installments.","3.0 out of 5 stars","February 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RUREQOBK435T0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00B7EQPNE#wasThisHelpful","RUREQOBK435T0","AHF97M45JFCB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AHF97M45JFCB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Its been almost 3-years to the day since the films DVD release (1/11/2011) that I finally dug through my animated film queue deep enough to give Alpha and Omega its due.  The reason for the delay? Well for one, abundant negative reviews surrounding this piece.  A quick search reveals no shortage of critics, professional and amateur alike, willing to slam this movie in just about every conceivable unit of measurement.  Yet despite the criticisms, Alpha and Omega just continues plugging along.  Nowhere was this reality more abundant than when this past October a direct-to-DVD sequel was released (A Howl-iday Adventure) with word that Alpha and Omega 3: The Great Wolf Games (2014), Alpha and Omega 4: The Legend of the Saw-Tooth Cave (2014) and Alpha and Omega 5: Family Vacation (2015) were going to follow.Five-part CG films put this series in very exclusive company as, after all, even blockbusters like Pixars Toy Story has only gone three and DreamWorks Shrek and Blue Skys Ice Age have reached the golden number of four (not including spin-offs and shorts).  Clearly, despite critical disappointment, the film has been deemed powerful enough to warrant continued support, a fact made even clearer by three franchise books by Scholastic as well as several licensed video games at present.So why all the attention you wonder?  In short it was a box office success through and through.  The film hit 2,625 theaters via Lionsgate with an estimated budget of $20-mil.  By the time it finished its theatrical run, it had grossed $50,507,267.  Thats not even taking into account DVD, Blu and licensing revenue.  As a result Alpha and Omega earns the prestigious honor of being the most successful film to date from Lionsgate or Indias Crest Animation, the two companies responsible for the films creation.All that being said, Alpha and Omega tells the tail er I mean tale of two young wolves in Canada's Jasper National Park: Humphrey (Justin Long) and Kate (Hayden Panettiere). The latter is an alpha, being groomed for leadership and hunting prowess while the former is one of the ragtag omegas; the good hearted and funny members of the group known more for riding logs down the wooded hillside than leading the pack. With hunting territory hanging in the balance, their pack faces a challenge from the encroaching Eastern wolves. In an effort to unite the packs and thus prevent war between the two, alpha Winston (Danny Glover) has promised the hand, er I mean paw in marriage of his eldest daughter, Kate, to the son of Eastern leader Tony (Dennis Hopper).Despite Tonys son Garth (Chris Carmack) being a bit of a meat head, not to mention a terrible howler to boot, the plan goes to pot when park rangers tranquilize and relocate Kate (along with Humphrey) to Idaho to repopulate Sawtooth National Forest as apparently we foolish humans are completely unaware of the laws governing wolves whereby alphas and omegas are prohibited from mating, or as its referred to here, howling together.The core of the tale centers on Humphrey and Kates attempts to return to their home while the two wolf packs teeter on the brink of all out territory war.The screenplay for this one was written by Steve Moore; the guy responsible for the much clunkier Open Season 2 and there are more than a few passing similarities between the two pieces.  Among these talking canines, oblivious humans, stowaways in motorhomes, slight themes of environmentalism and so on.However, unlike Open Season 2, Alpha and Omega carries much better plot momentum and, as is apparently requisite for animation to succeed in theaters these days, a few musical numbers of varying degrees of attainment.I actually came away from this film quite pleasantly surprised and a little bewildered by the pattern of negativity surrounding it.  While its true that it lacks the big-budget eye candy of your modern day Pixar or DreamWorks CG feature (or the complexly layered humor of say Illuminations Despicable Me franchise), what is here is 88-minutes of cute entertainment with a  perfectly cast vocal cast and a charming/ distinct art style to boot.  While its true that the film takes very few chances and introduces nothing new to the genre, its hardly as flawed as many similarly budgeted CG pieces jamming up the Redbox these days- particularly those that are actually foreign films with an English dialog track slapped on.At the end of the day, going in with low expectations certainly helps to appreciate Alpha and Omega for what it is but, as I can safely affirm, leaving it sitting on your DVD shelf for three years is certainly overkill.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3MQX0TK9JWBKF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002ZG972Y#wasThisHelpful","R3MQX0TK9JWBKF","AHF97M45JFCB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AHF97M45JFCB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"On the whole childrens books make for some excellent source material for computer generated features.  And why wouldnt they? Theyre typically cute stories for viewers of all ages rife with bright artwork and laced with some sort of life-lesson for good measure.  And such was the reasoning behind Sony Pictures Animations 2009 big screen adaptation of the 1978 childrens book Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs.  While the source material was pretty simplistic, Sony managed to scrape quite a memorable and charming tale of what was there.  Perhaps due to a wonderful voice ensemble, layers of humor that appealed to kids and adults alike, unique visuals or some combination of the three- the original Cloudy sort of came out of nowhere and managed to dazzle just about all who encountered it thus explaining how it turned its $100-million budget into $243-mil (gross) worldwide.As is expected in Hollywood, no money-making stone remains unturned and a sequel was all but inevitable and 4-years after the original film, we got Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2, which, interestingly opted not to acknowledge the literary sequel (Pickles to Pittsburgh) and instead continue on with the plot, characters and settings established in the first film.The film actually opens with a brief recap of events taking place in the first movie, mainly that Flint Lockwood's (Bill Hader) FLDSMDFR (Flint Lockwood Diatonic Super Mutating Dynamic Food Replicator) was blown up at the conclusion of the first adventure but apparently wasnt destroyed in the process.  Buried in mountains of uneaten and mostly gigantic food; the citizens if Swallow Falls, though relieved to be alive, are faced with the daunting task of industrial caliber cleanup.  Fortunately the United Nations, aware of the fact that almost every city on the planet suffered the consequences of Flints invention enlist the aid of revolutionary tech company, Live Corp for the actual cleanup.  Flint is awestruck when he discovers his childhood idol; scientific mogul Chester V (Will Forte) is leading the job personally.  Whats more- Chester enlists Flint directly to try to track down the rogue food-making machine so as to deactivate it once and for all with a device known as the BS-USB.Lockwood, his girlfriend Sam Sparks (Anna Faris), dad Tim (James Caan), monkey Steve (Neil Patrick Harris), Baby er I mean Chicken Brent (Andy Samberg), overzealous cop Earl (Terry Crews replacing Mr. T.) and jack-of-all-trades Manny (Benjamin Bratt) travel from their temporary digs in San Franjose back to Swallow Falls which has apparently become overrun by a bizarre race of sentient food/ animal hybrids called, you guessed it: Foodimals.What results is a pretty whimsical adventure/ expedition piece rather reminiscent of the later Jurassic Park films with heards of stampeding unnatural animals, adorable talking fruits, massive gentle giants and puns aplenty littered throughout a tropical jungle where once civilization existed.  Theres some good news and bad news in this- The good is that the writers of the sequel had to waste very little time developing their characters this time around as it is a literal continuation of characters (and actors), sets and even circumstances of the first movie.  The bad news is lack of character development nips this piece in its proverbial backside almost constantly to the point that the finished product doesnt feel like a solidly constructed story so much as a series of set-ups and plot devices to simply get the viewer to the next marquee moment. Yes, a lot of these marquee moments are clever, witty, creative and often funny, the problem is they come at the expense of the one thing the first film had in abundance: heart.Make no mistake, this film manages to hit all of its marks and at times feels perhaps a bit too reformed and revised for its own good.  Kids will likely be enthralled with the ridiculously lush color pallet and larger-than-life characters and adults, especially those for a penchant for tongue-in-cheek humor & puns will find many opportunities to giggle as well.  In fact that leads me to about my biggest complaint of the piece: when judged on its own merit, its 95-minutes of pretty enjoyable and well-presented CG entertainment but it starts to feel a bit contrived and hollow when compared to the original.On paper all of the pieces for success are present- even some slightly muddled themes of vegetarianism and anti-corporatism and an ending that doesnt quite offer the scale of resolve that the premise sets up, its still pretty tricky to come away from this one without a positive vibe and a few good laughs to boot.  And at the end of the day, isnt that exactly why we watch these types of movies in the first place?","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RIRZDGPF1LQKQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0090SI1RM#wasThisHelpful","RIRZDGPF1LQKQ","AHF97M45JFCB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AHF97M45JFCB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Well we all know that Finding Nemo set the standard by which all other underwater CG films are compared and to date, few (if any) have managed to get the formula right.  Beginning with DreamWorks Shark Tale and crossing over A Turtle's Tale: Sammy's Adventures 1 & 2, The Reef (and Reef 2), Dolphin: The Story of a Dreamer and ultimately ending with the abysmal Legend of the Sea; thats roughly the order Id place them in from best to worst but the question becomes where does Sea Level fit in all of this?To cut to the chase, it ends up coming in closer to the worse side of the list though in all fairness its definitely better produced and certainly more tolerable than the unwatchable Legend of the Sea and actually trumps 20th Century Foxs Dolphin the Story of a Dreamer in most categories as well.  If none of this means anything to you, lets take a look at the film on its own merits for a better understanding of where it succeeds and where it comes up short.Sea Level comes to us by way of Silver Ant; a Malaysian animation outfit where it was originally called SeeFood and hit theaters in March of 2012.  Working with 40 animators, the team took roughly two years to complete the animation process.  Coming in at a runtime of 92-minutes, Sea Level boasts a very appropriate PG rating for animated intensity and some inappropriate language  parents, take this rating seriously.  Children being called idiots, getting smacked around and the word hell all make appearances here.The story centers on an unlikely duo- Pup, a young bamboo shark and Julius the intimidating but good hearted oceanic white-tip shark.  Pup discovers egg sacs within his reef while exploring only to be startled by human poachers who show up out of seemingly nowhere and steal the eggs.Determined to locate and restore the un-hatched shark eggs to their rightful environment, Pup sets out on a ridiculously challenging task, with the aid of Julius, a wise sea turtle, a shady sting-ray and a few other characters, to get the eggs back from the domain of humanity.While seemingly straightforward a plot structure as a film geared for children should be; Sea Levels greatest crime is that the delivery is incredibly muddled.  Somewhere along the way, we have some good intentions like sharks being more than mindless killing machines, humanity is to blame for the disappearance of a lot of the oceans species, pollution is bad and so on but the trouble is they are so strangely integrated into the story that any value they may have originally contained are filtered right out.Take for example the ludicrous concept that fish, well at least this one particular bamboo shark, is capable of living on land and breathing air.  In my opinion, this in and of itself undoes 99% of the films message (not to mention all of the research the crew allegedly did to master the movements, behaviors, and mannerisms of the actual animals appearing in the piece).If this werent enough, by the end we have the other shark running around in a mech suit, we have an army of chickens hoping the sharks succeed, young kids getting arrested by the police and so on.  In short, it doesnt take much for the whole thing to come unraveled.Then there are the environmental themes scattered about that really dont make things any better for the floundering prose.  Yes there is a plant shown dumping toxins into the ocean that we occasionally flash to and there is a scene where the sea turtle is struggling to get air on account of the plastic shopping bag wrapped around her head but then were given the subplot that an evil eel and his band of crabs are supporting the pollution as part of their plan for oceanic domination.  Wait, the lesson here is that certain creatures are pro-pollution?At the end of the day enough plot holes to drive a submarine through mixed with odd pacing that seems more like sequences were simply strung together than it does a continuous narrative will keep Sea Level from ever challenging the dominance of top entries in the genre.In the plus column, the characters, backgrounds, animations, theyre all pretty nice.  Rendering is smooth and clean, particle effects and layering are very well done.  On account of the fact that film, though created in Malaysia, was originally recorded and animated in English means that moth flaps and timing are all spot-on (avoiding the biggest pitfall known to plague imported foreign animated works).At the end of the day, Sea Level is by no means unwatchable but the beautifully drawn colorful DVD cover-art does little to portray some of the major inconsistencies contained within.  Silver Ant displays a lot of potential, talent and passion in this piece but they would be wise to bring a western consultant on board for future projects should they wish to have a go at the leaders of the animated feature film industry.","3.0 out of 5 stars","February 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2IPLGRR35KDJN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007FF3HQM#wasThisHelpful","R2IPLGRR35KDJN","AHF97M45JFCB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AHF97M45JFCB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Like many kids in the early 1980s, I remember the Inspector Gadget franchise pretty fondly.  While it lacked the fantastical elements I craved in my daily He-Man fix and the over-the-top do-gooder ways of Superfriends on the weekends, it was always a treat to visit Metro City's bionic crime fighter, his niece and the true ""brains"" behind the operation; Brain the dog.Naturally over time, the charms of the show faded to the recesses of memory and when rumors of the 1999 live-action version began to circulate, I was immediately doubt-stricken.  To me the whole Inspector Gadget concept was birthed on the principles of cartoonism: The laws of physics are intermittent at best, bombs are always of the black cherry (with lit wick) variety, dogs (well one in particular) walk upright and do their best to talk- it just wasn't the type of stuff made to be taken seriously.Well of course the movie came and went and somehow so did a sequel but the true vibe of the cartoon seemed doomed to fade into absolute obscurity.  When, in 2005 it was announced a computer generated animated feature film would be released once again centering on the good Inspector and his pals, some hope was restored.After finally having had to enjoy the film, I have to say that fans of the original incarnation will certainly find much more to be pleased about here than they would have in either of the live action incarnations.For starters, this piece was created by Canada's Mainframe Entertainment.  If the name doesn't ring any bells, rest assured these guys were doing the CG cartoon thing even back when Pixar was primarily a software company.  They pioneered the format with their show Reboot in the early 90s then continued to do their thing steadily throughout the years: Transformers Beast Wars & Beast Machines, Max Steel, a dozen Barbie and Hot Wheels direct-to-dvd CG pieces and even a full-length feature designed to keep Pixar and DreamWorks honest in 2008 (The Nutty Professor).  All told, they've been busy!The 67-minute movie actually borrows a few elements from the live-action movie version of the mythos (like the talking Gadgetmobile and scientist love interest for Penny) but the narrative is undeniably inspired from the original cartoon.  The pacing is brisk and the silliness of the absent minded Inspector gets underway literally within the first couple of minutes of the film.The story centers on Dr. Claw escaping from MC Pen with a little assistance from the hilariously Scottish henchman Bombaboy, leaving a crater in the earth where once existed a maximum security prison.  While scoured the scene in typical Gadget fashion, the Inspector finds minimal clues to Claw's whereabouts (though evidence is a plenty) and instead uncovers an un-hatched dinosaur egg.Penny and the scientist Looney deduce it must belong to a long-extinct species called ""Iguana Giganto""; which immediately sends Gadget on a campaign to arrest as many pet Iguanas as possible.  Newly introduced character, alien obsessed Mayor Morty Markumr, views the discovery as a sure-fire tourist attraction and the newly freed Dr. Claw realizes a flying dinosaur could be precisely the type of minion he's been lacking all these long years.The egg hatches, a metal eating dinosaur emerges and sheer chaos ensues.  Rest assured, if this all sounds silly- it certainly is!  But like I discussed earlier in this critique, such silliness has always been the cornerstone of the Inspector Gadget experience.  Fortunately the formula still works here, even after all these years.The animation is a bit stiff and the background & texture detail show nothing to get Pixar or DreamWorks nervous but it is quite a treat to view the characters and their city in 3D.  Voice work is solid throughout and it's always a pleasure to encounter CG films actually animated to accompany an English vocal track as mouth flaps and timing is impeccable.The comedy here is slightly mixed- while much of the zany slapstick that was a staple of the original cartoon survives here, the writers arguably went a bit far in making Gadget a bumbling fool.  It's always been the low-key efforts of Penny and Brain that have resulted in Gadget's success, but this film is one of few examples where the two of them may truly have been better off without the good Inspector around.Make no mistake though; there are many solid gags here: The Gadget Copter being used to cut the grass, a criminal gathering where a lively game of pin the tail on the mayor ensues (and a piata of Gadget's head).  A few gags (like Inspector Gadget unable to remember which hand contains his integrated cell phone function) get a little tired but then the film redeems this with a quote like, ""Huh dead already and I left my elbow in the charger all night"".In all, a recommended romp in the unique world of Inspector Gadget that, while it cannot replace the charm of the original series on which it's based (no need to, the original series is still out there for those who wish to seek it out), the concepts here are undeniably fun.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 24, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R308008JRN5S7W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000A6T212#wasThisHelpful","R308008JRN5S7W","AHF97M45JFCB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AHF97M45JFCB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Unlike a majority of the press, I was in the minority who actually found the original The Reef (which was based on a 2006 South Korea film, Shark Bait) enjoyable.  Maybe because even the major studios haven't fully convinced me that underwater CG films are their strongest (Pixar's Finding Nemo and DreamWorks' Shark Tale for example) or maybe it's because the grade B attempts (Dolphin: The Story of a Dreamer, Sea Level & Legend of the Sea to mention a few) have demonstrated just how bad it can get... All I can say is that considering Shark Bait wasn't even designed to be a North American release, the finished product that was The Reef managed to deliver.The Reef 2: High Tide went about things a little bit differently: This time it wasn't just an English script dubbed atop a foreign film but rather a piece designed from the onset to serve as a direct sequel to The Reef.  It was animated again in South Korea and released to American audiences in October of 2012.The film makes a rather unfortunate assumption that you've seen The Reef and are quite familiar with the events that unfolded.  If you are not, the rather straight forward narrative and flow of this one is easy enough for even a young child to follow though do expect many references to events that took place in the original.At its core The Reef 2 is simply a revenge story.  The bully shark of the original film (who gets his tail handed to him in the end) decides it's time to pay back the occupants of the reef; particularly the small fish Pi who gave him the business.Oddly enough, though rumors abound that suggest the sequel had a bigger budget than the original film, a majority of the solid vocal cast was swapped out this time around.  Gone is Freddy Prinze Jr. as Pi and in his place Drake Bell, Evan Rachel Wood goes bye-bye for Busy Phillips as Cordelia, Fran Drescher gets replaced by an impersonator for the role of Pearl and John Rhys-Davies is MIA entirely.  Fortunately Donal Logue returns as the villainous shark Troy as does Andy Dick as a bit part and Rob Schneider as the wise (and surprisingly non-comedic) sage sea-turtle Nerissa.  About the biggest disappointment comes in the form of new character Ronny as Jamie Kennedy seems to have been determined to create the most annoying voice humanly possible for the character.Pacing is pretty decent and kids will surely delight in the beautiful color pallet.  The film's textures look surprisingly decent, especially on the high definition Blu version.  Parents should certainly appreciate the fact that there is a (oft times heavy handed) lesson present and the values of team work, believing in one's self and smaller doesn't necessarily mean weaker are all reoccurring themes here.Adults expecting the type of cleverness studios like Pixar have been spoiling us with for the past 20-years will be slightly disappointed with the fairly straight forward nature of the plot.  To put it another way, The Reef 2 doesn't really commit any major crimes of storytelling so much as it doesn't present anything particularly new or thought-provoking to the formula either.  The producers of this one were clearly interested in playing it safe and simply continuing on with the dynamic established in the first film rather than getting fancy and risking failure.In all kids will likely enjoy this colorful romp and decent vocal performance.  The plot, though predictable and formulaic, is certainly passable and may even elicit a smile or two from the adults being forced to watch it over and over.  IMDB users collectively rated the first film a 4.2 (out of ten) and this a 3.0 at the time of the writing of this review.  Perhaps a bit harsh, the comparison is fairly indicative of the lack of originality or cleverness found in this one.  In short you can do better if a good CG romp is in order but as I attest in the beginning of this review, you can certainly do worse!","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 22, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R27JPAJZKJ2U4I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008NNY9QW#wasThisHelpful","R27JPAJZKJ2U4I","AHF97M45JFCB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AHF97M45JFCB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Love or hate their work, Phase 4 films is really doing all they can to establish themselves as a player in the Grade B computer animated feature film segment.  Of course you really can't fault them for understanding that it takes budgets so inflated even our government would blush to attempt to take on Pixar, DreamWorks, Sony Image Works and Bluesky Studios directly; the trouble is their technique of locating foreign made CG films, slapping English over the original dialog track and releasing said dub on DVD generally leaves a lot to be desired too!Enter 2011's Luke and Lucy the Texas Rangers; a shining (or maybe glaring) example of this process that likely sailed right under your radar.The film's original title was Suske en Wiske: De Texas Rakkers, which translates to Spike and Suzy: The Texas Rangers in English.  Where ""Luke & Lucy"" came from is anybody's guess.  Released theatrically in July 2009 in Belgium, it was the first in a projected 13-animated film run based on the Belgian comic book characters (published in English as Spike and Suzy and sometimes Willy and Wanda).  Confused yet? Don't be.  All you need to know is Phase 4 brought this Belgian piece to the US, redid the vocals and here we are.About the biggest problem with Phase 4's take on the material is that it does show promise; something about 99% of films created by this process lack.  The English dub actually works pretty well with the general timing of the piece and even matches mouth flaps fairly successfully.The trouble is there is some foreign weirdness that no amount of dubbing can make logical.  The core of the story centers on an evil metallic cowboy named Jim Parasite who, by use of powder, has the ability to shrink human beings down to action figure proportions.  And this is precisely what he does to the entire squad of Texas Rangers on his tail at the onset of the film.  He then proceeds to store the shrunken cops in empty whiskey bottles that he has arranged neatly on a shelf in his lair.  If this sounds a bit askew to you, rest assured, it gets much more bizarre from here.The viewer is then transported to modern day Boston where the titular sibling duo (and a host of truly bizarre family & friends) receive word of the strange happenings going on in Texas via an alcoholic neighbor who opens up a case of what he believes to be ordinary whiskey only to discover a miniaturized human contained within one of the bottles.  At this point in the film you can't help but come to the horrible realization that all of this is supposedly taking place in modern day Texas!That's right: dusty streets outside the saloon, intermittent tumble weeds, horse-mounted rangers with six shooters and duals at high noon are all apparently daily life in Texas circa 2009 according to this film yet in Boston our cast is playing video games, talking on cell phones... Perhaps it's best to not even ponder such idiosyncrasies lest we have nothing left to talk about.Once the Boston gang set forth to Texas to solve this strange mystery, we are treated to all sorts of inappropriate behavior- children impersonating police officers, holding people at gunpoint to obtain information, a man closing himself in a refrigerator to have an uninterrupted snack, the sale of alcohol to minors and on and on.  That reminds me, the PG rating this film wears certainly isn't just there for decoration.  The language alone earns the rating thanks to multiple instances of repeated cussing all centered around the word ""damn"".  This is especially dumbfounding considering the ENTIRE dialog track was dubbed into English for the North American market! They couldn't have opted for ""darn"" or ""dang"" considering this thing's supposed to be for kids and all?Anyway, back to the plot... the film works off the mystery element and, truth be told, could probably give 2011's Adventures of Tintin (Steven Spielberg) a run for the money were it not for the goofiness.  In a strange way, there is a definite connection between the two films (that must be mostly coincidental considering Luke and Lucy was actually released back in 2009 after multiple years of development).  The look of the character models, the abnormally intelligent yet silent dog, the mystery element that leads the young antagonist(s) into far away lands, the pacing that makes the movies feel at least three-times longer than their actual runtimes, it's all present in both.However, where the paths diverge comes down to some odd choices that will be sure to offend even the most liberal of households in the case of Luke and Lucy.  The tragedy here is that the visuals are well above average, especially in Blu/ high definition.  Textures are rich, models are well animated, and even the English vocal cast does a surprisingly nice job with the dialog (save for the cussing mentioned above).  Considering what the material itself presents, the finished product is unexpectedly coherent.If you've exhausted the endless stream of quality CG entertainment coming out of the Grade A studios and feel a few slightly inappropriate words coupled to a lot of inappropriate behavior and a plot that borders on utter madness are just what you've been missing, Luke and Lucy the Texas Rangers is a dream come true.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 21, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3HM3XO84FPW8S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004CWLRKO#wasThisHelpful","R3HM3XO84FPW8S","AHF97M45JFCB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AHF97M45JFCB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When it comes to Disney, Pixar has been a behind-the-scenes factor far before their official merger in 2006.  2007's Meet the Robinsons boasts John Lasseter's influence as the fusion between Disney and Pixar occurred during the production of the film (when Lasseter became the chief creative officer for the Walt Disney Company).Coming in at a runtime of 95-minutes and paced flawlessly, Meet the Robinsons can probably best be described as Disney's colorful and charming take on Back to the Future.The story centers on Lewis, an aspiring young inventor at an orphanage whose wacky inventions have been scaring off potential adopters. He comes to the realization that his birth mother is the only one who ever truly loved him and sets off to build a machine to scan the farthest reaches of his memory banks in effort to locate her.The simplicity of Lewis' life takes a massive twist when a guy his age shows up at the very science fair he intends to debut his memory scanner claiming to be a cop from the future.  Before long Lewis finds himself time traveling to one of the wackiest futures imaginable while being pursued by a mysterious villain in a bowling hat.My summary sounds simplistic but the fact of the matter is that, unlike so many films geared to the younger set, there is some genuine thought-provoking depth to this one.  In fact, and not to give anything away, I'm still pondering the relationships of all of the individuals Lewis encounters when whisked away to the year 2037.Speaking of, as a society, we've collectively been treated to a wide variety of interpretations of the future throughout the years in film, but it's a pretty safe bet that none can come close to emulating the sheer hilarious craziness of Meet the Robinsons (which technically owes a lot of its credit from the children's book on which the film is based: A Day With Wilbur Robinson by William Joyce).People traveling in bubbles, topiary gardens, giant squid butlers, a man married to a hand puppet, a pizza delivery man/ superhero wannabe; the encounters young Lewis experiences in his first few minutes in the future are bizarre, wacky, in some cases over-the-top silly but undeniably entertaining.Like most Disney feature films, the attention to detail is impeccable.  In fact, save for a few paradoxes inherent in all time travel scenarios, the science isn't even overly laughable either.  Unless of course your goal is to laugh, in which case, like Back to the Future before it, viewers of all ages are free to simply sit back and enjoy the ride without any dreaded brain-pretzeling.  Kids will laugh at the visuals, the antics and the obvious gags; adults will enjoy the layered depth and the intricacies of the plot (and the accuracy of the time line that can only be verified by repeated viewings).In all, though considered a commercial and critical success, I was actually surprised that Meet the Robinsons hasn't achieved the type of universal charm present in nearly anything Pixar touches.  Perhaps some of this is due to the simple fact that after the original agreement with Pixar expired, Disney decided they could do the whole compuer-generated feature film thing on their own and formed the Walt Disney Animation Studios, of which this is the first film.Of course, in the middle a new agreement with Pixar would be reached and hence Lasseter and company would integrate during production.  It's rumored that after having screened the film to Lasseter, some 60% of the material was altered to his suggestions into what is now the final version of the piece (a particular addition coming in the form of a T-rex having been transplanted from the Cretaceous running amok in the year 2037).Factor in a whimsical score by legendary composer Danny Elfman and the package all comes together.  Fans of CG animation and those of good story telling in general will certainly find much to appreciate here.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 17, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1KL1MF77P8MIZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000ROAK2W#wasThisHelpful","R1KL1MF77P8MIZ","AHF97M45JFCB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AHF97M45JFCB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"With the exception of Despicable Me, Universal Pictures has been pretty lax on the whole computer animated feature film phenomena, leaving the big bucks to be gathered up by rivals Disney, DreamWorks, Sony, and so on.  However, and not unlike Despicable Me, The Jungle Bunch is by no means to blame for this.In case you have no idea about how this movie came into being- the film originated in France under the title Les As de la Jungle - Operation banquise back in December of 2011.  Universal quietly brought the movie across the pond, slapped an English vocal cast together for a redub and released it as a Direct-to-DVD affair in August of 2012.It comes in at a surprisingly short 58-minute runtime and comes in unrated but it would probably be safe to assume it could be squeezed into the coveted Rated G arena if it were.  There's a little animal on animal slapstick violence but considering such sequences are actually derived from real struggles that take place in the animal kingdom, it's nothing to get excited about.The story opens on an arctic ice floe where a bunch of peaceful penguins are approached by a walrus clan who  demand half of the penguins' bounty of fish each day.  During the encounter, a single penguin egg is tossed into the ocean and gets carried off by the currents.The opening credits form a vignette explaining that the egg eventually washed ashore on a distant jungle where it was recovered by tigers.  Hatched into a tiger clan, lead character, penguin Maurice (voiced by John Lithgow) grows up believing that he too is a tiger with a skin condition that demands he paint his body stripes at regular intervals.Appointing himself a great warrior in the tradition of his ""family's"" reputation, Maurice travels the jungle with the pet tiger-fish he believes to be his own offspring, Junior as a keeper of the peace.In the meantime, a couple of penguins, fed up of being bullied by the walruses, travel all the way to the distant jungle in search of the mythical ""Great Tiger Warrior"" to free them from bondage.They do eventually locate Maurice, who just so happens to match the description of the legend, and a ragtag group of other animals like Fred the warthog (voiced by Donald Learly), frogs Al (voiced by Stan Hanks) and Bob (Chris Smith), Miguel the gorilla (voiced by Stan Hanks) and galago Gilbert (voiced by Dre Gordon).  Maurice immediately volunteers for the job and a return trip to Antarctica ensues.The pacing of the story is remarkably brisk- like 58-minutes start to finish should be.  There are really no scenes that drag on needlessly and the visuals are surprisingly tight- bright and shiny textures and caricature-style simplistic animal models.  Small children will appreciate the animation and visuals, adults will find the underlying humor passable as well.  Lithgow's unique enthusiasm shines through.My critique may sound fairly unenthusiastic but make no mistake, the fact that this film is as solid as it is testifies to a lot of incredible hard work and dedication.  In my opinion the method of slapping English dialog atop a foreign animated work is the absolute formula for disaster!Think about this for a moment: Even if you had good actors and a wonderful script, by the time you attempt to match up the dialog to the onscreen mouth flaps, the timing of the humor infallibly falls apart.  No need to take my word for this, there are dozens of examples of it on the market today (Dolphin The Story of a Dreamer, Doogal, Impy's Island, Donkey X, The Snurks and so on) that demonstrate the situation perfectly.  Taking this into consideration, The Jungle Bunch is remarkably well done- feeling almost like it was an American/ English speaking project from the onset.If you're still unsure as to whether or not this one's right for your viewing/ purchase/ rental needs, it kind of harkens back to some of the tension of the Happy Feet films (without the environmentalism slant) and combines it with the wackiness of the Madagascars (particularly the Penguins of Madagascar).In all The Jungle Bunch has done very little to shake up the computer generated film industry dominated by the likes of Disney, DreamWorks, Blue Sky Image Works and so on but it's certainly an enjoyable little romp.  At 58-minutes, it's quite endurable for adults even if the kids tend to put it on over and over... and over.  The DVD also includes 26 shorts involving the characters from the film in an interview setting.  These are surprisingly cute and add an additional 40-minutes of entertainment to the package.  In fact, after taking the tour of the shorts, it becomes very clear with a little promotion on Universal's behalf, there's a very strong chance the Jungle Bunch could have been positioned to be a viable alternative to The Penguins of Madagascar on television.  However, as it stands, this one makes for a decent rental that you just may end up adding to your collection.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 15, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RRNW1J6EHG8IV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007X1K478#wasThisHelpful","RRNW1J6EHG8IV","AHF97M45JFCB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AHF97M45JFCB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"You may notice a pattern of terrible reviews surrounding this film and that's a shame because Phase 4 films is really trying to become a factor in the CG animated feature film world ala Pixar and DreamWorks.  The trouble is films like Life's a Jungle: Africa's Most Wanted really do the animation industry an injustice and it makes sense that people who put down good money for this (even the $1.30 or so renting it from the Redbox would set you back).The question then becomes how do films like this come to be and what makes them so inferior to the type of entertainment we've come to expect from some of the companies mentioned above?  Read on for a closer look into the process and to determine whether or not this one if right for you.Life's a Jungle tells the tale of an extremely pampered house dog from England named Pip who goes on tour of Africa with his family.  When a rhino charges their open-roof jeep, Pip gets ejected from the vehicle and takes a poorly animated tumble into the wild of the Serengeti.The core of the story (and its 85-minute runtime) consists of Pip trying to survive the rough and tumble environment while trying to reunite with his wealthy family.  To be honest, there's potential here.  One can imagine if Sony Image Works or Blue Sky got a hold of this premise, they could probably turn it into something decent.  In fact, a strong argument can be made that a tale not too unlike this has been told through DreamWorks' Madagascar or Disney's The Wild and sadly, told much better in either case.Though the film was produced in 2012, the visuals do very little to aid in the missed-opportunity factor.  The character models are extremely stiff, the backgrounds flat and simple and the textures appear to have been lifted directly from an early 2000's video game.  In fact, it wouldn't be surprising at all to discover this film was built upon a machinima system (which, in case you are unfamiliar, is the process of using a video game engine to produce animation).However, a supporter in the idea that pretty visuals do not a good story make, let's for a moment ignore the substandard looks of this work and discuss the bigger flaws at hand.  For starters, the pacing is awful- to the point where the few decent gags contained (like a flashback demonstrating Pip's version of playing fetch meant throwing the stick for his human owners to retrieve) drag out until all of the humor is erased.  In fact the deliberately slow movements of the characters coupled to long gaps without any spoken character dialog makes the entire film feel like a dream sequence.The jungle itself doesn't exactly present the type of challenges one would expect a domestic (and unbelievably pampered) animal may face as well.  For example many of the wild occupants break out into a game of football where, it appears, an attempt to mock The Matrix with some bullet-time action becomes hopelessly muddled due to the fact that the whole movie runs in what is, for all intents and purposes, slow motion.The ending attempts a little heartfelt lesson that again, may have been a bit emotional if not for the substandard animation, lifeless acting and pacing that can coax even the most patient viewer among us reach for the fast forward button on the remote.Director Robert D. Hanna (who apparently also co-wrote the screenplay) was very clearly banking on the notion that younger viewers would find the talking animals angle enduring enough to forgive all of the crimes in animation this movie manages to commit (many of which become apparent in the first minute of the film).With an estimated budget of around $230,000, one can hope a majority of the funds went to paying the vocal cast which, no exaggeration, consists of 7 individuals as the ambient sounds appear to have been taken directly from royalty-free sound libraries.In all, it's sad that there is so little redeeming to report about this film.  This represents Prevalent Entertainment Inc.'s second foray into the realm of CG films (the first being the equally despised but slightly more coherent The Prodigy) and it appears as though the high-school project quality has followed them here.In a way you want these guys to succeed- they are truly the underdogs in what is a multi-billion dollar industry and it is apparent that the company is clearly a passionate group of individuals inspired by the material  coming out of the larger animation houses like Pixar, DreamWorks, Image Works Blue Sky and so on.  But when it comes to parting ways with your hard earned cash (and keeping youngsters entertained for a couple of hours), you are much better off picking up something from the studios that inspire these guys!","2.0 out of 5 stars","March 14, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3P0W6DNCLJZH3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0077PBQ5E#wasThisHelpful","R3P0W6DNCLJZH3","AHF97M45JFCB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AHF97M45JFCB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Well I suppose the first thing we should discuss is that contrary to what the DVD box-art may have you believing, Back to the Sea is in fact a 2D animated film (unlike the CG film it clearly emulates, Finding Nemo).And if you're wondering how this film can be reviewed prior to its official Region 1 release, do keep in mind that it enjoyed a brief North American run in theaters on account of its origins as a Canadian & Chinese collaboration.So the big questions then become simple- how is it and who is it for?  The answers however, aren't quite as cut and dry.The plot, or plots as the case may be, show signs of competence here and there but some of the technical limitations of being a bit overly ambitious keep it from ever achieving the type of classic status of Disney/ Pixar film but we'll get to that.  For starters the core of this one mimics (almost too closely for comfort) Finding Nemo.We have a young fish named Kevin who gets netted out of the harbor and deposited into a business-owned aquarium.  Once here he encounters a bizarre tank-culture who are unaware that they are essentially imprisoned and tells them it's time to plan an escape back to the harbor.  Or ""Back to the Sea"" as the case may be.However, there's some added pressure here as poor Kevin didn't end up in an aquarium in a dentist's office but rather that in a very popular sushi joint in New York City.  When the residents of this tank get scooped out, they don't return if you catch my drift.Now where the film varies from Finding Nemo is what's going on in the sub-plots and the trouble with Back to the Sea is that there may actually be a few too many going on for its own good.  Among them we have a cook-off going on between the son of the owner of said Chinese restaurant and the son of a rival chef, we have the villain in the form of the guy who scooped up Kevin: a career criminal in fact with a plan to recover a priceless pearl that also got scooped up and deposited into the tank in order to pay off the mob.  We have cops chasing criminals, fish plotting an escape, some disturbing (albeit off-screen) suggestion to how living fish become a dish, rebellious sons trying to prove themselves to their dads and so on.If by now you're thinking this sounds like an awful lot of unrelated material, rest assured it is! In fact, when trying to compress so many story threads into a 96-minute runtime, certain parts become muddled and that's exactly what happens here.  Rather than weave the separate story elements together into one cohesive tale, Back to the Sea flops between plots with the randomness of someone flipping through the channels with a remote control.  The pacing is pretty sloppy, with climactic moments popping in at inopportune times or even feeling random at spots.However, to insinuate that the film is a total disaster isn't fair either.  It does have some charms- among these is a pretty stellar vocal cast who deliver an honest-to-goodness performance.  Christian Slater delivers as the villain, Mark Hamill as the mentally-touched octopus living in the sushi tank, Tom ""Sponge-Bob"" Kenny, Tim Curry, Tara Strong; the list is long and the performance solid.Additionally the visuals are quite tight.  No they aren't going to raise many brows in this society accustomed huge budgeted computer-generated majesty, but the mixture of cel-shaded CGI and digitally assisted 2D line art really work well in this application.All in all, Back to the Sea is an admirable attempt at big-budget entertainment that's greatest crime, aside from perhaps ripping off Finding Nemo, is that it's too ambitious for its own good.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 13, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3N309DR83VCF8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00B65IDD4#wasThisHelpful","R3N309DR83VCF8","AHF97M45JFCB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AHF97M45JFCB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As odd as the following sentence may sound- My Friend Bernard's biggest crime is simply that Pixar and DreamWorks have already shown us what clever computer animated feature films can be.In the event that such a correlation makes no sense to you, allow me to elaborate:  Children standing before the Redbox kiosk and parents shopping here online have been spoiled into associating CG features with charismatic characters, witty banter and cleverly layered humor to keep the parents entertained while the young-ones revel in the bright, rich visuals.  To be frank, My Friend Bernard lacks all of these traits.  That isn't to say it's a bad film per se, or that it's a complete and total failure so much as knowing what to expect going in can make the difference between a decent family movie night and counting the number of popcorn kernels in the bowl.The film comes in at a runtime of 70-minutes and wears a PG rating though often times it seems closer to the Rated G mark this type of movie should be targeting.My Friend Bernard tells the story of a little boy riddled with fears named Sam and his trek through the arctic where he encounters a polar bear named Bernard and a pair of penguins (Lloyd and Eva).  Rest assured it should be no real spoiler to say that the core of the tale centers on the idea that fearless Bernard, through flying, snowboarding and hunting, teaches the timid Sam that life isn't the scary place he's built it up to be.As the summary hopefully reveals, individuals expecting the type of cleverness of say Monsters Inc. or the sheer comedic efforts of Shrek are in for a disappointment.  The catalyst here is a magic necklace given to Sam by a bird that has the ability to generate a magic tea cup driven by a rat with the ability to transport occupants to anywhere in the world.  Talk about extremes, Sam chooses to visit the arctic and the Sahara desert before calling it a day.Visually the film is surprisingly solid.  No it takes nothing away from Toy Story 3 or Rise of the Guardians (just to name a few), but the characters are pretty charming; especially the pajama-clad lead character Sam as he timidly moves about his parents' house.The biggest detractor here is the audio- specifically the dialog as, believe it or not, there is none to be found.  The entire movie is narrated by a single voice.  While this may not sound detrimental on paper (or in pixels on your screen as the case may be), the truth is this could be a deal-breaker for many.In delivery, it actually feels as though you are being read to- that the onscreen action is merely the animated equivalent to the pages of a children's bedtime storybook.  Oftentimes the narrator simply reiterates precisely what is clearly happening onscreen and other times he takes a bit more interactive role by asking the onscreen characters questions that go unanswered.The bigger problem here, at least in my opinion, is that this method of exposition makes it extremely difficult to isolate a specific audience for the piece.  Adults will likely be bored beyond measure as what cute charm contained within the prose becomes buried behind silliness and narration.  Likewise, younger kids- those who would likely appreciate magic necklaces and transporter teacups, seem to lose interest simply because not a single character speaks for the duration of the movie.From the perspective of a small independent studio on a tight budget, the reason for this unique approach makes perfect sense:  No need to worry about syncing mouth flaps to dialog (often the most time consuming and tedious aspect of animating), only a single voice actor required, far simpler directorial sequence timing and on and on.  However, director and writer Aaron Lim would really have done himself a favor by studying the Pixar Animated Shorts and their method of seamlessly integrating dialog-less animation with the cleverness of the medium.  I am personally of the opinion that a narrator in film exists only as a fix for when the narrative of the story fails to cleanly reach the viewer on its own.I suppose there may be a very slim age group out there capable of appreciating the morals presented, the charms of the visuals and the necessity for full-length narration but if that doesn't sound like you or yours, you may want to keep this in mind when deciding if this one's worth a rental or a purchase.","2.0 out of 5 stars","March 12, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R13URAR9YZHXN9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008JLEVKM#wasThisHelpful","R13URAR9YZHXN9","AHF97M45JFCB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AHF97M45JFCB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Let me start out this review with a very important disclosure: Gnomes and Trolls doesn't do anything wrong; so much as it simply doesn't bring anything memorable to the equation.  I open with what should, by all facts and circumstances, should be the conclusion of this report because you are surely perusing reviews so as to determine if this film is worth your (and maybe your family's) time.  In that line of thinking you can certainly do worse than to pick this DVD up (especially if you're going to rent it) but it should be said that you could do much better as well.  That said, let's take a look at the facts shall we?Gnomes & Trolls is actually a Swedish film that came out back in 2009 called Gnomes and Trolls: The Secret Chamber.  It was then brought over to the Region 1 market in 2010.  Here it gets a little bit confusing because right as The Secret Chamber was coming out over here, a sequel was released in Sweden called the Gnomes and Trolls: The Forest Trial.  Don't let this bother you though, as the sequel has (to date) shown no signs of making it across the pond.Anyway, with a fairly modest budget of $5-million, Gnomes and Trolls tells the tale of Junior, a teenage gnome who wants nothing more than to invent gizmos and gadgets in his tree-house laboratory. But Junior's traditional dad, Jalle, who just so happens to be the head gnome of the forest, would prefer his son follow in his footsteps.During all of this, perpetually bickering troll brothers Face and Slim execute their evil father Fassa's carefully plotted plan to steal the food from the gnome secret food chamber. After Jalle is accidentally injured, Junior and his best friend Sneaky, a paranoid neurotic crow, embark on a heroic journey to the depths of troll cave to take back the stolen food. Junior and Sneaky's adventure takes them across vast landscapes and into encounters with the unknown.Interestingly the film was actually conceived as a 50-minute made-for-tv affair and was stretched into a full feature length film only after pressure from Russian and Chinese distributors surfaced.  As it stands, the completed work comes in at 70-minutes and the DVD-release is surprisingly devoid of extras.  It should also be noted that the film represents Sweden's first foray into the realm of computer generated filmmaking.The tale is decent enough, especially when summarized and the visuals really aren't too shabby either on a modern high-def television (especially if your DVD player can upscale to 1080p).  Like most foreign films brought across the pond, Gnomes and Trolls suffers from slightly slower pacing that we western audiences have come to expect.  What this means if you're still on the fence as to whether this one's right for you and yours, the plot meanders around a bit and certainly lacks much of the charm one can expect packed into a big budget Pixar or DreamWorks piece.The fantasy element is definitely cool here and the environments are rich enough to inspire a slight feeling of wonder but the lackluster pacing and absence of layered humor for adults makes the experience pretty flat-footed overall.So while I wasted my conclusion in the first line of this review, perhaps it would be best to end it by recommending Disney's Gnomio and Juliet if you're looking for a solid gnomish computer animated feature film that delivers on the charm of the concept of the little tinkerers and their pointed hats.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 12, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1HM712H3NRDUO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0037AGB1C#wasThisHelpful","R1HM712H3NRDUO","AHF97M45JFCB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AHF97M45JFCB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I should start this review by disclaiming a remarkable fact: I purchased the complete series of Star Trek Enterprise a few years back without ever having watched a single episode of the show during its broadcast run.  I say this not because I seek your respect, admiration or pity (though were you to insist on either of the first two, I suppose I wouldn't complain) but rather to illustrate a simple point:  When it comes to sci-fi entertainment, the Trek legacy has some pretty big shoes to fill as far as I'm concerned.So the big question you're probably asking yourself is whether or not I feel it was money well spent and I'll be glad to divulge such information but before doing so, let's take a moment to break down the hard facts of the show and its DVD release so as to further determine whether or not this is the set for you, shall we?Set in the nearby regions of the Milky Way galaxy, during roughly the 2150s (ten years before the United Federation of Planets would be formed), the show follows the adventures of humanity's very first warp 5 capable starship: Enterprise.According to the mythos, at warp 2, only a handful of inhabited planets were within a year's travel from Earth.  But at warp 5, that number increased to ten thousand planets and thus it is the appointed task of Captain Jonathan Archer (Scott Bakula) & crew to visit as many of these worlds as possible.The show debuted September 26 2001 on UPN and ran for 98-episodes spanning a total of 4-seasons (ending on May 13, 2005).  Low ratings are credited for its demise and unfortunately the dubious distinction of being the first Star Trek series since the original to have been cancelled by its network rather than finished by producers.  It's also the bookend of an amazing run of Trek TV: The last series in an 18-year run of back-to-back new Star Trek shows beginning with Star Trek: The Next Generation in 1987.That said, I can truly state that I went into the program with absolutely no expectations or predeterminations save for those established during previous Trek incarnations (most notably Next Generation and Deep Space 9).  Initially I was a bit let down with the Enterprise formula.  The first season, at least in my opinion, struggled to find itself.  The cast didn't seem overly believable, the sets were deficient in imagination and perhaps most of all, the prose simply lacked that slightly mind-bending flow of believability that has always been a staple of the Star Trek experience to me.Granted, I realize that this particular point in the mythos' timeline is supposed to be laced with claustrophobia and marvel considering it represents humanity's first foray into the galactic fold; the episodes themselves were a bit meandering to me with emphasis on action and quick resolve over the technologically brilliant conclusions to seemingly unsolvable dilemmas I'd come to cherish in past Trek efforts.I made it through the fairly lackluster first season and the initial half of the second, starting to assume this would be the formula for the entire series only to be pleasantly surprised somewhere around the halfway point of the second season.  Suddenly it was as if the cast had fallen into rhythm with both the characters they portrayed and interaction with one another.  Perhaps even more importantly, however, was the writing seemed to have taken a huge step forward as well.Episodes became far less reliant upon the gimmick of making the viewer privy to events of historical importance (even those that came off feeling like cheap reenactments) and instead simply dropped the cast of characters into some interesting scenarios where their sharp wits and collaboration became crucial for survival.  It didn't hurt that technological explanations and believable science became cornerstones of the formula as well.By the time the second season concluded, I was quite excited about starting out the third in the hopes of it continuing on with its newfound rhythm.  The third season, however, made another radical departure to the recipe, this time becoming a single episode that happens to take an entire season to develop.  While this was surely a risky move as far as syndication opportunities are concerned, viewers of the DVDs do get to follow along on a very solid dilemma with high stakes (earth being the target) and a whole bunch of exotic locales, species, alliances and betrayals to keep things interesting.Once again however I fear the tendency of the show's habit of going one step forward for two steps back rears its head.  The third season thread is resolved, well that's not technically correct, ends on a cliffhanger that carries into the fourth (and final) season. Here we kick things off with an alternate universe scenario that, aside from learning an entire episode was merely a dream, ranks up there as one of my lesser-appreciated cop outs in fiction.  This rather odd thread involving World War II era earth carries through for a couple of episodes, returns so stand-alone episode format then returns with but another alternate universe crescendo multi-parter.  This time the crew of Enterprise in an alternate dimension, one where violence and ruthlessness reign supreme, happen upon Kirk's Enterprise from the original series (complete with wonky sound effects and 60s-style uniforms) and intend to use the vastly superior tech to overthrow their totalitarian empire.  Many of the moments of this particular thread come off as forcefully comedic and, I suspect, not nearly as polished a finished product as it must have seemed on paper.Then, just when things are at their proverbial darkest hour, the 4th season concludes with an interesting thread centered on human-supremacy groups resorting to terrorist actions to preserve the human-way of life on earth during impending alien cohabitation.  I won't give away any spoilers, but let me just say that the final episode of the show takes a clever, fairly brilliant, approach to sending off the crew of Enterprise as only a cast & crew aware that the show has reached its conclusion can.I suppose if my ramblings and summaries thus far need have amounted to anything, I would hope they resemble a reflection to the fact that the show is a bit inconsistent at best.  There are moments sprinkled about its 4-season run that truly hark back to the finer moments of Star Trek's fabled history but unlike say Next Generation, consistent brilliance is simply not a given.  However, when Enterprise does hit its marks, and rest assured- it does, it's right up there with the quality and depth of storytelling Trekkers have come to expect from the franchise.In closing, to those who have endured my rather lengthy critique wondering whether this box set is worth their time and money, I have to say that I did find myself watching the entire program successively in about a year's time including all of the commentary and bonus materials.  In even its darkest moments, Star Trek is still superior to just about 99% of all science fiction out there and this show does continue on in that tradition.  Though my words may have come off as harsh at times, please do keep in mind that many of the flaws and shortcomings mentioned manifest when compared to the impeccable past Trek incarnations first and foremost.  When judged on their own accord (especially against what passes for science fiction television of late), nearly everything I mentioned can be overlooked!I am glad to have the most recent Trek incarnation taking its rightful place on the entertainment center shelf next to Voyager before it and am hoping, for better or worse, that the powers-that-be get to work on its successor.  There is something inherently missing in a world that does not have a current Star Trek series on the air.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 13, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1PITEKB3H022C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000AOEMXM#wasThisHelpful","R1PITEKB3H022C","AHF97M45JFCB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AHF97M45JFCB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"So thorough is my space-themed science fiction obsession that factors such as decade of release or the regional games the studios like to play with their DVD releases matter not.  Such was the case with Blakes 7 (why no apostrophe I wonder)- Having been a child in the late 70s during the Star Wars phenomenon, I've been vaguely aware of this series' existence for quite a long time but only recently became curious to the point of plunking down the cash for the complete 20-disc collection and digging out the ol region-free DVD player to determine what I've been missing.Created by Terry Nation and produced by the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC), Blakes 7 comprises four seasons (called series oddly enough here), each consisting of 13 50-minute episodes, and were broadcast in the United Kingdom between January 1978 and December 1981 on BBC televisionI suppose a good place to begin this critique would be to mention the surprisingly good video transfer.  So often with material of this era, the transition to digital clarity results in an overload of dust contamination from the original film, popping, hazing and so on.  Somehow this isn't the case with Blakes 7 as the image quality is far sharper than expected.  The show does retain a certain ""washed out"" quality as a result of the limited color pallet but that's hardly the fault of the transfer process.  Additionally the Dolby surround sound is an especially nice treat considering that viewers were likely limited to mono audio during the show's initial broadcast.That said I suppose it would be fair to say Blakes 7 surpassed my expectations in some areas but failed to live up to the abundant hype heaped on the show throughout the years in others.  Beginning with the good, there are definitely some interesting concepts and stories found throughout the 4-seasons.  Rather like the original Star Trek (in fact a couple episodes do come dangerously close to mimicking Trek plots), the show thrives on expansive-thinking and open-mindedness on the subject of space travel.  Many of the internal struggles center on the characters themselves but unlike say, the reimagined Battlestar Galactica, never to where the show is a ""drama-first, science fiction second"" affair.  In my opinion, this is a good thing!Additionally, the show is a serial with characters that grow and change over the course of the story (another nice touch).  Unlike say Farscape for example, Blakes 7 bounces between self-contained episodes and those that truly end incomplete without resorting to the famous ""to be continued"" message.Now the bad news.  There's no getting around the fact that 1978 birthed some pretty hideous television.  Regardless of how strong the plots, stories and characters, the show is pretty hard to become lost in thanks to an endless succession of awful special effects, set limitations and pretty silly technology (there is not one, but two British accent equipped talking computers on board).Then there's the undeniably British slant to it all; not a bad thing in and of itself, it sometimes becomes a little difficult for we American viewers to differentiate between science fiction characterizations and UK cultural commentary of the time (perhaps this trend is strongest witnessed in the second season episode Gambit).Sadly the show's primary charm takes a serious setback at the onset of the third season onward as many of the main cast had apparently left the show and were written out with incontestable finality.In all Blakes 7 represents a very interesting blend of traits and, even after viewing it in this day and age of computer generated image overload, ADD-style editing and production value that favors flash over substance, it's clear why this series has gained such a cult following since its inception.  Late 70s/ early 80s science fiction television was pretty disastrous overall; just look at Buck Rogers, the original Battlestar Galactica (Galactica 80 in particular) or the Starlost to mention a few.  In that regard Blakes 7 was unique in being wide in scope, creative in vision and pretty scientifically sound.  Even the humor is often sharp and still holds up.  Unlike so many shows of the era, the characters are well developed and their ongoing interaction worthy of viewer interest.The negatives in terms of visuals, effects, choreography and restrictive sets will surely scare off younger sci-fi buffs looking for an alternative to their Stargates and Star Trek Enterprise long before they give the show's good points a chance to shine.  I suppose I have the luxury of reviewing this set without the warming glow of nostalgia influencing my opinion (as again, I've only now finally gotten around to checking the show out for the first time).I suppose if you absolutely demanded a direct comparison to another series, Blakes 7 reminded me a lot of Gerry Anderson's Space: 1999 with its limited British production values more than offset by quality acting and strong, enduring characters.  I am left concluding it's certainly a shame the franchise did not get its 2005 two part, three hour miniseries (Blake's 7: Legacy) revival as one need only look at the reimagined Battlestar Galactica versus the original series to realize a new Blakes 7 could be exactly what the science fiction television world at large is missing.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 21, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2TJYULIXBSQF9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004AB9UVK#wasThisHelpful","R2TJYULIXBSQF9","AHF97M45JFCB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AHF97M45JFCB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The way I figure it, there are likely two types of individual considering purchasing this book: Those who are already aware of Bike Snob NYC's writing and those who are not but are looking for some cycling-related literature.  To that end, familiarizing one's self with the Snob's plethora of material is as simple as a web search of his name as his meteoric rise to fame is the direct result of a long-running blog on the subject of bicycle commuting (and here you thought he just had a cool name).I cannot confess prior fandom of Mr. Eben (Bike Snob NYC) Weiss' work though certainly found it entertaining enough in the multitude of periodicals I frequent that run his editorials (among them Time, Outside and Bicycling).  As editor of a mountain bike publication myself, commuting through the cityscape obviously isn't my main concern on keeping up with the cycling scene.  However, since decent bike-related literature is few and far between, I figured I would give The Enlightened Cyclist a chance.As one might expect after browsing Bike Snob's blog, the book is a first-person affair, written in Weiss' trademarked sardonic tone.  While some may find his sarcasm a bit too overdone by the conclusion of the book's 220-pages, I personally felt as though the author allows his humanity to shine through a bit more persuasively here than in many of his columns/ blog posts.Without giving up too much of the structure/ plot, The Enlightened Cyclist is designed to spoof a religious tome in its construction.  In fact, as the name of the book suggests, the goal here is to present a path to enlightenment as seen entirely from the perspective of a New York City commuter.  Sufficient proof of the ""inspiration"" here can be found right on the Table of Contents page with chapters breaking down into Books: Revelation, Genesis, Leviticus Now, Transcendence and so on.Individuals who may not find the comparison of religious/ biblical passage to the world of the commuting bicyclist all that amusing may not wish to apply but if it's any consolation, Snob avoids coming off as malevolent throughout most of his prose here.  Rather, he picks away through a succession of astute (sometimes borderline genius) observations gathered from years of cycling through NYC and slaps them into lessons so backhanded, it's rather difficult for even the most uptight among us to become offended.Occasionally the continual sarcasm grows a tab bit tiresome (oftentimes reminding me of a Dave Barry overload) but the Snob manages to reel these moments in by slipping some genuinely funny pop-culture references in so smoothly as to border on subliminal.  Nothing's safe either: Microsoft, Brad Pitt, Billy Joel, the iPhone, Harry Potter, Bono... Weiss makes no apologies for spicing up his prose with endless cultural pokes and more than a few of them really work.I found the sections of the book where the author moves away from the pious and cultural bits and instead just pokes fun of the bicycling lifestyle (like when he compares commuter behavior to marine life) to be some of the finer moments of the whole work.I suppose it would be far easier to dismiss this whole work as pure silliness if not for one small facet contained within: Namely Bike Snob reveals a bit too much of himself in the beginning of the piece.  Not that I'm complaining mind you, his shtick is what it is and there's plenty of it here; rather for a brief few moments the reader can almost be convinced they are entering into something so much more as Snob covers the tragic events of 9/11 from a perspective that even the media has yet to exploit.  It becomes clear that had he wished to, Mr. Weiss could have delivered a heartfelt (yet still humorous) account of both commuting by bicycle and NYC life in general without relying upon the gimmick of poking fun of sacred texts.  In the middle of the book the gimmick starts to feel a little stretched but then in his acknowledgements at the end, Snob manages to remind that there's more to the man than just cultural jabs and sarcastic wit.In all, The Enlightened Cyclist is certainly an enjoyable, airy read- its small form hardcover binding is undeniably charming and the writing flows with just enough lightheartedness to make grabbing ""just one more chapter"" before setting the book down a definite reality.  However, and as the Snob himself would surely concur, the presentation is certainly not for everyone.  While his material was undeniably crafted in jest, individuals overly sensitive about religion being used in such a context may not appreciate the author's ambitions here.  Considering this is Weiss' second book published through Chronicle Books, checking out his first (Bike Snob: Systematically and Mercilessly Realigning the World of Cycling) may be a better idea for such folks.  If you're still on the fence with picking up either, hitting up his blog is a free way to get your fill of Bike Snobbery- NYC style.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 29, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2R0VOV5529AVO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1452105006#wasThisHelpful","R2R0VOV5529AVO","AHF97M45JFCB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AHF97M45JFCB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The history of incorporating chocolate into breakfast cereal is a little hazy but we know with certainty Kellogg's had combined the stuff with its Rice Krispies line in the 1950s (hence Cocoa Krispies were born).  We know that in the time since, chocolate has become an absolute staple in the breakfast cereal world but, generally speaking, has been relegated to the domain of children's cereals while adults are expected to enjoy more ""sensible"" selections; often with the terms like oats, grain, fiber, or corn in the title.Of late it appears Kellogg's is doing its best to blur the lines between such stereotypes and entries like their Special K Chocolaty Delight and Krave (reviewed here) are prime examples of this evolution of reasoning.Beginning with the box itself, Krave makes clear the notion that this is adult-targeted in presentation; no flashy colors, no cartoony mascot and certainly no prizes to be found inside.  What you do gain by studying up on the cardboard is that Krave is a crispy multigrain cereal outside with smooth chocolate inside- and that it's made with real chocolate at that.Additionally a quick scan of the side of the box reveals that every serving is made with 9 grams of whole grains and is a ""good source"" of fiber; in this case 3g per serving.  But enough with all of the dry facts, the real deal breaker when it comes to a market with as many great choices as the cereal aisle has to offer is taste.  That said, to my perpetually juvenile taste buds, Krave tastes pretty darn good.The initial flavor is undeniably that of the corn outer shell but it's not as crispy or firm as say Cap'N Crunch.  Rather it's fairly airy and light and doesn't take long to absorb milk.  Fans of extremely crispy cereal may be better off looking elsewhere (or eating fast).  The chocolate is surprisingly rich and not the usual powdered affair typically associated with cereal.In all, the smooth chocolate and airy crispy corn combination work surprisingly well together.  It seemed to me like the corn taste actually becomes less and less prevalent as the outside of the cereal absorbs milk.  By the time the bowl is complete, I was tasting mostly the soft chocolate filling (and had no complaints with that).In conclusion, Krave is certainly worth the price of admission.  I typically try not to allow myself to get too attached to new cereals, as brands tend to appear and disappear so frequently with little to no warning but after a few bowls, I think it's safe to assume Krave could build itself a lasting niche in the competitive market on account of the fact that there really isn't a flavor/ consistency exactly like it out there.  I will definitely be adding it to my rotation.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 22, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2TD3BA237HZO5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006BXV130#wasThisHelpful","R2TD3BA237HZO5","AHF97M45JFCB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AHF97M45JFCB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When you stop to consider the Saved By The Bell franchise spans 15-seasons across multiple spin-offs (Good Morning Miss Bliss, The College Years, The New Class and so on), it can be a bit confusing to put a sense of order into the many releases.That said, The New Class Season 6 & 7 is, as the name suggests, the sixth and seventh seasons of The New Class and the twelfth and thirteenth season of Saved By The Bell if you're using 1988's Good Morning Miss Bliss as a starting point.  Regardless of where you like to consider your starting point amidst the Saved by the Bell franchise, this box set represents the very end of it all.TNC Season 6 originally aired between in September of 1999 and the 7th and final season debuted in September 2000 on Saturday mornings on NBC.  Unlike the seasons prior; which had all been 26-episode runs, 6 & 7 were reduced to 13 episodes each and were hence lumped together into a single DVD release from Image Entertainment.Season 6 made a single character swap: Ryan Parker (Richard Lee Jackson) was replaced by jock Tony Dillon (Tom Wade Huntington); but another Bayside transplant from rival school Valley.  One really does wonder why, since the original class' departure, so many Valley students trucked into Bayside but that's neither here nor there.  Perhaps credited to the fact that the cast was so similar to the season preceding it, it's apparent that the writers had reached a point where they were able to capitalize on the dynamic of this particular group.The Tony Dillon character actually wastes no time in integrating with the gang; in fact the character certainly feels more fluid from the get-go in the blonde-haired lead than either of the past two characters to have filled the role (Brian & Ryan).  The Valley transfer student angle is a bit weak undeniably but at least the writers were clever enough in this instance to use it as an opportunity to rekindle a flame with fellow former-Valley turned Baysider Maria Lopez.Sadly, while the duo of Screech and Belding had shown slight signs of improvement in subsequent seasons, the final two are a solid regression to the cobby and forced nonsense that shamed the original personas of the characters back in the original class days.As always the case with The New Class, prepare for a multitude of out-of-school episodes/ sequences. This time around it's the part time jobs at the mall (again), jobs at the Max, the police academy, and multiple parties, gatherings, and dances.  However, and in another step in the wrong direction, the final two seasons (the sixth especially) have traded in solid story telling & comedy in favor of glorified public service announcements.  The dangers of smoking cigars, drinking (even without driving), shady auto mechanics, yellow journalism, sexual harassment at work, the dangers of prescription painkillers, what can happen if you don't get enough sleep; the list of moral lessons tackled here is basically continuous.In all it's pretty safe to say Seasons 6 & 7 manage to instill a feeling that, try as they may, the dynamic of The New Class had finally reached the end of the road.  In the show's defense they did manage to give the class itself some closure in the form of final exams, senior prom, and even Belding coming to terms with the fact that it may be time to head off to greener (in this case Screech-free) pastures.  The humorous moments scattered about are surprisingly genuine but completely outweighed by the constant heavy-handed lessons.In all, The New Class has, throughout its 7-season span, probably enough humorous moments to fill an entire season with the type of clever writing/ good innocent fun that many of us still wax nostalgic about the original class.  Interestingly since many of the cable networks that own syndication rights to the Saved by the Bell franchise did not opt to buy The New Class rights making these DVD collections the only way to experience this rather obscure program.  I for one am glad that Image Entertainment took the time to bring all 7-seasons to market even if the dynamic could never surpass (or for that matter equal) the vibe of the original show on which it was based.","3.0 out of 5 stars","December 26, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R32EAZF7CYRMX0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000BC8T1O#wasThisHelpful","R32EAZF7CYRMX0","AHF97M45JFCB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AHF97M45JFCB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When you stop to consider the Saved By The Bell franchise spans 15-seasons across multiple spin-offs (Good Morning Miss Bliss, The College Years, The New Class and so on), it can be a bit confusing to put a sense of order into the many releases.That said, The New Class Season 5 is, as the name suggests, the fifth season of The New Class and the eleventh season of Saved By The Bell if you're using 1988's Good Morning Miss Bliss as a starting point.TNC Season 5 originally aired between 1997-1998 Saturday mornings on NBC and is typically regarded as a slight improvement over the fourth, which had been a slight improvement over the third and so on. When the original gang moved on, NBC had contracted just two seasons of The New Class as well as two seasons of The College Years for prime time. By the time Season 5 of the New Class had come about, The College Years had already been history.Season 5 broke the tradition of replacing half the main cast and instead made only a single character swap: Rachel Meyers (Sarah Lancaster) was replaced by new blonde beauty Liz Miller (Ashley Lyn Cafagna).  Perhaps credited to the fact that the cast was so similar to the season preceding it, it's apparent that the writers had reached a point where they were able to capitalize on the dynamic of this particular group.The Liz Miller character feels slightly out of place in the initial episode but quickly falls into rhythm in the episodes following.  Taking a cue from the old Zack/ Slater rivalry for Kelly's attention, Liz actually finds herself the target of both Ryan and Nicky's affection.  The series of episodes centered on her having to chose between the stepbrothers actually attempts a slight serial vibe; with low scale cliffhanger endings.The rest of the cast shows signs of maturing as a group as well, with the Katie Peterson and Maria Lopez characters coming into pretty unique identities.  The Eric Little character really starts to show some moments of brilliance this season as well.  We are spoon fed his musical abilities on multiple occasions but his is some of the most genuine humor to be found here (particularly when playing opposite Nicky).Perhaps most notable is the show's creative staff finally (after 4 seasons of floundering) seemed to have figured out how to make the Screech/ Belding duo a bit less annoying and more comedic.  One particular sequence where Screech imagines Belding running away with the French teacher is nearly worth the price of admission in and of itself!As always the case with The New Class, prepare for a multitude of out-of-school episodes/ sequences.  This time around it's the part time jobs at the mall (again), a class trip to Paris, a Habitat for Humanity construction site, and strangely enough, a season conclusion that takes place in the woods as part of a wilderness survival training (with some moments that nearly undoes the praise I just heaped on to the Screech/ Belding tag team).In all it's pretty safe to say Season 5 manages to improved upon the formula of the three seasons preceding it by coming up with some fresh situations/ dilemmas and a cast that was clearly becoming quite comfortable with each other.  The humor is a bit more genuine and certainly the heavy-handed lessons of the prior seasons were toned down.One odd fact worth mentioning is that while this DVD release contains 26-episodes just like all of the others before and after it, it is the only one of the lot spread across four discs (opposed to three).  The  reason for this is never made clear as transfer appears identical and is presented in its original 1:33:1 aspect ratio just like the other sets.","3.0 out of 5 stars","December 9, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1F6NBR9JBL1CA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000AYEIFY#wasThisHelpful","R1F6NBR9JBL1CA","AHF97M45JFCB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AHF97M45JFCB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When you stop to consider the Saved By The Bell franchise spans 15-seasons across multiple spin-offs (Good Morning Miss Bliss, The College Years, The New Class and so on), it can be a bit confusing to put a sense of order into the many releases.That said, The New Class Season 4 is, as the name suggests, the fourth season of The New Class and the tenth season of Saved By The Bell if you're using 1988's Good Morning Miss Bliss as a starting point.TNC Season 4 originally aired between 1996-1997 Saturday mornings on NBC and is typically regarded as a slight improvement to the slump that the third season found itself in. When the original gang moved on, NBC had contracted just two seasons of The New Class as well as two seasons of The College Years for prime time.  By the time Season 4 of the New Class had come about, The College Years had already been history and as had been the annual trend with the show, half of the primary cast had been dropped.Season 4 carried on the tradition of replacing half the cast and keeping Screech and Belding in the foreground as a bumbling slapstick duo. This time however it's Tommy D (Jonathan Angel), RJ ""Hollywood"" Collins (Salim Grant) and Lindsay Warner (Natalia Cigliuti) who get the boot and in their place Ryan's step-brother Nicky Farina (Ben Gould), football-playing Eric Little (Anthony Harrell) and Katie Peterson (Lindsey McKeon) step in to fill in the void.Well, where does all of this leave us?  Well the Ryan/ Nicky stepbrother angle works pretty well, with a rivalry early on that (not unlike Zack and Slater in the original show) manifests into a friendship over time.  The show's writers seemed to have realized that, and taking a cue from then-popular primetime show Friends, dating triangles could work well with your 6-lead characters.  As such Nicky bounces from dating Katie to Maria, other crushes abound and the formula continues to work pretty well.Newcomer character Eric Little moves farther away from the ""geek of the bunch"" archetype that Screech made famous in the original series but lacks the dry wit of the RJ Collins character he replaces.  Initially he struggles to find his rhythm but steadily improves as the writers find their groove.  By the time the gang ends up pulling a stint at Space Camp, the formula seems to have fallen into pretty passable place.Similarly Katie Peterson is another character that comes off as a bit bland initially but steadily improves (especially by the next season) into a genuine-feeling part of the gang.By this point in the Saved by the Bell legacy, the entire creative crew had apparently finally stopped even emulating the formula of the original cast and simply began telling fairly original stories with the cast it had.  For the most part the system works, albeit without some of the marquee moments that made the original so memorable.  For whatever reason the sets seem particularly claustrophobic throughout all of the New Class and especially so this time around.Believe it or not, this season starts out strong and finishes equally sturdy but does bog down a bit in the middle.  Once again the show seems to want to avoid the classroom in favor or part time jobs at the mall (again), gigs at the local hospital and the aforementioned Space Camp interludes.  Sadly the few school episodes found here involve musical numbers, renaissance fairs and so on.The season that would follow it would actually end being a step in the right direction and perhaps that fact can be attributed to the feeling one gets that the writers had a lot of hope in this particular group's potential.  In all, season 4 comes off as a pretty solid entry to The New Class mythos and certainly a step in the right direction when compared to those that preceded it.","3.0 out of 5 stars","December 7, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R8B2W6PP3YJQ0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0009S2KC4#wasThisHelpful","R8B2W6PP3YJQ0","AHF97M45JFCB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AHF97M45JFCB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When you stop to consider the Saved By The Bell franchise spans 15-seasons across multiple spin-offs (Good Morning Miss Bliss, The College Years, The New Class and so on), it can be a bit confusing to put a sense of order into the many releases.That said, The New Class Season 3 is, as the name suggests, the third season of The New Class and the ninth season of Saved By The Bell if you're using 1988's Good Morning Miss Bliss as a starting point.TNC Season 3 originally aired between 1995-1996 Saturday mornings on NBC and is typically regarded as an even lower point of the franchise than the season that preceded it. When the original gang moved on, NBC had contracted just two seasons of The New Class as well as two seasons of The College Years for prime time. When fans rejected the first season of The New Class, some pretty drastic changes were made during the off-season. In fact half of season one's cast were swapped out and the original show's geek Screech (Dustin Diamond) was brought on board in effort to bridge the gap between The New Class and The College Years; trouble is by Season 3 of the New Class, The College Years had already been cancelled.Season 3 carried on the tradition of axing half the cast and keeping Screech and Belding in the foreground as a bumbling slapstick duo.  This time however Swiss lead character Brian Keller (Christian Oliver), Megan Jones (Bianca Lawson), and Bobby Wilson (Spankee Rodgers) are history without so much as a mention and in their place are the following characters; all said to have come over to Bayside from rival high school Valley: Ryan Parker (Richard Lee Jackson), Maria Lopez (Samantha Esteban) and RJ ""Hollywood"" Collins (Salim Grant).Well, where does all of this leave us?  The Valley/ Bayside rivalry angle doesn't last long in this season despite a pretty solid initial set-up.  In fact by the end of the first few episodes, the new characters are pretty quickly slid into the slots left behind by the actors from Season 2.What the show lacks in plotting and clever writing, it overcompensates for with bumbling and drops in character IQ.  The duo of Belding and Screech somehow manage to lower the bar with their apparent cluelessness but the biggest tragedy here may be the degeneration of the Tommy D character (Jonathan Angel) from tough, greaser to lumbering fool.  Why, considering the Screech/ Belding dynamic already added an unbearable degree of ignorance to the formula, the show's creative staff decided to downgrade Tommy D to a similar state is truly anybody's guess.Additionally, while public outcry over casts that too closely mimicked the original gang were well documented and valid, the schemes of Ryan Parker are a far cry from the cleverness and entertainment found in Zack Morris's finer moments.In keeping in the tradition of TNC Season 2, the 26-episodes that comprise this set do everything they can to keep the stories as far from the classroom as possible.  Part-time job episodes set at the mall, excursions to a ski resort, even a two-month semester spent on the deck of a cruise ship all add up to convince viewers that California high school students must have the most lenient scholastic requirements the world has ever known.Sadly, even the few episodes that actually take place in the high school center on non-classroom oriented situations in favor of planning for musicals, plays, parades sporting competitions and so on.Additionally this is perhaps one of the most ""moral lesson"" oriented of all the seasons with heavy-handed lessons integrated within nearly every episode: Maria convinces Screech to pass her in driver's ed only to crash, Tommy and Lindsay take up smoking, date-rape gets addressed when Rachel starts going out with a college guy, poverty even judging a person based on physical challenges gets tackled here.Of course while my review seems loaded with complaints, the fact of the matter is there are a few enjoyable moments and lighthearted moments that make this season worthy of anybody's Saved by the Bell collection.  For one thing this season would be the end of many long-standing characters (Lindsay and Tommy D) and represents the RJ Collins character's only foray in the franchise despite some genuinely humorous moments.The season that would follow it would actually end being a step in the right direction and perhaps that fact can be attributed to the feeling one gets that the writers had simply run out of ideas for this particular group's dynamic.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 25, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3MTYCYUBUQM87/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000929AV4#wasThisHelpful","R3MTYCYUBUQM87","AHF97M45JFCB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AHF97M45JFCB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you're new the whole Scooby Doo! scene for the Playstation 2 console, the fact of the matter is First Frights is a magnificent jumping off point to get involved in the beloved franchise regardless of your age or video game level of experience.Though considered in its waning years of development thanks to the Playstation 3, the PS2 is far from extinct thanks to releases like this very title that came only to the Wii and Playstation 2 home consoles.  Not only is the system still being supported, but evidently still offers some exclusivity even over the current generation offerings!That said First Frights technically represents the 4th Scooby Doo! Incarnation to show up on the PS2 hardware (first being Scooby Doo: Night of 100 Frights followed by Scooby Doo: Mystery Mayhem and then finally Scooby Doo: Unmasked).  However, unlike the first three, which were distributed by THQ, First Frights is the first forego material based on the classic 2D Hanna-Barbara cartoon in favor of a fully 3D CG rendered animation (ala Pixar).  Additionally it is the first of a pair of Scooby games (the second being Scooby Doo and the Spooky Swamp) distributed directly by Warner Brothers Games.In Scooby-Doo! First Frights players witness the roots of Mystery Inc. as the gang unites for the first time to solve some of its early mysteries. Scooby, Shaggy, Fred, Daphne, and Velma are all playable characters in the game used to explore environments, solve puzzles, dispatch enemies and collect clues to unmask devious villains and gain prestige as world famous detectives.The game spans four mysteries across 22 levels of game play and players can expect to explore such locales as a Phantom Cruise Ship, Haunted High School, Foreboding Castle and so on.  The environments look solid even on the over-decade old hardware with themes and tones that would fit right in with the classic series just fully realized in 3D detail.The in-game music is perfectly fitting, harkening back to the classic cartoon and live-action movie offerings of the franchise and the vocal work/ cut scenes are perfectly top notch as well.Now onto the most important element- the game play itself.  First Frights is pretty spectacular on all fronts.  Much like any of the Lego games, a steady camera with a  above angle makes for very user-friendly platforming without any of the dizziness and disorientation commonly associated with 3D gaming.  Of course the downside to this style of viewpoint is that it can be difficult to judge depth when attempting to jump.  The good news is that unlike the jumping in the Lego games, failing to land a jump has absolutely no consequence here in terms of health, number of lives and so on.  Your character simply respawns indefinitely.The primary quest is one of exploration and collecting with some nice intuitive combat with ghosts, ghouls and skeletons thrown in for good measure.  In fact at the risk of sounding redundant, it is perhaps most accurate to compare this game's play dynamics to any of the Lego platformers.  Beginning with the two-player co-op option with easy drop-in, dropout functionality anywhere in the game and the fact that various playable characters offer unique strengths, abilities, weapons, and access to certain areas.  The controller arrangement/ game control is identical and almost everything in the game can be smashed, bashed and clobbered, releasing loads of Scooby Snacks to collect (rather than studs).Also borrowing from the Lego formula for success, the true challenge of the game for more advanced players stems from the fact that true completion of the game requires revisiting the various levels in free-play mode so as to collect all of the hidden goodies using unlocked characters in your quiver.Unlike the Lego games, rather than offering a massive roster of unlockable characters, First Frights offers costumes to be unlocked for the various members of Mystery Inc. that grant different abilities and skill sets for Freeplay mode once Storymode is completed.In all, I had pretty high expectations for this title going in as an adult gamer looking for something to play with younger kids in the family at get-togethers and came away impressed on every conceivable level.  Truly this is that rare game that actually manages to capitalize on a beloved license and deliver on the potential of the source material.  Truly gamers of just about every conceivable skill level/ age will find something to enjoy here and for me personally, this is the first true alternative to the Lego platforming games I adore.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 15, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R19OWSZSZSRYJ3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0026FCAR8#wasThisHelpful","R19OWSZSZSRYJ3","AHF97M45JFCB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AHF97M45JFCB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When you stop to consider the Saved By The Bell franchise spans 15-seasons across multiple spin-offs (Good Morning Miss Bliss, The College Years, The New Class and so on), it can be a bit confusing to put a sense of order into the many releases.That said, The New Class Season 2 is, as the name suggests, the second season of The New Class and the eighth season of Saved By The Bell if you're using 1988's Good Morning Miss Bliss as a starting point.Season 2 originally aired between 1994-1995 Saturday mornings on NBC and is typically regarded as a low point of the whole franchise.  When the original gang moved on, NBC had contracted just two seasons of The New Class as well as two seasons of The College Years for prime time.  When fans rejected the first season of The New Class, some pretty drastic changes were made during the off-season.  In fact  of season one's cast were swapped out and the big addition was the original show's geek Screech (Dustin Diamond) was brought on board in effort to bridge the gap between The New Class and The College Years; where he was simultaneously starring.I have to admit that the first few episodes of Season 2 are downright painful to behold, even now where the sting of losing the beloved original gang has long since faded.  The acting is downright abysmal, the performances stiff and the jokes pretty forced.  Many lines are butchered or fumbled yet remain in the final production cuts; leading one to suspect that dozens of retakes must have been standard fair in the show's filming.Fortunately by about the midway point of the season, the acting (and perhaps more important, interaction between characters) really starts to find its rhythm.  It's absolutely critical to stick with the show before judging it, as the early episodes are undeniably the weakest!Interestingly, the show's writers had gone so far to steer clear of creating a Zack Morris imitator lead character that season 1's Scott Erickson (played by Robert Sutherland Tefler) was dropped in favor of fictitious Swiss expat Brian Keller (Christian Oliver) as a much less cunning protagonist.  Gone for the first time in the show's history was the rivalry element made famous by Zack and Slater originally in favor of a friendlier group dynamic.Perhaps the most controversial of all the new elements brought to Season 2 of The New Class was the integration of the Samuel ""Screech"" Powers character as a college-going administration assistant doing his internship at Bayside.  As most Saved by the Bell fans can attest, the Screech character's demise from a scientifically oriented geek and cohort to Zack's clever scheming to a bumbling fool with the most annoying way of speaking this side of Steve Urkel was nothing shy of obnoxious.  Sadly by the time the second season of The New Class came about, the character was in the depths of the latter (perhaps explaining why, outside of Saved by the Bell, Dustin Diamond has been unemployed).Looking back, the 26-episodes that comprise this season are by far and large the most classroom free of the entire series.  Summer job episodes at a country club, excursions to dude ranches, dance parties even ski resort getaways all surface in between school days.  For a show supposedly centered on school, The New Class Season 2 does all it can to keep the learning-related situations to an absolute minimum.  Making matters worse still is it appears as though Belding (Dennis Haskins) isn't only the solitary administrator in the school; he's with the kids at each and every excursion.  Perhaps the most notable of this ridiculousness comes when he dishes out detention at Tommy D's surprise birthday party.Well in conclusion, as someone who was around when these shows were originally airing, the sensation that the show was struggling to find itself isn't quite as apparent now.  I have found that trying to view the New Class in its near constant cast rotation and writing transformations taking place across its 7-season run as a replacement to the original series is the quickest way to become disappointed.  Rather, it's a sort of silly cousin to a good show that, because of its lack of popularity in syndication, is a new experience to many long-time fans of the franchise.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 12, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R10HGM92BGZIVQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000777HYS#wasThisHelpful","R10HGM92BGZIVQ","AHF97M45JFCB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AHF97M45JFCB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When it comes to books like this, I think it's a safe bet to say that the most pertinent question in need of answering before deciding whether or not to sink your hard earned money is if the information contained within will be useful to you or simply a rehash of things you already know.  To that end, I hope to adequately summarize some of the wealth of knowledge contained here and couple it to my own experience with cinematography.I fancy myself a semi-professional still photographer and walk the line between hobbyist and qualified (having provided images for various publications throughout the years).  I've dabbled in independent film as often as my work schedule has allowed and even wrote/directed a few pieces I've been pretty proud of.  I've long felt that still photographers have a wide variety of useful literature (especially periodicals) at their disposal while videographers are typically left to their own devices.  In fact I've often found myself taking techniques such as lens selection, light metering, and depth of field mastery found in the plethora of still photograph magazines I read and doing my best to apply them into the realm of motion-picture making.  This works for the most part, until concepts such as framing moving subjects, positioning lights so that they aren't visible in pans, and deciding whether the situation calls for a dolly or Steadicam shot come into play.  Then suddenly (as I have no formal training in video photography), I find myself improvising, relying upon instinct and oftentimes, just hoping for the best.Enter Shooting Movies by Jack Anderson.  Coming in at 349 pages, this tome manages to pack about as much information in as any college course I'm aware of, and possibly even more in terms of life-experience shared.The author approaches the plethora of useful information presented with a casual, almost conversational style that immediately lays to rest fears of becoming overloaded.  In fact by the book's conclusion it becomes painfully apparent that cinematographers (or perhaps more accurately, directors of photography) aren't given near enough recognition in general.  I had never heard of Mr. Anderson prior to having picked up this book and truly that's a crime in and of itself.But let's discuss the nitty-gritty of the book itself and the material contained within.  The prose itself is clearly geared toward an aspiring professional cinematographer with proper reference given to the motion picture industry unions, the proper chain of command on a production, and the step-by-step process of being interviewed for the job right on through production.  I bring this up only because some of the indie films I've worked on were a far cry from the actual process of putting together a major motion picture.  As such some of the information here wasn't pertinent to my needs but interesting nevertheless.The author devotes chapters to studying the script, equipment selection (from lighting to camera bodies, lenses to tripods, nothing is left to wonder)- Interestingly there are many pages devoted to the pros and cons of using film cameras versus a digital equipment and though Mr. Anderson professes a bias toward the film side (and discusses the attributes of various film stocks accordingly), he manages to present some level-headed arguments to each side of the coin.Surprisingly, this book relies minimally on photographs, instead slipping a few black & white captures about to demonstrate points of the text as needed.  Particularly interesting to me were the movie stills and the scanned call sheets from actual films (in this case Starship Troopers).  I can't accurately express the hours I spent studying this information in awe that with so many individuals involved in a single day of shooting, that films ever get completed at all.Perhaps most useful to aspiring cinematographers is the style by which Mr. Anderson breaks all of the information at hand down.  He literally separates his chapters into a virtual schedule of the entire process from beginning to end.  His 37-chapters span four parts (Preproduction, Production, Postproduction and Technicalities) and are written in such a manner where just about every possible concern (from first day jitters to worst case scenarios like a botched shot) is both presented and reasoned out.  It's clear that this is an individual who learned by actually doing rather than simply studying and the ability to capitalize on his experiences is a constant throughout the book.In all, I would be lying if I said this particular book was targeted to the type of filmmaking in which I dabble and the amateur camcorder user looking to spruce up clips of the kids' birthday parties will also probably be a bit out of their league but that doesn't mean this isn't an absolutely fascinating look at the process of filmmaking for anyone and everyone.  However, it's the true cinematography student/ apprentice/ wannabe who will get the absolute most out of this work.  Thanks to an absolute wealth of practical knowledge coupled to a presentation that takes what could easily be construed as a very stressful job and breaks it down into a whole bunch of easily digestible chunks, this should really be required reading at the university level.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 11, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/RLDJYDQ1UTA4A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0240814932#wasThisHelpful","RLDJYDQ1UTA4A","AHF97M45JFCB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AHF97M45JFCB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you are at all concerned with the computer animated film industry, you probably know a little bit about Robert Zemeckis' unique approach of motion capture to achieve an animated product that looks remarkably lifelike (a technique he has proven in films like The Polar Express, Beowulf, A Christmas Carol and Monster House thus far).  The unique stylized look is back in Mars Needs Moms and this one managed to secure the promotion and backing by none other than Disney - who of course has been making a big push in the computer generated feature arena themselves since the absorption of Pixar.The plot of this one is certainly unique with a welcome science fiction flare not as thoroughly fleshed out since Pixar's own Wall-E.  The story follows nine-year-old Milo (played by Seth Green for the motion capture but voiced by child actor Seth Dusky) who, like most kids his age, is more interested in watching zombie movies than doing chores or eating his broccoli at dinner. When Milo's misconduct prompts his mother (Joan Cusack) to punish him with an early bedtime and no zombie pay-per-view, a moment straight out of Home Alone ensues: ""I wish I didn't have a mother!"" and hence the lesson of being careful what you wish for commences.When Milo wakes to discover his mother is being kidnapped by Martians, fear of being probed is put on the backburner as he stages a rescue attempt that results in his being accidentally dragged along on for a ride to the red planet itself. Once there, Milo is befriended by a fellow earthling refuge calling himself Gribble (Dan Fogler), an overly enthusiastic man-child who's decades-long absence from Earth has left him trapped in the cultural mindset of the 1980s.Surprisingly enough, this picture comes from a long line of CG-feature films inspired by children's books (a list that includes How to Train Your Dragon, Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs, Meet the Robinsons to mention a few).  The screenplay is surprisingly competent and while the intended audience of the film will likely be too swept up in the grandeur of the visuals to be concerned with such things, diehard scifi fans will likely be a bit frustrated by several questions of Marian society that are never fully answered.However, the film juggles some pretty heavy themes- the dangers of suppressing free will in society, reliance upon technology, the universal power of love and why moms are more than simply nagging buzz-kills for example- it does so with that trademarked Zemeckis brand of humor that has made past efforts like Back to the Future so endearing.  There are references scattered about that younger kids probably won't appreciate, but adults who remember a thing or two about the 80s will surely get a rise from.  The humor in Monster House was certainly more universally appealing but it is nice that not all kid-oriented films rely upon slapstick for laughs.The visuals here are an interesting mix of elements.  On the one hand, the motion capture technique is capable of delivering facial expressions that are truly without rival (after all, this is essentially the tool James Cameron used to develop the aliens in Avatar).  On the flip side it does away with the exaggerated characterizations kids flock to in your average DreamWorks or Pixar piece.  In fact, at a glance, the human characters here can almost pass as live-action with just a hint of aberrance in their faces.In all, this is a solid family film that doesn't tread upon objective language or themes that is rife with interesting environments, and a nice brisk pace that seems even quicker than its one-hour 22-minte runtime.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 2, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R32165AXKDSA40/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004EPZ048#wasThisHelpful","R32165AXKDSA40","AHF97M45JFCB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AHF97M45JFCB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There are many comic fans, a group that includes yours truly, who feel as though Bruce Timm's 1992 Batman The Animated Series Batman: TAS) so thoroughly covered (and accurately portrayed) the franchise that further animated incarnations were simply no longer necessary.  Over time, the next decade in fact, the team responsible for Batman The Animated Series would somehow manage to evolve the property enough to keep it fresh and in many cases, even improve upon the formula.  We would enjoy Batman Beyond and the ""caped crusader's"" legacy again as a staple of both the Justice League series (and to a lesser degree in Justice League Unlimited).  Even to this day that incarnation of Batman lives on in the form of the DCAU's frequent animated feature films such as Batman Under the Red Hood, Justice League Crisis on Two Earths, Superman/ Batman Public Enemies, Superman/ Batman Apocalypse and so on.However, and banking on the success of the live-action Batman film reboot (with Christian Bale), Warner saw fit to give viewers another animated version of the franchise, this time opting for a weekly Saturday morning affair.  What resulted was The Batman (2004-2008); a brighter, younger take on the Bruce Wayne character that, while true to many of the characters given their proper due in Batman: TAS, was generally rejected by fans for its light hearted take on dark material and inconsistency (especially in the Rogues Gallery).As such I, like many, feared for the worst when news broke back in late 2007 that Warner Brothers was going to reboot the animated Batman franchise once again.  This latest incarnation, which would be known as The Brave and the Bold, would be a brighter incarnation than the last with even lighter underlying tones.  Teaser shots at the time depicted Batman back in his bright blue, yellow and gray motif, eerily reminiscent of the get-up worn the 1960s Adam West live action series, or more disturbing still, his 1970s/ early 80s Superfriends persona.  This one would have to be an absolute disaster right? Wrong!After just a few episodes (which were now appearing in a Friday primetime slot in Cartoon Network's lineup), Brave and the Bold managed to obliterate any and all preconceived notions of failure.For starters there is the show's unique format to consider; each episode actually consists of a small self-contained team-up adventure before the opening theme then a full length adventure to follow, usually containing an entirely separate hero for which to be teamed up with Batman and villain(s) in need of some justice.  Episodes are structured as stand-alone although there are hints of ongoing story threads explored here and there (as well as a few two-parters for good measure).Just as had been forecasted, the look of the show is extremely bright and crisp, with color pallets seemingly directly from the pages of a comic book.  Interestingly, neither Kevin Conroy's (Batman: TAS) nor Rino Romano's (The Batman) voice talent was utilized for this show, instead calling upon Diedrich Bader of Drew Carry fame to provide the vocals for the titular character.  Many of the secondary characters from the past Batman franchises mentioned above do make frequent appearances here however.So just what makes The Brave and the Bold formula work despite doing away with nearly every aspect of what made Batman: TAS so incredible you ask?  It actually manages to prevent falling into a pattern of overusing its hero and villains for that matter by structuring each episode as a team-up.  In a very legitimate sense, the show has more in common with say Justice League than it does the other Batman incarnations.  Among the notable team-ups in this collection, expect Blue Beetle, Red Tornado, Atom, Green Arrow, (and a truly hilarious take on) Aquaman to mention a few.Next up, it may approach matters lighter than the earlier incarnations but it doesn't do so at the expense of Bruce Wayne/ Batman's intelligence and nor does it overlook his dry, ironic wit.  There is humor scattered about here but no child-like slapstick involved in effort to try and gain approval from the younger set.  Most of the conflicts require brains and Batman's abilities as a detective to thwart as well as the brawn often provided by Batman's episodic sidekick.The look of the characters (both hero and villain) comes straight out of the 1960s-70s comic pages as well, but don't let the lack of updating throw you, they are portrayed in the absolute best possible combination of their original persona blended with modern-day depth (no fear of Superfriends-style group laughter to fade endings here).DCAU alumni James Tucker is the producer of the show and brings with him an apparent deal of respect for the character as a whole as well as their past efforts in Batman: TAS and seems to literally go the extra mile in not attempting a redo of what has already been accomplished there.  Instead, Brave and the Bold brings a much-appreciated modern take on the classic characters out of the comics from yesteryear.Warner Brothers tried initially to pacify fans of the show by dropping 4-episode releases (meaning 6-sets would have to be purchased to have one full 26-episode season) but quickly followed that poor decision up with double disc 13-episode releases.  At the time of this review's writing the first season has been released on DVD entirely as well as the first half (13-episodes) of the second season.  The show is still running on Cartoon Network and is currently broadcasting its third season.In all, I came away from this show very pleasantly surprised.  There is a subtle rhythm to the episodes that is terribly addicting once the viewer becomes accustomed to the format, style and era being represented.  Be forewarned though, completion of this set will lead to having no choice but to acquire the rest.  Here's hoping Warner wastes little time in bringing the rest of the seasons to DVD.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 31, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2QO6ZFIPX9LXZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003M8NGLC#wasThisHelpful","R2QO6ZFIPX9LXZ","AHF97M45JFCB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AHF97M45JFCB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I don't know about you but when I think of Pixar's ""classics"" rarely is Cars the first to come to mind.  The Toy Story(s) perhaps, Monsters Inc. maybe, even Finding Nemo for those so inclined and yet it took a under-whelming sequel followed by a revisit to the DVD I thought I knew well to realize that the first Cars is the epitome of all that Pixar has come to mean to modern animation.In the event that you've been living in a cave these past six years, Cars tells of a racecar sidetracked by fate on his way to The Big Race in California.  Lightning McQueen (voiced by Owen Wilson), a brash NASCAR rookie who unwittingly gets lost and ends up in Radiator Springs, an almost-ghost town and former hot spot along historic Route 66, now ignored by tourists and travelers alike, thanks to the superhighway that bypasses the town.In the process of arriving, McQueen inadvertently tears up the asphalt of Main Street.  He gets arrested and is sentenced, against will and ego, to repave the damaged street.While paying his debt to society, McQueen encounters a 1951 Hudson Hornet, a rusty but lovable tow truck, a hippy 1960 VW bus, a classy but confident Porsche and a herd of tractors prone to tipping over and fluctuating exhaust fumes out of fright.The racing action certainly gets its due to be sure and kids have proven that a ragtag group of vehicles with eyes behind their windshields works just fine as toys, school folders, and backpacks.  But it is John Lasseter's underlying message that couldn't be clearer here: Pay attention to what matters: family, friends, true love, and it doesn't hurt to appreciate cars either.NASCAR-fans had much to celebrate, as did car-racing aficionados of all disciplines for that matter but it's the nostalgia of society's collective switch in thinking (from the scenery of iconic Route 66 being traded for the efficiency of the superhighway) that I found most prolific this time around.Even though 2006 might as well be eons ago in the ever-advancing world of computer animating technology, the visuals in Cars still manage to impress (especially in high-definition); a fact perhaps further enhanced by the abundance of heart within the prose.In all, and contrary to the trend that Pixar just continues to outdo itself in each subsequent effort, it is almost ironic that having watched the lackluster sequel in the theater led me back to the original and of course to rediscovering the charms that separate the good films from the great ones.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 31, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R282VTDXNV61XS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00005JNS0#wasThisHelpful","R282VTDXNV61XS","AHF97M45JFCB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AHF97M45JFCB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When you think of the heavy hitters in the animated feature film realm, it's certainly understandable if the first things that come to mind are Disney, Pixar or DreamWorks.  However Nickelodeon has been hovering around the scene for a while now, hoping to earn a nice piece of the CG animated movie pie.Rango is by far their most serious attempt and while the film's deserved PG-13 rating may succeed at distancing it from its key demographic (a concept all studios would be wise to emulate from industry-leader Pixar).The story follows the comical, transformative journey of Rango (Depp), a sheltered chameleon living as an ordinary family pet, while facing a major identity crisis.  After all, how high can you aim when your whole purpose in life is to blend in?  When Rango accidentally winds up in the gritty, gun-slinging town of Dirt, a lawless outpost populated by the desert's wiliest whimsical creatures, the less-than-courageous lizard suddenly finds that he's been preparing for this role his whole life.  Welcomed as the last hope the whole town has been awaiting, the newly appointed Sheriff Rango is forced to play his new role as if it life depended on it.  In fact, it does!  In a blaze of action-packed situations and encounters with outrageous characters, Rango starts to become the hero he's always pretended to be.If you didn't already know, this piece represents Gore Verbinski's first film since concluding his Pirates of the Caribbean trilogy in 2007 and represented an ideal opportunity for him to continue working with the oddly charismatic Johnny Depp.Like the Pirates trilogy, Verbinski proves strangely proficient at developing properties that seem almost kid-friendly but continually flirt with adult-only ideals and references.  In fact those viewers expecting a wild-west themed variation of a typical Disney/ Pixar feature will be in for a bit of rude awakening.  Rather than craft an action-driven kids movie peppered with adult humor and pop culture references, Rango is boldly unrepentant for the various tones and complexities it explores.Industrial Light and Magic does a spectacular job with the look of the film, with drab landscapes and gritty character textures and while the John Logan script is funny at times, appreciation of this film depends heavily on the viewer's feeling towards old spaghetti westerns.The pacing is deliberately drawn out and littered with crusty townsfolk, children will likely find the prose a bit too dull to hold their interest even before the objectionable language and references have a chance to upset them.  In fact, a strong argument could be made that this is very nearly like watching a genuine old western film with personified animals transplanted over black and white live action sequences.  Further contributing to the sensation is an extended version release on the DVD & Blu-Ray that comes in at just under two-hours.I personally enjoyed the idea of a desert down finding so much value in water that it has literally become currency and there's no denying that, while a bit hideous, there is some serious brilliance in the character design models.Of course despite the film's rambling philosophies and lackluster supporting characters, Rango has its moments thanks in no small part to solid vocal deliveries from Depp, Ned Beatty, and Wedding Crashers' Isla Fisher.There are some slapstick moments to keep the kiddies in their seats even if the western puns and clichs will be lost upon them.  Adults may get a kick out of a few of the exchanges although truthfully, they can be a bit over the top, eliciting some ""ewwws"" even out of teens at times.In conclusion some of the finest computer generated visuals to date (there is a segment depicting a human that is nearly photo-realistic), Rango lacks the type of cleverness that makes many of Pixar and DreamWorks' pieces so timeless.  Adults who appreciate modern animation (especially those with a fondness for western classics) will find much to enjoy here but contrary to the Nickelodeon backing, kids aren't the target audience for this one.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 31, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/RRUE8UD372OCZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003Y5H53S#wasThisHelpful","RRUE8UD372OCZ","AHF97M45JFCB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AHF97M45JFCB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Allow me, for the sake of justifying my complaints about this piece from the onset, to say that I am a subscriber to the theory that the DCAU crew is responsible for the absolute best incarnations of the DC comic characters of all time.  Whenever I begin to burn out on the whole animated comic hero industry, a trip to my Batman the Animated Series collection or through a few Justice League Unlimited episodes are all it takes to remind me of everything that is right about the concept of turning static comic panels into animated life.That said, I've noticed many of the crew responsible for the aforementioned properties (Bruce Timm, Alan Burnett, the late Dwayne McDuffie and company) have since shifted gears from weekly serial production to animated feature film work exclusively.  While a few of these features have been pretty darn impressive (I enjoyed Batman: Under the Red Hood, Superman/ Batman Public Enemies and Justice League Crisis on Two Earths to mention a few) but All Star Superman is one of the oddest animated films I've encountered, DCAU or otherwise, in quite some time.All-Star Superman, on which this picture is based, is a twelve-issue comic book series featuring Superman that ran from November 2005 to October 2008. The series was written by Grant Morrison, drawn by Frank Quitely, digitally inked by Jamie Grant and published by DC Comics.The film incarnation is actually the tenth in the DC Universe Animated Original Movies line released by Warner Premiere and the first in the line that is rated PG (as opposed to the usual PG-13 rating).The plot goes like this: Dr. Leo Quintum and his P.R.O.J.E.C.T. Team are exploring the Sun when they are sabotaged by a booby-trapped, genetically enhanced Lex Luthor clone. Superman saves the doomed crew, but it turns out that in the process has been overdosed with radiation that, while responsible for increasing his power initially, is actually slowly killing him. Luthor, having orchestrated the death of Superman while under the employment of General Sam Lane, is arrested thanks to Clark Kent's article and sentenced to death.Playing off the unique angle of the arch nemeses responsible for the inevitable death of the other, there is a lot of potential in this plot structure.  Sadly, I felt as though the delivery of these ideals never manages to live up to the possibilities.For starters, this 76-minute film suffers from the undeniable feeling of trying to fit entirely too many key moments from the 12-issue book run into a little over an hour's worth of narrative.  As expected, this mash of plot threads often comes off as completely disconnected from one another.  Characters appear frequently, do something completely contrived, then vanish for the duration of the film.  Detours like Superman's encounter with Samson and Atlas and even the Kryptonian scientists will leave even the most diehard fans of the franchise scratching their heads in ""what in the world was that?"" theatrics.These threads work out in the books on which this film is based simply because they are given due time to develop.  Perhaps had they been integrated here more subtly earlier on and allowed to play out in the background to the seriousness of the larger issues at hand, they may have worked out here as well.  Instead they come off as unnecessary plot devices.However, in all fairness there are a few qualities here that prevent this one from sinking like a cinder block.  Among these are the opportunity to witness Frank Quitely's bright crisp art work come to animated life and a modern take on the Lois Lane character.In all though the end result here is quite a muddled mess.  The story itself is interesting and arguably tragic enough to warrant looking into the mini-series but the film will most certainly under-whelm both fans of the books and of past DCAU efforts alike.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 28, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/RAY6LMPQG02JI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004EE2ZY2#wasThisHelpful","RAY6LMPQG02JI","AHF97M45JFCB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AHF97M45JFCB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If ever there was a series I planned to go into with anticipated disappointment, it would be Iron Man: Armored Adventures.  After all, the idea of taking a mature, long-standing comic franchise and retooling it so that the hero(s) and villains are in high school rarely stands the test of time.  On the other hand, Marvel's animated history with the Iron Man franchise has been less than stellar.  The 1990s animated series (which finally earned a licensed DVD release by the way) was certainly a mixed bag and the Marvel Lion's Gate (MLG) animated feature Invincible Iron Man was quite abysmal.Then I learned that the guys responsible for this one were actually many of the same individuals who had succeeded in ""younging up"" Xavier's mutants in X-Men: Evolution and more recently, did the pretty solid Wolverine and the X-Men series.  I rolled the dice and ordered the first two releases of the show on DVD (which totaled the first 13 episodes of Season 1).When his industrialist father Howard Stark disappears in a plane crash after refusing to weaponize the Earth Mover at Obadiah Stane's behest, 16-year-old genius Tony develops the high-tech suit of armor we all know and love.The series follows the adventures of teenage child prodigy Tony Stark and his alter ego Iron Man. As Iron Man, he uses his technological inventions to stop villains at all hours of the day/ night, even it makes it extremely difficult to attend classes and keep up his grades. His friends, James ""Rhodey"" Rhodes and Patricia ""Pepper"" Potts know of his secret life and help him  (either directly or by covering for him) on his perilous adventures.Driving the show is the suspicion that Stane had been involved in his father's death, Tony divides what free time he has conducting an investigation of his own while battling such staple villains as Mandarin, Mr. Fix, Whiplash, A.I.M., Madame Masque, Living Laser, the Maggia, Firebrand, Controller, Crimson Dynamo, Blizzard, Killer Shrike, Unicorn, M.O.D.O.K. and the like.As is the trend these days, the piece is 3D cell-shaded CGI entirely, with a distinctive look that, contrary to the cover art of the DVDs, is actually quite moody and muted, almost washed out, in its presentation.  Considering that Marvel's animated works are often overly bright and kid-friendly by nature, Iron Man: Armored Adventure's grittier pallet is certainly a welcome change and goes a long way in counteracting the upbeat high-school angle introduced here.Pacing is pretty spot on, with episodes that each act as stand-alone affairs with just enough of a serial element in the background to establish a nice ongoing arc.  Dynamically, the formula proves quite similar to past shows Batman Beyond, Static Shock, and perhaps most closely, the aforementioned X-Men: Evolution.  Whether you find yourself for or against the concept of taking an established comic property and scaling it to work in the high school setting, at least go in knowing that the production team behind Animated Adventures seems to have mastered the art (and actually tuned the material quite flawlessly in the process).It should be noted that there are a few staples to the mythos only touched upon here (and in some cases omitted altogether).  Among these is the relationship between Tony's artificial heart and the suit of armor.  Also traditionally, Tony's parents were accidentally killed in a car crash, whereas in this series, Tony's father, Howard Stark, disappears in the first episode in a plane crash suggesting Howard's death.  Tony also injures his heart in this crash, as opposed to being injured by an explosion in war. Tony invents the Iron Man armor at home. In previous incarnations, Tony invented a beta version of the suit to escape after being captured due to the trap explosion leaving him defenseless.  All minor changes to be sure.Which brings up a slight complaint about the domestic DVD releases thus far.  Early adopters were forced to buy two individual releases episodes 1-6 then 7-13.  Now the entire 26-episode release of the first season has arrived leaving those of us who purchased the first two releases little choice but to buy all 26 just to have access to the final 13.  But in all, a minor compliant- Had it been confirmed that this, the 26-spiode box set would be coming I certainly would have held off for it and if you are someone who has been on the fence about getting involved in the show, this is the best way to do so!The second season is still airing at the time of this review's writing and here's hoping Vivendi Entertainment sees fit to release a complete 26-episode second season after its broadcast run as well.These days the news is that Marvel Anime: Iron Man will be the next big thing to hit the USA (coming later this year).  As everyone seems to be preparing for that show's arrival, there's a good chance Iron Man: Armored Adventures will get lost to the proverbial shuffle: A shame considering to date it is perhaps the most impressive animated incarnation of ol ""shell head"".","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 24, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2MMFSMHB0B9FZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00368PSIM#wasThisHelpful","R2MMFSMHB0B9FZ","AHF97M45JFCB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AHF97M45JFCB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I remember at the time of its debut, Teen Titans sort of represented the end of an era.  After an impeccable run of DC Comics/ Warner animated shows including Batman The Animated Series, Superman The Animated Series, Batman Beyond, Static Shock and Justice League, here came a show that didn't take itself too seriously and wasn't afraid to use creative license on the animated incarnations of the comic book source material.Though the DC Animated Universe's unofficial president supreme, Bruce Timm, was involved as the show's producer and Glen Murakami came on for character design, it was made clear right from the get go that Teen Titans was not a part of the interconnected DCAU properties and nor would it ever crossover with then-airing Justice League Unlimited.The series' creators initially stated that younger children were the intended audience for the series and this was manifest by a slightly super-deformed (large heads) style, complete with goofy anime-inspired characterizations to express emotions.Naturally die hard comic fans were less than impressed and complaints poured in with a frequency that Executive Producer and Cartoon Network V.P. Sam Register was forced to step in and justify criticism regarding the style of the show: ""The main mission was making a good superhero show for kids. Now if the fanboys happen to like the Teen Titans also, that's great, but that was not our mission.""When I first gave the show a go in season 1 (after being spoiled by the earlier shows above), I was quite disappointed and nearly gave up on the whole franchise.  Fortunately, as writer J. Torres would go on to confirm, the show's producers discovered TT was reaching a wider audience than initially anticipated and hence got into some darker story lines and introduced a lot more characters.  Truly by the third season the show had moved away from its juvenile antics and began stringing together some deep serials that were nearly DCAU quality!So what does all this have to do with Trouble in Tokyo you ask?  Well for fans like me, who appreciated the depth of the show (and improved humor) as it progressed, this feature film represents the final farewell to the franchise.The plot goes like this: The Teen Titans' hometown is attacked by a Japanese ninja named Saico-Tek. Under interrogation by Robin, Saico-Tek reveals the identity of the one who sent him: a mythical being called Brushogun. The ninja then escapes and the Titans decide to head to Tokyo to search for the one who sent the assassin.After overcoming the language barrier and fighting a giant reptile of all things, the Titans meet Tokyo's own Super-normal Defense Force (the DNF) led by Commander Uehara Daizo. Daizo shows the Titans around the Tokyo Troopers headquarters, and when Robin questions him on Brushogun, he informs the Titans that he is nothing more than an urban legend.Though encouraged to spend the remainder of their time in Tokyo as tourists, Robin refuses to call off the investigation.  When a second incarnation of Saico-Tek tries to eliminate Robin once and for all, plans of simply touring the city are scratched permanently.Even though the film was created and released in 2006 (after the 5th and final season of the show ended), the ""feel"" of the material harkens back to the earlier days of the series for better or worse.  Part of this is likely due to the return of head writer David Slack after having left the series after the fourth season.The plot structure is pretty decent, if not exactly the type of climactic sendoff one might expect for a show that went 5-seasons.  There is, at its core, a mystery element here of course but one that shouldn't be too difficult for viewers of most ages to puzzle out before the conclusion (although there are a few pretty cool elements in the reveal).Pacing is fair if a bit meandering at times, feeling as though the 53-minute runtime required writers very accustomed to doing 22-minute slots to stretch things out a bit.  The DVD release contains a few bonus features worth mentioning, among these a slightly interactive video game that uses the DVD remote and an episode of the show that never aired (probably because of its 11-minute runtime).In all, returning to the Teen Titans certainly revealed a mixed bag of emotions.  This is one of those franchises that really worked best when caught up in the rhythm of its silliness/ timing.  After taking a break to explore other properties, I found coming back into this film to be a bit rough around the edges.  There were certainly better gags in the series and richer story threads to be sure, but the vocal work and characterizations are all in tact here and while it would have been really cool if, as earlier rumors had suggested, they might have used this opportunity to close out the show by revealing the heroes' alter egos, I feel like the DVD was a worthy investment and like that it completes the Teen Titans series collection.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 20, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/RWXEII1MYEX3X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000JLTR86#wasThisHelpful","RWXEII1MYEX3X","AHF97M45JFCB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AHF97M45JFCB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Talk about high expectations going in, ever since the release of Superman/ Batman Public Enemies, I have been terribly excited about this piece.  Going through absolute withdrawal of the animated Justice League series, about the closest I can get to fulfilling that void comes in the form of these DCAU feature films starring some of the League's most influential members.And in theory this one should have delivered there! After all, it features Batman, Superman, Wonder Woman and Supergirl (heck even Superman's dog Krypto makes a cameo) and pits them against the hordes of darkness on Apokolips.  However, in execution, I found the finished product to be a bit too ambitious for its own good but more on that in a moment, first let's take a look at the facts.Superman/Batman: Apocalypse is a 2010 direct-to-video animated film based on the Superman/Batman comic storyline ""The Supergirl from Krypton"" and serves as an unofficial sequel to Superman/Batman: Public Enemies.The story basically opens by making reference of the timeframe through blurbs on Gotham City radio suggesting it is within the weeks after the events that led to Lex Luthor's arrest, the impeachment of his presidency, and Batman's success in saving the world from the impact of an approaching meteor.A spacecraft crash-lands in Gotham City Harbor apparently containing a naked young girl without knowledge of English or Earth or really much of anything. Without giving much away, the girl in question is of course the future Supergirl (Kara Zor-El) and while Superman welcomes his fellow Kryptonian refugee with open arms and works to teach her English and Earthen culture, Batman remains suspicious.By the time the film is over, the viewer will have visited Gotham City, Metropolis, Themyscira, Apokolips, and Smallville.  Considering its 78-minute runtime, there's a lot of ground to cover here!I mentioned earlier that my biggest criticism of the film is that it may be a bit too ambitious for its own good and that statement certainly deserves elaboration.  While the look of the film is spot on (with a unique, angled look to the character models), the vocal cast impeccable (opting to use the talent of the Justice League actors; in fact this was the noted as the first project Kevin Conroy and Susan Eisenberg (Batman and Wonder Woman) have worked on together since the end of the Justice League series) but the plot is a bit scattered and the pacing inconsistent.I guess this is to be expected given the incredible number of characters and locations involved to be crammed within a film that runs only a bit over an hour in length.  Call it wishful thinking if you must, but this whole thread would have been far better served had it been introduced as a multi-episode thread in the Justice League animated series.  Maybe I'm still not over my adoration of that show, but I can't help but feel like a lot of these DCAU feature films coming from Warner Brothers of late would have made for awesome season-long threads for JL not unlike the Project Cadmus angle.Back to reality though, the fight segments contained here are pretty impressive, and do a nice job capturing the inhuman power of the combatants involved.  The inconsistent pacing and rushed ending can probably be overlooked by action-junkies on account of these awesome battles.  The rest of us who have come to expect absolute perfection from Bruce Timm and company will likely come away from this film feeling as though the potential outweighs the finished product.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 16, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2IDO0IIL7GQQC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003UN2ICM#wasThisHelpful","R2IDO0IIL7GQQC","AHF97M45JFCB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AHF97M45JFCB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have to admit that while I've loved almost everything that Bruce Timm and company have done with the DC Universe in animation throughout the years, I have always felt that with a few exceptions, Marvel has never been successful at making the transition of the depth and richness of their books into animated form.  I toured their entire MLG (Marvel & Lion's Gate) library and came away feeling like while the animation was nice and the vocal talent pretty deep, the whole experience just felt shallow and dull.  However, being never one to give up on a solid idea, when I saw the preview for Planet Hulk on one of the DVDs, I decided I would have to give that one a go before writing off the whole MLG experience and truthfully, I'm really glad I did.Based on Greg Pak's fantastic Incredible Hulk: Planet Hulk book, the film tells of Hulk's destructive nature to the planet finally reaching a point of unacceptability and The New Avengers: Illuminati's reluctant decision to jettison Hulk into space.  The original plan was to have his spacecraft crash onto a peaceful lush planet of greenery and livestock for which the Hulk could live out his remaining years alone but the plan is derailed when an enraged Hulk starts thrashing around in the capsule and causes it to crash land on an alien world somewhere between earth and his original destination.Subdued by a restraining chip and sold into slavery, Hulk quickly finds himself in the role of Russell Crowe's character from the movie ""Gladiator"".  It turns out that the world he crashed upon (Sakaar) finds itself locked in a political dictatorship that has the people putting hope in the arrival of a savior to restore freedom to the land.Without giving up any spoilers, the Hulk's incredible feats of strength in the coliseum aren't unnoticed by the populous and before long rumor begins to spread that perhaps his arrival was foretold in prophecy.  In an act of utter irony, Hulk's destructive nature is suddenly viewed as the catalyst for lasting peace.The action begins in this one nearly immediately; wasting very little time with setup.  Hulk's crash sequence is complete by the opening credits and the alien world is presented with some pretty cool life forms and concepts.  Especially note worthy is that due to Sakaar's proximity to a wormhole, species of countless races crash land on the planet's surface and, because they are unable to leave, become the property of the Empire (in other words slavery is alive and well on Sakaar and involves far more than just the indigenous species).The Hulk we're given here is surprisingly intelligent as well with his sheer uncontrollable rage offered as a sort of brooding determination.  We actually get some character evolution as well, with Hulk's gradual change from a sulking, primitive monster in the beginning to a beast with a sense of pride and honor by the end.  Bruce Banner makes not a single appearance here and while that may seem suspect to some die-hard Hulk fans, truthfully the slant toward a more intelligent Hulk blended with the fact that the alien world would have killed Banner instantly, makes this fact not only justifiable but plausible in the mythos as well.Pacing is pretty quick (as is expected when stuffing some 400 pages of material into 72-minutes of film) and the action heavy gladiator sequences are offset with some nice splashes of back-story & character development.With an ending that certainly hints to a ""what-if"" vibe, the whole story can technically be viewed as a sort of offshoot to the time-honored Hulk material but this is certainly not a bad thing.  Quite honestly Hulk's out of control nature here on earth lends beautifully to this exact scenario and it's really interesting to witness the green man pitted against enemies truly deserving of the beating he is capable of administrating.In all, even if you've gone through the other MLG pieces and came away disappointed, Planet Hulk is certainly worth giving a go.  I'm truly hoping this piece has elevated the bar for all future Marvel animated features to follow.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 13, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R129S5LOGK7FQ7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002WNUVKC#wasThisHelpful","R129S5LOGK7FQ7","AHF97M45JFCB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AHF97M45JFCB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I am very lucky that my 70 pound Pitbull is not a barker but my friend's little 20 pound Pekineses barks like she's 120 pound!  Vastar had sent me a sample so I gave to my friend and let her try and she said it works wonder!  Like other reviewers, she likes that it has 7 different levels and it gradually increases the shock/vibration.  She said her dog didn't know what's going on at the first few barks but she quickly learned that it's her barking that causes the shock/vibration.  Dogs are very smart animals, they learn and pick up things much faster than we expect and my friend said she sees DRAMATIC changes in her dog's barking behavior, before the collar, she barks so loud and will keep barking, after the collar, only a few barks.She's happy, her neighbors are happy, and I'm giving this product a 5 stars review~","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2UF78830SA3PX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0140HJBYE#wasThisHelpful","R2UF78830SA3PX","A1DJ9ZJH1RKQIE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DJ9ZJH1RKQIE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've been searching for a thicker swaddler and a friend of mine highly suggested the Ergobaby and she had given me a set~  :)  The reviews here are a mix but lots said their babies grow out of the small/medium within weeks so I'm lucky she gave me the medium/large which will fit 12-18 Ibs according to the box.The material is very soft, 100% cotton, fairly stretchy.  These swaddler are not cheap but considering the thickness, the material, and the design, I would give it a try.  Regular swaddle blankets are too thin for night time so this thickness will be perfect for us during winter nights.  I like the arm pockets design and the ""open bottom"" so it should make diaper changing easier.

"I always wanted an electrical pencil sharpener when I was a kid, now I finally have one~~  Thank you Huhuhero for sending me a sample for product review!Very nice pencil sharpener, much much better than the manual ones.  With this electrical sharpener, you'll have a pointy sharp pencil literally in seconds!  Comes with an extra sharpener core and a USB cable.  Pretty self explanatory, just put pencil in vertically, push down for a few seconds, and you'll have a perfect sharpened pencil in seconds~The shaving tray is very tough to open but I guess it's a good thing so it won't come off accidentally.

" 3:23 MinsWireless is super convenient. Being able to move freely without removing the headset is just pure enjoyment. Initial pairing process was easy, just press and hold the play button until light blinks. Reconnecting is also quick thanks to the 4.0 technology. But if you want wired, a aux to aux cable is included.Buttons on headset are large and accessible even for first time user. A English speaking female voice will prompt when reaching certain commands like Power on/off, Bluetooth pairing, Maximum Volume and such.The muffs are large enough to cup over the entire ears, lined with a soft smooth synthetic-type leather. After several long hour sessions, my ears were warm which are expected but not overheated/stuffy. The pinch of the muffs were just right for me at the near largest settings. It is also fold-able for travel, includes a hard foam-like zip pouch for storage.Sound is balance and clear. Not bass heavy, providing a solid experience for any type of music or entertainment. Even though the muffs fully cover the ears, at higher volumes (70%up) sound begins to leak.The glossy reflective exterior is nice to look at but easily attracts oil/fingerprints. The modern design and color combinations (red, black and silver) are done well to look stylish and high tech.Overall, surprisingly comfy with user friendly functions and reliable connectivity, sample given for review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2DDJGCXOGRYWM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010TRK7VU#wasThisHelpful","R2DDJGCXOGRYWM","A1DJ9ZJH1RKQIE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DJ9ZJH1RKQIE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I always wanted to get a seat belt for Cannes, my 70 pound blue Pit, thank you Vastar for giving me the opportunity to review the product and I am absolutely satisfied and would recommend to all dog owners, all feedback are my own opinion about the product.Cannes loves going on car rides with us and it doesn't matter where she sits, front or back, there was numerous times that when we had to slam on our brakes, she would either hit the dash board or the driver/passenger seats.  There was one time that she had a small cut from hitting the dash board...  This seat belt is perfect, it will prevent Cannes from hitting the dash board again for sure.  The strap is made with a pretty durable nylon, adjustable, shortest 15"" and longest is 22"".  The metal buckle fits both of my cars perfectly, I think it should be universal.

We did put ours up on pavers, mainly because we didn't want the inside bottom to get into a muddy mess when it rained, it has really worked out well.

"I cannot wait until December 1st arrives and we can start this new tradition with our son.  An advent calendar is nice, and we've done those in the past, but with those, most of the time your child is receiving something.  The Good Deeds Manger makes is easy to make it all about giving and doing good deeds for others.  Baby Jesus comes swaddled in a piece of linen, he comes laying in a real wood manger.  The set also includes 25 pieces of real hay in a burlap bag, a gold star to symbolize the North Star, and a proclamation to hang on your tree.  The idea is to start December 1st(parents, keep baby Jesus tucked safely away). do at least one good deed a day, when the good deed is done, place one piece of straw in the manger.  On Christmas morning baby Jesus will be in the manger, resting on a bed of straw, each piece representing a good deed performed by your child and/or family.This set is so well thought out, the details are amazing!  The manger itself is a true piece of craftsmanship.  The entire set is made in the USA.  I highly recommend adding this to your family Christmas traditions.  It would be a PERFECT gift also.

"Easy to use, lightweight digital thermometer.  I tested this against a temporal thermometer I have at home and it appears to be pretty accurate, the only drawback is that it has about a 10 second read time.  Not a big deal to adults, but when you are dealing with sick children, this could be an issue.  Most parents are looking for a quick read thermometer.  I also noticed that there is no backlight on the display, so you need to be in a lit area, or move to a lit are after you take the temp.  Again, not a big deal for adults, but could pose an issue when dealing with little ones who don't feel well.  On a positive note, I do like that the tip is flexible and waterproof, this makes it easier to use with little ones and of course, gives you peace of mind when cleaning.

"The book title attracted me a lot. I am not single but my friend is currently having problems after a nasty break up with her boyfriend. By no mean I can be her breakup expert to help her out. So, this is another reason to read this book.  I really like how the author talks in the book. She is like a very close friend and she knows a lot about men for sure. She based on her knowledge about men and came up with this No Contact Rule. I believe it is the hardest thing to do. But she got your back. She guides you through this process step by step. She comforts you and know exactly what you think and feel. She tells you how to occupy your time and most importantly is to love yourself.

"I was really looking forward to this book, but after getting through half of it, I'm admitting defeat - so far I've found very few redeeming qualities. I recognize this will not be a popular viewpoint, particularly since it's hard to get published and easy to be a critic, but I'm just not a fan of this author's style or story.Briefly, the book sets up a war between the depraved King of England and the wonderful folks of Ireland, the land of magic, which is ruled in a tremendously democratic and delightful way by the stout-hearted Celts and their faerie friends.  The bad guys are very bad (and all evil Catholics, funded by Jews).  The good guys are generally good, as druids are, even if they keep getting forgotten for many pages at a time.  There's some confusing double-crossing, lots of gratuitous bloodletting, and rather too much un-steamy sex.  The story moves from 2016 to the late 1300s, forward 20 years, back 17 years, forward 7 years, back 3 years until you don't know (or care) whether the characters are coming or going.  Speaking of the characters, they are flat and poorly defined, and by turns whiny and then suddenly omnipotent.  The main character was supposed to suffer when her twin sister was killed.  This was clearly indicated by the fact that she voluntarily married a man who she knew was cruel and he promptly sodomizes her.  After 50 pages, he gets his comeuppance, but was any of that really necessary.  The plot appears to be just as clumsy - almost an afterthought to the rather lousy world-building.  There are too many flavors of faerie and not enough space for them all to have their own little corner of Ireland.  Oh, and there are Vikings, somewhat inexplicably.  With an armada poised to invade, I gave up.  It was never clear to me why so many people (including the reader) should remotely care what happened to Ireland or any of the characters therein.So why was I looking forward to this book?  Well, the 'reviews' by people I'd never heard of looked good until I started reading the book and understood what they meant:""simultaneously sweeping and intricate"" means the passage of time is handled very poorly.  Pages upon pages deal with a single day, but then the next page goes backwards or forwards 20 years or 200 years.""plundering the treasure troves of myths"" means half the ideas are stolen and that Geoffrey Chaucer turns up halfway through, sounding thoroughly misplaced and completely out of his element.""a wild grab bag of myth, history, folklore, and the fantastical"" may sound great, but remember that most of what comes in a grab bag is stuff you didn't really want or need.If you want better world building, I'd recommend Bradley Beaulieu's Twelve Kings of Sharakhai or Robin Hobb's Assassin's Apprentice, which has just as much blood but for a much better reason.  If you want some old school magic, try TH White's Sword in the Stone.","2.0 out of 5 stars","November 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3BOOA2A2KEWBI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0525429530#wasThisHelpful","R3BOOA2A2KEWBI","A3GRPS2NYINLX4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3GRPS2NYINLX4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was really impressed with this chocolate.  The positive impressions started with the packaging.  A large bubble wrap envelope held a fairly large cardboard box that looks like it would hold a piece of electronics (like a hard drive) rather than 3 bars of chocolate.  Opening the lid of the sturdy box revealed the three bars, surrounded by a significant amount of shock-absorbing cardboard.  Needless to say, the three 100g (~3.5 oz) bars arrived in pristine condition.  The actual packaging of the chocolate is nice, but not quite as upscale as you might expect, but this is probably for direct consumption rather than gift-giving.  Black box with red and yellow trim and silver foil are all nice enough.  The important part is what's inside the packaging.This is 84% cocoa solids, which means it's on the dark end of dark chocolate.  Typical milk chocolates are 30 - 45%.  Dark chocolates are usually anything above 50% cocoa.  As one approaches 100% cocoa, the chocolate is basically cooking chocolate.  So this is a very dark, almost bitter, quite edible bar of chocolate.  It has a very nice texture with almost no graininess, despite not having any soy lecithin (an emulsifier often included in chocolate).  It's brittle with a nice rich mouthfeel.  The tasting notes describe this as floral and bittersweet.  I would describe it as not very sweet, quite bitter, not terribly floral, perhaps a bit flat at room temperature, but very chocolately.  The finish is almost pure cocoa and lasts for a very long time (at least 5 minutes).The bar is made by Nestle in Switzerland and branded for the North and South American market (mostly Brazil and Mexico).  Somewhat strangely the ingredients list is: Chocolate, cocoa butter, sugar, cocoa powder, vanilla extract - which is a bit like listing the ingredients of coca-cola as: coke, water, sugar, etc, etc.It's a bit bitter for my taste and not as interesting as some other chocolates that are out there.  If you're after a very clean bitter cocoa taste, this could be your bar.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ZS50FKD8M9EP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014UAGKLS#wasThisHelpful","R2ZS50FKD8M9EP","A3GRPS2NYINLX4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3GRPS2NYINLX4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a perfectly good moisturizing cream, but I still don't fully understand why I should bother with this product.  Will it really help my skin over the long-term?  How can I assess that in the 30 day period I have to review the product?Instead, I'll start with a quick analysis of the chemicals that are used in this thick white basically unscented cream.  It's pretty standard, with a fair amount of water, some alcohols, various components/precursors of fat and oils (eg, glycerin and long-chain fatty acids), some vitamins (notably E and A), some plant extracts (oatmeal?), and some preservatives.  Of all these chemicals, three need specific callouts:1, Parabens - cheap preservatives that have been widely used for a long period of time.  That doesn't mean we know everything about them.  They have weakly estrogenic (feminizing) activity in the lab, and have been linked to both cancer and DNA damage, since they can radicalize in the presence of UV.  Definitely not one of my favorites.2, BHA - there's probably only the tiniest of quantities of this Butylated Hydroxy-Anisole in the cream, and this stuff is routinely used as a preservative in food products, notably breakfast cereals.  But it's basically another form of toluene, which is a pretty potent carcinogen.3, Vitamin A - as at least one other review has pointed out, this is a potent teratogen, usually available only by prescription (or in ROC anti-aging cream).  It is often prescribed for acne, which is where my familiarity with this stuff comes from.  On the plus side, it's very good at dealing with mild to moderate acne over the long term - it takes a minimum of 2 weeks to have an effect and you may break-out more in the first two months before it really starts to improve things.  On the minus side, it makes your skin more sun-sensitive (ie, prone to sunburn) and has been shown to cause chickens to grow extra wings in the lab.  Of course, we don't know how much is included in this cream, which is one of my biggest issues with this cream.  There's a big difference between 0.5% and 5% - how much does this stuff have in it?Due to these three caveats, I'll probably discontinue use.  I've been testing it by applying it only to the left side of my face for a few weeks.  There are some pros and cons, as one might expect:PROs1, This is perhaps the only moisturizer I've ever used that doesn't make me break-out in seconds2, A little goes a very long way, and continues to work for at least half a day - you can still feel it at least 6 hours after you apply it3, It's not greasyCONs1, If you exercise with it, it will make you sweat more - is it blocking pores?  I can't tell, but I really notice it2, I didn't really notice any short-term benefits - my skin still creases in all the same ways, but it's just more moist now.3, As already mentioned, I just don't know if there are any long-term benefits.I'm a pretty critical reviewer yet I don't hate this product.  If you need a moisturizer, it's worth trying.  It may appear expensive, but I predict it will last a year with judicious application.  However, I'm concerned that we don't know enough about the composition of this, particularly since there are some potent chemicals in there, nor the long-term consequences of use.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3POZ1OCI7UA0C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LHZC00K#wasThisHelpful","R3POZ1OCI7UA0C","A3GRPS2NYINLX4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3GRPS2NYINLX4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Reflecting the latest trend in cases, this case is constructed so you can see through to the back of the phone - ooooh!Seriously, this is a great case.  It covers the back with clear tough ABS plastic and the sides are made of a generous layer of colorful silicon.  There is no protection for the front of the phone (ie, no scratch-resistant screen is included with this case), but the silicon extends a couple of millimeters above the screen to give a good lip.  It seems like this will protect your phone from a drop onto a flat surface, but probably not if you drop it onto a rocky one.  The silicon part of the case is also a bit wider than it probably needs to be.  When in the case, the phone has a nice low profile, but it's pretty wide, which could be problematic for those with small hands.  Unlike some purely silicon cases, this one doesn't seem like it will loosen with time.  I'm confident it will remain a tight-fitting case.As you'd expect from Otterbox, the quality is high - all the cut-outs are in the right place for either the iPhone 6 or the iPhone 6S (this case is not the correct size for the iPhone 5/5S or the 6+).  It's easy to push the buttons on the sides of the phone.  I've bought other (similarly highly rated) cases from other companies in the recent past, and this one is better, offers more protection and is sturdier.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3K82CFL4LWPDL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00X53TU64#wasThisHelpful","R3K82CFL4LWPDL","A3GRPS2NYINLX4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3GRPS2NYINLX4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"...and that's it.The first book in this trilogy made me want to read everything Robin Hobb has ever written.  It was an excellent story with a fun and engaging main character.  The second book in the trilogy piles on the injuries the main character a little too much.  This last book is 770 insufferable pages in which the main character is assaulted in almost every imaginable way: physical, mental, spiritual.  He is stripped of all the interesting layers and left as not even a broken shell of a man.  I think Ms. Hobb was trying to reimagine the cliched ""to defeat them you must become them,"" but it just left me thinking that Ms. Hobb is a bit of closet sadist.  I was enough of a masochist to read the book, but I won't be reading any more of her writings.Two notes:1) Like many others, I was surprised to get to page 700 before things started to wrap up.  The mysterious and terrific enemy established in the first book and belabored in the second is dispatched in about three pages with about as much preamble as the character usually gives to his evening meal.2) It appears from the jacket covers of the follow-up trilogy to this story that even Ms. Hobb relented and reimagined a happier ending for the main protagonist...","2.0 out of 5 stars","October 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R13B3FOYB6A8IT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0553565699#wasThisHelpful","R13B3FOYB6A8IT","A3GRPS2NYINLX4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3GRPS2NYINLX4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have used daily disposable contact lenses for about 15 years.  I prefer daily disposables to those that have to be cleaned daily because they are much more consistent, easier to deal with, and if you rip one it doesn't matter.  J&J Acuvue Moist are pretty good and have all the things I like in contact lenses: they're comfortable, tinted to make them easy to find, and offer UV protection.  Recent changes in regulations have pushed some daily disposable contact lens prices through the roof, including most J&J lenses, so I started looking around at other brands.I really like some of Ciba's Focus Dailies, but the ones I used to use don't offer UV protection.  J&J's Acuvue Moist are even more comfortable and offer all the things I like, but for a high price.  B&L's Biotrue lenses are also quite comfortable and offer UV protection for a very reasonable price.  However, these Clariti lenses are just dreadful.  The price is high, yet the packaging is poor and the lenses are very uncomfortable, particularly around the edges of the lenses.  My eyes became itchy and tired in minutes.  I wore them for five days, often for my usual 15 hours, but I couldn't wait to take them out.  It's strange because they should be just like Acuvue Moist - they are the same price, very similar composition (around 55% water), and offer UV protection, but I think the difference is in how the manufacturers 'round off' the edges.  For the price, I would rather have Acuvue Moist than torture my eyes with these.  However, I will continue to look for cheaper lenses that are legally allowed to be discounted. I was really shocked at how poor these lenses were.","1.0 out of 5 stars","October 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1C7J88MVHGOFB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RC6U95G#wasThisHelpful","R1C7J88MVHGOFB","A3GRPS2NYINLX4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3GRPS2NYINLX4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I received this machine for review purposes - I would not have purchased it with my own money, having previously had a poor experience with a Toshiba Portege R500 about 10 years ago.That having been said, this machine is a reasonable desktop replacement with a large hard drive, relatively fast processor, and a dedicated video  card.  It also has good speakers, a DVD drive, an SD slot, and some USB 3 ports.  The 15.6 inch screen has a relatively small half-inch bezel, a reasonable chiclet-style keyboard, and a nice big trackpad.However, it has many issues:1, Build quality is pretty bad - Plasticky, sharp edges, and a trackpad that feels like I'm about to press through it2, Weight is significant - It's a 5 pound brick and really only good as a desktop replacement3, Keyboard is only OK - The layout is OK but the keyboard is not backlit and the spacebar is a bit small.  The trackpad is too easy to swipe, moving the cursor to a completely different part of the screen, which gets really annoying when typing.4, Hard drive is huge but slow - This machine has a slow-spinning 1 TB hard drive; it does not have the more desirable solid-state drive.5, Included DVD drive is a waste of space 99.9% of the time - None of my other machines have an optical drive and I've never missed it.6, Screen is old technology - The resolution is low (1366 x 768 isn't even 1080, let alone ""4k"") and is not touch sensitive.The compromises aren't awful, but they do raise the question of who would want to buy this machine.  The high-end core i7 processor, dedicated graphics card, optical drive, and big hard drive might make this machine great for students who download movies and play a few games.  However, the resolution of the screen is not that great and it weighs too much to carry around.  In addition, the battery life is pretty lousy compared to the HP Elitebook that I use at work.  It's probably intended as a desktop-replacement, to be hooked up to a decent monitor and keyboard.

"There are two types of electric shaver.  The first, epitomized by Norelco/Philishave and Remington, has a set of blades on a little circular platform that are spun at high speed behind a grate.  The second, most famously from Braun and now Panasonic, has a set of blades that oscillate from side-to-side beneath a very thin guard foil.  I won't consider electric clippers (as used by most barbers), since those really are best for trimming hairlines, rather than removing stubble.This shaver is a very respectable example of the second type of shaver, with oscillating blades.  One important question with any shaver is how it deals with the contours and curves of the face, especially if the blades are straight.  This shaver features two adjusting pieces.  First, the entire head can pivot at the 'neck' (around the power switch) from side to side.  Note that some shavers move forwards and backwards too, but this one does not.  Second, the individual foils are mounted on springs and can move independently of each other.  (Sidenote: this shaver advertises three foils, but there's really only two, connected by some weird bladed thing in the middle.)  All in all, it works fine, especially on flat/slightly convex facial surfaces like cheeks.  The shaver does struggle on the angles of the face, particularly the sides of the jaw and the very edge of the chin.  It is possible to get a reasonably close shave there, but you have to hold the shaver at the correct angle and do multiple passes.  The next important question is how quiet is the shaver.  Although it's pretty quiet, this shaver is definitely a little louder than most rotary Norelcos from the last decade.  I think it's probably quiet enough for most folks, but if you want a super-silent shaver, look elsewhere.Other features that some will value include the following:1) battery life, which is about an hour - on the high side of average2) battery life indicator, which is poor - I had a Norelco that counted down the minutes left; this one just has 3 blue LEDs that light up for the briefest moment after you've finished shaving3) battery type - lithium ion, which is the current benchmark for this product type4) weight, which is again absolutely average for an electric razor5) ability to use in the shower or with lather - still a somewhat unusual feature, of limited use for me but necessary for some folks6) Sideburn trimmer - standard on all but the smallest travel electric shavers, this one is fine but no match for a dedicated clipper.7) Travel cover - a clear plastic piece to protect the blades and the power button from getting knocked around8) Clipper converter - an interesting device to turn the whole shaver into an adjustable clipper, but still no match for an actual clipper...The other cool feature of this shaver is the fact that it comes with a charging stand / automatic cleaner.  Braun and Norelco first introduced these a decade or so ago as a way to differentiate their top of the line shavers.  They're hard to find on such a reasonably priced shaver.  This one has a useful filter to ensure that all the little hairs removed by cleaning don't get cycled back into the shaving head.  The cleaning cycle is quite a bit noisier than just using the shaver and takes 20 minutes.  The noise prevented me from using the cleaning stand too early in the morning, which is a bit of a nuisance.  Another drawback of the cleaning stand is the need to buy (overpriced) foil pouches of detergent (ie, soap) with EDTA (ie, the same anti-microbial used to keep humidifiers from getting moldy).  On my old cleaning system, I would change the solution just a few times a year, which sort of defeats the point.  The solutions last longer if you just lift off the foil covers and knock out the excess hair before loading the shaver in the cleaner.  Although annoying, such cleaning stands do improve the quality of the shave and are worth having.Time will tell how the blades last over time.  I found my Norelco shaver blades last about 2 years or so before they really start to get appreciably worse, but then they cost one-third the cost of this shaver to replace.  Replacements for this shaver are hard to find, but look like they'll run twenty to thirty dollars.  I'll update this review as necessary.All in all, this is a perfectly respectable lightweight wet/dry shaver with pretty good battery life and lots of add-on features (cleaning stand, clipper converter, travel cover) for a reasonable price.  Step-up models spin their blades faster and have better battery life indicators.  If you have really thick stubble, it might be worth looking into a faster model.  If you travel a lot, you might need a better battery life indicator.  In short, this is not the best shaver on the market, but it is pretty good value.(Disclosure: this shaver was provided free by the Amazon Vine program)","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3O4438JHEWEM9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SIJSNUY#wasThisHelpful","R3O4438JHEWEM9","A3GRPS2NYINLX4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3GRPS2NYINLX4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"After a very enjoyable first foray into the realm of A Secret Atlas, I was looking forward to more.  Well, no longer.  I'm 150 pages through the book and will not continue.  I will try and explain why without revealing any spoilers for those who do wish to read the book.All the characters from the first book are back, but most of them have changed substantially in very odd ways.  Several characters carry on with a surveying expedition for no apparent reason, at least two characters quickly becomes gods, and at least one main character becomes completely possessed and, jarringly, starts getting written in the first person.  There are still one too many characters to keep straight (is that Prince Cyron or Warrior Cyrus?  Which minister is that again?), having four parallel plots is challenging, and the existence of a parallel dreamworld into which several characters are absorbed just adds to the confusion.","2.0 out of 5 stars","September 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1MZWTOMQUUBF4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0553382381#wasThisHelpful","R1MZWTOMQUUBF4","A3GRPS2NYINLX4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3GRPS2NYINLX4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I don't want to give away too many details of this excellent book, but suffice it to say the short description on the back of the book does not do justice to the story within, nor does it do justice to the quality of the writing.The book starts out as an engaging tale of swashbuckling that is leagues better than the overrated Lies of Locke Lamora.  There's a little less dry wit, but the characters are well-differentiated and well-drawn.  The setting for the book is remarkably well-described through beautifully transparent prose that never gets in the way, but rather draws the reader in.  The plot is complicated enough to be interesting but not too complicated to follow, with plenty of intrigue.As the story continues, there are two narrative arcs: present day and a decade earlier.  These are interwoven in a very clever way, revealing exactly the right amount of information at the right time in a way that only once seems slightly contrived.  The characters all evolve in a rewarding, impressive, and believable way.  The plot continues to suck the reader in and the prose never gets in the way.When I finished this first volume in the ""Song of the Shattered Sands"" series, I couldn't wait to start the next one, which is not yet available at the time of this review.  In the meantime, I will go back and pick up some of the author's earlier works.

"Although I've given this book a three star review, that hides the bi-modal nature of the book.On one hand, the 47(!) principles of success are useful, astute, and the kind of thing one usually only gets from experience.  It's clear throughout this book that the author has had those experiences ... in the peculiarly confined world of strategy consulting.  I've also had some of those experiences in the same peculiar world, and most of the principles really resonated with me.  The principles described are worth four or five stars.  If I were to write all of them here, you'd have one fewer reasons to buy the book, so I'll just list a few:1, Focus on what really matters2, Start with the hard stuff in the morning3, Catch small signs and make a difference4, Have a 30 second answer for everything5, Frontload your project...19, Pause 3 seconds before answering difficult questions20, Question more and talk lessThe 47 principles are helpfully divided into four sections:1, Building the better self2, Growing with others3, Excelling in process management4, Going the extra mileThe last section (Become a thinker and a writer) is a little self-indulgent acknowledgement section, which is fine, except that there's already a self-indulgent acknowledgement in the beginning AND a self-indulgent introductory chapter.If you're beginning to sense a theme that the writing style left a little to be desired, you've already realized why I only gave this book 3 stars.  In true consulting style, there are three reasons why I didn't like the text.  First, it's written in a very conversational style, but that leads to lost clarity on quite a few occasions, not helped by omissions of punctuation (at least in my pre-publication copy).  Second, a substantial portion of the text is re-quoted from other self-help books you've probably heard of (""the seven habits of highly successful people""), or in one egregious example, the oracle from the film The Matrix.  Lastly, despite being a very structured and organized thinker, many of the author's stories ramble and a few are not even relevant.  Several times, he delves into pseudoscience explanations for why it is best to do hard work at 4:30 am or why running is the best exercise.  As a side-note, since the author also recommends eating dinner with interesting people, even if it means putting off work until 3am, I'm left wondering when the author slept.  In the final chapter, the author reveals that he wrote most of the book by ""bulldoz[ing] through several sleepless nights.""  This flagrant flouting of the author's own second principle is very apparent - the writing deserves one or two stars at most.It seems unfair to bash this book for the writing when the bullet points are so useful.  If you can get past the poor writing, the 150 pages in this book will go by quite quickly, and many of the 47 business principles are definitely things I wish I'd known earlier, rather than having to learn through experience.  My only question to the author is whether it really is possible to learn these principles without experiencing them personally...If you didn't like this review, please let me know how I can improve it in the comments section.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1KI6UL3S6PZ6X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1259588688#wasThisHelpful","R1KI6UL3S6PZ6X","A3GRPS2NYINLX4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3GRPS2NYINLX4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book was published after the author passed away in late 2014.  That makes it very hard to describe how little I liked this book, but I'm required to review it, so here's what I think: if you're a big fan of the author it's probably worth reading.  However, I won't be reading any of his other works to compare them to this one.  Anyway, regardless of whether you agree with my review, please use the voting buttons if you find the review helpful or not.This book purports to be an epic adventure covering 3 billion years.  It explores aspects of time dilation and also imagines what a society of humans might evolve into if their entire world were a tree on a comet.  The tree on a comet concept was first described in the 1920s, something author reminds us of at least twice.The story moves along at a reasonable pace, although it's hard to care for any of the characters.  They appear to be there solely to keep the plot moving along.  The plot itself is little better, and appears to be there only to allow the author to put together some claptrap pseudoscience ideas in a way that sounds vaguely plausible.  That's fine, until it goes too far, towards the end of the book, when it just becomes an unbearable diatribe.  The bad guy is a bit deranged, for no apparent reason.  The good guys are beyond good.  Inexplicable, improbable things happen and mind-blowing coincidences are just part of the story.  And then you get hit with 20 pages of gushing partial scientific explanation, some of which isn't even really relevant.The book, in short, is a mess.  I would much rather read some Joe Haldane (Forever War) or even Cloud Atlas.  I should have realized what was wrong with this book when the best quote they could find to put on the cover was, ""the science is so good, it's hard to believe he's not a scientist!""  Well, having struggled my way through most of the book, I can believe he wasn't a scientist.  One other thing to keep in mind: there's nothing about the story in that quote, or any other.  Yeah, there's a reason for that.","2.0 out of 5 stars","September 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1KZ2H5OM0LVY2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1497682940#wasThisHelpful","R1KZ2H5OM0LVY2","A3GRPS2NYINLX4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3GRPS2NYINLX4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a white paste toothpaste from Colgate that's not very different from the last few generations of Colgate Total.Based on the ingredients list, it is almost identical to Colgate Total Whitening, except that it no longer contains mica (a family of silicates that usually contain sodium, potassium, calcium, and/or magnesium).  Compared to the gels, it also does not contain FD&C blue #1.The good news is that it contains fluoride, which helps to strengthen teeth, and triclosan, an anti-bacterial agent.  Triclosan is usually used to kill bacteria outside the body.  For instance, when doctors scrub in for surgeries, they use soaps containing triclosan.  At the low concentrations found in toothpastes AND as long as you brush for 2 full minutes, triclosan appears to be a pretty good anti-bacterial agent that reduces bacterial colonization of your mouth, especially between teeth (plaque) and around the gums.  Triclosan remains a little controversial, although it's been in toothpastes and other household cleaning products for many years.  All the dentists I've spoken to agree that the fluoride is the most important active ingredient.The bad news is that this toothpaste doesn't taste minty.  In fact, it's almost impossible to describe the flavor.  The first time I used it, it tasted a bit like a dentist's office, which is not an especially appealing flavor.  Since then, it just tastes bland each time I use it.  I miss the mint, but if you're not a fan of minty toothpastes, this might be the one for you.Nothing else major has changed over Colgate Total Whitening.  The tube is a little smaller for the pricepoint.  They used to sell 6.4 oz, then 6.2 oz, then 6.0 oz for the same money.  This is 5.8 oz.  It still claims to reduce plaque, gum inflammation, and also whiten teeth.  In addition, this paste claims to be capable of 're-mineralization!' to 'promote enamel re-growth!' and other such things.  There is no good evidence for these claims - they're certainly not conducting clinical trials like drugs - but there's no evidence against them either.  These new claims for the same old paste appear to stem more from changes in dental beliefs than from actual changes in toothpaste formulation.  I'll check with my dentist next time I go to visit, but for now I'd say that if you're looking for a non-minty toothpaste with fluoride and triclosan, this is probably fine.  For my part, I'll keep using the virtually identical minty version that doesn't claim to add back lost enamel but does come in a bigger tube.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RUV4PUV9GXL28/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZANSGT4#wasThisHelpful","RUV4PUV9GXL28","A3GRPS2NYINLX4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3GRPS2NYINLX4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I enjoyed Half a War much more than I ever expected to.This is essentially a medieval fantasy which involves a fair amount of swords and swash-buckling.  The story apparently concludes a trilogy.  I say apparently because, unlike many trilogies, this book stands alone extremely well.  I can say this with confidence since I thoroughly enjoyed it without reading either of the two prior books.  I may now go back and read those, even though this genre isn't really my favorite.The pacing is steady and the writing is good.  There isn't too much technobabble/altered vocabulary to plough through, although the names are a bit challenging at the start.  For instance, it took me 40 or 50 pages to realize I had Raith, Rakki, and Brand mixed up as being just two characters, mostly because I was confused about how Thorn and Rin fit in.  So far, so three stars.The two standout aspects of this book, which elevate it above a typical fantasy, are the strong character development and light-hearted yet suspenseful writing style.  The characters are drawn a little sketchily at first, but are definitely allowed to grow and develop over the course of the book.  At least four major characters are almost unrecognizably different by the end of the book (assuming I kept their names straight!).  These transformations were handled very well and made me care enough to finish the book.  I probably would have finished the book anyway, since the plotting and writing were good.  The author clearly had fun writing some of these characters and that really shows through.  It's not all earnest ""defeat the powers of darkness or else!""  The author makes time for some humor and does a nice job of revealing the inner thoughts of most of the protagonists.So why not five stars?  Well, the plot had a few twists, but nothing earth-shattering.  Several character threads were left disappointingly unresolved, to the point that I'm forced to wonder if there will be a fourth book in this ""trilogy.""","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2N2R2SHKB144F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0804178453#wasThisHelpful","R2N2R2SHKB144F","A3GRPS2NYINLX4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3GRPS2NYINLX4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a spy novel, set against a sci-fi backdrop.  It aims to be like Fleming's ""The Spy Who Loved Me"" and in many ways it's almost as fun.  The plot moves along as rapidly as a summer blockbuster, and the writing is reasonably taut.  The two central characters have chemistry, despite their differences.  The book tries to ask some Big Questions, much bigger than the airplane-suitable thriller this book could easily be mistaken for.For instance, the book explores the idea of what you might be capable of if you weren't 'cursed' with a memory or a conscience.  Through a barely believable sci-fi plot device, the main character (Peter Caswell) has his memories selectively removed.  Knowing that he is unencumbered by memory, the book explores what Caswell is and is not prepared to do.  How callous are human beings?There's also some interesting allegorical reference to the Cold War, as seen through the warped vision of someone drunk on James Bond and using hazy hindsight.  Instead of East vs West, there is a war of North vs South.  Instead of an iron curtain, there is a no-man's land called the Desolation.  What is it that we were fighting for?In the end, though, this is just a good action read, with more emotional awareness than your average spy story.  It's not the best thriller I've ever read, and it can't really hold a candle to masters of the genre, but I had trouble putting it down and the main characters were much more likeable than they had any right to be.  This book stands alone, but I wouldn't be surprised if there are sequels.  I'd probably read them, too, and that means it gets four stars.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1D46VA6BTRIDW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0553391267#wasThisHelpful","R1D46VA6BTRIDW","A3GRPS2NYINLX4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3GRPS2NYINLX4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've used Eagle Creek luggage for over 6 years, which included a two year stint of weekly cross-country travel.  For the most part, it stood up to tremendous abuse with very little visible wear and tear.  In short, I'm a fan.One of the best features of the luggage was the shirt/trouser pack-it bag, which is one of the pieces included in this set.  It's deceptively simple: a bag with a stiff base and a (smaller) 'template.'  Using the included instructions, you can fold a collar shirt or pair of trousers around the template and about 10 items will fit in the bag perfectly, where the stiff base keeps them from folding.  This new ""Specter"" version further improves on that concept in two important respects: it's about half the weight and the capacity has gone up by a claimed two shirts.  Actually, the dimensions are the same as before but the velcro is a little more generous.  I now use the template on top of the pile of clothes to make it easier to shut the velcro closures.The other two pieces are carefully designed with bag dimensions in mind: the bigger one is about 13 x 10 inches and the smaller one is about 10 x 6.5 inches, both perfect for airline carry-on bags with external dimensions 22 x 14 x 9 (pretty standard in the industry).  The bags are really lightweight ripstop nylon parachute material.  The smaller one is good for underwear, while the larger one is the perfect size for t-shirts.  They're also covered in some amazing non-stick because they're really slippery.  That's great for pulling things in and out of a well-packed bag, but it can be a double-edged sword if you're relying on friction for everything to stay in place.I really like the lightweight nature of these packing pieces, which will work well with any standard-sized airline carry-on.  However, I wish they had thrown in one more small bag for this price.  Also, to save weight the shirt packer has sacrificed the template-storage pocket in the base.  But having now used this for a couple of trips, it's a product I wish I had bought earlier - even at full price.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RVL0SFMFBJR7I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00F3Z886U#wasThisHelpful","RVL0SFMFBJR7I","A3GRPS2NYINLX4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3GRPS2NYINLX4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There's a lot of confusion about this product on Amazon, probably because there are two distinct products being sold on this page.  One is an ""Enamel Health"" toothpaste that combats sensitivity.  The other is an ""Enamel Health"" toothpaste that whitens teeth.  I am reviewing the latter, which makes no claims about its ability to combat sensitivity....and why should it?  The ingredients list makes this a very standard whitening toothpaste.  There's fluoride, which is a critical component of most toothpastes, and not much else.  There are no anti-bacterial ""tartar control"" agents like triclosan, which means this toothpaste will not reduce tartar or promote gum health.  I've been using tartar control toothpastes for over 20 years and have had consistently excellent results with them, so I miss this feature.Contrary to what other reviewers have mentioned, this product does NOT supply additional calcium in any form (unless they're using brittle mica rather than the more common sodium and potassium-containing forms of mica).  Colgate remain unclear on this issue, claiming only that their formulation ""helps replenish natural calcium.""  This toothpaste's big selling point appears to be that it is alkaline rather than acidic.  Acids dissolve enamel, so perhaps that is what they mean.  In my view, this is weak logic, since the bacteria that live on your teeth (which this toothpaste probably isn't doing much to combat) produce acid fairly consistently during the day and night and probably overshadow any benefits an alkaline toothpaste has.The toothpaste itself is pretty unsatisfying to use: it's watery and tastes chalky, minty, and chemically.  The texture isn't that great, either.  It reminded me of Arm & Hammer's classic baking soda toothpaste ... without the baking soda.  If that's why you want, that's probably a better choice.  In fact, at first I thought it was a watered down kid's toothpaste, but the package explicitly notes it's only for kids over the age of 6 (presumably because of the titanium compounds in it). For me, I'll stick to my Colgate Total gel, which has a better texture and triclosan.  (For those who are justifiably worried about antibiotic resistance, triclosan is not generally used as a systemic antibiotic and should not contribute to the spread of antibiotic resistance, but please feel free to correct me in the comments section if you disagree).","2.0 out of 5 stars","April 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RCAKOINVCLBW0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N2JPLRS#wasThisHelpful","RCAKOINVCLBW0","A3GRPS2NYINLX4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3GRPS2NYINLX4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This aerosol-type clear sunscreen is really quite good, but isn't quite as good as the confusingly similar ""Neutrogena Ultimate Sport"" sunscreen that we like to use in my family.  Both are sweat/water resistant for 80 minutes.  Both have the same active ingredients (avobenzone, homosalate, octisalate, octocrylene, oxybenzone).  Both are around 5 oz.  The big difference is the feel of the product as you spray it.The Ultimate Sport feels like a fine dry powder the moment is touches your skin and cannot be rubbed aroundThe Cool Dry Sport is (somewhat confusingly) the one that goes on wet.  It can be rubbed around, but dries very quickly.  The product reminds you that it does not feel greasy, which is almost entirely true.  I'd say it feels a little oily until it dries a few seconds later.The other slight difference is in the cap.  The Cool Dry Sport has a great cap that locks by turning it.  The Ultimate Sport requires a separate, easily lost plastic cover.In the end both of these sunscreens are great products.  They are easy and quick to apply, offer excellent sun protection, and last for quite a long time.  I would not hesitate to recommend either.

"This is a somewhat short but often entertaining collection of short stories by Jonathan Lethem, who is known for his astute and sometimes surreal fiction.  If you're a fan of Haruki Murakami, you'll probably really enjoy most of these stories.  I say most because there was at least one pretty weak story (The Dreaming Jaw; The Salivating Ear).All of these 9 stories have been published before, 5 in the New Yorker, 1 in the Paris Review, 1 in Harper's, and the last two in one-off hard-to-track-down volumes.The only common element in these stories is Lethem's ability to build a world for his characters in a very short amount of time.  He's clearly comfortable writing about New York City but also surburban California.  His characters inhabit slightly odd places (but nothing as odd as Gun with Occasional Music), and get into some strange situations, but Lethem is at his best when he's describing the almost real oddities of life, as experienced by the stranger-than-real characters he develops so effortlessly.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2J082P0VX85KF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385539819#wasThisHelpful","R2J082P0VX85KF","A3GRPS2NYINLX4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3GRPS2NYINLX4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I should clarify that I really like the SINGLE flask that I received.  The description that Amazon offers this flat bottomed flask under is ""pack of six.""  The price is expensive for one flask and cheap for six, but I wanted six, as it was originally listed (for over a year) in the description.If you order this product, please be aware that you will only get ONE flask, not six, no matter what the description promises.The flask itself is really quite good.  It is Bomex glass, which means it should withstand direct heat from an open gas flame - it should be safe for your gas stovetop, if you want to test your luck.  Bomex is a cheaper copy of Pyrex and Kimax glass, both of which I would have preferred.  The flask also stands up and is reasonably stable, thanks to its flat bottom.  You will not need a tripod/clamp to use this flask.","2.0 out of 5 stars","January 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2OQPCHCJ51UAM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005QDP1GY#wasThisHelpful","R2OQPCHCJ51UAM","A3GRPS2NYINLX4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3GRPS2NYINLX4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I had hoped that this book wouldn't be like every other business book out there: one short idea that is somehow stretched, mostly through innovative use of 'chapters,' into book length, when in reality it would have been more efficient (but less lucrative) to just tweet the idea in the first place.Unfortunately, this book has exactly the same flaws as most business books:1) A single central theory that really needs only a napkin to explain, yet gets a whole book2) No actual analysis or evidence to support the central theory, but a whole lot of marginally relevant anecdotesIn this case, the book's central theory is that implementation is worth more than the foundational good idea.  How much more?  A lot more - apparently, you don't even need the initial idea.  Wow!  What insight the author is demonstrating!  I almost swooned.  The problem with this, of course, is that you can't just have an idea OR implementation - you need both.  Maybe I'm over-intellectualizing this, which the author is clearly not a fan of.  In fact, he devotes five pages of his precious allocation (a whole chapter!) to bash a dead economist (Keynes), claiming to agree with Orwell that ""some ideas are so absurd that only an intellectual could believe them.""  Sadly, Mr. Schrage, there are some ideas that are even more absurd, like the idea that you don't need ideas.  Or have you tried building a house with no actual foundation?  While we're at it, why not pick on someone who can defend themselves, instead of a dead guy?There are also problems with the implementation portion of this book.  First, it takes a while to get there.  Second, it's so general as to be useless.  Here's my evidence:  The book promises much early on but struggles to get to the point.  On p 47 he states ""the best way ... to advance the boldest ambitions is through the ... most fundamental experiments.  This book explains how.""  Great!  Except it doesn't.  Instead,  the entire next chapter is on how much the author enjoys hobnobbing with the wise and witty Warren Buffet.  After another 20 pages of hero worship (Bezos, Jobs, etc, who are definitely not known for their good ideas), we get to the author's much ballyhooed ""5x5 experimentation methodology,"" the author's recipe for implementation.  Well, not quite.  First, there's a lengthy explanation of what the framework is not.At this point, we're about halfway through the book and losing patience fast.  [Quick aside: Schrage, you told us a good idea should be tweetable.  Well, after 80 pages, you still haven't got to the point.  Instead you're outlining your ""80/20/20 vision.""  Great, now you sound like one of those football coaches telling us all to give 120% effort.]Ah!  Here it is: your tweetable idea: ""give a diverse team of 5 people no more than 5 days to come up with a portfolio of 5 business experiments that cost no more than $5000 (each) and take no longer than 5 weeks to run.""  Brilliant!  Pilot experiments for all!  Oh, wait, we're already doing those.  Never mind.Now that I've given away the thrilling conclusion of this book, you can decide if you want to read the remaining diatribe on things that even NASA figured out in the 1980s (""innovators ... go beyond throwing a prototype against a wall to see if it sticks."" and ""Low hanging fruit tastes delicious."").  If so, by all means pay this author for the privilege of reading his big idea.

It doesn't really do a good job and it isn't as clever or as high quality as I would normally expect from OXO.The head is fine, but kind of annoyingly shaped.

"I'm really pretty impressed with this product but I have very little experience with its competitors.It charges easily and quickly using a micro-USB cable (although no data can be transferred using the included cable, but I found I could charge it with another micro-USB cable, which was nice).  The earphones are pretty comfortable, exclude external noises well (but it is NOT capable of active noise-cancelling, merely noise isolating).Connections to sound sources are pretty easy: you can plug in a standard stereo jack or you can connect over bluetooth to your phone.  I only tested it with an iPhone, but connection was extremely easy, the range was comfortably 25 - 30 feet.Sound was good, but not great.  What really blew me away was that I could answer phone calls, even though there was no apparent/dumb-looking microphone.  I only tested this indoors, but the microphone seemed at least as good as a bluetooth headset and picked up my voice even if my hand was in the way.If you've been looking for a lightweight, comfy, simple, effective cross between headphones and a bluetooth headset, this product is definitely worth looking into.

"Having read this book all the way to the end, I noticed that the author notes he completed the work in Moscow in 1999.  That means this is one of his early works, if not his actual debut novel, and that makes sense.This book reads like a debut novel from start to finish.  Sure, the author is definitely one to watch and there are some very inventive ideas in here.  It's also engaging and quite well-paced, although the denouement takes about 20% of the book to unfold.  However, the characters are one-dimensional (partly by design, to be fair), the plot is simplistic, and the entire book isn't quite funny enough, nor is as serious as it sometimes thinks it is.  There are some political messages woven rather clumsily into the final few pages, almost as if the author realized he hadn't made the points he wanted to and was running out of pages.  But it was mostly readable, except for the biological science parts, which I found just beyond silly.I usually leave synopses to others, but I will say this starts out promisingly with an intriguing premise (you wake up to discover you remember nothing, but that you still have some very well defined skills).  The protagonist quickly gathers a rag-tag crew, gets a spaceship, and rapidly ends up in the center of criminal investigation.I'd recommend Charles Stross' excellent Glass House over this book, since it starts from a remarkably similar premise, and delivers much more in the end.  Meanwhile, this book will pass the time if you're a fan of the author.","3.0 out of 5 stars","December 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R202DVDQ1R7Y0R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1497643961#wasThisHelpful","R202DVDQ1R7Y0R","A3GRPS2NYINLX4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3GRPS2NYINLX4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The only reason you might want to purchase this game is to experience how truly awful it is.The ... um ... concept of Concept is related to all those fun games where you have to use verbal ingenuity to define words without actually saying the word you're thinking of.  In this case, you have to try and define words without saying anything at all and instead pointing to pictures on a big board.  There are about 100 pictures to choose from.  The game uses a series of color-coded blocks to allow the expression of several different ideas at the same time.  The initial question is posed using the green question mark and up to five little green cubes.  Then subordinate clauses (if any) are constructed using the exclamation marks and more little colored cubes.Armed with this information, gleaned from the sub-standard and ill-thought-out instructions, I assembled four smart people over the age of 10 (the minimum number of players required for this game), added an appropriate amount of wine for the adults and sugary beverages for the rest of us, and tried to explain the rules and the scoring.  Having read the instructions aloud and then passed them around for review, we were all left with the same burning question: huh?The crux of our problem is this: what is the incentive for a player to play?  Let's say we split into teams and it's my team against your team.  My team will try to come up with a creative way of explaining a concept using the picture board.  Your team's goal is to try and guess the concept in exchange for light bulbs (the person with the most light bulbs at the end wins).  This immediately creates three huge issues:1, What defines the ""end""?  I guess you could say the game's over after a certain amount of time...2, What is the incentive for the people putting together the concept definition?  They don't get any light bulbs or points whether they do a good job or a poor job.  If they do a poor job, no-one guesses and the game just gets bogged down.  If they do a great job, the game keeps moving but that effort is not rewarded in any way.3, The guessing team actually ends up competing with each other as two light bulbs go to the person who actually makes the correct guess, whilst all other team members get just one light bulb.  Since light bulbs are essentially handed out for every turn that is taken, we ended up with a draw between players on opposing teams, and it would be perfectly possible for all participants to be ""the winner.""We looked at the rules to see if they would shed any additional light on these issues.  We found instead a little note that says something along the lines of, ""after extensive testing we determined that the game was more fun without scoring!""  Except it isn't.  And you don't even have to take my word for it: a quick sample of the top ten suspiciously positive reviews of this game reveal that everyone abandons the scoring system sooner or later...  The reality is that the pictures are too limited to make this anything other than a fancy guessing game.  That would actually be fine if the scoring system worked well, or somehow rewarded the people creating the concepts rather than the ones doing random guessing, but it doesn't.The most fun thing about this game was when we gave up at the end and tried to figure out what would be more fun than playing this game.  Here are some samples of things that we thought might be more fun than this game:1) Any other game, including playing Frogger ... with real traffic2) Elective dental procedures without anaesthetic (""at least you'll be able to smile afterwards!"").3) Watching any movie, even ""The Room.""4) Frontal lobotomy (although, to be fair, this one was debated for a few minutes).There are so many great games out there.  Don't waste your time or money on this one. Recommended alternatives include Taboo, Pictionary, Labyrinth, Apples to Apples, Cards Against Humanity, or any other game ever made.","1.0 out of 5 stars","October 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1YUH1R8S9RJ0O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IDB6J0S#wasThisHelpful","R1YUH1R8S9RJ0O","A3GRPS2NYINLX4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3GRPS2NYINLX4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm really enjoying this tale.  Yes, it's a little predictable and various plot points have been telegraphed from at least fifty pages away, but there are plenty of things to enjoy.  The plotting is sufficiently interesting to hold my attention.  The characters are more interesting than Karpyshyn's standard Star Wars Good Guys and Bad Guys, although the Bad Guys are still pretty bad - it would have been nice if they'd had a bit more nuance.  The writing style is unobtrusive and not noticeably good, bad, or strained.I hadn't read the first book but the story is accessible enough that I didn't feel like I missed too much.Briefly, a small gang of five characters has been flung together and, guided only by a flimsy ever-changing prophecy, are attempting to collect various talismans to fight the forces of Evil, who are attempting to take over the world.It's probably exactly what you're expecting to read, but nonetheless entertaining and engaging.

"I'm really torn by this book.  I fervently believe that family dinners are important, something that was pounded into me as a child, even as my Mum perfected the art of putting four different dishes on the table simultaneously (whilst holding down a full-time job).  No, I don't know how she managed either.This book starts off as a painfully aware self-help book.  It even contains a page entitled ""In case you are flipping through this book and saying to yourself, ""Suckers, who's going to buy this gimmicky self-help book?""  It's filled with underlinings and circles and checks and arrows that attempt to draw your attention to key parts of the book, but only succeed in distracting you.  After a significant number of pages proselytising, the book suddenly starts to get useful with instructions on how to make a meal plan.Then we get to the recipes.  These are variations on the '30 minute quick healthy meals' with a few bonus more involved meals thrown in for good measure.  There's a lot of kale, but not a lot of red meat.  The attraction is that all the meals are rated kid-friendly by at least a few kids but don't appear to be too bland.  Some of those recipes are simple: baked potatoes, for example.  Some are a little more interesting: chicken in a creamy mustard sauce is a winner.And here's what it boils down to: if I take away even a couple of these recipes and add them to my repertoire, it's a success.  I could look up a new recipe on the internet every night and try that, but I'm more likely to flick through this collection of recipes and try a few of them instead.  This isn't a great cookbook, but it has something to offer those of us who have got a little stuck in a rut.If you can look past the annoying style and preachy voice, you'll get to some solid recipes.  If the author ever makes a second edition and fixes some of the formatting and digs up a few more interesting recipes, I'd recommend it more easily.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ECSGPJOGBW79/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0345549805#wasThisHelpful","R2ECSGPJOGBW79","A3GRPS2NYINLX4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3GRPS2NYINLX4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have never owned a Tempur-pedic pillow, but I have owned a variety of other memory foam, latex foam, down, feather, and polyester fiberfill pillows in my quest for the perfect pillow for a broad-shouldered side-sleeper.  This one is definitely not a keeper.It is a fairly lightweight pillow, which at first I ascribed to the fact that there are ventilation holes in the pillow.  Those holes are considered de rigueur for memory foam pillows/mattresses at the moment, since they're supposed to make the pillows cooler.  Unfortunately, sleeping on this pillow is like resting one's head on a short pile of hot bricks.Despite the holes, the pillow gets very warm very quickly.  There are various gels, cooling covers and other ways to prevent this - I'd never realized why it was so important until I tried this pillow.  The lightweight nature of the pillow stems from the fact that this foam is pretty unyielding.  A good memory foam should have a higher density and be more elastic/yielding, but that tends to be a bit more expensive.  This pillow isn't that cheap, but it really feels like it is.One other note: if/when you buy a memory foam pillow or mattress, be aware that they absorb moisture quite effectively.  It's worth putting a waterproof barrier around the pillow or mattress.  Often these will also offer some protection against today's most popular scourge: the bedbug.","2.0 out of 5 stars","August 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2TCWFANS6O2MH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00I9WNTCW#wasThisHelpful","R2TCWFANS6O2MH","A3GRPS2NYINLX4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3GRPS2NYINLX4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I mostly enjoyed this collection of short stories, even though I've never heard of the author or his most famous set of characters (a set of semi-supernatural defenders of humanity, all with the family name Drood).I won't bother with a synopsis of all 17 stories - part of the joy of books like this is not knowing exactly what's about to come next.  The first ten or so stories are new and the last few are stories the author wrote when he was first starting out.What I will say is that this book is written with a uniquely British voice: it's breezy, a little colloquial and refreshingly blunt.  The stories are not immersive, but very few short stories are.  These are not exactly hard SF, deep space stories - instead they tend to ask questions about what's really going on in the world that we can see, and the one we can't.There's a short afterword after each story to explain the circumstances under which it was written, and these really start to shed some light on the things that changed and the ones that didn't over the author's career.This collection is entertaining, imaginative, and fun.

"First there was Bic pens for women and it was hilarious.  We laughed.  We cried.  And about half of the population felt a little bit left out.  Fortunately, my prayers have been answered.  Proctor & Gamble have clearly decided to redress the balance with dryer sheets than can only be described as heaven-scent.  How did I live my life without these?  Specifically, how did I get through so many years without knowing that ""As a result of the friction between fibers, electrons are transferred across surfaces, resulting in a static charge and that annoying high-pitched sound when you touch them.""  I'm not sure exactly what high-pitched sound is being referred to, other than my significant other's howls of anguish when she discovers that I failed to use this product in the manner for which it was intended.Even though I'm a typical man and would never actually read the instructions, I felt compelled to at least understand how to use a standard dryer sheet that differs only in the added perfume.  According to the strangely over-enthusiastic and sadly under-edited advertising copy, these sheets can be added liberally to your washing machine yet are not safe for your washing machine.  They are not safe for use with a single blouse, but that's OK - I'm a guy; I don't own a single blouse.  And if I did, I certainly wouldn't want it to smell like a man.  Further concern furrowed my ridged brow when I realized that I cannot use this product with my underroos, since it may cause them to actually catch fire whenever my significant other tries to ""permanently dispose"" of them.As I reflect further on this product, silently and stoically, I realize this product's perfection is probably wasted on me:  I do actually rely on a little static cling to supplement my natural animal magnetism.  Furthermore, I pull most of my garments out of the dryer slightly damp to avoid shrinkage (mostly because I like my clothing as baggy as possible; it's hard to be manly in overly tight trousers, unless you're the Incredible Hulk and thus so manly that you explode out of your overly tight trousers or your Hulk underroos), so this product isn't actually very useful for me.  However, I may still buy this product, safe in my manliness, if only to ensure that somewhere, somehow, I can help whoever wrote this winning copy continue with their dream of pursuing a PhD in English Literature without having to resort to doing an MBA afterwards.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3BGIVTJME52S7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00J4GTA7A#wasThisHelpful","R3BGIVTJME52S7","A3GRPS2NYINLX4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3GRPS2NYINLX4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I spent a long time looking for a great watch.  This isn't really it, but it has stopped me looking for a great watch anymore.  I needed a work-suitable replacement for my Luminox diver's watch.  Although this one isn't waterproof, it does feature the same tritium tubes, a Swiss quartz (battery-powered) movement and it's all wrapped up in a simple, elegant package.  I love the highly visible red second hand and the look is quite distinctive - many recognize it as the Swiss Train watch.  The leather strap is quite comfortable.  It's definitely not the best strap, but it's definitely better than most cheap watch straps.However, it's not perfect.  The tritium tubes are a bit dim - they only last 20 years or so and this may be five year old stock.  The most annoying thing about  the watch is also its best feature: the relatively huge date.  In order to get the date to be so large, two wheels are needed: one for the tens (0,1,2,3) and one for the ordinals (0 - 9).  This means that after you get to the 31st of the month, comes the 32nd, 33rd, and so on until the 39th, then 00.  It means that every month you have to manually set the date.  As you can tell, that's not really a big deal in exchange for such a readable display, but it was a bit of a surprise.  Also, the watch is not very waterproof.  It's not worth risking swimming or even showering with it.  You'll rot the strap and probably end up regretting it.  It will withstand sweat and hiking near waterfalls, etc.Overall, I'm really happy with the watch.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R141778A28B1KX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003ESY286#wasThisHelpful","R141778A28B1KX","A3GRPS2NYINLX4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3GRPS2NYINLX4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Some manage poignancy.So why only three and not quite a half stars?  Well, I don't really know who most of the people are.  That wouldn't matter if the book really were written as if the food and/or location is the most important star of each story, but it isn't.  The editing is clearly good, but there's still lots of variability on display.  I particularly enjoyed Curtis Stone's story, but not all of them are so gripping.I can't decide if I would have preferred shorter stories, more about the locations, longer stories, more of an introduction to the authors, or just a different book entirely.  However, for people who are in the mood for reasonably engaging reminiscences that tend to dwell on the importance of food and/or travel, this is probably worth a look.","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1PC3A0EZIM1ZE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1743218443#wasThisHelpful","R1PC3A0EZIM1ZE","A3GRPS2NYINLX4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3GRPS2NYINLX4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I just got back from a 9 day trip to Siem Reap/Ankor Wat.  This guidebook was excellent for that area.  I particularly liked the small size and light weight, the good maps, and the good suggestions for activities that are a little further afield.  The temples section is really quite good, including just enough points of interest and things to look for.  It helped me get more out of my trip than just going from temple to temple.So why only 4 stars?  Well, there are a number of reasons:1, The temples section could be organized more intuitively - it was hard to relate the order of the temples to what I was actually visiting.  Also, one or two good temples are not included yet one disappointing pool is (although I guess it's a bit different from all the temples...).2, The restaurants section is already a bit outdated.  While the recommendations are generally solid, there are some really good new alternatives if you're prepared to venture beyond Pub Street.3, The trip backgrounder was fine, but missed a few key items, including but not limited to: flashlights, bandana/face masks, the use of US dollars as the main currency (even the locals use them), bike or motorcycle rentals.I only wish I had found a similar book for Phnom Penh!","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 10, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RERUBRDDH1JF2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1741797209#wasThisHelpful","RERUBRDDH1JF2","A3GRPS2NYINLX4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3GRPS2NYINLX4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There are 64 stories nestled in these 272 pages, equivalent to about 4 pages per story.  Some are longer, but many are shorter, with a few being only a few words long.  This, then, is a collection of short, short stories.  There are no sub-plots.  There's very little characterization.  This is a book about ideas.  Often the ideas are quite smart, but sometimes they are not.If you can get past that stylistic quirk, you'll find a collection of humorous ideas that are played out quite well.  The language is often quite coarse, especially at the beginning of the book, but that doesn't detract from the wit on display.It's hard to give much more information: there's no plot as such, although several of the stories are interconnected in amusing ways.  The best I can do is compare BJ Novak's debut work favorably to another similar book: Demetri Martin's ""This is a book.""  I thought both were similarly funny and follow a similar short, short format.  While Martin's book is more visual, Novak's book is a bit more literary.In the end, I will recommend (and lend) this book to friends, and I'll want it back when they're finished.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 10, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R270504F11FD3E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385351836#wasThisHelpful","R270504F11FD3E","A3GRPS2NYINLX4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3GRPS2NYINLX4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I try not to give three star reviews - I'd rather adopt a clear position.  So why have I given this book three stars?  Because I really wanted to like it, but I just didn't.  It's not a bad novel, and I will probably continue to follow this author in the future, but I can't recommend this novel.Briefly, this is a story that explores class relationships in a future society, specifically the relationship between lower and upper class Westerners and lower-middle class Asians.  There isn't much science behind this fiction - it's definitely more soft SF than hard.  It is written by a Princeton writing professor who clearly believes that science fiction needs more pretentiousness in its writing.  The story starts awkwardly, settles into a nice enough rhythm in which we follow the eventful life of an uneventful character, and ends somewhat unexpectedly.Once I got into it, it held my attention, but I was ultimately disappointed, especially with the lack of character development and the unimportance of the near future setting.  It did have some of the whimsical feel of Murakami, and I'd recommend The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle or Kafka on the Shore.  It also had some of the depth of Nicola Griffith's early work (Ammonite, Slow River).  I would recommend any of those works over this one.If you found this review unhelpful, please leave a comment to help me understand why.  I didn't want to give away too much of the plot but I'm happy to give more details if that would be helpful.","3.0 out of 5 stars","December 1, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RIE4XDPVVRARH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1594486107#wasThisHelpful","RIE4XDPVVRARH","A3GRPS2NYINLX4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3GRPS2NYINLX4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I actually met the author of this book and I told him the same thing: this is not the idiot's guide to dating, nor is it really the geek's guide.  Instead, I think it's more of a male computer game player's guide to re-entering real life.That doesn't mean it doesn't have a fair amount of useful advice.From the eight-bit graphics to the gratuitous video game references, this is a very accessible and breezy guide to everything from identifying a person of interest, asking that person out, dressing appropriately for the date, going on the date, and handling the post-date expectations.  It does have a lot of useful non-intuitive advice that is particularly useful if you're 16 - 26 years old and male.The author includes a note saying that this guide could be useful to women, but it really is written from a male perspective for (straight) men.  I guess it could be a useful insight into straight male dating norms for other potential readers, but that clearly wasn't the main audience for this book.The other issue is that, unsurprisingly perhaps, there is no definitive guide for creating a couple, and this guide is even more generic than others.  If you use these tips to prepare for a date with a woman in her 30s, you're unlikely to learn much new.However, if you are a male gamer targeting less nerdy co-eds, or you're looking for a fun gift to get for one, this is worth a look.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 1, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2D6OKTHILPRMF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1594746435#wasThisHelpful","R2D6OKTHILPRMF","A3GRPS2NYINLX4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3GRPS2NYINLX4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This set is very hit or miss, and needs to be reviewed piece-by-piece:1) Bag - nicely built nylon bag with mesh pockets to allow the gear to dry out; single off-set shoulder strap doesn't have or need a lot of padding2) Fins - universal fins will definitely fit anyone who can use the mask; probably good for kids from 14 years onwards3) Snorkel - so much better than a tube, this one has drainage valves to allow easy emptying and a wave-stopping valve to stop water coming in from the top.  It's a little disconcerting to find you suddenly can't breathe if a wave triggers the wave-stopping valve.  However, once you get used to it, it does seem to work for me.4) Mask - the critical part of any of these packages was pretty disappointing for me.  Visibility is good, but fit was awful for me.  There is plenty of room in the nose for those of us with bigger noses, which is good news.  However, this mask will only be comfortable if you have a flat/broad face.  If your face is long and narrow like mine, you will find the mask hits you right between the eyebrows, becoming extremely uncomfortable within a minute.  The only way to fix this issue would be have a larger silicon gasket, which is not available.  The glass lenses are high quality and distortion-free but fog up quickly (easy to fix: just spit on or lick the lenses before use; it's glass so you could also use an anti-fog solution without fear of scratching the lenses, unlike plastic).  I could get a seal, but not without considerable pain, which increased with dive depth, becoming unbearable at 6 feet depth (2 yrds/2 meters).If you can't test the fit of this set before you buy, be aware that the mask is the big area of concern if you have a narrow face.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 17, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R37LJDQ2OM9R5T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BUMDW3E#wasThisHelpful","R37LJDQ2OM9R5T","A3GRPS2NYINLX4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3GRPS2NYINLX4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The main protagonist in this engaging tale is 15 years old, and I think this book would appeal to anyone over the age of 14 who enjoys mild fantasy.  I say mild fantasy because it has magical elements, but doesn't read like it was lost in the mists of distant time.  There aren't 10 pages of Elvish poetry.  Instead, it's a very readable adventure in which a young girl grows up very quickly.Without giving away more than the back page, the pacing is generally very good, the story covers a lot of ground yet takes the time to explore the character's emotions.  It's sometimes a little simplistic and clumsy, especially in trying to convey some of the romantic pieces.  I also have some quibbles with the things that just seem to happen by chance - some seem awfully improbable.But these are minor quibbles.  I'll definitely be in line to read the sequel and I look forward to continued character development.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 24, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1JX0XZ0YRGH0N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0756407591#wasThisHelpful","R1JX0XZ0YRGH0N","A3GRPS2NYINLX4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3GRPS2NYINLX4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Nanoblocks are a small Japanese building block that, on the surface, look like a miniature version of Lego. This review will note the major differences first, then talk about this specific model: A Dutch Windmill.Differences between Lego:1) Size - most obvious perhaps, but these things are tiny. They're about the same proportions as Lego, but each dimension is roughly half what you'd expect. That doesn't sound like a big change, but it means that each brick is about 1/8th to 1/10th the volume of a traditional lego brick. This makes these sets small and fiddly. Nanoblocks do not interact with Lego in any way - these are 100% NOT compatible.2) Diversity - there's lots of different colors but very few different types of piece, in contrast to Lego, which has a somewhat limited color palette (much less so these days) but many more types of piece. Lego includes slopes, smooth pieces, and many different types of hinge. Nanoblock sets really only include basic building blocks, with very few hinges or pieces that allow rotation.  The issue of how to get a rotating windmill blade mounted without using any rotating pieces is the main point of interest in this set.3) Quality of instructions - all Nanoblock sets come with minimal instructions. For most sets that I've built, it's just one sheet. For those familiar with Lego's outstanding step-by-step piece-by-piece instructions, this will come as a bit of shock. For those who are used to building plastic model cars, it won't be quite so much of a transition.Dutch windmillThe finished set is a bit delicate, especially the blades, and quite well designed.  However, it's quite uninteresting and there isn't a lot of long-term playability.  The blades are mounted by using a long stack of circular bricks to create an axle.  However, the axle isn't secured by anything, which is fine since the model is really only for static display.I think this set is ideal for an adult who really enjoyed a trip to the Netherlands, or a 7 - 11 year old child who likes model landscapes and has (or wants to develop) a fair amount of patience. This set is one of the easier ones to put together but still took this adult 2 - 3 hours. For a similar price/theme, the Space Shuttle Nanoblock set is more fun, more challenging to build and offers more long-term playability, although it's still delicate.If this review was not useful, please let me know how it can be improved in the comments section.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 23, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1V1T80LW66HVI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CQDGWLK#wasThisHelpful","R1V1T80LW66HVI","A3GRPS2NYINLX4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3GRPS2NYINLX4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've been using electrical implements to clean my teeth since I had braces 20 years ago.  I started with an oral-B rotary brush and have been using a sonicare for the last 3 years or so.  I started flossing about 10 years ago, after an ordeal at the hands of a particularly sadistic dentist (who I would thank profusely and happily treat to a great dinner - she spared me a great deal of subsequent oral health issues!).I provide that background so that you know where I'm coming from when I got this electric ""flosser.""  I've put quotes around it because it's really a compressed air gun that aims to replace one of the two functions of floss, without actually using any floss:1) Stimulating gums to prevent inflammation2) Removing food particles/bacterial build-up (plaque) from between teethIn my hands, this gizmo only really seems to perform the first of these functions.It's about twice as fat as a standard current model sonicare toothbrush.  (Note that it does use exactly the same charger as a standard current model sonicare toothbrush.)  There's a small reservoir that can be filled with water or mouthwash.  It's pretty messy to fill, since it's hard to judge when it's full enough, and the reservoir is so small it really only lasts for a day.  I fill it with water over the sink.  I imagine it would be a real waste of mouthwash.You can change tips if there's more than one user, but I don't think the tip is really consumable (unlike a toothbrush).  I'll update if it becomes apparent that it is.  So, with the reservoir filled and the tip in your mouth, you're ready to start squirting.  Where do you squirt?  Well, this is pretty critical.  Basically, you want to aim between two teeth at the gumline.  Flossing really benefits gum health and that is the function that this squirter is supposed to replicate.  Most people who floss also do it to remove food particles, and this device isn't as good as floss for that function.So, who would benefit?  Well, if you need a portable waterpik-style irrigator OR you have braces, this is the device for you!  It's well-designed, holds a good charge, and is satisfying to use.  Although I've only been using it for a week, it's now part of my standard routine and I really enjoy using it.  It's caused my gums to bleed a little (which I take as a good sign) and it's reduced the effort required for me to floss, plus my gums look a little better.  But I do still floss after I use this gizmo because I don't think it's quite as good as floss at removing food particles.  So now I brush, use this gizmo, and then floss!  Why bother?  Well, I think it's a little better at stimulating my gums and reducing inflammation than brushing/flossing alone.  Time will tell, and I'll edit this review as appropriate.Will it replace flossing?  I don't think it does.  I think you have to use it just right to see much of a benefit and, as others have mentioned, even after brushing and using this gizmo, I still sometimes find food particles on my floss (but much less than before).  It's a bit wet and messy, and it does add a little extra time to the evening routine, but I think it's making my mouth cleaner and I think it's a great/fun way of introducing kids/people with braces to the joys of interdental cleaning!I wasn't expecting to like this gizmo as much as I do, so even though I don't think it will ever replace floss for me, I still think it's worth at least four stars.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 7, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RCXTWXU7S8996/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CUG270S#wasThisHelpful","RCXTWXU7S8996","A3GRPS2NYINLX4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3GRPS2NYINLX4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The fuselage narrows at the rear in a particularly clever way, and the tail section is definitely the most interesting part of this model.  The jet is attached to its stand by a universal joint, allowing it to be displayed at almost any angle, although the looseness of the piece means that it will probably adopt its own configuration sooner or later.  The colors of the set are good (note that dark grey is not the same as black - the only truly black pieces are used for the stand) and it displays nicely when finished, but the set will have limited playability: it has no wheels for landing and is a bit delicate.I think this set is ideal for a 7 - 11 year old child who has (or wants to develop) a fair amount of patience.

"This book is somewhat engaging and a very quick read.  Unfortunately, I can't help feeling that the material in it is really only worth a newspaper article (or a review!) at most.  So, here's what I learned (which you can learn from the author's website without buying the book):1) There are five flirting styles that the author has identified (although his definitions are neither mutually exclusive nor collectively exhaustive, but they're fine): Physical, Playful, Polite, Traditional, Sincere2) The author believes that most people exhibit just one or two of these styles and that this explains why some folks mesh and others don't.So what, then?  Well, I don't want to bash the book too hard, because I learned at least one interesting snippet.  For instance, folks who go to a bar meet someone interesting around 10% of the time, but if you break that down by flirting style, you find that physical flirts reporting meeting someone interesting about 25% of the time.  Does this explain why those of us with other ""flirting styles"" are even less successful at bars?  Maybe.  Is it useful?  Perhaps.  But, and here's the crucial question, do I believe the author?  Um, yes and no.I don't really buy into the idea that folks have just one or two ""styles"" because I see bits of myself in all of them.  If you take the on-line questionnaire, you'll find it forces you into one or two ""styles"" but that's just a poorly designed questionnaire, not proof of accuracy.My title for this review was ""book teases but doesn't please"" and yet I've told you very little other than that I disagree with the central hypothesis of this book.  I had hoped to learn something more but was left with something between disappointment and irritation.  It seems pretty clear the author did some research that was enough to get him a PhD (oh, how things have changed!) and he felt like he could make some money on the side.  Well, sadly, I don't think there's really enough here for a book (or a degree, for that matter, but I clearly wasn't on his examining board!).  Ultimately I didn't learn enough new things to make purchasing the book worthwhile.

"I guess it was my fault for expecting a product like this would solve all my problems.It is a couple of 1-inch thick foam pads, held together by a piece of thick, flexible plastic, with two carry handles sticking out from the sides.  There's a set of holes in the front 'half' of the seat, which go all the way through.OK, good parts first: there are no stray threads and the foam is satisfyingly dense.  The holes don't have any loose bits around them.  In general this feels like it would last.  The solid (hole-less) back 'half' of the seat is firmer than the section that has holes.  If you sit on that bit, your legs will feel a little less pressure, so the holes do relieve that a bit - I guess just because there's less material to sit upon.Now for the bad bits: the smell is awful, like really cheap new car smell.  I aired the product out for a few days but still can't really stand to sit on it.  When I did spend the day sitting on it, it was initially quite comfortable, but quickly became uncomfortable and left me with more back pain at the end of the day than I have without it!  Add to that that the material makes you sweat and that the thick, flexible plastic 'hinge' isn't really hinged and doesn't seem like it would hold up, and top it off with the weight (it's surprisingly heavy), and I'll pass.I guess if you're looking for a foam pad to sit on, you could do worse, but I found it less comfortable and worse for my back over the course of four or five hours than not having it.UPDATE:I left this in the office for others to try.  After four weeks, no-one has taken up the option of using this foam cushion full-time.","2.0 out of 5 stars","August 29, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZXAC34EAJJRH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BLQG6D2#wasThisHelpful","RZXAC34EAJJRH","A3GRPS2NYINLX4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3GRPS2NYINLX4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I get the feeling that, when it comes to dishes, people are either sponge people or brush people.I am the kind of person who cleans dishes with a brush.  I appreciate the reach that the handle gives me, allowing me to keep my hands far from the dirty dish, or to reach all the way to the bottom of a tall glass.  I find firm bristles allow me to attack stuck-on dirt. However, there are definitely sponge people.  They believe that a sudsy sponge is the only way to distribute soap to every part of the dirty dish, and they like the idea that they can scrub dirt away.Like the scouring pad before it, this is a hybrid.  While the scouring pad is effectively a bristly sponge, this item is a spongy brush. It's got a nicely weighted wooden handle, and lots of bits of cut-up sponge on the head.  I'm not sure it's really all that ecological but it's much better for removing lipstick from wine glasses than my brush.I'm not really sold on it, but I'd recommend it to all my sponge-loving friends - it's definitely better than a regular sponge.  However, it won't convert me from my favored bristles.  I'll update this review with longevity information eventually.

"I've owned a couple of Lowepro camera bags and they always have surprisingly good hidden features.  The general build quality is high and I know from experience that they generally use materials that last.Here are the features of this particular bag:1) Single shoulder strap - not just less dorky than a double strapped backpack, the real advantage of this system is that you can move the drop the bag from your back to your side without removing it, by rotating the bag across your body.  This is only useful because one of the two ways of accessing the bag is a side-mounted pocket that's perfect for a mid-sized camera body and medium lens.  If you need additional support, there is a hidden strap on the right side that plugs into the single shoulder strap about half-way up.  I thought this would create a waist strap, but instead it gives you a very strange triangular attachment that leaves all the weight of the pack on a single (right) shoulder but prevents excessive lateral movement.2) Waterproof cover - one of the major selling points of any Lowepro bag, this is a little poncho for your bag that stores in a pocket in the base of the pack.  If you're caught in a sudden downpour, it's convenient enough to pull out and cover the bag within a few seconds.3) Tripod carrying system - a fixed loop, an adjustable loop, and a pocket that drops out of another hidden pocket conspire to give you a way of carrying any reasonably compact (max 15 inch collapsed height) tripod.4) Internally re-configurable - lots of velcro separators and a clever panel that's the width of the pack but contains a lens shaped cut-out means you should be able to accommodate some combination of a small-bodied SLR-type camera with a lens attached and a couple of other lenses OR a full-sized SLR with a zoom lens that protrudes 8 inches from the body.  The maximum internal dimensions of this padded pack are: 14 x 8 x 4 inches, although the shape of the pack means if your lens is longer than 8 - 9 inches and you want it stay on your camera you probably need a bigger bag.5) Extra pockets - a tablet/document pocket right next to your back (but still well padded), an outside zip pocket for small items, a mesh pocket for lens caps, and an internal zip pocket with a key loop all give you extra flexibility6) Lightness - by any standards this is a lightweight pack - it feels like it weighs about 2 pounds at most.This is great for traveling with your camera for quick access, but only if you're carrying your camera as a carry-on on an airplane - I wouldn't trust my camera to the luggage hold in this bag.  It's great, but it's not indestructible...","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 24, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1LDIIMA8Q3KYU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00D96LZ6K#wasThisHelpful","R1LDIIMA8Q3KYU","A3GRPS2NYINLX4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3GRPS2NYINLX4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Reviewer copies of this book (similar to those provided by the Vine program) advertise this book as being the first of up to 7, to be distributed to at least 18 countries, and the film rights have been optioned by none other than Gollum (Andy Serkis from Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit).  That's a lot of hype for a first-time author entering a crowded space.Despite the horribly mis-leading title, this is neither fantasy or overly gory.  It's also not really science fiction.  Let's call it speculative fiction, set 40 years in the future in an alternate universe involving some ""aliens"" and a fascist government that's very reminiscent of ""1984"" or ""V for Vendetta.""It turns out that the easiest way to categorize this book is what it reminds you of.  Contrary to all the reports that this is completely new, etc, it's actually more than a little reminiscent of ""1984,"" ""The Matrix,"" and Phillip Pullman's ""His Dark Materials"" trilogy.  No, not the awful movie version, but rather the excellent books, that I still recommend highly.  In fact, with its Oxford setting, emphasis on a parallel spirit world, and stratification of society by something mystical, this book reminds me of that series in all the right ways.I don't want to ruin the book for you with a plot synopsis.  If you like hard sci-fi, space opera, or swords & dragons fantasy, this might not be for you.  If you enjoy speculative fiction, character-driven stories, and just enough of a twist on reality to keep things interesting, I recommend this book.  It definitely caught my interest and it's been hard to put down.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 8, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2HI9X2NCV3P6G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1620401398#wasThisHelpful","R2HI9X2NCV3P6G","A3GRPS2NYINLX4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3GRPS2NYINLX4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've read most of this book now.  I find it thought-provoking, but extremely annoying.The book is basically a written version of a course that the author teaches at a university to make economics more accessible to her students.  It must be a *really* basic economics course; I never took an economics course and I haven't come across anything new yet.  I think the content would work quite well as a series of entertaining lectures.However, as a book it falls flat.  Lots of ""studies"" are peppered throughout the text, but the reader never has any idea how reliable the studies might be - were 10 people studied, or 10,000?  Given some of the claims that are made, I would like to have more information to evaluate the evidence.  How many contrary studies were ignored?  Quite a few, I imagine.If you do take everything at face value, prepare for a very warped view of dating and sex.  Much of the book is grounded in sexism, on the assumption that sexism has been practiced by society for millenia.  Ok, but that doesn't mean that all men are going to enslave all women.  It also doesn't mean that all women are servile.  I understand that I haven't read as many studies as the author, but I couldn't help but feel that I was getting a profoundly one-sided view of the world of sex and dating.As well as appearing biased, the arguments are also hard to string together.  By page 160, I'm still not sure what the point of the book is.  Is it to make all men feel dreadful?  Is it to make all women feel like they can't hope for a happy partnership and must choose security or loneliness?I'm hoping the end of the book will make the rest make sense, but I'm not sure I can bear to finish it.  I'd much rather be having a drink with someone lovely.  Perhaps the author will feel similarly, and not write a sequel...","2.0 out of 5 stars","July 21, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R23VT7B3KLIV51/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1452109222#wasThisHelpful","R23VT7B3KLIV51","A3GRPS2NYINLX4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3GRPS2NYINLX4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've used an electric toothbrush for 20 years.  For the first 15 years, I was a fan of the Oral-B Braun electric toothbrushes with a rotary head.  I really liked the cleaning power and the reach/accessibility that the small, round brush gave me.However, Oral-B lost its competitive advantage some time ago.  My teeth and gums feel cleaner with Sonicare.  I really like the battery life yet lightness of the handle.  The brush is even quieter...  The only issue I've ever had with the brushes is that I don't have quite as much accessibility to the back of my mouth as I had with the Oral-B Braun brushes.To fix that I've relied on the compact brush heads that are available for Sonicare.  This new brush head is the same size as the full size brush head, but has bristles at different heights.  At first I was tempted to dismiss this as just another gimmick.  I've tried the ""diamond head"" brushes and found them to be only marginally better than the regular brush heads; they seem to last a little longer.  But these are different: this brush head gives me the size of a regular brush with the reach/access of a smaller brush head - I can finally get back behind my rear-most teeth because of the shorter bristles.  My teeth feel really clean now.So I would definitely buy these again, as long as the price is similar to the regular/compact brush heads.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 21, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1AR89P5KN2IUH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CUG26ZE#wasThisHelpful","R1AR89P5KN2IUH","A3GRPS2NYINLX4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3GRPS2NYINLX4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I only have a relatively small apartment, but the configuration means my bedroom internet radio receives an intermittent signal.  I thought a range extender like this one would solve my problems, so I requested one through the Vine program (ie, it was sent to me for free).This product arrives in pretty good packaging.  It's a small box, about 2 inches in each dimension which takes up one plug, even in a double outlet.  There is a single button on the box, and a single LED lamp.  The instructions look simple - plug it in, press a button on your router and press/hold the button on your box and you should be all set.Except that I wasn't.  The configuration failed in its original location.  Following the instructions, I moved the box closer and closer to my router.  Even at a distance of less than 1 foot from my router, the WPS easy push-button set-up didn't work.  Instead, I used the set-up that requires some typing on a computer that will connect to both your router and the box.  That did seem to work.But, and here's the reason I only gave this thing two stars, it didn't appear to improve my internet radio reception.  The issue appears to be a *very weak* radio inside the box.  So, you might get the signal extended by a few feet, but I couldn't see any evidence for signal extension of the 10 feet that I needed.I did give it two stars because the instructions were generally easy to follow and did just about work, in terms of making the little flashing lights flash in the way they said they would.  So it should be working, but I would have had to actually see more evidence of working to give it more than two stars.","2.0 out of 5 stars","June 18, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R31D5Z78VBFR6G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009OZUPUC#wasThisHelpful","R31D5Z78VBFR6G","A3GRPS2NYINLX4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3GRPS2NYINLX4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Second, if you fill it too high (and there is no line to know how high too high is), water runs out of a little hole in the back and directly into the bottom of the pitcher!

"I got this set of gloves for three reasons:1) Color scheme looks pretty good2) It should keep my hands warm3) Metal fingertips for using a smart phoneWell, I'll give it two stars for looking pretty good.  The globes are pretty well made with good attention to detail, especially around the fingers.It all starts to go wrong from there, though.  First, the sizing is a little too snug - I usually take a medium glove, but I should have got a large in these.  Next, as another reviewer noted, these aren't winter gloves.  They're not going to keep your fingers toasty for a day in the cold or snow.  They're better as wind protection on an Autumn day.  Last, the metal fingertips are not nearly as effective as others I've tried.  The metal pieces need to be smaller so that the phone can actually interpret them as a finger.

"This book is remarkably engaging - not quite on the level of a good thriller, but surprisingly close.  It achieves this feat by having a significant number of interesting anecdotes woven into the text.  Crucially, it skirts around the problem of basing too many conclusions on a single anecdote by having good supporting evidence that is reasonably current.  The book appears to date from Q1 2011, and contains a lot of tables that include 2010 as the final year.  It was good to see a chapter on expected US Healthcare reform impact, even if it was very short (3 pages).The book is divided up into lots of sub-sections, like most textbook-type volumes in this series.  The first few sections set the stage.  The book starts with an excellent discussion of the pharmaceutical business environment.  It is succinct and highlights all the major issues in a very readable form, although it is a little too focused on the US and EU at the expense of Japan and other Asian markets.  Next, there's an excellent introduction to patents, again very focused on the US but with mentions of situations in the EU and Japan.  There is very little discussion of the patent situation (or lack thereof) in developing markets.The next few sections delve more deeply into Lifecycle management (LCM). This starts with general strategies, which are somewhat obvious from the early part of the book and general knowledge.  Then there is an exploration of personalized medicine (treatments for subsets of the population).  The next few chapters discuss ways to extend the useful life of a drug (reformulation, new dosages, chemical modifications, etc).  All in all a useful section to skim.The next few sections after that get to strategic choices that you can make for a particular product.  The discussion remains readable and pertinent throughout and is useful.  It's a bit like hiring a consultant for a day to discuss options with - the book acts as its own sounding board, bringing up possibilities and then discussing their merits.  There's substantial discussion of how to deal with generics (and biosimilars).  There are 14 pages on ""10 keys to successful lifecycle management"" that appear to be the crux of the book, but they're actually not as useful as the earlier sections and the subsequent one on how LCM integrates into overall portfolio management.The last section is how LCM integrates into overall portfolio management and is also an excellent introduction to this area.  This is followed by a useful set of appendices (case studies/examples) that are useful to refer to when you're trying to make a point.In short, this is a really useful introduction for brand managers and commercial strategy folks within the pharmaceutical industry.  As written, it's accessible to others working in the pharmaceutical space (ie, educated investors, consultants, etc), and it does a great job of explaining things that really aren't visible from outside a pharmaceutical company (or even inside it sometimes...).","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 4, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R25BR9LFNPWM0M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0470487534#wasThisHelpful","R25BR9LFNPWM0M","A3GRPS2NYINLX4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3GRPS2NYINLX4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These Nanoblock sets are superficially quite similar to Lego.  From a distance, this Space Shuttle set looks for all the world like a 25% scale model of the Lego model of a real Space Shuttle.  That scale difference is the most obvious way that these blocks are different from and perhaps more challenging than a typical Lego set.  They're really small pieces, easy to lose even if you're being super-careful.  Fortunately, many spares (ie, more than 50 spare pieces) are included in the set.Like Lego, the little blocks have studs/nobbles and the idea is to lock the studs of one piece into the bottom of the next, so building the blocks without having to stick them together using glue or cement.  Lego pieces stick to each other quite tightly.  These blocks are made with similar levels of precision, but the bottom sides of the pieces are missing some critical structures, which makes it possible for these pieces to slide around on top of each other.  I mention this in particular because it's the second factor that adds to the challenge (and also the frustration) of this set: the blocks won't line themselves up as beautifully as Lego blocks do.  This set needs an even greater eye to detail than a typical Lego set.Another point to note is that the instructions are sufficient, but not detailed.  The base and tower take 8 steps, the boosters require 6 steps, the orbiter and main fuel tank just 3 each.  Several times I had to consult the color scheme on the box and the detailed side view at the bottom of the page to ensure I had the correct fit.  In short, these instructions are more like you'd get with a model car or airplane and less like your typical very detailed Lego (or Ikea) instructions.  I mention this because it's the third factor that adds to the challenge of this set.So: i) smaller piecesii) that fit together less securely and with more wiggle-roomiii) according to instructions that are much less detailed than you might be used toAll these things combine to make Nanoblocks intriguing, challenging, and a little frustrating.  If you're buying this kit for someone over 10 years old who likes to display models, I think these sets are pretty good up to age 70 or so.  This space shuttle in particular is a nice introduction to these sets, and will keep even a good builder occupied for 2 - 3 hours.  I really like some of the lovely touches in this model: the orbiter engines and tail are especially well-done.  The simplicity of the blocks (like Lego used to be, before the pieces became so specialized) means that the designers had to come up with pretty ingenious solutions to getting a triangular arrangement of the engines.  Your mileage may vary, but older folks may struggle with the small size of these pieces, which requires more patience than Lego.If you're looking for a set to co-build with someone, or for a kid/teen who will play with the set, ""fly"" it around, explore strange new worlds (rooms of the house), then buy one of the Lego versions (set 10231 is excellent, or set 3367 is about one-quarter the price and pretty fun, too).  It will be more expensive, but much easier to handle and much more fun to play with after it's been built.Or buy all of them and have the ultimate homage to a really clever spacecraft - still can't believe they actually built these!","3.0 out of 5 stars","December 26, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2XFPBXL6O7IBE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0053T15HK#wasThisHelpful","R2XFPBXL6O7IBE","A3GRPS2NYINLX4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3GRPS2NYINLX4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

It is an excellent set, with two astronauts, a cargo bay with robotic arm and a satellite, retractable landing gear, detachable boosters/main fuel tank, and even a little launch center.The most important thing to note is that this set should be available on Amazon or from Lego directly for a reasonable price (about 10 cents per brick).  If you see it advertised at much more than that (eg, current price as of writing is more lik3 15 - 20 cents per brick), please re-consider your purchase.  If you're a collector and understand what you're paying for, that's one thing.

"There are two views of this product.  The uncharitable view is that it is a glorified overpriced chocolate-covered raisin.  My view is that it's much more than that.First, the chocolate is a generous coating of high quality dark chocolate.  I think they say it's about 65% cocoa solids, which makes sense.  It's not too dark/bitter but it's darker than semi-sweet.  So the chocolate is a bit darker and much thicker than the dark chocolate-covered raisins that you'll find in the grocery store.Next, the raisins are definitely infused with wine.  This does two things: makes them more moist and also imparts a lovely red wine flavor (I think they claim to use a Shiraz).  There's not enough wine to really tell what type of wine they've used, but the flavor is strong enough that it stays with you.  In fact, I ate one before sitting down to compose this review and I can still taste the chocolate and the wine right now.Of course this means that each raisin is substantially larger than a typical chocolate-covered raisin, perhaps four times the volume.Apparently, the vendor has had some issues with shipping during the summer, so it's worth ordering when it's cool out.  Even in December, several of my raisins had stuck together, but separated easily.  They're fine eaten from the fridge, but definitely better when eaten at room temperature.  They appear to store well at room temperature.Last, there are several sizes available: a small bag, 8oz, and 16oz boxes.  The latter is a bit expensive, but comes with about 4 or 5 dozen raisins, plenty for a dinner party/group.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 21, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1U99C75LASPIX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002UMBIL6#wasThisHelpful","R1U99C75LASPIX","A3GRPS2NYINLX4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3GRPS2NYINLX4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a really good book, as other reviewers have commented.  I'm not an architect, but I've read many (biochemistry) text books.  I was drawn to this textbook because of the outstanding illustrations.  They really are impressive and help to visualize exactly whatever the text is discussing.However, it's important to know the limitations of the book.  First, very little of this book is actually original.  The introduction describes that the book is actually a compilation of key chapters by the (prolific) Francis D.K. Ching.  The source books are:1) A global history of architecture - appears to be reproduced in chapters 2 and 3; provides snapshots of architecture every 200 years or so from 2500 BCE to present day.2) Architecture: Form, Space and Order - appears to be the source for chapters 4 (Form), 5 (Space), and 6 (Order)3) Building Codes Illustrated - interspersed and probably forms the basis of chapter 114) Building Construction Illustrated - Chapter 105) Design Drawing - Chapter 86) Interior Design Illustrated - summarized in chapter 147) A Visual Dictionary of Architecture - interspersed8) Language of Space and Form: Generative Terms for Architecture by James EcklerSecond, the font is difficult to read for a long period.  I know that shouldn't be a big deal, but it's not conducive to reading much of the text at a time.Third, the text is kind of obtuse.  The descriptions are not as clear as they could be.  For instance, you might build a building on a hill to make it more prominent.  This book notes that ""elevating a portion of the ground plane establishes a platform or podium that structurally and visually supports the form and mass of a building.""  I realize there's a need to use the appropriate terminology but the best textbooks make that really clear (eg, Immunobiology by Janeway and Travers, another beautifully illustrated book that uses all the right terminology to explain the complexities of the immune system really clearly).However, as other reviewers have noted, the diagrams really make this book excellent.  If you don't already have all of the books mentioned above, this is probably one of the better introductions to an interesting subject for students and the interested general reader alike.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 3, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RET0YHU9DYAO6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1118142063#wasThisHelpful","RET0YHU9DYAO6","A3GRPS2NYINLX4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3GRPS2NYINLX4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

As others have said, there is no belt loop.  In addition, the camera must be fully removed from the case to actually use the screen or any of the rear controls.  These two facts make the case less ideal to actually carry the camera around while it's in use.The case will accommodate the XZ-1 with a lens cap, including the separately available Olympus ""auto-open"" lens cap, although it's a tight fit.

"This review will be in four sections: 1) Why use a screen protector? 2) How good are 3M privacy filters? 3) How well does this product work? 4) Brief conclusionsScreen protectors are really helpful to prevent two big problems with smartphone/kindle/tablet screens.  First, the oleophobic coating (ie, a chemical layer on the very surface of the screen that repels grease from fingers) rubs off within a few months.  Second, even in the softest cotton pocket, the much-vaunted gorilla glass will still get many fine scratches on it.  Neither of these really affects utility, but it will affect ultimate resale value, and I found it annoying after a year.  I've found that applying a screen protector prevents both of these issues without creating additional problems.  In fact, these screens can reduce glare and improve contrast.  Obviously, the sooner you apply the protector, the better.3M does a great job of making privacy filters.  These are thin polarized pieces of plastic that substantially limit the viewing angle of the screen.  If you view confidential information and/or spend a lot of time using your phone on planes, subways or other environments where people's eyes will be on your screen, this really helps.  However, it's worth remembering that privacy screens only work in one dimension.  In this case, when you hold the phone in portrait mode, anyone whose head is more than about a foot away from yours will have real trouble seeing your screen (at a normal distance).  If you hold the phone in landscape mode anyone significantly shorter than you will have trouble seeing your screen, but other folks will be able to see it.  I've used privacy screens from other companies and some of them are not nearly as good as these 3M ones from an optical point of view.  This screen is really clear, with no distracting lines.So, how does this work on the iPhone?  Well, the package is a bit stingy.  It claims to contain 3 items: ONE screen (many competitors come with three or four), 1 lens cloth, and an applicator.  At first, I couldn't find the applicator, until I realized it was the cardboard insert from the top of the packaging.  It will work, but many competitors give you a small piece of plastic.  If you don't have one of these, I'm a fan of using a credit card.  I didn't attempt to use the cardboard.  Like competing filter, this one is applied by cleaning the phone screen with the cloth, partially peeling the protective plastic off the filter, pressing the top portion of the filter in place, and then use the applicator to gently press the filter into place as you continue to peel the protective layer off.  A better description appears on the inside of the package, and there's a website with pictures that can help.  That all having been said, it's not rocket science or brain surgery.I think this is a great product - it's about time someone came out with something like this, but it is a bit pricey.  There are plenty of cheaper protective non-privacy screens that doe a great job, too.  I really like the matte finish ones made by Halo.  They are virtually indestructible.  I do not yet know how long this 3M product will last - it seems like it should last for a while, though.Let me know how this review could be improved.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 4, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1C9K4G90KV2G9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009A5206S#wasThisHelpful","R1C9K4G90KV2G9","A3GRPS2NYINLX4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3GRPS2NYINLX4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I got this book thinking that it might be as good as some of the Annals of Improbable Research (AIR) Ignobel prize round-ups and some of the other outstandingly funny science books that have been written.But no such luck. Instead, it's a fake textbook, split into astronomy, biology, chemistry, earth science, physics, and two other random chapters.  In the interests of scientific method, and in response to some of the other comments that reckoned every page was hilarious, here are excerpts taken at random from every 50 pages:Pg 50: (Astronomy) ""Our universe began about 14 billion years ago, give or take 12 billion.  It's believed that the universe was packed into a hot dense particle the size of a popcorn kernel, but scientists are almost certain there wasn't any butter.""Pg 100: (Biology) ""Moss is a flat plant that covers rocks and land quickly, like slime but soft. New Zealand is covered entirely in this soft, fabric-like plant, which allows its people to travel barefoot wherever they go.""Pg 150: (Chemistry) ""We shall fight them on the beaches, we shall fight on the landing grounds, we shall fight - okay, very funny.  Did someone put helium in my microphone?"" - Winston ChurchillPg 200: (Earth Science) ""The seasons feed into each other in a weather cycle. They are spring, summer, autumn, and winter, and without the variety of seasons we'd have to appreciate the one we're currently in.""Pg 250: (You're a scientist) [annotated diagram of a scientist] ""Shoes are necessary to maintain dignity, but if they are unavailable, you can use some acid to give your feet some healthy calluses.""Fortunately, the book runs out of pages at 270.  If you thought those quotes were even vaguely funny, you should probably buy the book and/or book an operation for a sense of humor bypass.  It's all like that which, to be fair, is exactly what it promises in the product description.There are lavish illustrations throughout, just like a textbook.  In short, my opinion is that this is a one-joke book: textbooks can be incorrect.  It's a pretty reasonable concept for a book, but it just falls so flat that it's not worth the paper it's printed on.  To be even more blunt: I won't be buying any copies, not even for people I don't really like much.UPDATE:I may not like this product, but I am trying to write a helpful review.  If you don't find this review helpful, please tell me why, so that I can address it in the future.  Even if you're the author of the book.","1.0 out of 5 stars","November 4, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3HVHIWHASSJMM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1440527016#wasThisHelpful","R3HVHIWHASSJMM","A3GRPS2NYINLX4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3GRPS2NYINLX4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In the interests of full disclosure, I received this food processor through Amazon's Vine program.  Despite the exterior badging it is a Sunbeam product.  Having had one of their bread machines, I was expecting cheap and cheerful.  This processor does not disappoint: it's really a 3.5 to 4 star machine so far.When it arrived, I concocted an excuse to chop various vegetables and 3 lb of meat into a dumpling filling.  Should be pretty easy for a 500 watt large capacity food processor like this one.Impressions during unboxing: The cord is SHORT - only 2 feet long at it's fullest extent.  This needs to be situated right next to a power outlet.  The round blades (grater and french fry chopper) are made of a reasonable steel that isn't too sharp, except for the cutting surfaces, that are clearly from another kind of steel and bolted on afterwards.  They are sharp, but how long will they stay that way?  Both blades were a little warped, but nothing significant.  All the blades have a single central somewhat soft plastic piece that slides onto the spindle.  The chopper plastic piece already had some scoring, and there was some residue left in the plastic bowl.  It's possible I received a refurbished unit, but it was professionally packaged and I don't think it was a big deal, but it's definitely worth washing every component (except base!) before using it the first time.As far as size goes, the base is pretty large: about the size of a 3 quart pot.  The bowl is similarly large, and the lid is about half that size.  I have room for it in my kitchen, but it's definitely a consideration.The motor unit is large, but not too heavy, with four pretty reasonable rubber suction cups for feet.  The large serrated blade was missing one of the protective sleeves and I almost cut myself taking the blade out of the packaging.  Given how hard I gripped the blade, I'm surprised and not entirely pleased that I didn't draw blood.  The blades measure about 6 inches across, which leaves a quarter inch margin between the furthest edge of the blade and the inside of the bowl.The instruction manual seems fine and is generally pretty clear.  There are odd exceptions: After washing the parts in hot soapy water, I'm instructed to ""rinse them dry.""  All the parts except the base are dishwasher safe.  The unit will NOT ""chop ice, whip cream, beat eggs, grind coffee beans, spices or other items with high oil content, or slice/shred hard-cooked eggs, marshmallows, or soft cheeses.""  The manual doesn't give any indication of how to use the various attachments.  It's not rocket science: the grater looks like a flattened cheese grater.  The french fry disc has perpendicular blades.  The confusing one is the one that looks like a half-grater, half-chopper.  I'm going to assume it's for shredding.General fit and finish is definitely on par with what you'd expect for equipment of this price.  The lid portion is the worst designed element: annoying to clean and kind of clunky.  The seal around the lid on mine was a little wonky, but doesn't seem to affect function.The processor assembles easily and quickly.  The blades have enough power behind them to make short work of carrots, onions, mushrooms, etc.  Some folks have complained that the plastic bowl feels a little flimsy.  I think if you're careful and buying this for weekly/irregular use you'll find it great for large capacity chopping.  If you're going to be dicing celery or doing other challenging things on a daily basis, I think you might want to invest in a more substantial piece of equipment.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 27, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2VTO4V3QJG16T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008UAHQAE#wasThisHelpful","R2VTO4V3QJG16T","A3GRPS2NYINLX4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3GRPS2NYINLX4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've used a couple of different types of screen cleaner and this one is really pretty good.  The pack comes with a generous 7 oz (200 ml) of almost odorless cleaning solution and a really nice cloth.  Switch off the TV/laptop/tablet/whatever and let it cool down.  Two squirts from the bottle onto the cloth and then wipe down the screen.  Fingerprints, dust, and other dirt disappears with very little effort.  The cleaning solution evaporates very quickly, leaving a perfectly glassy screen.In short, this is a nice product.I noticed there's a table in the product description that tells you what kind of screens you can use this product with.  Well, I am quite unconvinced that this product is significantly different from the smaller sizes that are recommended for smaller screens.  In fact, I think the only difference is that they sell you less solution and a smaller cloth for not much less money.  So, there's plenty of this product in the container and I'm pretty sure it'll be good for all your household screens.  I wouldn't use it on oven doors (just use ordinary glass cleaner for that), but I'll be using this product for all my TVs, laptops, digital picture frames, GPS devices, kindles...So why only 4 stars?  Well, if you don't have little ones with wandering hands, you may not need a product like this at all.  My 6 year old flat screen TV (a 26 inch behemoth!) has never been dusted, so I used this product on it.  Although the plastic bezel if filthy, the screen has always been quite clean and this product didn't make a difference.  Plus there was nothing on the cloth when I'd finished.  However, if you know you have a fingerprint, dirt, dust problem, then this product does seem to work.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 24, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R36ECFUCO2DFMV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001FR8POU#wasThisHelpful","R36ECFUCO2DFMV","A3GRPS2NYINLX4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3GRPS2NYINLX4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This product is designed for the iPhone 4 or 4S, the equivalent iPod touch, or some android phones (with screens under 4.3 inches).  It will not fit the latest iPhone 5 or Samsung Galaxy III phones, since they are too big.If your phone doesn't fit, you're not missing all that much.  It's really just a well-constructed plastic steering wheel, which looks like fake carbon fiber.  There are four buttons, two on the front and two on the back.  These are mechanically connected to buttons that will activate a touchscreen phone.  For this reason, the instructions recommend the use of screen protector.  There are no electronics or connectors to worry about.  The phone is held securely, although the locking mechanism is a little clunky.  If you're buying this for a child, they may need some supervision the first time they try to fit it the first time.  Once you get the hang of it, it's relatively straightforward.You have to download the game itself, which seems to work just fine in or out of the holder.  So why buy a piece of plastic so you can play a ""free"" game?  I don't get it.  The game has two problems:1) It's very hampered unless you buy in the in-game extras2) The physics just don't work - there's no way you could execute tight turns at the apparent speedsBut don't take my word for it.

"Physically, this is very appealing: it looks like a large bottle of shampoo or conditioner and comes in a variety of bathroom-matching colors.  Perfect for a bathroom radio!The radio takes two AA batteries, which is not many.  However, installation requires a screwdriver and there is no obvious rubber seal.  My other waterproof radio (a Sony) does not require a screwdriver to change the batteries.Setting the clock is OK - there are a couple of buttons on the bottom that allow the clock to be set (but only moving forward - if you miss the right minute, you'll have to press the button for a while to cycle through the minutes again).Turning on the radio is relatively straightforward.  There is an on-switch and an off-switch, a band selector, and two tuning buttons on one side of the radio.  These 5 buttons look identical to the five buttons on the other side of the radio, which control the pre-sets.  Once you get into the habit, it's easy enough.Ok, now here are my issues:1) Reception was poor, since the antenna is internal not very effective.2) Sound is poor, since the speaker is remarkably tinny.3) There's no sleep function, which means you have to remember to turn it off (and remember which of those 10 buttons, labeled in tiny writing, is the right one).Upshot: I don't use it anymore, and would rather have my Sony - with an external antenna, sleep function, and easily-installed batteries - even though it doesn't match the bathroom decor as nicely.","2.0 out of 5 stars","August 8, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3MPWK74VTM46T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007JR55KC#wasThisHelpful","R3MPWK74VTM46T","A3GRPS2NYINLX4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3GRPS2NYINLX4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a very standard deodorant/anti-perspirant.  It features 20% of the active ingredient (formerly ""prescription strength"" or ""clinical strength""), not the 16% that was standard for so many years.  As a result it is very effective.  The scent is fine.  It's got Aloe and vitamin E in it, so if you have sensitive underarms, this may be a good choice.However, the first few ingredients are waxes and oils, so it goes on white.  I'm not sure how it could ever be construed as an invisible solid.  I don't know for certain, but I would predict it will leave a waxy build-up on clothing over time, like almost every other underarm stick I've tried.I had bought this because Mitchum makes another product (""smart solid"") where the first ingredient is water.  I had assumed this product was the next generation of that one.  No such luck.

"Pre-cut pieces with pre-punched holes sewing crafts are an excellent introduction to needle work. Dimensions NeedleCrafts features a whole line of needlepoint, punch needle, felting and applique projects for the novice and experienced stitcher.With less than 100 stitches - mostly the running stitch, an easy way to learn to embroider - and only 4 tie-offs, the Little Owl Felt Appliqu is perfect for between ages 5-8. The owl's features are sewed together before applying the entire body to the gingham background fabric. This approach eliminates requiring little hands to hold multiple pieces together while sewing. The effect is a clean line on the back (see picture), another important sewing technique that should be taught and mastered young.The Learn & Craft Owl kit combines skills building with pleasing design and aesthetic value while even offering a little bit of fun. A ribbon can be strung through the plastic hoop to hang the creation on a bedroom wall. It's a modern approach to an ancient art form.That blending of old and new in an attractive and easy-to-learn kit earns this craft a solid five stars.

"At the time of my review, this American Girl craft was ""currently unavailable."" That's disappointing, and I hope that Amazon is able to restock this ""Sew & Share"" kit as I found this to be an exceptionally well made, attractive and useful craft. We were so impressed with our original purchase that we bought nine more of these kits. Our children gave the completed sets as holiday gift ornaments to friends and family.American Girl Crafts offer generous and quality supplies for interesting projects at reasonable prices. The entire line features vibrant materials and whimsical designs. Each project comes with a brightly illustrated booklet that reads as both an instruction manual and as a ""rah, rah, you can do it!"" cheer.Hand crafts, particularly sewing, can seem daunting. Needle and thread work requires concentration and control. Pull the needle too tight and your fabric bunches. Thread your work too loosely and the pieces look askew. The individual working areas of this craft are small enough to allow sewing corrections so that the finished look is professional. Your crafter will learn as they go and feel accomplished, too.This project strengthens the fine-motor and attention-to-detail skills required for sewing while producing a useful and beautifully made gift that will make your crafter proud. There's a lot of value in such a small package. Put this American Girl kit on your Wish List. When it comes available, be sure to order one - or more - for your young crafting enthusiast.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1LU7XX7RS7ZA1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00920H89U#wasThisHelpful","R1LU7XX7RS7ZA1","A2ALMW6CSEEFBE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ALMW6CSEEFBE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Just like navigating the waterway itself, there are a variety of ways to explore the many books and stories about this national treasure.A first must read is the richly detailed but highly technical Waterway Guide: Atlantic ICW 2015. After the rough seas of that excursion, sail into calmer waters with Allan Fisher and James Amos's visual and poetic 1973 narrative, America's Inland Waterway. After the practical Guide and the dreamy National Geographic Society paean, Gene and Katie Hamilton offer a breezy travelogue of their 1,243-mile journey.The three works give you vastly different perspectives on the same body of water. The Hamilton's requires the least amount of `tacking' and `jibing' and makes for a quick read. Their personal touch is found in the movie and recipe suggestions they pair with each portion of their route - ""Being in Virginia Makes Us Hungry for..."" or ""Our Favorite South Carolina Flick.""This is a conversation in book form - it reads as if you are on deck cruising with them as they make their way south. It's an accessible style that is light on sailing terms and focuses more on the sightseeing aspects of this legendary waterway.

"Why cruise the America's seaboard waterway, a 2,000-mile inland route that runs along the Atlantic coast to Key West, FL?Allan Fisher, author of this National Geographic Society book, quotes Stamford CT mayor and sailing enthusiast, Julius Wilensky, who says it's because, ""there's a bit of Columbus and Magellan in many of us.""That sense of adventure and exploration infuse every page of this book. And although published in 1973, the book is as timeless and beautiful as the majestic waterway it describes. The lyrical text by Fisher is richly illustrated by the images of well-regarded photographer, James L. Amos. Six full-page, color maps outline each segment of their journey. The combined effect is to bring the reader right into the hypnotic beauty of this intracoastal waterway (ICW).Fisher describes the voyage through the eyes of a naturalist from the vantage of his 43-foot motorsailer, Andromeda. Putting in and out of anchorages all along the incredible estuaries, coastal rivers, creeks, canals, marches, tributaries, and tidal basins of the coastal shoreline, Fisher is a modern-day maritime explorer describing a world many of us only know at dockside. Amos focuses his lens on life - human and animal - both on and off the water, capturing the interplay between man and his environment in this unique ecosystem.This work is out of print and only available from third-party sellers. Yet, it is worth adding to your collection of ICW books. The outstanding writing and photos make this an unforgettable reading experience of one of America's great waterways.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R54MQ35GDPV4Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000U2K4EK#wasThisHelpful","R54MQ35GDPV4Q","A2ALMW6CSEEFBE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ALMW6CSEEFBE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Don't be fooled by the low price (I paid under $20): this ChargerCity holder is a solid piece equipment that will enhance your iPad recording experience.This is an accessory stick product that acts as an extension of a stand-alone tripod. I use the Targus-brand tripod for my digital and video camera mounts, both of which came with factory-installed screw bases. iPads don't have a screw base requiring the ingenious solution of the ChargerCity holder. The iPad slides into the holder which attaches to the tripod by way of a bendable gooseneck ending in a quarter-inch screw socket.With the iPad secured in the holder, and the holder securely screwed onto your tripod, you will be able to shoot or record wobbly-free images. The value in this product is pairing it with a good tripod. Bad shocks are going to give you a rocky ride no matter how comfy the seats. A flimsy tripod (bad shocks) is going to give your iPad in its ChargerCity holder (the comfy seats) a rocky ride.With my iPad mounted in the ChargerCity holder and attached to my adjustable Targus tripod, I've shot many clear, distortion-free videos. The swivel ball joint makes positioning the holder simple while the joint ring adjusts the tension depending on how fluid you want your shot. The gooseneck detaches from the holder making it easy to store flat.The ChargerCity iPad holder is a great accessory for your recording needs.

"I read this guide three times. The first time was as a tourist, blown away by the amount of visual and written detail describing the amazing breadth, complexity, and beauty of the Intracoastal Waterway. The second time, I read as a consumer, scrutinizing the ads, which were almost as informative as the guide, and definitely as interesting. The third time, I read from the perspective of a boater, mentally plotting my route as I studied the pages.This waterway guide is outstanding precisely because it gives the reader so many perspectives and angles from which to approach their journey - whether it be `by land or by sea'. Each section is color coded and uniformly organized. It's a generous amount of marine (bouys, tides, lanes), boating (anchorages, docking, facilities), technical (navigation, safety, equipment), and local flavor (historical, dining, points of interest) information supplemented by extensive charts, maps and photos.The ""Goin' Ashore"" feature that describes every port stop and appears in the many side trip notes, includes the well-researched ""History"" and ""Points of Interest"" categories that I particularly enjoyed reading. Salted throughout the guide was ""Quick Facts"" that described local animal life and explained quirky boating terms and waterway rules.The writing, layout, maps, guides, charts, and even the ads, are outstanding. This waterway guide is less a boating manual and more an expeditionary guide.  It's an excellent resource for the new or seasoned boater, as well as a vicarious thrill for the armchair adventurer.

"After 5 years of heavy use, my padded Office Max chair was starting to show its age. It was time for a new chair. When I find something that I like, I usually buy it again. Instead, I decided to try out this mesh task chair by HON.Padded chairs have a soft, quilted design. What you get in comfort, you pay for in weight and bulk (see pictures). Foam padding can also get warm and, over time, lose its firmness. Still, padded chairs offer cozy comfort with a stately profile.In contrast, the mesh chair presents a sleek, modern, no nonsense profile. This is a chair that tells you to ""get to work!"" I liked the flexible mesh backing that is in contrast to the firm seat. Good posture is part of the package with the adjustable lumbar support. The arm rest has six settings and is easy to move, as is the lever for the seat height. I thought it an awkward design to have the tilt tension separate from the seat lever. And even when loosened, it barely provided any tilt.Overall, I think this chair is great for posture and for attitude: there's no slouching or getting comfy at the expense of getting the work done. I also liked the smaller 5-star base and lighter weight of the entire chair. For my money though, I prefer to have the tilt and seat height feature combined.This is a solid, good-looking, pricey chair with a 4-star rating.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3N02FCU8367ZZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NVKEZQQ#wasThisHelpful","R3N02FCU8367ZZ","A2ALMW6CSEEFBE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ALMW6CSEEFBE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My son discovered the K'Nex building sets in 2012, when he was 8 years old. The timing was perfect as he had already mastered the LEGO building kits up to the 14+ age range. K'Nex sets offered him the complexity of LEGO with the excitement of motorized or mechanical movement.In between designing his own creations, he worked his way through the K'NEX Robo Battlers, the Ferris Wheel (a favorite),  two sets of roller coasters, the Super Sonic Swirl and the diabolically clever K'NEXosaurus Rex kit. And while K'Nex went on to offer bigger and better versions of these highly original concepts, it seemed the product line had run its course.With the release of the K-Force line, K'Nex has returned to its roots of offering challenging creative design with exciting play options. K-Force combines the intricacies of LEGO with the mechanics of Erector sets, the sport action of Nerf with the interactivity of MindWare's building sets.Flexibility is the most important part of K'Nex products - not only in the Flexi-rod design, but also in the ability of users to reconfigure the manufactured set. Your young engineer can follow the 66 steps in the 24-page, full-color and detailed manual, or they can take the concept and reimagine it (see pix for my son's two-player design from the Dual Cross kit).K-Force is an outstanding building set. Kudos to the creative genius who dreamed up this product. K'Nex is a again a force to be reckoned with the Build and Blast product line. Highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R227D1HGPEIKK9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00V5YA2U8#wasThisHelpful","R227D1HGPEIKK9","A2ALMW6CSEEFBE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ALMW6CSEEFBE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Since we bought this patio bench in June 2009, it has held up to three kids, three moves, 36 seasonal changes, including two record-breaking winters of 81"" and 110"" of snow. During MA's Snowmageddon 2015, the bench was buried under almost 7 feet of snow. That's 2,190 days of weather and family ab/use. Our next-door neighbors were so impressed with our unit, they bought one for their family patio, too.The bench is easy to assemble right out of the box. No tools are required as all the pieces simply snap into place. That's an important feature to consider for outdoor equipment that is exposed to the elements year round - you won't have pieces that rust and discolor the unit, your deck or clothes, or the stored items. The top can be popped off for seasonal cleaning. We splash on some Murphy's Oil Soap, scrub, hose down and air dry.Although we wrap mitts and other soft-textured items in large Ziploc storage bags, the bench is remarkably waterproof. Even torrential downpours barely penetrate the casing with only nominal water in the honeycombed base. It's a solid piece of outdoor furniture, despite the snap-in-place construction, easily holding two adults without the top buckling. Summer heat hasn't caused any warping, either, while the light color prevents skin contact heat burns.This was a big-ticket purchase that has more than proved its worth. The Suncast Patio Bench is a good investment for your family's outdoor needs. Highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R301K3LOBH07T2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000EFFS5I#wasThisHelpful","R301K3LOBH07T2","A2ALMW6CSEEFBE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ALMW6CSEEFBE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In our family, no matter the grade, there are three stages to our childrens' daily learning: school work, homework and extra work, otherwise known as studying. We use workbooks by Sylvan, Teacher Created Resources, School Zone, and the Summer Bridge series by Carson-Dellosa to enhance the classroom curriculum.The first third of this Brighter Child series workbook features exercises of English grammar. The language rule, such as nouns, verb tenses, subject and predicates, direct and indirect objects, and adjectives is reviewed on the first page of the main section, followed by 4-5 pages of subsection work. For instance, Adverbs is followed by Adverbs of Time, then Adverbs of Place and finally Adverbs of Manner. If your child is still trying to figure out the basic rules governing simple adverbs, the following three sections will be confusing and frustrating.The second third of the workbook features contractions and syntax rules such as ""sit/set, can/may, good/well, because/so, this/these, and/or/but. The work was made harder by the absence of a typical fill-in-the-blanks answer format. Instead, all the possible answers were included in the sentence example forcing the reader to slow down and really read through the material. This section was my favorite for both its original concept and challenging format.The final third quizzes your scholar on their proofreading and punctuation skills.This is not a skills-building workbook; this is an intense skills-testing workbook. There's a lot of material on each page - an average of 15 questions - all of which require written responses. We're looking forward to tackling the next level with Brighter Child.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3HY6UEB9J2OFN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0769676243#wasThisHelpful","R3HY6UEB9J2OFN","A2ALMW6CSEEFBE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ALMW6CSEEFBE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"My kids loved these gummies, but at the price for the serving size of 4 gummies per day per child, we are priced out of the market. Here's the breakdown:  2 kids x 4 gummies per day = 8; 120 gummies per bottle  8 = 15 day supply. Meaning we'd need to buy 2 bottles per month at an average cost of $25 per bottle or over $50 per month. A year supply would cost $600.I could justify that cost if we didn't already eat healthy. Our vitamin regimen is added value to our diet, not a substitute for one.The SmartyPants flavor is outstanding and didn't require refrigeration to mask the fishy Omega-3 smell. Stickiness is a bit of a challenge, especially in summer, but not a deal breaker. The packaging, ingredients, and product story are all terrific.Except for the cost, this is a great addition to the dietary supplement market for kids.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3I9YR8ZXUC3QQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Q2Q41DS#wasThisHelpful","R3I9YR8ZXUC3QQ","A2ALMW6CSEEFBE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ALMW6CSEEFBE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As I don't suffer from seasonal allergies, the main reason I got this mattress pad is the fact that it could be washed in hot water. Detergent manufacturers claim that their products allow linens to be washed in cold water with the same cleaning power of a hot water wash. Blame my hot-water wash upbringing, but I'm not buying it.But, while I prefer hot water washes for my linens, elastic-cornered mattress pads are another story and require a cold wash before a delicate dryer setting. A hot wash and dry will melt, shrink and eventually rip the rubberized pieces of the material. Hence the conundrum: sheets washed hot only to be placed atop a cold-water washed mattress pad. Was that really clean?Thanks to Allerease, this conflict is resolved. The packaging prominently displays that their mattress pad was ""hot water washable."" My pad has been through several wash and dry cycles and all is well. The hypoallergenic fiber fill is still fluffly, and the stretchable sides are still tight.It's a comfortable - though slightly bunched - fit on my 9"" deep IKEA mattress. One person can easily place the pad on the mattress since the sides are entirely composed of a loosely banded material that snaps into place without skewing the remaining corners. I found the top to be soft and poofy - a pillowy feel.For all the hot water washers out there, I highly recommend this mattress pad.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3KBZQVI8F7NLU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DSLCFVU#wasThisHelpful","R3KBZQVI8F7NLU","A2ALMW6CSEEFBE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ALMW6CSEEFBE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There's a whole field of engineering devoted to managing noise and vibration. Common industrial applications include mufflers for cars, soundproofing material for music studios, dampers for heavy machinery such as roof-mounted air conditioning units, and specialized floor mats for commerical gyms and fitness centers.Scaled-down designs made home-based fitness equipment possible. Yet, the market for mitigating the noise and vibration side effects of this equipment didn't likewise keep pace. Consumers didn't buy commercial grade soundproofing for their personal-use fitness machines for three reasons: it was usually heavy, smelly and expensive.SPRI, a leader in both the home and retail exercise market, has designed an attractive and affordable high density equipment mat suitable for your home. The Pro-Tech doesn't have a rubber tire or plastic smell; the texture isn't oily or greasy. This high density mat is surprisingly heavy but that heft provides the traction needed for a stable workout experience.While the Pro-Tech distributes vibrations over a large surface area (8ft x 3ft), which theoretically should help dampen noise, the reality is that exercising in a home on any level other than the basement is going to cause a lot of noise, regardless of the mat used. What this mat offers is excellent surface coverage with no slippage or migration due to machine vibrations or exercise patterns, and no smell at a competitive price.I've been using this mat for several months and am pleased with its performance. I recommend it for your home-based workout space.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3U4USTOQFYP96/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PUHQXRM#wasThisHelpful","R3U4USTOQFYP96","A2ALMW6CSEEFBE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ALMW6CSEEFBE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Synopsis:  The Athenian king Aegeus marries Aethra, who mates with both Poseidon and Aegeus, to become the mother to Theseus. Poseidon sends Minos, the king of Crete, a white bull which mates with Minos's wife, Pasiphae, to birth a half-man, half-bull creature called Minotaur. Minos's son, Androgeos, is killed by the white bull. Theseus slays the Minotaur with the help of Minos's daughter, Ariadne, whom he abandons on a deserted island for the god Dionysus, before marrying her sister, Phaedra.Have you got all that?Theseus and the Minotaur could be an allegorical tale for the labyrinth that is Greek mythology with its complex relationships, confusing agendas, and confounding names. A graphic novel can be a great vehicle by which the elementary reader can be exposed to a-maze-ing tales such as this one.Toon Graphics tries to rise to the challenge with this beautifully illustrated work. Yet, the densely arrayed images per page, combined with the wordy narration throughout - in addition to the speech bubbles (in a different font) - makes this godly tale feel merely mortal. An exciting myth like this needs larger art and more than 48 pages to be told.There's terrific attention to detail including the 2-page trading card recap followed by the helpful index. Overall, ""Theseus"" is an artistic gem, but is way too wordy for both the graphic novel concept, and the target audience of elementary readers.I recommend this work for your middle and older readers.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1NA9EK9LGCC8I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1935179616#wasThisHelpful","R1NA9EK9LGCC8I","A2ALMW6CSEEFBE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ALMW6CSEEFBE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"For my 10th birthday, I received a mini pool table. The balls were the size of marbles and the cue sticks were like twigs. It was impractical and cheap, and I loved it. That little tabletop pool game was one of the best gifts of my young life.The Wild West Shootout by Sharper Image is like that pool table; it's ridiculous fun that will create memories for a lifetime. The best range of play is at 5 feet, but 10 feet back make for more competitive firing as players get more skilled.It's got the old-time arcade look and feel right down to the sound effects of Yee-haw! when the game ends. Speaking of, we taped a thick paper towel over the speaker to reduce the volume (there is no knob control). Four targets - a vulture, buffalo skull, cactus, tin can - are intermittently lit red for scoring action of 20 shots and a total possible score of 530. The target light moves faster the higher you move through the levels - whether you hit them or not. The first 5 shots are 10 points each (50), the next 6 are 20 points each (120), with the remaining 9 shots earning 40 (360) points each.The microchip technology makes it virtually impossible to memorize all the target sequencing - we stopped counting at 15 rounds of different combinations - meaning a new game is played almost every time.The Wild West Shootout is a solid piece of silly fun. Highly recommend this toy arcade shooting game.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3S5V5TO8QO2CI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00S31099U#wasThisHelpful","R3S5V5TO8QO2CI","A2ALMW6CSEEFBE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ALMW6CSEEFBE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Projects like paint-by-number, potholders, coloring books, puzzles, stained glass, and suncatchers are hands-on creative work and play. Besides being fun to do, they develop sensory and fine-motor skills, require focus and concentration, and teach task-and-time management skills.The end result of all that effort can simply be satisfaction of a job well done. Or the final product can be used, displayed or gifted for the enjoyment of many.With Makit Bakit, your young artist can make a festive suncatcher using the enclosed colored baking crystals. It's exacting work that requires use of a teaspoon or a pair of tweezers (neither included). This project also requires a steady hand and lots of patience - good skills to practice at any age.While the craft looks deceptively easy, it's pretty labor intensive. Your child's maturity level will determine whether they - or you - finish the work.My family loves arts and crafts and the Makit Bakit suncatchers continue to be a popular rainy-day project. Highly recommend the Makit Bakit line, as well as the other arts and crafts from the ColorBk company catalog.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2JNGUMZEPOIHU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KKV7FUC#wasThisHelpful","R2JNGUMZEPOIHU","A2ALMW6CSEEFBE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ALMW6CSEEFBE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It's a pretty safe bet that any product you buy from Melissa & Doug will be a keepsake piece. This is especially true of the Peel-n-Press line that includes the Rainbow Garden and Undersea Fantasy.We bought all three stained glass projects to make during summer vacation. My kids range in age from 8 - 12, yet they each found their gel-piece work exacting, yet fun. The end result is a gorgeous handmade artwork for display in a window or glass door.A review of the directions was required, but they quickly figured out how to match the gel pieces to the numbered template, working intently for at least two hours to complete the work.Each kit comes with the image encased within a wood frame which is painted on one side to match the main color scheme. The window-facing plain side allows the child to write the date or a message if giving the stained glass as a gift. Although no suction cup is enclosed, a color-matching string at the top can be hung off window latches for see-thru presentation (see Customer Images of Undersea Fantasy). Unlike traditional stained glass, this window art is lightweight and unbreakable.This art project combines sensory, numerical, and color learning within a play-like experience. It's a classic Melissa & Doug approach. Highly recommend buying all three kits. The entire line is a beautiful addition to your homeschool art studies program or simply as home-based arts and crafts project. I hope Melissa & Doug adds more products to this Window Art line.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQGKKGKLRFHKR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AWTH36S#wasThisHelpful","RQGKKGKLRFHKR","A2ALMW6CSEEFBE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ALMW6CSEEFBE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a great bag for casual campers, road trippers, and sleepover use. It is not a bag intended for serious backpacking and, despite its 20-40 degree Fahrenheit rating, winter camping.We found this bag perfect for camping out inside while traveling away from home. The Coleman Sabine simplifies the logistics of our host family finding enough sheets and blankets to bed down a family of five.For road trips, we pack three Sabines and two twin AeroBeds. The adults sleep in regular beds with regular bedding while the kids bunk down on a couch and the blow ups. The bags take the place of linens making daily setup and breakdown convenient. The quilted design and generous polyester fill make for a roomy and comfy night's sleep.Besides being comfortable, these bags are toasty. Even in houses where the nighttime thermostat is set to 60 degrees, the kids seemed warmer and more comfortable in their sleeping bags than the adults who were sandwiched between cold sheets topped by layers of flannel blankets and heavy comforters.Although the bag comes with Coleman's QuickCord storage - a plastic hook catches and holds the rolled up end of the bag - we purchased three large Nelson-Rigg Compression Bags in which to stuff the Sabines. This kept the bags clean and made transporting and storage easy.The Sabine performed exactly as we expected which is why I give it five stars.

"The makers of the ZhuZhu Pets, a toy hamster craze that dominated the Christmas 2009 season, have now released a motorized plush puppy and kitten line called The Happy's. The plush pet play can be enhanced by accessories such as the Zippy Skateboard and the Speedy Sports Car.This is a well-made toy that has held up to extended play for over 9 months despite banging into table legs, baseboards, and doors. The plush pet (sold separately) is belted into the car before pressing the motorized button found near the tail.There are three wheels on the bottom of the pet: one small pivot wheel under the front of the pet, and two larger wheels flanking the back (see Customer Images). It's the back wheels on the pet that ""powers"" the car; the blue car wheels are decoration only and don't move. The angle of the pet allows its treaded wheels to extend past the chassis of the car to zip around both a hard and carpeted surface.The beauty of this design is that the car never gets stuck since the pet's wheels spin either backward or forward - both together and independently - allowing it to back out of seemingly impossible spaces. It ""drives"" for over 4 minutes.I gave this toy five stars because it is well made, priced right, and wacky good fun. It's a great gift for the under five year old set. It is also a hugely popular chase toy for cats and puppies.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R34M2QUZMKWJ8G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IPMVP68#wasThisHelpful","R34M2QUZMKWJ8G","A2ALMW6CSEEFBE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ALMW6CSEEFBE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The uses of this little above-ground pool are limited only by your imagination. Obviously, it's perfect for refreshing home-based play for your toddlers. The shallow 18-inch depth fills up quickly while the 6-foot diameter comfortably holds 2-3 average-sized young kids. At less than 2 feet deep, the water will absorb direct summer sun quickly, too, offsetting the chilly hose water.As your toddlers turn to tweens, turn the pool into a refilling station for their water blaster and super soaker games.The complaints about setup and breakdown feel ill-informed to me since explicit instructions are enclosed that work as directed. The advantage to a small daily pool is that you use regular chlorinated water that doesn't stand overnight. There are no chemical or safety issues. Like another reviewer noted, a large, plastic tarp provides ideal ground coverage preventing dirty water from muddied feet, as well as protection to the pool liner against sticks and stones.We bought a couple of buckets and had the kids water the lawn and plants in order to empty the pool. With the water emptied to about a 2"" depth, simply lift one end and drain out the remaining water. Hung over a porch railing, the pool will completely dry until its next use.The Snapset Pool folds up accordion style allowing you to pack it in a large bag and take on road trips. This was a great summertime fun investment. I highly, highly recommend this well-priced, fun, easy-to-use and multiuse pool.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3BENGN2YQQA55/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006JS2FXW#wasThisHelpful","R3BENGN2YQQA55","A2ALMW6CSEEFBE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ALMW6CSEEFBE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"My favorite line in Edmund White's memoir, ""Inside a Pearl"", is found on page 53, where a friend tells him, ""...you are an artist - artists should never pay!"" This quote sums up the spirit of this book - expansive, generous and rewarding. Every page is a delight of snappy dialogue, larger-than-life characters, and glamorous gatherings of people with a ridiculous amount of creative energy and savoir vivre.The majority of the book takes place in Paris, in the early 80s, where White moves to after winning a Guggenheim fellowship. He stays in France for the next 15 years. For the French, manners, decorum and talent are respected independent of affiliations and beliefs. It's a bigger sin in his adopted country to be boring than it is to be gay, liberal, aging, pudgy, and, eventually HIV-positive. His writing reputation opens salon door after salon door.What keeps White's story from veering into camp or eccentricity is how gracefully he writes about his friends and their adventures despite their excesses. Perhaps his Midwest roots (Ohio and Michigan), explain his lack of pretense or sarcasm in either his relationships or his writing, the latter of which brims with enthusiasm and wonder at how splendidly his life and work turned out.White is a natural storyteller who also clearly took careful notes of his times abroad. The ability to put the reader in the moment is a unique gift.

"This memoir from writer Richard Hoffman, is a continuation of his family story, first told in ""Half the House,"" and ends with the death of his father in 2008.Hoffman's first book, published in 1996, found its storytelling power through victimization, writing about his sexual abuse - at the hands of a youth coach - six years before the Catholic Church pedophile priest scandal broke in the ""Boston Globe.""In ""Half the House,"" Hoffman is unflinching in writing about the evils of pedophilia and the pain it caused him and his family. The book's theme of death - of brothers, of small-town life, of trust and innocence - ended with an affirmation of forgiveness and love.In this book, Hoffman explores the evils of racism, classism, and sexism lived by generations of Hoffmans. It could have been an interesting juxtaposition of personal works. This book could have explored the idea of public and private harms within a family dynamic as opposed to an outside harm that invaded the heart of the family as described in the first book.Instead, Hoffman writes as if the family legacy of bigotry ends with his father's death. Hoffman was just another victim of another evil that has now died out and all is right with the world. The memoir reads like a weak and uninspired response to the corrosive power of the Hoffman familys heart of darkness.An honest reckoning would have made for powerful reading from this gifted writer.

"""It was the first time in a long, long time that a stranger recognized me as my father's son."" It's a powerful line in the opening chapter of Arlo Crawford's memoir. The possessive form suggests a story about the bonds between a father and son not only to each other, but also to the land they work together one season at the family's organic farm in Pennsylvania.As the chapters unfold, though, Crawford writes less like a young man on a journey of self-discovery and reflection, and more like a bored Gen X-er spending down time with the farm folk  la Nicole Richie and Paris Hilton in ""The Simple Life.""The real story is his parents, Jim and Moie Crawford, who, over 40 years and against enormous odds, built up a 95-acre sustainable organic farm. It's where the younger Crawford was born and raised until leaving for boarding school - and for good - at age 16.In Arlo's telling, it's a family business without family since neither he nor his younger sister has any interest in farming. That lack of connection is what makes his memoir feel shallow and contrived. The pages most come alive when he's not in them - writing about how his parents realized their dream through grit, vision, and courage during the counterculture movement of the early 1970s.Skip the book and look up New Morning Farm on the web. It's a great story.

"This is an excellent product for use by teen girls or boys who are dealing with acne brought on by puberty. They'll appreciate the spa-like treatment and the fresh-faced results. You'll appreciate the affordable price. Two boxes (8 packettes) will last one month for twice-weekly masks at less than the cost of a large acne-causing pizza.While the drying properties of the ingredients may not be ideal for older skin, the affordable price, ease of use, convenient packettes and glowing results makes this a perfect health and beauty product for your young teen. Plus, it's a fresh, fun way to introduce the habits of lifelong skin care to an impressionable group.I liked how simply this product delivered on its promise of keeping ""skin clear and healthy with deep-cleansing"" masks. Highly recommend it for your teens' healthy skin regime.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R22WELX8N9PHQM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00G7U29KQ#wasThisHelpful","R22WELX8N9PHQM","A2ALMW6CSEEFBE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ALMW6CSEEFBE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Footwork is an underappreciated but essential part of any sport training. Strength and conditioning must be supplemented with balance and agility for optimal athletic performance. The SKLZ Speed Hurdles and Ladder allows even the recreational athlete to work on their ""foot strike and lift frequency to improve maneuverability"" and conditioning.The plastic pieces are easy to assemble and come packed in a generously sized cinch-lock type bag. Although the manufacturer cautions that the ""Elevation Ladder is not intended to be taken apart after each use"" I found that mobility is a key feature of this ingenious design. In the winter, we set up (with the flat or elevated rungs) in a common-use hallway where every transit requires engagement. In the summer, it's easy to move the ladder from yard, to track, to garage or gym, and other workout areas as needed. The Ladder has retained its shape and material integrity despite all the breaking down and rebuilding.The six 4"" rungs are another excellent design feature. When snapped into the upright position, only a misstep will trigger a rung's collapse. Footfall vibrations do not trigger a response - even on a flat, hard surface. No false alarms will interrupt your momentum. If the rung falls, you'll know that your fancy footwork still needs work.Materials, design, ease-of-use, and price make this is a 5-star, and highly recommended, product for your sporting family. Buy two, lay them end-to-end, for an even harder workout.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R26K2X23HTTOSG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GPDH0CC#wasThisHelpful","R26K2X23HTTOSG","A2ALMW6CSEEFBE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ALMW6CSEEFBE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Based on the 157 posted reviews (to date), the Philips Norelco Hair Clipper appeals to parents who want to cut the hair of toddlers, kids of any age with sensory issues and developmental delays, and families who want to touch-up barber straight or fine hair at home.I can another group to the list of users: Parents who want to trim the edges of their child's tightly-curled corkscrew hair without reducing the volume or ""fluff"" factor. This clipper does an excellent job of shaving all around the hairline - especially around the ears where painful snagging is most likely to occur.Ordinary scissors cut and trim hair. Only clippers (or a razor) can achieve that edge that gives fades their distinctive and polished look.For a lightweight and quiet tool, this is a rugged and precise pair of clippers.

"Hands-on or experiential learning is the optimal educational experience. In my kids' elementary school, their curriculum includes growing chicks and frogs from eggs, butterflies from caterpillars, and plants from seeds. What these projects emphasize, though, is observation over participation, or hands-off learning - an incomplete model for experiential learning.Ms. Frizzle rides to the rescue on her Magic School Bus and the Young Scientist Club kits. You can supplement the static school experience with these interactive, hands-on and integrated home-based experiments. I suggest starting your young scientist with something they already know: themselves.The Journey into the Human Body kit starts with a clever experiment demonstrating the lungs and breathing, a functioning - albeit miniature - circulatory system and beating heart, and the muscular and skeletal systems - including hinge and ball movement. The journey ends with a taste test that explains both the senses and the digestive system while an ingenious glitter and water experiment explains both hearing and balance.The kit includes balloons, a pipette, string, glitter, glue, ping pong ball and cap (illustrating the ball and joint), a bendable straw, a paper fastener, and leg model. You provide common household items like salt and saran wrap and supervision. The 7 experiments come in a 12-page 81/2 x 11-sized glossy booklet that provides space for writing observation and notes and includes lots of ""liner"" notes about the human body.I highly recommend this and the other kits. Order the Magic School Bus Inside the Human Body for the best overall learning journey.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1MAT5LGIPXEZZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000MAD7FS#wasThisHelpful","R1MAT5LGIPXEZZ","A2ALMW6CSEEFBE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ALMW6CSEEFBE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Despite the popularity of Facebook, Instagram, and selfies, Klutz continues to carve out a corner of the tween girl market through these keepsake-style books - the original social media.The distinctive features of this Klutz activity book - basically a peer-to-peer networking project - are the enclosed pencil with eraser and a multicolored and generous pad of paper on which answers can be noted and dated. Pockets on the interior pages allow these notes to be stored for future reference, comparison or audiences. It's a clever idea that adds an interactive-style element to the book.Each page features sentence starter-style questions such as ""5 People Who..."" followed by a dozen teaser ideas like ""Drive me up a wall,"" or ""Can always cheer me up."" Although author Karen Phillips does an excellent job writing and organizing this book, her editors could update this 2008 work to reflect the changing demographics and social awareness of the tween market.I found the section ""Boys and Other Animals"" with topics like ""Rank Some Romeos,"" and ""Who's a Good Boy?"" awkward and disparaging. With Macklemore singing ""Same Love,"" and girls growing up with stay-at-home dads, two moms, and accepting of or experiencing different life expressions, these kind of sex-and-gender stereotypes don't fit either the hipster vibe Klutz strives for or the current reality for many tweens.Overall this is a good product, but only earns 3 stars for being old fashioned. Instead, I recommend Klutz's more recent offering, It's All About Us, also by Phillips, which is a more relevant and contemporary Q&A of tween life.","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQU88FM8A6LQV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1591745160#wasThisHelpful","RQU88FM8A6LQV","A2ALMW6CSEEFBE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ALMW6CSEEFBE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My maternal grandfather made his way to America from Germany as an 18-year old coal trimmer aboard the Imperator, a Hamburg-Amerika line ship launched in May 1912, just one month after the Titanic sinking. Although my interest in the Titanic stems from my family history, the Titanic tragedy is a storytelling form as old as the Greek myths from which the ship was named. This ""titanic"" book brilliantly captures the arc of that terrible night through the true story of two families told in simple prose accompanied by beautiful illustrations and photographs.It opens with the boarding of the first-class Carters and the third-class Goldsmiths, cleverly introducing the different worlds from which they came and continued to occupy while on board the ship by the four-page foldout depicting a full ship cutaway. The middle section of the book is the moment of impact with the iceberg and the catastrophic consequences that follow as the great liner sinks below the surface in less than three hours with 1,500 souls still on board.The third and last part of the book features the rescue and the aftermath. Both children survive although their family and personal history are forever marked by that night. This is an excellent story and resource for the young Titanic scholar. The information and pictorial detail is accessible and gripping no matter where they are on their Titanic journey. I highly recommend this book either to begin or enhance your Titanic exploration.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2FMTYW18ZPX8D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0316557161#wasThisHelpful","R2FMTYW18ZPX8D","A2ALMW6CSEEFBE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ALMW6CSEEFBE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"From the packaging and product write up, Science Lab looks promising. The description says that your young scientist can, ""use household items in these engaging experiments."" If you have yeast, purple cabbage, Borax, also known as salt of boric acid (used in kitchens to control for cockroaches and ants), or a single disposable diaper laying about your home, this kit may interest you. If not, I suggest the Magic School Bus Young Scientist Club kits, in which the one-off items like agar and gel crystals are included.This product is way overpriced given how many uncommon or bulk-sized items you must purchase to make these experiments work. One of the easiest and cheapest science experiments I did with my kids was the diet soda and Mentos geyser kit we picked up in our grocery aisle for five bucks (including the 2-liter soda).But the biggest missing ingredient in this kit is the lack of girls represented in the materials describing the experiments. Every single one of the otherwise well written and interesting 24-page booklet features a boy. Seriously, did Larry Summers, the former Harvard president, who said that the dearth of women in science and engineering was due to aptitude and not discrimination and socialization, help design this kit?At the impressionable target age of 8 and older, science projects should be accessible, affordable and interesting. This SmartLab product misses on all three counts and deserves only 1 star.

"3179. That's how many steps I've walked so far today. Pathetic, I know, but when I'm not sitting on my bum writing Amazon reviews, I usually have clocked in at least twice that, topping out around 14,000 steps - or over 5 miles - per day.I know all this thanks to my little pedometer. It acts as a friendly reminder to get and stay moving. The ""no judgments"" metrics record how far it is to where I've been - or not been. I'm constantly checking it to see how I measure up.The unit is simple to program, has a colorful, big key design and an easy-to-read display (although I do wish it had Indiglo or some other lighting display function). My unit is clipped sideways to my belt loop which prevents the popping off that other reviewers have mentioned - the orientation doesn't affect the step count. I also purchased a safety leash (free shipping as of the date of this review) and use that to anchor the unit for extra security.This is a solid value for the price. Sure, there are probably units with more bells and whistles that calculate body fat and take your blood pressure, too. For my money, though, this unit works great at simply counting steps. It's also perfect for young kids who are part of school-based or community walking group; I bought one for each of my kids. They compete to see who has the most steps at the end of the day.Enough talking; I gotta get walking.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJMLA3CJ3G3VL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CLD81M8#wasThisHelpful","RJMLA3CJ3G3VL","A2ALMW6CSEEFBE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ALMW6CSEEFBE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Quiet. That's the best description I can give of this powerful, sleek, versatile and attractive stick vacuum. I've owned many brands: Black & Decker, Hoover, Eureka, Dyson, Dirt Devil, and this Electrolux is the quietest vacuum I have ever used.I was also pleased with its cleaning power despite its 25.2 volt motor - standard upright vacuums run between 10 and 12 amps or 120 volts. Lower power, lower noise would be the obvious conclusion except for the fact that I also own a 15.6 volt stick vacuum and a little 10.8 volt Dust Buster and both whine at an earsplitting high ""C"".Based on the marketing photos and lifestyle descriptions in Amazon's Product Description, Electrolux is pitching this vacuum as an upscale accessory for the urban hipster demographic, but the elder sub/urban market should also be considered. I got this model for my aging parents for several reasons: the cordless feature eliminates a tripping hazard that is a major concern for the elderly; the lightweight (6 pd.) design makes it easy for arthritic hands to grip; the 180-degree swivel head allows them to maneuver around and under furniture; the unit easily attaches to the charging station; and the lithium battery holds the charge long enough for them to do regular spot cleaning of hardwood floors and rugs.Those are all standard features of other brands, too. What sets this vacuum apart from the pack is how quietly this powerful vacuum works. That feature is priceless and earns this Electrolux vacuum a 5-star rating.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R225NYRZD2VD74/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FPSKTXU#wasThisHelpful","R225NYRZD2VD74","A2ALMW6CSEEFBE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ALMW6CSEEFBE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In my car owning lifetime, I have changed oil and filters; replaced spark plugs, batteries and fan belts; rotated my own tires and flushed radiators. Pretty simple stuff, but I felt intimidated with the installation of this tailgate light bar. If not done right, it can be an expensive mistake.So I cheated and took it up to my local garage and asked them to do it for me. Mine is a product, not an installation, review. However, it took my shop just under 30 minutes to install this light bar; they did fast work at a reasonable price. It seems Putco has designed an easy-to-use kit for the gear heads out there who have the equipment and expertise to do the job themselves. For myself, I am not worthy . . .The tailgate light bar has been installed on my vehicle for over a month.  It is a solid piece of equipment that looks like a custom made accessory. I like the slim, sleek profile that displays a penetrating, but glare-free LED light. The installation kit includes double-sided tape to anchor the bar for placement only - a nice touch.Since the majority of road accidents I see are fender benders, I think a tailgate light bar adds a vibrant layer of visibility in challenging driving conditions. When you buy a light bar, you are buying both style and safety.

"Compilations are tricky business in that they can be accused of covering either too much or too little information. This book manages to do both. That inconsistency combined with boring graphic design knocks this work down to 2 stars.For instance, the period from prehistoric medicine to the dawn of modern medicine in 1920, covers 200 pages, but the era of modern medicine to the present including ""genes and dreams"" comes to only 142. Although the former category covers centuries of discoveries and advancements, while the latter barely covers one, it's seems as if author Steve Parker relishes writing on the ancient history at the expense of the present and quickly-evolving science.Yet, the modern-age AIDS makes the list, but the age-old bird flu does not. Medicine to combat biohazards such as radiation poisoning from the nuclear disasters of Hiroshima or Chernobyl or terrorist attacks by anthrax aren't even mentioned.Overall, the work felt both rushed and predictable thanks to the repetitive graphic layout and design. Most left-side pages featured an image in the lower left corner while right-side pages featured an upper right image (lots of head shots). Every 5th page featured a full-page color spread.I also agree with other reviewers that the 6 x 9 size was disappointing. I love medical books and wanted to love this one, too. Unfortunately the only cure for my affliction for this book is to kill it.

"Before Larry the Cucumber and Bob the Tomato from the ""Veggie Tales"" videos, there was Davey, and his dog, Goliath. The stop-motion animation series was produced by the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America in the 1950s and 1960s to provide a Christian-based show for young viewers.The 15-minute episodes center on Davey, a likable, polite, and hard-working kid who wonders how to apply his Christian faith and values to his everyday experiences. What made this show so approachable was its lack of good and evil dichotomies. Rather than sin and sinner storylines, these shows simply convey Davey's yearning to understand his place in God's creation. While some of the shows deal with large social issues such as bullying, racism, and death, the majority of the plotlines explore Davey's daily journey of a faith-based life with Goliath by his side, both as companion and conscience.Uncomplicated storylines, simple set designs of familiar characters and places, a thoughtful and kind central figure whose seriousness is balanced by his goofy yet loyal dog, anchor each show. The show's messages of love and forgiveness can trace its roots all the way back to Jesus and the New Testament teachings. I remember the powerful impression these shows had on me as a child. Despite the low-tech quality when compared to today's animation, my kids are equally riveted by this series.This review applies to all the other shows within this beautifully produced series.

"When products are marked as ""indoor/outdoor"" it's generally a tip-off that their main use is recreational. This is not a backcountry camping lantern; this is a supplemental light for summer nights outdoors on the patio of your house or as an emergency light for power outages. I bought a lantern for each of my kids as a slumber party toy/tool.As a lighting accessory, the price of less than twenty dollars is appropriate, especially given that 4 D-cell batteries can cost half as much as the unit itself. Overall, I like the Emerson brand and have bought several of their products. For this price, you get a pretty solid value.This lantern is lightweight, and the 20 LED-generated light is a bright white that clearly illuminates a 10 x 20-sized room with remarkably little shadowing. Like newer LED flashlights, the lantern features a removable battery compartment accessed via the screw-off bottom; there's no fumbling around to figure out battery orientation.Although not as effective at illuminating broad outdoor spaces without ancillary light sources - the light gets swallowed up by the 360-degree darkness - this is an excellent all-purpose utility lantern for enclosed areas needing general throw light.Emerson delivers exactly what they promise in this product: a long-lasting, versatile and portable light source. For delivering on that promise with good design and style, this product deserves 5 stars.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R28QTIHE3WGW6T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001CUVI58#wasThisHelpful","R28QTIHE3WGW6T","A2ALMW6CSEEFBE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ALMW6CSEEFBE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My First Sock Puppets kit offers an easy introduction to crafting for your young artist without the messiness of glue or the stress of and coordination required for a needle and thread project. Instead, peel-and-press decals are used to create hand puppets from the three socks in blue, orange and lime green colors. The socks are large enough that on a young child they easily extend all the way to their elbow.Although my son is a skilled needle-and-thread crafter, I bought him this kit as a fun break from the intensity of his stitching work. He loved it. The socks are thick and fuzzy yet allow easy positioning and adhering of the decals.There must be 100 different decals of a dozen shapes including pom poms, wiggly eyes and other face and feature designs that offer limitless imaginative combinations. The finished product results in either silly hand puppet characters or a decorative accessory (my son placed his puppets on his bedposts).For a rainy or snow day craft, for play date fun or just family fun, this is a great project to have in your art bin. The generous assortment of decals means that your crafter can use cast-off socks to design more puppets or create art projects in combination with other materials.A great craft for any age - both the young and the young at heart.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1LTY96389AV71/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ESXSDBI#wasThisHelpful","R1LTY96389AV71","A2ALMW6CSEEFBE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ALMW6CSEEFBE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"After less than 3 years of use, our first two sound machines  from HoMedics conked out - one right after the other. In response to our emailed complaint, HoMedics offered to replace the machines for free. We ordered these new units rather than wait the 6-8 weeks for the replacement sets. Consumers should know that HoMedics stands by their products.In contrast, the Original Sleep Sound Generator (Single Frequency Model), that I bought from Hammacher Schlemmer almost 15 years ago is still going strong and comes with a lifetime guarantee. It was then, and still is now, 3 times the cost of the lowest-end HoMedics model, so the lesson here may be that you get what you pay for. Like any product, the higher price point may yield better quality and reliability in the HoMedics brand.If you are looking for quick value, this redesigned and lower-priced unit may be worth your expense. New sounds of thunder, white noise and babbling brook (known as waterfall on the old unit), have replaced the annoying heartbeat (a great Halloween sound effect), and rainforest settings while the ocean, summer night and rain sounds remain. The sound seems clearer, too - the old graininess and sound skipping is gone.I gave this product 5 stars because of the sound improvements and because the lower price seems to reflect HoMedics awareness of the model's longterm reliability issues.

"Studying comics and graphic novels, writes author Karin Kukkonen, is no laughing matter. She analyzes a wide range of material covering political, social, personal and mythical genres: Art Spiegelman's Holocaust memoir ""Maus""; Alison Bechdel's lesbian-feminist reflections in ""Fun Home""; the King Arthur tales in ""Prince Valiant""; as well as the more commonly-known comics of Batman, Superman and Donald Duck.I enjoyed reading this book even though I agree with other reviewers that the paperback and Kindle prices are outrageously high and will limit the market appeal to the textbook audience. In fact, Dr. Kukkonen's Introduction states, ""(this book) is designed to provide you with all the knowledge you need for studying and analyzing comics on a university course.""The ridiculous pricing is a reflection of that narrow demographic (remember buying college textbooks that cost almost as much as the course itself? Or a professor's self-published work that was required reading for their class?).Wiley-Blackwell is a scientific, technical, medical and scholarly publishing business. Given that their target market for this work is also a captive one, they can price a boutique book at a designer price. Works like this - a thesis turned into a course syllabus by way of a 177-page book - should really be downloadable open source material.Although well written and provocatively argued, for a more affordable analysis of comics, check out Scott McCloud's work including, ""Understanding Comics: The Invisible Art,"" instead.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 19, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1TZVFX0CUSEKU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1118499921#wasThisHelpful","R1TZVFX0CUSEKU","A2ALMW6CSEEFBE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ALMW6CSEEFBE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The ergonomic balance between the top and bottom blades - making the angled presses to the sides and back hair more comfortable - are other great design elements.A lot of careful thought went into this appliance: you can lock in your preferred heat setting from the baseline of 300 to 450 degrees; the blades can be locked in the closed position for travel or storage; a swivel cord attachment at the unit base prevents snags or awkward hands holds - an important safety feature when handling hot surfaces; and a 6-foot long extension cord.I also liked the LCD Indiglo display on the top blade of this iron.

"People who share a common vision or destiny are strengthened by forming communities in which their work and beliefs are supported and sustained. Many of these movements are religiously based such as the Amish, Mennonites, or Hare Krishnas. Secular movements that adopt a community-based lifestyle are harder to maintain on a broad scale because competing interests - like sex, money, and power - make coalescing around a common core more complicated.The Chelsea Hotel was a unique and beautiful exception to this rule. Despite vast differences in race and gender, age and income, education and experience, money and power, the Chelsea Hotel community was bound by one thing: talent.  Even the talent was expressed in widely divergent ways. Yet, for almost 100 years, this diverse energy found a place to call home at the Dream Palace.Sherill Tippins's opus pays homage to the idea that ideas can form powerful and perpetuating communities of believers. Emerson or Thoreau would have called the Chelsea Hotel home. Remarkably, Tippins also shows how outside influences and competing interests strengthened the intimate bonds between the Chelsea believers while propelling their creative work beyond its walls.The Chelsea Hotel was both a cultural and artistic incubator. Writers, musicians, graphic artists, filmmakers, actors and avant garde adventurists mixed in amongst regular people in the heart of New York City. Religious-type fervor within a secular, and sometimes sinful environment, somehow produced enduring art. The Chelsea Hotel was both wicked and wonderful - and so is this book. Highly recommend it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 19, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1765SNJ0EZQYI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0618726349#wasThisHelpful","R1765SNJ0EZQYI","A2ALMW6CSEEFBE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ALMW6CSEEFBE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Every family should own a globe. The Pioneer Globe is an outstanding product made by Replogle, a company that has been mapping the world for almost 100 years. Also invest in a magnifying glass to zoom in on the amazing detail included on this globe's 12-inch surface such as cities, islands, oceanic currents, mountainous and arctic regions that feature bas relief surfaces.The color and definition is sharp and the matte finish makes it easy to see under bright light without glare or reflection. There are little details that show the attention lavished on this project: the ""Direction of the Earth's Rotation"" with an arrow pointing to the right along the Equator; the Tropic of Cancer with parens that note that `most northerly vertical sun rays, June 21'; depth markings for waterways (the shallow depth of the Gulf of Mexico helps explain why hurricanes in that basin move so much water ashore); and even shelf ice markings off Antarctica.There are three other excellent designs: the time dial located at the North Pole from which you can determine the time anywhere in the world; the full rotation of the north and south axis allowing you to view the South Pole without lifting up the entire globe and stand; and the informational booklet.Finally, I appreciate the offer of 50% off the retail value of a new globe when the world changes. The Replogle Globe company has mastered the world. With their globe, so will you.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 16, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2PE0LY7ZC712R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00004WJU4#wasThisHelpful","R2PE0LY7ZC712R","A2ALMW6CSEEFBE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ALMW6CSEEFBE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Growing up, my siblings and I filched palm-sized rocks from wherever we could find them, brought them home to wash and dry before we created Van Gogh-like designs on them with leftover model airplane paint. Those painted rocks became handmade gifts to friends and family. That was arts and crafts in the days before kits like this one marketed creativity.4M has produced an attractive and ingeniously-packaged kit of quality components. There are 10 2""-square tiles - enough to be enjoyed by two artists. What there isn't near enough of is the paint. If you purchase this as a gift, be sure to include an extra strip or two of model paint. It took me two coats of a color to create a solid base on which to paint my design and half the 1 ounce paint container was already gone.You'll also need to buy extra brushes since the one included will require lots of washings and dryings between colors interrupting the artistic flow. Unlike other reviewers, we had breakage when magnets fell off the fridge - where the box specifically suggests the magnets be placed. You can solve the problem by using the scrap magnetic strips to reinforce the sides of the tile rather than using the pre-cut 1""-square piece which isn't weighted or thick enough to prevent slippage during door movement.There are too many issues to make this more than a 3-star product. For the price, it is a visually appealing - if not particularly sturdy or fun - gift.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 16, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RN63VWP6ML56G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0016ISNW2#wasThisHelpful","RN63VWP6ML56G","A2ALMW6CSEEFBE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ALMW6CSEEFBE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Dover has been creating quality and affordable books since 1941. I grew up enjoying their coloring, stencil, sticker and puzzle books. This is a brand that has staying power with that artistic tradition now being passed down to my kids. Holiday favorites such as the Christmas Stained Glass Coloring Book (1973) while the Goddesses Coloring Book (2012) offers a new look on an old art form.We bought this Old-Fashioned Farm Life after a visit to Greenfield Village, MI, part of the Henry Ford Museum complex in Dearborn, MI. If you are planning a trip to this Midwest museum, my recommendation is to buy and review these pages before your trip and then have your kids color/review it after.The 44 pages accurately illustrate both the historical structures as well as the costumed role-players who populate the working Firestone Farm accompanied by a brief description of the daily and seasonal activities of a large farming operation. For East Coast readers, Greenfield Village is the 19th-century version of the 17th-century Plimoth Plantation located in Plymouth, MA. It's a terrific resource to prepare for your travel through time.The 1990-issued book needs updating; the real-life version includes the lives and games of farm children - activities missing from this work that would help personalize it to the target audience of 10 and older. I agree with another reviewer that the detailed line-drawings discourages coloring.

"On downtown Boston's Rose Kennedy Greenway, are two solar-powered charging stations, designed like seats by MIT, to allow users - weather permitting - to charge their smart phones. A mobile world depends on its connectivity through a charged device.Charging devices have been available since before 1990 when mobile phones went mass market. Eventually, better batteries were developed allowing for longer device operating times. As a result, though, new applications emerged that drained copious amounts of juice requiring new charging innovations. A vicious circle ensued.So, although charging devices are not new, the peripheral needs are constantly being taxed and reimagined. What the Tylt model brings to the marketplace is an ergonomic design with enormous power. This little unit is like jumper cables for your devices. On 12-hour family road trips, we plug in to the backseat port allowing the kids to recharge their various devices simultaneously.Its tight fit into the port ensures a locked-in power connection. The compact profile of this unit is also an advantage - with no cords or other dangling features, it can easily be stored when not in use.As a side note, the old-economy car manufacturers could learn a thing or two from high-tech companies like Tylt: For electric cars to succeed in the gas or hybrid-powered marketplace, they are going to have to solve the charging station issues. Perhaps Tylt - or MIT - can show them the way . . . .","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 7, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R293R02BSVXDLM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BL8EUJ2#wasThisHelpful","R293R02BSVXDLM","A2ALMW6CSEEFBE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ALMW6CSEEFBE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The challenge to being F. Scott Fitzgerald's biographer is originality of material. What hasn't already been written about a man who died over 70 years ago? On Amazon, there are over 300 biographies listed.Author Sarah Churchwell's book parallels the genius behind the ""The Great Gatsby"" to that of a true crime: a brutal double murder that took place in New Jersey at the same time Fitzgerald decamped to Great Neck, New York, to begin work on his third novel.It's an interesting angle, but ultimately a thin one that can't sustain the 350-pages that comprise this book. While I agree with her premise that the Mills-Hall murders influenced Fitzergald's Gatsby story and characters, the relentless side-by-side construction is too much and bogs down Churchwell's otherwise excellent narrative.Fitzgerald is famous for mining many real sources and personalities for his works including his wife and an early girlfriend whom scholars believe inspired his Daisy Buchanan character in Gatsby. Weaving in the murder as yet one more inspiration would have been enough, but to hinge her entire work on that singular murderous event and subsequent investigation, news coverage and trial is tiresome.Churchwell's exhaustive research uncovers previously unknown direct links between other events in Fitzgerald's life and Gatsby's development - she's done her homework - but the 1922 murder story ends up smothering her main literary investigation and earns this work 3 stars.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 7, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2HM6DJHISFCLX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1594204748#wasThisHelpful","R2HM6DJHISFCLX","A2ALMW6CSEEFBE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ALMW6CSEEFBE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Just in time for the holiday shopping season comes the Kaotiks Psycho-Plex playset. Impressively packaged and easy to assemble - less than an hour by my 9 year old - this playset will meet your young race car track enthusiasts need for speed.The vehicle is insanely fast and once you get the hang of the infrared-controlled handset and the feel for the track, you'll be hugging the curves and doing backflips and spins off the stunt ramps like a champ. At high speeds, the vehicle even has the whine of a real race car.The handset features a simple backward and forward finger-trigger control. Since the maneuverability of the race car depends on the speed at which you take the curves, the need for directional controls is eliminated thereby enhancing the streamlined feel and quick response of the vehicle.The race car itself is a clever design in which the vehicle can move in either a rightside or an upside down orientation which keeps the action moving. The car battery is recharged via the handset. The charging problems mentioned in other reviews can be avoided by following the manufacturer's recommendation to use Ion Lithium Batteries.The genius of this playset is that you can get pretty good pretty fast. Expertise feels possible since the super-charged excitement, reflexes and pace keep you engaged despite the challenges. It plays like a video game.Kaotiks has built fun - not frustration - into this playset. This is highly addictive and I highly recommend it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 2, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1MTWVKF5QQK4I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00E1EFHBI#wasThisHelpful","R1MTWVKF5QQK4I","A2ALMW6CSEEFBE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ALMW6CSEEFBE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Play is the work of children, and it's a childhood tradition to play house. Perhaps nothing captures the imagination like a dollhouse. Melissa & Doug are known for their wide range of toys, games, arts and crafts, puzzles and learning sets. Our family has purchased dozens of their products over the years. The Victorian Dollhouse was our biggest purchase, but we made it in confidence based on our experience with the quality of the brand.You won't be disappointed with this purchase the memory of which will stay with the gift recipient long after their dollhouse-playing days are over. Our kids enjoyed unwrapping their enormous box and helped us to assemble the pieces into the finished product. This is a solidly built, heavy and richly-detailed dollhouse. It looks handmade.The furniture and accessories are sold separately the expense of which makes it an ideal holiday or birthday gift. Don't buy the house if you aren't going to get some of the interior pieces at the same time. Of the 6 room sets, we started with the kitchen, bath, nursery and dining rooms since those had the most knick-knacks and doo-dads (also sold separately) that kids love. The doll family was added value, but not essential to their play since my kids enjoyed playing interior designers more than re-enacting family life.Given the cost of the house and the numerous set pieces, I highly recommend this dollhouse for the imaginative and mature child(ren) in your house. They will love it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 2, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RWMEOIKQ7B7EJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000GYSYSU#wasThisHelpful","RWMEOIKQ7B7EJ","A2ALMW6CSEEFBE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ALMW6CSEEFBE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The InCryptid novels were a lot of fun when they first started, but now they've started to bog down.  It doesn't help that Alexander Price is pretty boring as a protagonist, but the book was made worse by the incredible one-dimensionality of the supporting cast.  All of Shelby's family hates Alexander and the other Australians don't trust him.  That pretty much sums up the character development in the book.  The humor of the earlier InCryptid novels just felt flat in this offering, and Alexander himself lacked any real energy.  One of the problems that I've noticed with series that try to be humor-oriented is that they wind up fall flat on humor after a bit, and generally don't worry so much about character development in the meantime.  This is a shame, because the author has a really interesting and unique world that she's built up, but her characters seem to be meandering through it rather than bringing it to life in the last couple of books.  I will say that the author's take on werewolves and lycanthropy actually was pretty fresh, but it just wasn't enough to make this book truly interesting.I think the series could easily be salvaged, but only if the author moves away from Alexander as the main character.  The younger sister sounds dangerously interesting.","2.0 out of 5 stars","May 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1YJWRJNM8QMWZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MNNAOJ4#wasThisHelpful","R1YJWRJNM8QMWZ","A1ZY08GYVIKZFM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ZY08GYVIKZFM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a book that I wanted to like more than I did.  Several of the characters were developed well and the idea of how a vampire might be challenged during a zombie apocalypse was an interested cross-over concept.  Unfortunately, I didn't feel that the big conflict was really all that big and was over with way too little fanfare.  Also, the ""male"" leg of the male/female/female triangle felt like an arbitrary addition, as if the author decided to perpetuate the now-tired love triangle trope and just needed a guy for it.  Any guy would do.  To be fair, I felt that he female/female leg of the triangle was a little rushed, but at least there was an attempt to build some chemistry.Still, I think that the author set things up so that future adventures (if there were going to be any) have a lot of raw material to work with.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1KTZVUP7XY37K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QZVRZAG#wasThisHelpful","R1KTZVUP7XY37K","A1ZY08GYVIKZFM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ZY08GYVIKZFM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Looking at some of the other reviews, I couldn't help but wonder if they were reading the same book.  While the main character of Jessa had occasional bouts of entertainment value, her obsession with food quickly made her into a one-schtick pony personality-wise.  Even worse was that Jessa was still a deeper character than pretty much everyone else in the book.  The Compass brothers were, from a character-depth perspective, completely interchangeable.  The were all strong, intimidating, ""hunky,"" and obsessed with Jessa.  You could take any of their dialogue and if you hid the name of the brother, there would be no way of telling which of the four Compasses it was.  They were just that generic.  That was the extent of their ""personalities.""  The villains were generic in their villainy, and Jessa's family were bland in the extreme.  While I had hopes for Jessa as a character at times, they were quickly dashed.  In between bouts of crying and inconsistent behavior, Jessa wasn't much of a heroine.  She either needed rescuing by one of the strong, hunky men or when she did get herself out of situation, it was more by accident than design.  ""Wait, I have this new power / ability that randomly decided to manifest itself now and save me without any conscious effort on my part.  Oh joy, oh rapture.""As far as the notion of this being a fresh take on the genre, I can only imaging that the reader would have had to never have read other urban fantasy books.  There was nothing about the way that the different races worked that was unique at all, and the author seems to get the notion of ""powers"" and ""species"" badly confused.  The whole supernatural prison thing could have been interesting, but it didn't even really make sense that all those prisons would exist for such a comparably small population.  By the end of the novel, there really hadn't been a big (or even medium) confrontation, no real resolution to anything, and all we were left with was a rather weak cliff-hanger.","2.0 out of 5 stars","May 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R32I5K66ZJ7Q6S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SXKFAKO#wasThisHelpful","R32I5K66ZJ7Q6S","A1ZY08GYVIKZFM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ZY08GYVIKZFM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This was a tough book for me to review.  On one hand, I loved the world-building that the author performed, building an old-west, steampunk Rapid City from the ground up with a beautiful attention to detail.  That attention to detail unfortunately wound up causing problems, as the book took a really long time to get started (from an action standpoint) and never really built toward that crescendo that I was hoping for.  I liked the primary character pretty well, though there were times where she seemed to be more brave than truly heroic.  And while Memery (her spelling, not mine) had really developed a voice and personality all her own by the end of the book, none of the other characters came anywhere close, making them all pretty two-dimensional.And while I really, really wanted to support the Memery/Priya relationship (it's not easy to find a same-sex relationship as a primary relationship in a book which isn't specifically about same sex relationships), I felt the author forced it here.  Priya was never really developed as a character, and I never understood why Memery was drawn to her except . . . well, she was available?As I mentioned, I really wanted to like this a lot more and the book was very close to being truly special, but the author got so bogged down on developing her setting that the other aspects of a story that draws readers in suffered for it.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2P11XIHIGSJHP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LRWIDK4#wasThisHelpful","R2P11XIHIGSJHP","A1ZY08GYVIKZFM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ZY08GYVIKZFM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I really wanted to like this story more than I actually did.  The overall pacing was really good and we met a really interesting cast of characters.  Amber continues to impress with her depth as a protagonist.  Unfortunately, the normal cast of secondary characters was kind of wasted in this effort.  And after a really good build up to what promised to be an exciting confrontation, the author ran into the same problem that he did in the second book . . . politics broke out.  Much like in ""Hidden Trump,"" the author squashed any real sense of urgency toward the end by having a protracted political debate break out that drug on for far too long.  It was like watching Die Hard for 90 minutes, and then switching over to C-SPAN.  At least in ""Cool Hand,"" our protagonist actually did have a hand in the finale whereas in ""Hidden Trump,"" she was almost entirely a spectator at the end.I still really like the series overall.  I want to see Amber's personal relationships develop (particularly with Jen, who is considerably more interesting than Amber's werewolf paramour), and it'll be interesting to see how (it at all) Amber's familial relationships are repaired.

"This book started off as potentially interesting, with a fiery protagonist in Lyza.  She had a cause and an attitude.  Unfortunately, the author goes completely off of the rails shortly after the free sample was over.  The plot meanders all over the place like a drunk monkey on a pogo stick.  The reader is bounced from one character's perspective to another, and a number of these characters are pointless.  Initially, it seemed like the primaries were going to be Lyza and Adriana, and it think it would have benefited the writer to stick with those two.The author introduces characters and ""plot"" ideas and then discards them almost at random.  It felt like the story was written at a number of distinctly different times and the author never bothered to go back and look at what he'd been doing before.  Character development was inconsistent at best.  And then the author just sort of steers everything toward a second book toward the end, but there's really no chance that I'd be willing to invest time or money in it.

"It's strange to give such a low rating to a story with so many promising elements.  The world building was rich and detailed, and the primary Jeckyl/Hyde character of Eliza/Lizzie was absolutely fascinating.  Eliza was the scientific, steady one while Lizzie was the passionate, devil-may-care type, and either of them could have been a wonderful protagonist in her own right, and watching them attempt to come to some sort of understanding was a treat to read.My frustration with this book was that Eliza/Lizzie was an amazing character who was utterly wasted.  The woman/women were supposed to be inordinately clever, and yet were outsmarted and outmatched at every turn.  Every major clue is basically handed to her by one of the male characters, all of whom seemed to be deceiving her and she was constantly in a state of surprise by this.  She never really figured anything out until it was too late or until it was handed to her on a silver platter.  I never really felt that she ""bested"" anyone.  I don't want to have a protagonist made up to be a strong, female character, and then have her either need the aid of (or to be rescued by) her male counterparts, much less have her seem to be constantly duped.  And the author spends so much time desperately throwing red herrings and false accusations into the mix that I was able to guess who the culprit was simply because this individual was the only one who DIDN'T have suspicion thrown their way.This could have been one of the best books that I'd read in a while, but the author just didn't do the story any justice with her remarkable main character.","2.0 out of 5 stars","April 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R18AHN2M3RNK9L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KFG44VK#wasThisHelpful","R18AHN2M3RNK9L","A1ZY08GYVIKZFM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ZY08GYVIKZFM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"While I liked the idea of twins as the primary characters and the author's decision to avoid an arbitrary romance in this initial effort, nothing really came together.  The characters were pretty underdeveloped (despite periodic clever snark), the plot just blundered along without any real sense of urgency, and the author's attempt to throw in a ""twist"" at the end felt more like a random afterthought.  Overall, it was just flat and anticlimactic, and there wasn't enough here to make me willing to invest in a second book.","2.0 out of 5 stars","April 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1EP0YIEG4VI9Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MXS6X8K#wasThisHelpful","R1EP0YIEG4VI9Q","A1ZY08GYVIKZFM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ZY08GYVIKZFM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"While there were some interesting basic concepts here (magic vs. science-based agents), everything felt way rushed.  The author never really explains why the two groups are at odds, and there really isn't anything beyond the most superficial attempt at character development.  Since all the characters were paper-thin, the underlying relationships were also shallow.  It was a short novella already, and it felt like the author rushed through everything and didn't quite do anything well.","2.0 out of 5 stars","April 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RTQFSZW667ZLD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TWUVA5S#wasThisHelpful","RTQFSZW667ZLD","A1ZY08GYVIKZFM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ZY08GYVIKZFM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I like the character of Kate Prospero and thought that this book was a reliable (if not overly inspired) addition to the series.  It really is a pretty cool concept for a world, with potions and alchemy taking the place of more traditional wizardry/magic or vampires and werewolves.  Kate is the quintessential tortured soul trying to walk the straight and narrow after a rocky upbringing, and she as a character is intriguing.Unfortunately, the primary plot was a little sluggish for me, and the main villain was a little too distant from the action until the end.  Also, I dislike how the author seems intent to make Volos a love interest despite a lack of chemistry (or any reason to be attracted) between he and Kate.  The rest of the supporting cast felt a bit wooden this time around, and Danny (Kate's brother) is so incredibly annoying that I actually wanted something bad to happen to him.  I also felt that Kate spent a little bit too much time apologizing when she hadn't done anything wrong.I think that I'm still interested in following the adventures of Kate Prospero, but more out of a sense of approval of the underlying world building than the events of this particular novel.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RKCDNRVPZODJX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00H25FCIQ#wasThisHelpful","RKCDNRVPZODJX","A1ZY08GYVIKZFM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ZY08GYVIKZFM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These book was so unexceptional that I had to give up on it halfway through, and that takes a lot with me.  The primary character of Raven is a boring rehash of pretty much every ""rebel cop"" from any 80's movie or television show that you can imagine.  The character has no depth, and responds in exactly the same way to every situation: she shoots it.  What's worse is that the character is supposed to be a policewoman and yet, despite humans not known about vampires or the like, she isn't held accountable at all by her human counterparts.  When being a half-vampire isn't the least believable thing in the book, then you know that you have a problem.It doesn't help that there isn't a single character in the book that has any personality.  Normally, a good supporting cast of characters can help make even a mediocre book tolerable, but this story couldn't even provide those.  Even the villains were boring.  The apparent love interest of Levac certainly doesn't help matters, and I couldn't figure out for the life of me why he's a possible love interest.  Over the course of 3 books, there was zero chemistry between he and Raven.  Of course, it's difficult to have chemistry when you lack any actual character depth.  Raven herself was incapable of actually figuring anything out (because she was too busy randomly shooting it).  The author kept using the ""felt it was important but didn't know why,"" which is usually a sign that the protagonist isn't actually going to figure anything else until she is handed a big old ""reveal"" late in the book that she didn't do anything to earn.  It's hard to rate the underlying plot itself because it was navigating by paper-thin characters.","2.0 out of 5 stars","March 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ORBWOCNDUAQI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RVYW4FW#wasThisHelpful","R1ORBWOCNDUAQI","A1ZY08GYVIKZFM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ZY08GYVIKZFM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"At first, I really thought this was going to be a good book.  The plot seemed promising, and there were aspects of the primary protagonist that made it seem that she could be interesting.  There was a subtle snarkiness to her that I initially enjoyed.  Also, it seemed that the author wasn't going to force an arbitrary romantic interest down the readers' throats . . . at first.  Then about halfway through the book, everything took a turn for the worse.  We were introduced to the concept of ""shades"" as a group, but the reason for their existence was poorly developed and executed.  We wound up with an incredibly arbitrary ""relationship"" for Ayala that was wholly unbelievably, even for an urban fantasy book.  There was never a particularly good or even coherent reason for why the antagonist (who turned out to be a witch) was doing what they were doing, except maybe that they had to act evil because every book needed an evil person.  By the end of the book, I was just happy for it to be over, and don't think I can muster any interest in subsequent books.","2.0 out of 5 stars","March 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1HPS8K2K1JR4Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SF5AWV4#wasThisHelpful","R1HPS8K2K1JR4Z","A1ZY08GYVIKZFM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ZY08GYVIKZFM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Yeah, I'm not quite sure what the point of this book was.  The premise made it seem like it could be fun, and the main character initially seemed like she might be someone I could grow to like, but it turned out she was just a horrible person.  None of the secondary characters were likable either.  In other words, no characters in this book had any redeeming features whatsoever.  The plot just kind of meandered from place to place with no end in sight with our unlikable protagonist doing what felt like the same thing over and over.  The erotic bits weren't even particularly erotic and the action, which started as funny, just became tedious.

"There were hints of potential throughout the book, but none of them were ever realized.  It was weird reading the blurbs associated with this book that say things like ""mixes laughter"" and ""oozes sexual chemistry,"" since this book had nothing resembling humor and zero chemistry of any kind.The beginning of the story seemed to bumble along and then the reader finds himself (or herself) on a rather lackluster plot where you never even encounter the villains until the very end and there's an encounter that really had no sense of gravity to it at all.  It didn't help that none of the characters in the book had anything resembling a personality.  They were, A) Generic attractive woman with strange powers, B) Generic and incredibly predictable love interest with a tortured soul, and C) Generic best friend.  Even the villains, once we finally meet them, are bland, and villains are where the author generally has the most creative license.  And while I've already mentioned the predictability of the love interest, I think it is worth mentioning that the author makes no effort to actually develop chemistry between the two primary characters.  It breaks down to both characters are attractive and in proximity, therefor they must long for one another.  The insidious plan of the generic villains (the plan itself had a lot of potential for drama that was never really realized) seemed secondary to the tedious meanderings of Thierry and her incubus paramour.","2.0 out of 5 stars","February 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1IAVKP5MGVDPZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00O99U15C#wasThisHelpful","R1IAVKP5MGVDPZ","A1ZY08GYVIKZFM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ZY08GYVIKZFM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Having read Weldon before, I was initially excited to see something new outside of the Zoe Martinique series, which I thought had grown a bit stale.  Unfortunately, the first book of the Eldritch Files was chocked full of flaws.  First, there were spelling/grammatical mistakes (e.g. Getting ""right"" and ""write"" mixed up).  Secondly, the author kept referencing things that happened prior to this story that seemed more like bits from another story rather than just general background, as if there was a prequel or some other kind of short story that set up the Eldritch Files that we should know about.  If I read a book that is the first part of a series, it bugs me when I already feel like I'm missing something.  Thirdly, the main character is initially made out to be some kind of powerful witch, but she is pretty much outmaneuvered and outsmarted at every turn.  Fourthly, the author keeps throwing swerves at the reader to try and make the story seem more clever than it was, but after a while the swerving just felt random.  Finally, none of the characters really had any personality, and left me with very little interest in finding out what happens to them (or the story in general) next.","2.0 out of 5 stars","February 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2RXL9C92OTQG7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RNIX4OQ#wasThisHelpful","R2RXL9C92OTQG7","A1ZY08GYVIKZFM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ZY08GYVIKZFM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Well after a fairly limited amount of use, this case wound up failing in every way that mattered.  It was really difficult to get it to stay in place.  The ""velcro"" part was less velcro and more of a light adhesive that lost its tackiness really quickly.  This meant that if your arm had any muscle on it at all, bending your arm can cause the band to pop open and leave you scrambling to grab your smartphone before it hits the floor.  It was so snug on my Nokia Lumia that I couldn't access the side controls very easily.

"What the heck happened?  The previous book (""Iced"") was an interesting story with a novel character, and I was looking forward to the confrontation between Mac and Dani.  While ""Iced"" did most things right, ""Burned"" did everything wrong.  First, it seems that Mac had turned into a vapid, pointless, mouth-breathing excuse for a heroine that turns into a drooling idiot anytime that a dreamy, hunky man crosses her line of sight or even crosses her mind.  It's like the author completely forgot how to balance an active lead's romantic interests with being a useful and proactive heroine.  Mac degenerated in this book from what she had been in previous efforts.  She seemed to lose every argument that she had with anyone, particularly the dreamy, hunky men.Also, the author managed to totally ruin the character of Dani.  Dani used to be the most interesting character, partially because we got to see what a young, rambunctious, and fearless young woman could be as she developed her superhero chops.  The author decided that rather than continue what was previously a successful bit of character development, that she wanted to instead bypass that and artificially age Dani.  She turned a unique character who could grow into being an adult into a full-fledged commando sex-bomb with none of the characteristics that made Dani special.  My guess is that the author wants to have another once-promising character be available for sexy-times with all the misogynistic, dreamy, hunky men that she's populated her books with.The story itself was fairly lame, taking a long time to develop and not really having what I would normally consider to be a ""big conflict.""  While most of the story was from Mac's point of view, there were a number of shifts to the perspective of other characters, all of which felt random and none of which were necessary for the story.  I've also become somewhat tired of ""the Nine.""  They're all huge and muscular and dreamy and they win every philosophical point when they engage in debate with the women-folk.I'm not sure why the author decided to go from a good urban fantasy story with an integrated romance angle to a bad romance in an urban fantasy setting, but I'm disappointed by the entire effort.  When I finished ""Iced,"" I was really looking for to ""Burned,"" and burned is just what I got.

"This book fell short in pretty much every way, not just overall length.  While the primary character had a lot of potential, I never really felt that she actually developed a personality, and ALL of the secondary characters were flat as paper.  This is a big problem because when the main character lacks personality and the plot isn't that interesting (both of which are the case here), you need a really good supporting cast to keep reader interest.  The villain was a complete non-entity, just thrown into the book because books need villains.  Again, there was no real personality there, no real excitement or tension  to the big confrontation, and there was no mystery in figuring out who it was because the good guys for the most part stumble on the antagonist by accident.  There is of course a romantic interest who is introduced with all the subtlety of a jackhammer outside your window at two o'clock in the morning, and there is no attempt to develop any chemistry between he and Jade.  Instead, we're treated to the typical, ""They don't like each other but he's hot so they must be attracted to each other"" nonsense.  If this entire thing were condensed to ten pages and turned into an epilogue for a book about Jade an her evil ex (who seems to be a more interesting adversary than the one that we saw here), then I might not be so annoyed, but instead the reader is given a fairly lackluster heroine with boring sidekicks and generic romantic interest facing an utterly uninteresting villain.","2.0 out of 5 stars","September 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1NKV20KE1Y5ZV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00M9WCUOQ#wasThisHelpful","R1NKV20KE1Y5ZV","A1ZY08GYVIKZFM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ZY08GYVIKZFM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Well, I really hope that this was the end of the series but, if not, it's definitely the end for me.  This book was such a mess.  Much like the end of the Aneka Jansen series, the author decided to bounce from one character's perspective to the next with no thought for story flow, giving the whole novel a very disjointed feel.  Every character that Teasdale had lying around got some paragraphs or pages told from their view.  There were multiple plots that could have been major but all just sort of sputtered and died with a profound lack of build-up or drama to any of them.  The author had made his main character so powerful that there was no mystery at all, because you knew that not only would Ceri survive, but that she wouldn't ever really be challenged.  Sure you can see if any of the supporting cast gets offed, but its hard to build tension if your main character's unfettered success is a foregone conclusion.  Then there was a rather random attempt to change or examine the dynamic between Ceri's partners which felt utterly random and unnecessary.  The author finally stopped trying to include sex on every page, which would have been an interesting change of pace if he had replaced it with an actual cohesive story.  Instead, Teasdale was just trying to wrap up lots of random threads that didn't even need to be wrapped up and wound up delivering a grab bag of ideas that left me rather unsatisfied as a reader.","2.0 out of 5 stars","August 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RA43J16KV3VX2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MRWB986#wasThisHelpful","RA43J16KV3VX2","A1ZY08GYVIKZFM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ZY08GYVIKZFM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"While her acting skills could still use some polish (mostly in delivering her dialogue), watching Gina Carano in an action film is refreshing.  It is one of those rare occasions where they put an attractive woman in an action role and it doesn't feel like they took some eye candy and showed her some martial arts moves.  Carano can sell the action like a boss and the fight scenes alone in this are worth the price of admission.  Throw in a fairly talented supporting cast, a beautiful backdrop for the story, and this wound up being a surprisingly entertaining action flick.  I hope more producers and directors take note of Carano's performance because, like in Haywire, she proved how a strong female protagonist can and should carry a movie like this.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2F4L192AFAUCS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00J2MQ06U#wasThisHelpful","R2F4L192AFAUCS","A1ZY08GYVIKZFM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ZY08GYVIKZFM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm kind of glad that I didn't read this book before Kay's ""Good Intentions"" and ""Natural Consequences"" books, because I probably wouldn't have risked them.  ""Poor Man's Fight"" is a poorly organized mess of a book.  None of the characters are likable or interesting.  The author switches perspectives often, usually with every chapter but sometimes within chapters.  A little less than half of what I read (about 50 percent of the book) is following the rather dull Tanner through boot camp, which was really, really boring.  The rest of the book to that point had been following space pirates and these pirate are indeed bad guys.  I'm not sure if the author was trying to paint them as sympathetic rebels or something because if he was, he failed.  These pirates are ""kill innocents for fun and profit"" types with a paper-thin coating of ""sticking it to the man.""The plot itself was . . . not really there.  Halfway through the book, there was really no convergence (or even an attempt at convergence) for the two totally disparate halves of the book.  Even skimming, it was borderline painful to get through each page.  With the Tanner story line, it was because the character was boring.  With the pirate story line, it was because everyone was unlikable.

The main character (Zelda) is a whining, insipidly boring, and mostly oblivious protagonist who spends a lot of time question anything that resembled good luck, hemming and hawing about if she's attracted to someone, and then worrying about her financial situation.  She was incredibly uninteresting as a character, but even she was more well developed than the Jessica character.  Trista was a little more interesting, but not enough to save the book.  The characters, the plot (such as it was), and the romances were all hopelessly flat and uninspired, and there was nothing here that would make me want to follow the story forward.","2.0 out of 5 stars","August 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2SI1KWGXI38UD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00M3D4CDS#wasThisHelpful","R2SI1KWGXI38UD","A1ZY08GYVIKZFM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ZY08GYVIKZFM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Like some other readers, I gave this book a shot because the premise sounding interesting and definitely outside the mainstream urban fantasy cliches.  The supporting cast (e.g. Murphy, the leprechaun, etc.) had potential to make things interesting as well.  But being unique doesn't help much if the underlying story just isn't good.  Karma was definitely not good.  First, the main character was really annoying in a childish kind of way, which made it difficult to get behind her.  The storyline itself couldn't quite figure out if it was supposed to be a serious idea, a comedy, or some combination of them. It was probably going for the latter, and just didn't pull it off well at all. And of course there was the incredibly badly done romance angle.  The entirety of romance seemed to be, ""I hate him (Fate) and have no reason at all to like him, therefore I'm attracted to him.""  Bleh.  I'm not sure why some authors think this is a good way to build a primary relationship, and I guess that it is mostly just a lack of desire to do it the right way.  Anyway, I got a third of the way through this before deciding that I had absolutely no interest in what happened to the primary character and moved on to better stories.","2.0 out of 5 stars","August 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RC1Q69JHLGW9M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LMNRWQ4#wasThisHelpful","RC1Q69JHLGW9M","A1ZY08GYVIKZFM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ZY08GYVIKZFM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Wow, was this ever bad.  I'm not sure what the creators of this movie were trying to accomplish but unless it was to make my ears cringe, then I don't think that they succeeded.  While there was some friendly chemistry between the primary characters, the rest of the movie was just atrocious.  The acting was bad, and the music was even worse.  I wasn't expecting a musical, but the performances were so bad that I'm not sure this wound up qualifying.  The romance angle wound up being very disappointing, the humor fell flat all the way across the board, and the story just dragged.  I really wish that I could say something positive here because I would like to support these independent projects that are inclusive of the LGBT community but from an entertainment standpoint, this movie just didn't have anything to offer.","1.0 out of 5 stars","July 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3GWMXJBWU3NS0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009BQJ4GK#wasThisHelpful","R3GWMXJBWU3NS0","A1ZY08GYVIKZFM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ZY08GYVIKZFM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I never thought that I would say this about a Mercedes Lackey book, but ""Children of the Night"" was plant, flat-out boring.  Over the first half of the book, our normally brave protagonist does . . . nothing.  Okay, she has conversations with friends, gets drunk, and complains about how hard her job is (the same job that she doesn't seem to be doing), but that's it.  Then the author has us following ""Dave"" around, who's about as insipid and uninteresting of a character as you could ever hope to avoid.  He falls in with the dark and sinister crowd, gets in over his head, and then the reader is subjected to he and Tragarde running into each other and there's a lot of staring across a crowded room and other dreamy-eyed (and dreamy-thought-process) nonsense.  I actually got so tired of not seeing the main character (or who I thought the main character was) do anything and being forced to follow the incredibly dull back story that I just gave up.  I'm certainly not willing to give up on Lackey, but this may be the last of this series for me.","2.0 out of 5 stars","July 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R26EZA1Q2TB2Y2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JOOQE1M#wasThisHelpful","R26EZA1Q2TB2Y2","A1ZY08GYVIKZFM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ZY08GYVIKZFM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This was a pretty good read overall.  I thought that the main character of Elise was interesting in a prickly way, but I also saw plenty of room for growth (which the author seemed successful in doing).  There were some secondary characters that had appeal, though the romance angle seemed to be thrown in at random because . . . well, these books are supposed to have romances, right?  The action was plentiful and well thought out, and there was never any part of the book that dragged (which is pretty impressive considering the glut of urban fantasy books out there).  The ending was a good setup for a second novel and gave the author lots of paths to follow.There were two big problems for me that kept this book from getting a slightly higher rating.  The first were how the flashback sequences were integrated.  The author attempted to tell some of the back story through chapter-long flashbacks that are interspersed at odd intervals throughout the book, and it really kept me from getting a good rhythm going while reading.  Also, I was really confused as to what exactly Elise was supposed to be (or what the source of her powers was).  She was obviously a more-than-she-appears heroine, but the author really didn't do a good job of explaining why (or even giving any hints that made sense).  Still, there was enough there to draw me in for round 2, which is more than a lot of these series has been able to do.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R13N2FGOY0AITR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AQZX4BG#wasThisHelpful","R13N2FGOY0AITR","A1ZY08GYVIKZFM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ZY08GYVIKZFM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm almost surprised at how much I liked the second installment of the series.  There were a few issues to be sure, but the main character has an abundance of actual personality (and most of it is actually likable!), the dialogue is sharp and clever, and the secondary characters are interesting.  Heck, I'd be happy to read an entire novel about Kate's assistant, who is the (semi) living embodiment of the ""straight man"" (in comedic terms).  There's a good overarching story line that actually kept me engaged for the majority of the story.  I also like the ongoing ""Kate's Obituary"" jokes that continued from the first book.One problem that I had was that there was a plot-line toward the beginning that seemed like it was going to be major and then really wasn't in that it just sort of resolved itself and wound up not seeming to have a major impact on the big conflict.  Also, while once was all right, I found it rather weird that Kate Kane was apparently still attracted to ALL of her exes, all of whom showed up in this book.  Hopefully in the next novel (and I hope there will be one), we can look forward a bit more toward Kate's future and less about her past.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2SX2JAIC21QZU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00L0LJX06#wasThisHelpful","R2SX2JAIC21QZU","A1ZY08GYVIKZFM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ZY08GYVIKZFM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"While I think the idea behind this book wasn't bad, the delivery wasn't quite there.  The notion of controlled chaos or chaos magic was an interesting one, but the author wasn't quite successful in explaining what it was (at least not to my satisfaction).  The action jumped from incident to incident, but didn't flow very well overall.  There were several dead-end streets in regard to plot directions (the author would pursue a particular avenue that really didn't feel like it went anywhere), and then the character is back home again with the feeling that the reader is starting over.  You are able to see the participants in the final conflict coming a mile away.  Also, none of the characters really have much of a personality except MAYBE the best friend, and even that wound up seeming like more of cartoon that a real character.  Throw in a romance that seemed to be added simply because these books usually have one, and you wind up with a good idea that really fails to differentiate itself in most ways from the thousands of other straight-to-ebook urban fantasy novels that are out there.","2.0 out of 5 stars","July 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1T05CHIMMY8Z7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HXZN0UC#wasThisHelpful","R1T05CHIMMY8Z7","A1ZY08GYVIKZFM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ZY08GYVIKZFM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have to admit that I see most of this author's works as falling into the guilty pleasure: an almost fluffy combination of softcore erotica and sci-fi/fantasy geek fun.  Doing a superhero(ine) sequence is right up Teasdale's alley.  I get more fun out of them than most books at this price, that's for sure.Unfortunately, I did have some issues with this book.  First, the perspective shifts (bouncing from one character to another) happen way too often, making it really hard to get any kind of rhythm going while reading the book.  It was a big complaint that I had toward the end of the Aneka Jansen series, which I hoped the author had outgrown.  With two main characters and a couple of secondary characters all getting face time, it got . . . well, not difficult, but frustrating at time to follow the action.  Also, while the tension between the primary main character and her roommate was inevitable, it wasn't handled as well as it was in the Thaumatology books and felt very glossed over at the end.  Also, there were a lot of secondary characters that were introduced that didn't seem to fulfill a real purpose, and it would probably be better for the author to really develop the primaries and then save the plethora of other ultras for later.Still, overall, I found it to be an intriguing enough setup (particularly for the price) that I'll probably give the series another chance.  Hopefully the author will stop the perspective bouncing or at least tone it down, because that's the most problematic element that I found so far.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 3, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2AA5L2Q4W38QS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KU28VCW#wasThisHelpful","R2AA5L2Q4W38QS","A1ZY08GYVIKZFM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ZY08GYVIKZFM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Linda Larsen's ""The Complete Slow Cooking for Two"" cookbook is an excellent introduction to creative slow-cooked meals. The dishes in this cookbook will be familiar to Americans, but that doesn't mean it doesn't include some interesting dishes from other cultures because it does--there are Indian and Korean recipes, too.If you don't have a lot of time, or would like to spend less time cooking, this is the book for you. The range of dishes in it will prepare you to be able to translate recipes not geared towards slow cookers into tried and true slow-cooker recipes. Larsen sets up the cookbook with stories from couples in different situations who needed to cook for two and eventually ended up relying on their slow cooker and it changed the way they ate for the better. This book is great because you can relate to the stories and it just serves to reinforce that you are not alone in not wanting or being able to spend a lot of time cooking, and that is great motivation to keep at the slow cooking until it becomes second nature.I like that Larsen goes over ""layering"" quite a bit to emphasize the importance of the order in which you place the ingredients in your slow cooker so you end up with the right texture of ingredients, and everything cooks the way it should. For example--putting small veggies like corn at the top to keep them from getting soggy. That's a great tip.This is a big cookbook with a lot of great recipes to get you started. I like that it made grocery shopping easier for me, because I just look at the recipes for the week and go with the ingredients on the list.

"Marye Audet has done a fabulous job with the Mexican Slow Cooker Cookbook. This book has changed the way I approach the food I prepare at home. Thanks to this book, I have been been seeking out more interesting and flavorful cultural recipes from around the world.Mexican is by far my favorite kind of food. Audet's Cookbook is full of quick, easy, fool-proof recipes that cover all the basic traditional (or maybe just popular in the US) Mexican dishes. What I like about this Cookbook is its layout: It is easy to read, and formatted in a consistent manner. I also really love that the text is colorful. All of the ingredients pop against the rest of the page in a beautiful turquoise. This is great because when I'm reading a recipe, I like to easily find the measurements of the ingredients while I'm reading the steps to take. The format of the book as a whole is that it is divided up into what part of which meal the dish would be served in: Entres, Desserts, Breakfast, etc.I'm not a skilled chef, or even cook of any kind. I was cooking boring staple dishes before getting this cookbook, and only pulled out my slow cooker once every other month or so. I never really thought I could create delicious and complex dishes that I would be proud to serve any guest. Now, I think of all sorts of things I can make in my slow cooker, not just Mexican, but all types of food. This book is a good primer in that way because you learn how to layer things in your slow cooker, which is a skill you can apply to any recipe.I highly recommend the Mexican Slow Cooker Cookbook to anyone who likes quick, easy, fool-proof and delicious meals. I think that's most people!

"This mouse was very close to getting a 5-star rating for me, if it were not for one tiny detail that makes a big enough difference to irritate me almost constantly when using this mouse. On the scroll wheel, there's a lip of plastic that seems like was accidentally fused onto the wheel, so when scrolling with the wheel, once a revolution I hit this bump of plastic that really irritates me. It's a rather shallow or short mouse, as it's more flat than rounded. I did not have any problems with the connection or using the mouse. I probably just got a bad one with the plastic on the wheel. This is now my travel mouse that I take with me on weekends away from home to visit my parents. That way, if I leave it there I'm not as irritated, and I only have to use it for a short period of time so the bump also kind of limits how much time I want to spend on the computer versus with my family.

"Lucentee's large ice ball maker was the perfect gift for my whiskey-loving, whisky aficionado boyfriend. At first he thought this was just some junk I bought. Until I made a batch, he saw me drinking my drink with an ice ball in it, and the light bulb went off in his head that this is perfect for whisky because of the rate at which it melts, and how it maximizes its surface area. You have to make sure you really get a tight seal for the ice balls to come out perfectly round, and even then, it's hard to fill it up to the top so that none spills out and you don't have a little flat part at the top when the water hardens into ice.

The nose part is really wide.

"This is an interesting product. I thought it worked differently than the way it does, before I got the product and used it. It sticks to the top of your bowl because it has a series of rings that are about 1/2 inch apart, so if you stretch it, the rings catch on the outside of the bowl and are supposed to stay put. But if you have anything slick around the edges of the bowl, you'll see it slip off, so make sure the bowl is dry around the rim before using this product.

"This books has its strengths and weaknesses. To make things simple, here's my list:STRENGTHS:Full color screenshotsIt's a workbookVisually engaging, except for the font.WEAKNESSES:Not enough examples - it says things like ""what value does your business offer?"" without giving examples for those who are just starting out building a small businessVery dryPretty boringIt's a workbook - if you use it as you learn you need to use pencil to erase your old answers.It doesn't feel like a workbook - It feels too small and nice to write all over. An online workbook would be more helpfulIf you do not have business acumen or coding experience, this book is not going to help you. If you sort of already know what you're doing and would like a book to guide you or remind you on what to do, then this is a good book for you. However, if you're already at that level, I wonder why you wouldn't be able to find your answers online, through WordPress help, chat or other forums, but maybe that's just me.Overall, I feel as though this particular book doesn't explain enough in detail. The workbook aspect asks a lot of questions without guiding you towards the best fitting answer for your situation. If you do well with that sort of learning, and are a ""big-picture"" person, then I strongly encourage you to purchase this book.

"WordPress for Dummies is like an encyclopedia for all of WordPress because it covers so many topics! I can't name a topic this book doesn't cover. Well, it doesn't go over every plug-in, but it does go over the ten most popular which is helpful because once you get a handle on those, you can get a feel for not only how to use plug-ins, but to figure out which ones you might want or need for your site. And this example demonstrates how I see the book. It gives you all the fundamentals you need and goes over the basics so you know how to navigate WordPress.What I found most difficult about WordPress before reading this book was figuring out how to make my website shine without paying for all the easy add-ons. Having read this book, I feel a lot more comfortable managing my site and even helping others with their websites. The step-by-step ""how to"" instructions are great. The books tells you which urls to enter and where to find what you need to click on next to get what you need done. I won't say I'm a WordPress expert, but now I know a whole lot more, and I know what I don't know, as opposed to before when I didn't even have a clue as to what I needed to learn to ""make things go.""This book is well-written, which makes it easy to read and follow along on my computer. Instructions are detailed yet clear. I can recommend this book to anyone starting out on WordPress as a great place to start to cover all your bases.

"I took Financial Accounting in business school as an undergrad. There were over 100 students in my section, which was one of three taught by the professor that semester. There were over a dozen TA's. Let's just say I didn't learn much from that class. I was reluctant to dive back into accounting after that experience, but I have to help run my father's business as he's getting older.This book has been so helpful. It's a friendly introduction to accounting that just tells you the important stuff you need to know to keep your business on track. It explains what different kinds of statements are and when to use them. In college, it was like I was getting papers and balance sheets thrown my way and I was ducking out of the way, and couldn't make sense of how to put what I was learning together to actually be USEFUL in the world.Accounting for Small Business Owners is great because it uses plain language that is easy to understand, with lots of examples to learn from. There are sample statements in the book to show you what these documents should look like, which I find really helpful. Reading this book is like sitting down with a friend who happens to be an accountant who explains things really well. It's amazing how simple this stuff can be when it's explained the right way.

"It rather small but the sound is pleasant.  The packaging was good and each bell was individually wrapped.  The centers ball were not lined up properly with the bells, so I very gently but firmly had to move them down about 1/2 inch or so.  The sound is pleasant enough but it is very quiet and takes a bit of a breeze to move them.  I will keep them but I'm not that impressed.

"Surprised by the number of positive reviews, this is a pretty mediocre BBQ tool in my opinion.  I was looking for something to give me better control at handling burgers after using a friend's hybrid spatula-tongs, a tool I thought looked quite gimmicky until I used it.  I had high hopes for this product given the positive reviews.With this version however, the handle isn't long enough to protect you from direct heat, and the spatula section isn't wide enough to really function as a spatula.  It isn't any better at handling delicate items like loosely compressed burger patties than a decent set of normal BBQ tongs.I will keep looking, and this will likely fall to the back of my utensil drawer.  It's not a poorly made product, just doesn't function any better than a standalone spatula or tongs and the handle is too short to use over high temp direct heat (I use Meathead's reverse sear from amazing ribs, with very high direct heat at the end).","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R85AZN65UBQUE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZHKB7IM#wasThisHelpful","R85AZN65UBQUE","A2YOSGV8YE3NJ8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2YOSGV8YE3NJ8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I travel quite a bit and thought this would be useful for hotels.  I don't view something like this as a high security lock, rather as something to prevent someone with a key (i.e. at a hotel, where LOTS of staff have access to your room, or in a rental situation, where again depending on the situation numerous people could have keys such as apartment staff or former tenants and anyone those people shared a key with) from easily or non-forcefully entering an occupied dwelling.I traveled with this only once, but concluded this isn't going to work for me.  The first problem is in the product design itself - the cutout for the door latch is far too small to fit the latches that seem to be common at commercial building such as hotels, which are larger than typical residential latches.  The cutout seems sized more for what you encounter on a residential door.  So for hotels that were built or renovated within say the last 25 years, I think this is not going to fit the latch in the majority of cases.The second problem was, when I was returning home, the TSA wanted to open my carry on bag after running it through the belt.  I got a good look at the screen and this does looks like it could easily be confused with a weapon to the TSA personnel.  I didn't end up having a problem, but I prefer to get through security as quickly and efficiently as possible and having them open my bag is a big inconvenience for me.  You could take it out along w/ your liquids etc. and place separately on the belt, but this is also an added inconvenience.  Granted, I am going on a sample size of only 2 (one flight out when it didn't result in my bag getting searched, the return flight where it did), but based on what it looked like on the screen I could see this being a problem regularly.So, we have a product that 1) isn't going to fit the majority of hotel doors, and 2) is likely to delay you in getting through airport security.  Combined these two issues make this an unviable product as a travel/hotel lock, in my opinion.  I give it 2 stars instead of 1 as I could see that for renters in say an apartment, if this happens to fit your door, it could be useful for you although in that situation you'd be better off asking your landlord if you can pay to change out or rekey your lock.  For my intended (and apparently a lot of peoples') intended use for hotels, it's of quite limited use and a potential travel hassle in my opinion.","2.0 out of 5 stars","October 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1FWDRN01D8IW1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00186URTY#wasThisHelpful","R1FWDRN01D8IW1","A2YOSGV8YE3NJ8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2YOSGV8YE3NJ8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I live in a 3-story contemporary house with a lot of windows, many of which are high up and/or at odd angles ... basically an out of work professional window washers' wet dream.  Before hiring a pro, I decided to order this along with some ettore products (18"" squeegees, washer, their concentrated washing solution, the bucket, and the scraper).I found this to be highly useful, and I was able to clean all of my windows myself.  Using this extension pole, I was able to reach windows up to my 2nd story without the use of a ladder, although I did have to use my ladder for some third story windows.  I was afraid the angle would be odd squeegeeing with this fully or mostly extended but that wasn't the case.  I was even able to effectively use the scraper attached to this on some second story windows.I did not have any difficulty retracting this back in after use, as some other reviewers have noted.  That said, because I had read their reviews, I took special care not to lock it in to tight - you do not have to tighten it very much!  Err on the side of less tight, and if that doesn't lock it in place gradually and gently tighten further.  To be fair I have only used this once so far, but I used it on my entire exterior of my house so there was quite a bit of extending and retracting involved.  I only used this on the exterior of my house, as I felt using the method of the ettore washer dipped in a bucket of solution results in way too much water dripping everywhere than I'd want inside, so for inside I filled a spray bottle w/ the diluted ettore solution, sprayed it on and squeegeed off.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1IMTHBE325W5K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000LNRR7A#wasThisHelpful","R1IMTHBE325W5K","A2YOSGV8YE3NJ8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2YOSGV8YE3NJ8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'd have looked at quite a number of products for secure but quickly accessible firearms storage, and I came to the conclusion that the simplex style locks are probably the best available lock type for this application as they are reasonably secure, quick and simple to access including in the dark and/or under stress, and reliable.  I personally would not trust anything with an electronic lock for any firearm I keep for defensive purposes.  Many of the locking mechanisms on competing quick access ""safes"" are pretty insecure, google deviant ollam's video ""safe to armed in seconds"" although to be fair he doesn't review any simplex type lock products.  Finally, the configurability of the simplex combinations, which have the option of including multiple buttons at a time, gives the user the option of choosing a more simple code or a more complicated one depending on need (i.e. if you don't have kids and thus don't need much security, you could make a very simple one or two button press ""combination"").This container is reasonably well constructed and size wise provides a good balance of interior space vs. compactness.  It easily fits an AR style carbine w/ red dot optic with enough room for a holstered handgun, a few mags, backup flashlight etc.  It would similarly fit a typical defensive type shotgun (i.e. 18-20"" barrel).  Security wise keep in mind any of these quick access safes are intended mainly to keep guns out of unauthorized hands (i.e. children, or an intruder from quickly accessing your gun) for the purposes of preventing an accident, they are a compromise between security and the ability to access quickly, and consequently they are not high security ""safes"" designed to prevent theft although if bolted down would be much better than nothing.As far as I know, for long guns, this is the best product I'm aware of currently on the market.  For handguns, I prefer the FAS1 product which utilizes the same simplex style Illinois lock but is much more solidly constructed.  I own both products and I consider it a big advantage that both use the same lock type (I have them programmed with the same combo).  5 because I think this is the best product out there, although the construction is good but not great.  I'd love to see a better constructed FAS1 type product in this size, although it would be significantly heavier and more expensive (which is why I don't deduct a star, for the price I think this is as good a product as one can reasonably expect).","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3BKJ9KKCBDHQM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000T2A6BW#wasThisHelpful","R3BKJ9KKCBDHQM","A2YOSGV8YE3NJ8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2YOSGV8YE3NJ8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I recently did a garage organization project and looked at a number of gladiator products.  For cabinets, I ended up getting Newage pro over the gladiator product as the gladiators look a little cheap/cheasy to me and they don't have much interior space due to lack of depth, and a lack of height on their taller cabinets.For shelves though, the gladiator product looked like a winner.  I ordered and am very happy with them.  They are very sturdy, deep enough to be quite useful, and extremely easy to assemble, requiring no tools.  It recommends 2 people to assemble, but I did it myself no problem.The only caveat I'd mention is,  I was in Costco yesterday and they had what appears to be an extremely similar shelf (possibly the same thing?  The brackets under the shelves looked slightly different) for quite a bit cheaper than these.  I would probably consider that as an alternative if I was buying these.  That said, I'm still quite happy w/ the Gladiator, and getting them delivered to my house was more convenient than lugging it home would be.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1AL4S3SYQ3ZBA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DU61N48#wasThisHelpful","R1AL4S3SYQ3ZBA","A2YOSGV8YE3NJ8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2YOSGV8YE3NJ8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have a 2gig alarm panel/system and use it along with Alarm.com for various alerts etc.  This review is from the perspective of someone who has and uses a 2gig alarm panel.This is a very useful product, integrating your doorbell to the alarm panel.  This has 2 useful features - first, it allows the chime to go through your alarm panel speakers, which is very useful if, like me, your existing doorbell can't be heard through the entire house.  I can now hear the doorbell anywhere, even if I'm in the shower etc.  Second, it allows you to set up alerts via alarm.com, for example you could receive a text message, an email, or a push notification via the alarm.com smartphone app whenever the doorbell rings.The only negative about this, and the reason for 4 stars rather than 5, is that IMO it's kind of ugly and cheap looking.  If it was made out of say aluminum and available in a choice of white or black that would be a huge improvement aesthetically., although even a higher quality looking plastic would be an improvement.  It does light up, which is a nice touch, and it's dim enough to not appear lit during the day but is quite visible but not annoyingly bright at night.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R6J7SC2LJPPHB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BPCIQQW#wasThisHelpful","R6J7SC2LJPPHB","A2YOSGV8YE3NJ8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2YOSGV8YE3NJ8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I had a great Cuisinart toaster oven (Cusinart TOB-40, http://www.amazon.com/Cuisinart-TOB-40-Classic-Toaster-Broiler/dp/B004JMZGM2/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1434205776&sr=8-1&keywords=cuisinart+toaster+oven) that recently started to die after 3 1/2 years, and while I was in Costco my girlfriend talked me into replacing it with this Kitchenmaid model.  Ignoring my better judgement, which told me to either order an identical Cusinart or go home and scour thousands of Amazon reviews in search of the best toaster oven on earth, I agreed as this did look like a fairly nice toaster oven.And in fact, it is a fairly nice toaster oven - although it's a bit bigger than I'd like, it looks and feels like a good product, it's got plenty of features, it has simple analog controls etc.  It should be a perfectly acceptable replacement to my Cuisinart.Except for one fatal flaw - this thing takes FOREVER to make toast.  Forever.  Every Saturday morning, I face the excruciating dilemma of whether to allow my eggs to continue to get cold while I wait for this hunk of s*** to finish my toast, or take out the still-untoasted-despite-having-been-toasting for 10 minutes bread and eat it that way, or eat my eggs before my toast and then wait another 3 hours for toast.Some may think 1 star is too harsh for an otherwise decent product - but this thing is a toaster oven, and a somewhat high end toaster oven at that, that fails miserably at it's core task of making toast.  Avoid this.

Great on tacos, burritos, and most anything else that could use some hot sauce.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RMLBKCU4H4BMF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AIR3Q38#wasThisHelpful","RMLBKCU4H4BMF","A2YOSGV8YE3NJ8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2YOSGV8YE3NJ8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Go to a webite called amazing ribs dot com.  Read his articles about thermometers (really, read all of his articles but thermos in particular).  Then buy this thermo, along with a thermapen Splash-Proof Super-Fast Thermapen (Yellow) Instant Read Thermometer, Perfect for Barbecue, Home and Professional Cooking and you're all set.  Yes this seems like an expensive combo, but it's worth it.One probe goes in the meat.  The other probe goes in your grill/BBQ/Egg (could probably use in your oven, too) to tell you the temp inside there.  You can use both probes together (meat + grill), or either one individually (just meat temp or just grill temp).  Pretty simple concept.This Maverick thermometer combo has changed the way I grill and BBQ, and I've been grilling for a long time.  It's kind of eye opening in that I feel like a moron for not using one of these for the previous 10 years - it's like driving with your eyes closed in comparison.  I now consider a probe thermometer like this one a MUST for anyone who wants to grill or BBQ.  Not only has it dramatically improved my cooking skillz, it's also super convenient as you can bring the remote inside so you can keep an eye on your BBQ while you are watching TV or playing Uncharted 3 or whatever it is you do.There have been some complaints about reliability - it's very important not to submerge the probe when you wash it.  Just wipe the probe with a soapy spunge or rag or w/e you use, and make sure you don't get the wires wet where the wire meets the probe.  I haven't had any issues as I've been cleaning mine this way since I got it.  Meathead explains all of this in the articles I told you to read, hello.Setup/use is pretty easy.  You'll probably want to read the instructions but it's pretty intuitive.  Turn both units on and they sync.  Plug in the probes and make sure you push them all the way in.  The alarm features are a little more involved but are nice to have, particularly for say an overnight smoke.  I.e., you can set it up so if your grill temp dips below or rises above a certain point, an alarm will sound.  When the meat reaches it's target temp, an alarm will sound etc.  I don't use the alarms for day to day stuff, though, as it's pretty easy to keep an eye on the remote unit.Personally, I only use the food probe when I'm doing a roast or pork butt or turkey or something.  But, I use the probe for the grill temp virtually every time I use the grill or BBQ - the only eggception is if I'm searing something at high heat (or maybe pizzas or something where the temp might eggcede the limit for this baby).  Again, I really can't believe I wasn't using this before.If you're looking at this, buy it.  You need it, or something like it, but this seems like the best quality for the buck unless you want to get something more involved like a BBQ Guru (which is basically a thermostat).","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 17, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3DJTYOIDLJ0G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004IMA718#wasThisHelpful","R3DJTYOIDLJ0G","A2YOSGV8YE3NJ8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2YOSGV8YE3NJ8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought this set for Xmas for my nephew, Ben Franklin.  Ben doesn't eat a very healthy diet because his parents are morons and feed him a bunch of carby junk - all kinds of puffs and cereal crap like that, which is ok but not when that's ALL you ever eat, he doesn't even eat chicken fangers as far as I know.  I was hoping that maybe playing with this sammich set would teach him a little something about what normal people like to eat for lunch.I do not think this has improved his eating habbits, but he does enjoy playing with it.  Hopefully after a few more weeks this set will train him to make his uncle sandwiches when I come to visit.Also - the quality is very nice.  Good wood.  Good paint job.

"My landscaper recommended I get one of these as I have a tree that wasn't getting enough water via my regular irrigation system schedule.  I didn't even know these things eggzisted.This thing is incredibly easy to program and use - it doesn't even come with an instruction manual.  Even a moron could program this thing.  Gives a wide range of options as far as how often you want it to come on and for how long.  The manual option is also very useful - just push a button and it waters for a specified # of minutes.Time will tell on reliability - I've only had it about a week but it has worked flawlessly so far.  I will edit my review if anything ever goes wrong.  My only fear would be if it were to somehow die while the water was on, and not shut it off, fortunately I have a neighbor who watches my house like a hawk and I'm pretty sure she'd notice and turn it off.Note batteries weren't included so you may want to order 2 AAs too.

"I shoot a lot and I have been using the very similar 3M Nitro corded ear plugs for awhile.  I used to buy them by the 100 pack and always had a bunch of pairs stuffed into my various range bags.  Those were evidently discontinued but these 3M EAR corded plugs are very similar, I was very happy to find them and bot two 100-packs I like them that much.I like this particular style for various reasons:1)  They are very comfortable - more comfortable than any of the non-disposable ear plugs I have tried.2)  They offer pretty good protection - particularly when paired with electronic muffs to ""double up"" hearing protection.  Overall comfort to protection ratio is pretty hard to beat.3)  They are disposable - makes them great for sharing, plus ear plugs get nasty after a few uses so I prefer to throw them out for a new pair anyway.  Yet they can still be worn multiple times.  My friend Blair, who's very cheap, hangs onto the same pair and always insists on reusing them even though I am the one paying, which is odd since he never seems to have any problem shooting up all my ammo without offering to pay.  After a range session, he likes to hold the two plugs together and wrap the cord around them, which apparently looks to him like a butt or cleavage or something, and it always gives him a good laugh nomatter how many times he's done it.  Then he shows it to everyone and says ""he, he, look at that!  hehe"".  But this little trick of his isn't purely for show, as he stores them this way for next time.4)  I like the cord because I am usually using these to double up under my electronic ear-pro muffs.  At a day at the range or a class I will periodically take the plugs out if I want to hear voices better w/ just the electronic ear pro, and I don't lose them because the cord is around my neck.  With non-corded, I always loose them.5)  Super portable and convenient - can always have a handful conveniently stuffed in a pocket or in a range bag etc.Cons - None.

If you are an egghead and your OEM gasket doesn't burn off ... don't sweat it, it doesn't need to be replaced unless it gives you problems and not everyone has them (I think when they burn it's mostly due to flashbacks on high heat cooks).However, while the nomex gasket is a worthwhile upgrade, I'm just amazed people can get away selling them - uh, if you email the mothership, they will send you a free one.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 26, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3UTYGQAEDQ43X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004MNW1TE#wasThisHelpful","R3UTYGQAEDQ43X","A2YOSGV8YE3NJ8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2YOSGV8YE3NJ8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I bought this primarily for smoking baby back ribs on my big green egg (using car wash mike's method, google it).It's well designed and works well - right shape and size to either use as a roaster, or to turn upside down and use for ribs.However, after only a handful of uses over a few months, the finish has worn off and it's rusted in places.  I will admit, like my grill grates etc. I don't always clean it off immediately after use (so has some grease on it) and I store it outside ... yes this is hard on things, but the product description mentions it can be used for BBQ (and many of us in warm climates store our grill gear outside).I still give it 3 stars because it's cheap, so I shouldn't expect a top notch long lasting finish.Bottom line - in my opinion, this would work fine for indoor roasting type stuff in the oven (i.e. turkey), although I would be sure to clean it soon after with mild detergent.  However, because of the finish I would not recommend this product if you're looking for something to use on your outdoor grill/BBQ/smoker.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 2, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RF92D6BR9JIDV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000I1YG2E#wasThisHelpful","RF92D6BR9JIDV","A2YOSGV8YE3NJ8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2YOSGV8YE3NJ8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"My new weekly obsession did not disappoint this week! Every week Kandi Steiner releases a new episode in the Palm South University series, and Episode 4 is by far my favorite episode so far!The drama is getting bigger as the season goes on, and Episode 4 focuses on Jess, Cassie and Skylar. After what we found out in Episode 3 about Skylar and Adam, my heart broke for Cassie, but I was happy to see her not letting it bring her down completely. If anyone is at fault with that mess, it's definitely Adam! Jess is still avoiding Jarrett, and Jarrett is NOT a fan of her behavior, and things definitely get interesting between these two in this weeks installment.I loved seeing Bear and Skylar making up and Skylar opening up more about why she's in the poker tournaments. Skylar is an amazing character, I really enjoy reading her parts in this series. Cassie and her best friend Paris finally seem to realize that things aren't the same anymore, and I really want to punch her friend in the face. She's just a snob and I'm glad Cassie has the girls at her house to chill with since her ""best friend"" is obviously a stuck up brat!This week's episode definitely is fun and sexy. We get to see the girls prepping for the Halloween Party, and get some more background on these awesome characters. I can't wait till next Tuesday to read the next episode, and I think I may cry when this is all over! If you haven't picked these books up yet, what are you doing?!

"What an absolutely amazing story! I was thrown into Indi and Carter's world, and I loved every single second of it.We meet Carter as he's about to move in with his mom and step-father. He only has a few months till he's 18 and can leave. He adores his mother, but can NOT stand the man she has married. When Carter was 5 the carefree child that he was, was changed forever by some hurtful words from his grandfather. That name, that tone, shaped him into who he is now. He's cocky, he's arrogant, he doesn't really give a crap, and he really is a Bastard at times. When his new neighbor Indiana (aka Indi, ""Kid"") enters his life, he's drawn to her, but knows she deserves so much better than what he thinks of himself.Carter and Indi as teenagers were quite frustrating at times. You could tell immediately that there was chemistry between them, but Indi is too good, and Carter is too Carter, so they are at odds a lot. When they aren't at eachother's throats though, their friendship and banter is awesome. I enjoyed getting to see Carter open up to Indi, something he's never done before. It showed, even though he didn't want to admit it, how much he really did care for Indi. Having Indi, and her dad Ross, in his life really showed him that there are people out there that do care for him and are good people. I just wish in the end of part one, he wouldn't have done what he did. I understand why Carter did what he did in this part of the book, but at the same time, I was heartbroken for all characters involved.When we move into part two and get to see how things are going five years later, it's one crazy ride. Carter has grown a lot in the five years he's been gone and really made something out of his life, but the one thing missing, is the girl he left all those years ago. When he has to come back to Sydney for his mom, he wasn't expecting things to be so crazy with him and Indi. I knew Indi wouldn't be happy at first to see him, but I wasn't expecting her reaction, it was kind of hilarious and he did get what he deserved.These two have a hard time finding their way back to one another, and when they do, things get difficult for them yet again. I was scared about how Carter would handle some of the things that happened, but to see how amazingly he handled everything, really showed how much his character has grown throughout this book. Indi... her character is pretty amazing, but man, this girl is stubborn! Her and Carter are definitely butting heads a lot in this book, and it's quite entertaining.To say this book was not what I was expecting would be an understatement. I was expecting a cocky arrogant man throughout the entire story, but instead I got an amazing and beautifully written love story. I was not able to put this book down, and I really enjoyed the characters in this book. The ending of this book was perfect and I was left with a happy feeling in my heart after seeing how everything ended up for these amazing characters!","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R17JTPUD2DBC88/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014DTSTKG#wasThisHelpful","R17JTPUD2DBC88","A1GECJN7XHDKU6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GECJN7XHDKU6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Looking for a hot and sexy story? Taking Flight is definitely one to pick up. I was intrigued by this book based off the synopsis, and then when I dived into it, I was unable to put it down. Told in the male POV this is a definite twist on the other love stories out there today.We meet Kane, who's a pilot and kind, maybe.. well yeah he's addicted to sex. He doesn't care where he gets it or who he gets it from. Scorned for a relationship gone bad he has no intentions of getting back into another relationship. At first I wasn't a big fan of Kane's. He came off arrogant, cocky, and kind of a douche, but as I got into this story, I found myself falling in love with him. He really is a unique character and I loved his story.When Mya enters Kane's life, it was unexpected and the feelings she makes him feel are unwelcome at first. I loved how he didn't want to see her, but did everything he could on the chance that he would run into her. When they finally bump into one another again, the chemistry is undeniable, and I loved watching both of them take a chance on one another. We get to see everything that Kane has been through with his ex Maddy and his best friend Dean, but with Mya he is able to finally start moving on. These two definitely figured out their own lives while they were together, and I think this made their love for one another so much stronger.I really enjoyed Mya's character. I think it was awesome that we didn't get to see what was going on in her head, and there were times I would have loved to, especially towards the end. She's a strong character, and she brings something to this book and to Kane that really brings this story full circle.Mya and Kane's relationship definitely is not easy, it seems as soon as things seem to be going great, something happens and sets them back a few steps. There are parts in this book that are heartbreaking, where your soul is crushed for Kane and for the other characters, but Mya was there to pick up the pieces and help heal all the wounds that are ripped open in this book for Kane.I loved the writing of this book, and how much the characters grew from the beginning of this story to the end. This is a beautifully written book with a hot and steamy love story. Once I picked this one up, I wasn't able to put it down. I highly recommend Taking Flight! Trust me, the ending/epilogue...

"What an absolutely amazing and stunning story. From the first words till the epilogue I was drawn into Summer and Cole's story.What happens when hot, celebrity, movie star Cole Masten and southern country girl Summer Jenkins get thrown into eachothers' lives? A whole lot of chemistry, hotness, anger, hate, arguments, and sexual tension, that's what!It's really hard to put into words how amazing this book is. Alessandra Torre did an amazing job with these characters and making you feel what they were feeling and going through. I enjoyed the mystery of what happened three years ago to make Summer the outcast of Quincey, and seeing her fight tooth and nail against her attraction to Cole. Seeing Cole go through what he did with his ex, and then be thrown into the whirlwind of a change from L.A. to the quiet southern town of Quincey was amazing. He was no longer the pampered movie star, no one really cared who he was, and he had to do things by himself. Granted, at times I thought he was a bit arrogant with how he handled things, but as time went on, I grew to love the person Cole had become.Summer and Cole do not get off to a great start. A knee to the nuts, her blowing him off as if he's a no one, him being a jerk, it was the setup of a lifetime for their story. Once they seem to get along, something always happens that makes them go off one one another. Sometimes its a war of words, other times a war of silence and ignoring. No matter how much they argued, you could tell they were going to give into all the sexual tension in the air and it would be amazing. The first time, it was hot... but the night that changed everything for them, it was absolutely beautiful. I love these two together and I wanted them together as soon as they started calling each other on all their crap.I must say, the supporting characters in this book really helped bring this story full circle. Brad, and his intimidating lawyerish ways, and keeping Cole on a tight leash was awesome. His rules really put a hamper on Cole's plans, but in the end, ended up saving him. Ben, the location scout, and new best friend to Summer. This guy is hilarious and really helped bring Summer out of her life of solitude she'd been living in. Justin, we didn't get to see much of him, but he was a good friend to Cole and his reaction to seeing Cole being ""good"" was awesome. Mama, Summer's mom, was a great shoulder for Summer to lean on, and did everything she could to see Summer happy, when she was younger, and now as an adult. Then there is the infamous, ""Cocky"" this character.. well you'll just have to read the book to find out more about him, and why I just loved him and Cole with him. Priceless is all I am going to say about it!This book definitely plays out like a movie, which is kind of ironic since it's about a movie, and I felt as if this was playing out in front of me while I read it. I adored Cole and Summer's love/hate like/tolerate relationship and the road their relationship took us on. Not only is this book about Cole and Summer and their road to possible happiness, but it's also a lot about these two moving on from the past and learning who they really are. The drama and sexual tension in this book definitely was done beautifully. I highly recommend this book, no cliffhangers, no ridiculous story line, just a beautiful written story. Five + stars to Hollywood Dirt!","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2W3CY2OG84LD9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014UA70U8#wasThisHelpful","R2W3CY2OG84LD9","A1GECJN7XHDKU6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GECJN7XHDKU6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"What an absolutely amazing and beautiful second chance romance! Words cannot express how much I truly loved this book and Mia and Jensen!Mia and Jensen were meant to be, fell in love young, and had the world at the palm of their hands, until Jensen made one major mistake and the two of them were separated for five years. Mia hates Jensen, yet no man can ever live up to who he is and she's not sure she can ever love someone the way she loved him, yet she's not sure she can even speak to him without being hurt. When Mia takes a temporary job in New York City, she knows there is a chance of running into Jensen, but she wasn't expecting him to be working on the same project as her. Jensen pursue's Mia relentlessly and you can really tell how much he still loves her, if only he can make her see.I really wanted to hate Jensen's character, but he made it so freaking hard. I loved him. His ""Jensen Talks"" articles we got to see and how he spoke of Mia to the world was truly beautiful. He knows he made a mistake, but never has he forgotten how much he loves Mia. Seeing him try to get her to open up and be his again was awesome and I wanted to strangle Mia for not jumping right back into his arms Granted, I understand why Mia was so hesitant, her heart was crushed last time they were together, and she can not go through that again.Their relationship definitely isn't easy, but once Mia starts talking to Jensen, you see that happiness begin to shine through. Her friends are hilarious in trying to get her to see that she will fall back in love with him, and then when she does, they are even more funny with their ""I told you so's"" and their ""what are you going to do's?"".The character that definitely stole this story though was Olivia. I loved this little girl and she was perfect, you couldn't help but fall in love with this sweet little girl. Mia obviously felt the same way, and she has a harder time saying goodbye to her than I thought she would.If you're looking for an angsty second chance romance book that has a little bit of everything, laughs, drama, tears, this is definitely the book to pick up. I devoured this book in one sitting and am eagerly awaiting more books by Claire Conreras as I am in love with her writing style! This book read like a movie playing in front of you, and the characters are beautifully written!","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2911BWO5V2Q5F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014YLQX74#wasThisHelpful","R2911BWO5V2Q5F","A1GECJN7XHDKU6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GECJN7XHDKU6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"What an absolutely amazing story! I loved Brody and Jordan's story and all the angst that this story brought!Jordan Elliot has won the prestigious college sports scholarship and is spending her senior year playing soccer in college away from her home in Australia.  Her goals are to play the best she can, finish school, and make it big in her career. She never expected Brody Madden to enter her life and turn it upside down. Brody is the college football star who is expected to go pro, but he's having a problem passing his classes. Enter Jordan as his new tutor and things definitely get interesting.Brody was attracted to Jordan the first time he saw her, he had no clue she was going to be the one helping him in his Ethic's class, and when he finds out, he's shocked and pleased. Problem is, Brody doesn't want any help, he has a horrible way of seeing himself and sets himself up for failure a lot in this book.Jordan and Brody's relationship is full of drama and angst! When things are good with them, they are amazing, but when they are bad... it's really, really bad. I was rooting for these two throughout this entire story, but at times I really didn't think things would work out for them. Too many things stood in their way, too many things were hidden, and both of them are at the tops of their careers.  I truly loved these two together, I just wish at times their relationship would have been a little easier.I loved how strong Jordan was in this book. She was confident in her career, and she believed in Brody when no one did, not even himself. She fought for him, when he wouldn't fight for himself, and she truly loved him. Even when things go wrong with them she still believed in him and fought for him, and I loved this about her. She didn't lose herself in Brody, but found herself, and she was stronger with him by her side than she was without him.Brody, this poor, poor man. On the outside it looks like he has it all, but he really and truly doesn't. He comes from a messed up family who doesn't know what love is, he's struggling in school, and has never really had anyone in his corner. Jordan really helps bring Brody up, but there is only so much she can do and he needs to help himself. Brody does some things in this book that will make you want to scream, I know I did a few times. He works on forgetting and ignoring things instead of making himself better. When he does some of the things he does, I wanted to hate him, but at the same time, I hurt for him and everything he has been through.The supporting characters in this book are absolutely amazing. I loved Jax (aka ""bananaman""), Eddie, Hayden, and Leah. Leah is a fierce friend and is super protective Jordan. Jax is Brody's cousin, roommate and best friend. He is there for Jax as much as he can be, and even though things at first didn't go how Jax wanted, he's very protective of both Jordan and Brody and is the glue that keeps them together at times.Even though this book is full of drama and angst, the love story in this book is truly magnificent! If you're expecting a happy go lucky, sports romance, The End Game, is not that book. This book is edgy, angst filled, and one that will definitely pull at your heartstrings! Be prepared for one emotional roller coaster when reading this book, but it is one that definitely needs to be read!","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2WBG3KB0E6S9F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014IDFDQU#wasThisHelpful","R2WBG3KB0E6S9F","A1GECJN7XHDKU6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GECJN7XHDKU6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Another great installment in the Palm South University series! In this week's episode the drama is turned up a notch and some stupid mistakes are made.In Episode Three we get more of Ashleigh,  Erin, and Adam. We finally find out what Ashleigh has been doing when not at the house and missing sorority events. At first I was like YOU GO GIRL! but then... she does something horrible and I wanted to strangle her. I hope she figures out what she did, and fixes it soon, as I really like her character and don't want her to go down the road she is on right now.Erin... Erin is pretty amazing, and we get more of a background on her as well. Seeing her speaking to her mother made my heart break for her. She doesn't have the support she should have in family, and that explains why she's so close to all of her sisters and throws herself into everything she does. I really enjoyed getting into her head a bit in this episode.Adam... I wanted to like Adam, but him and Skylar need to be kicked, slapped, or whatever else will hurt them. Skylar is definitely in the wrong with what she did, but Adam, he knew what he did and that makes it even worse. Trust me, you will want to junk punch both of these characters by the time you finish this episode, and that sucks, because I really do like Skylar!This season of Palm South University is amazing and I can't wait till each Tuesday to get the next episode. This episode was definitely the most scandalous so far and I can't wait to see what happens next week!","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RRDHNW7DRQJLT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013KWTEYM#wasThisHelpful","RRDHNW7DRQJLT","A1GECJN7XHDKU6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GECJN7XHDKU6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"What an absolutely amazing story! The Drafter is not in my normal genre of reading, but is definitely one of my favorite reads of 2015!The Drafter focuses on Peri Reed and Opti agent who can bend time. If you've read Sideswiped (the prequel to Drafter) then you've met Peri before. This book takes place in 2030 in the new Detroit. Things are quite different in the future, and Peri and her anchor Jack have a rough go at their last assignment. When they get back to headquarters, things definitely go wrong for Peri and Jack, and it opens us up to this absolutely amazing story.This book is a definite mix of suspense and sci-fi, to make a story that I was unable to put down. Peri's character is unique, and I adored her character. She's been through so much, and she doesn't remember most of it. How would it feel to not know who in your life you can trust? That's how Peri feels throughout most of this book. Between forgetting major things in her life, and everyone trying to manipulate her, her life gets pretty crazy and dangerous. Throughout this book, Peri realizes what she has done and who she really is, and isn't at ease with any of it. She's made some bad choices, and since she has no memory, only bits and pieces, she doesn't know if she did things because she wanted to, or because she was trying to help others.With the Alliance trying to get Peri, and Silas trying to figure out what is right and what is wrong, the suspense of this book is amazing. I was on pins and needles throughout this book trying to figure out who was bad, who was good, and who Peri really was. I did fall in love with Silas all over again (we met him in Sideswiped). His character really is a strong one in this book, and helps balance out a lot of the craziness. You can tell how hard it is for him to see what is going on with Peri, and him trying to help her.There is a lot in this book that is awesome, but can't be written about for fear of spoiling this story for you. I will tell you that I loved Taf, Howard, and Silas. These three are awesome, and I hope we will get more of them, especially crazy Taf, in future installments of this series. Each main character in this book brought something to the table and weren't there for fluff. I am not a fan of Fran's or Bill's. I don't think either of them are good and one is not better than the other. Allen.... what can I say? I'm not sure how I feel about Allen. I hated him, I liked him, I definitely didn't trust him, but when this book ended, I was left with a feeling of contentment with his character. I'm not sure if I trust him yet, but I look forward to seeing how his story plays out as well.Even though this book does have a defined ending, there is so many more questions left unanswered that will leave me waiting anxiously for the next book in the Peri Reed Chronicles. There is a bit of romance in this book, but it is not what makes this story. Peri and all her craziness, and figuring out the truth is what makes this story stand out above a lot of other books I've read this year. I am in love with this series and can't wait for more!I have received this book as a member of the XOXperts, XOXO After Darks official street team, in exchange for an honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R5YSYFGDUS6RW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00P42WN5E#wasThisHelpful","R5YSYFGDUS6RW","A1GECJN7XHDKU6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GECJN7XHDKU6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Torn Hearts is the beginning of Mia and Jensen's story. In Kaleidescope Hearts we met Mia and Jensen, and found out they had some sort of history. In this novella, we get why there is so much animosity between Mia and Jenson, and I loved every single second of it!This prequel gives us the history of Mia and Jensen and what went wrong with them. I enjoyed how much Jensen really seemed to love Mia, but then he took her heart and crushed it. I am proud of Mia for not dwelling on it, and just cutting him out of her life. Granted they belong together, but Jensen made a decision that altered their lives forever, and didn't think about Mia in the decision making.Torn Hearts takes place in the past, and brings us right up to the future. After seeing how these two were together and how they are now, I am definitely looking forward to their full length novel! I am one-clicking it immediately!","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R48EUOZF036ZK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012D9R9J0#wasThisHelpful","R48EUOZF036ZK","A1GECJN7XHDKU6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GECJN7XHDKU6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Enrapture by Rachel Van DykenIf you are an Eagle Elite fan and can't wait for the next book, reading Enrapture in this book is worth it! Enrapture is told mostly in Joyce's (Trace's grandmother's) point of view, but we get to see inside of Nixon and Trace's head as well. We finally get the back story of Joyce, Frank, and Luca and learn more about the twins we were told about in Endure.My heart broke for Joyce, Luca and Frank in this book. They all made tough decisions, and learned to live with them. But the love Joyce and Frank had was different than the all encompassing love we found that she had with Luca. Seeing how their story really plays into the Trace, Nixon, Chase story from previous books is interesting as well.This is a definite must read and a reason to purchase Hurt. The Eagle Elite series is my favorite series EVER and getting any glimpses into the craziness that is part of these books is always a plus. I wanted to cry with Trace, and I was furious with Frank for how he let the information for Trace to find when he wasn't around. Seeing the whole gang together being themselves was refreshing, and nothing bad happened to them, which is always a plus!Loved Enrapture!The Initiation by Kristin VaydenI really enjoyed this book and seeing a bit of a tie in to Endure by Rachel Van Dyken. In the initiation we meet Khan, Sofia, Daphne, and Jude.Daphne has crushed on Khan for years since she met him through her brothers girlfriend Sofia. She never thought he'd give her the time of day so she went on with her life until Jude comes in whisking her away to help save him.Throughout this book we learn Khan is the head of a family in the Russian mob and made some mistakes. We learn of his connection to Sergio and Andi as well. I loved how Khan was a tough guy but really just wanted to be happy and out of the craziness his life currently is.Daphne and Khan are amazing together and it sucked that just when things started to get really good the story ended. I really hope to see more of these characters in the future as they are definitely interesting and the story was great!Ice by Elise FaberThis is the first book of Elise Faber's that I've read and I will definitely be picking up the rest of the series when they release.In ICE we meet Ryker and Laila, two super awesome KTS Spies on missions to help people in need. Ryker and Laila have a past, she was young, she fell hard, he ran. But now that they are working together again and a few years older, Ryker realizes his mistake but convincing Laila is much harder than he expected.The missions their team goes on are intense, but the majority of this story focuses on them trying to stop a child sex slave/prostitution ring in San Francisco.  In such a short amount of time so much happens and I was on pins and needles. When their mission goes belly up, and they are in a predicament they have to learn to work together to save themselves.I really enjoyed the suspense in this book, but I really, really enjoyed the chemistry and banter between Laila and Ryker. I adored these two and hope to see more of them in new books by Elise Faber.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1G6955KLYU4E9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014Q7PJSA#wasThisHelpful","R1G6955KLYU4E9","A1GECJN7XHDKU6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GECJN7XHDKU6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I know there are many people out there who don't like it when Queen is covered by another band so just try to listen to this as a My Chemical Romance or The Used fan. I think it's a great song and it's really their own interpretation of the song. This version has more harmonies in it than the original. It's really a great song if you are a fan of these two bands because they really didn't get together for any other songs that I'm aware of (I might be wrong but I really can't think off the top of my head if they recorded any other songs together).This brings me back to a time when these two were quite popular and they were friends and toured together. It's sad that that's not something that can happen anymore since MCR broke up but the memory of those good times live on through this song.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RAWFRADTMK4F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001200L9C#wasThisHelpful","RAWFRADTMK4F","A1F7XETXDDGRBE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1F7XETXDDGRBE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I actually am biased towards this song since I'm from California. This is of course a theme song to a popular TV show... I think, I honestly never saw the show but I think it was on The OC? I just like this song because it reminds me of California, well it is about California! So if you like the good sunny state that is California than you'll love this song. They make references to various part of the state like ""driving down 101"" and I just can't help feel connected to it. I think overall this is just a feel good song.This song is what I would call pop-rock? It has piano in it which if you've ever heard this song you'll recognize right away. Then it goes into pop-rock. I think this song is a song that can be sung along to as well.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2TIMHCE7YRN8L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004FEX2W0#wasThisHelpful","R2TIMHCE7YRN8L","A1F7XETXDDGRBE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1F7XETXDDGRBE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was actually surprised just how big this backpack ended up being and how many compartments it had. I feel like this is much more than a ""yoga backpack"" because it can really carry many different items and you can get really creative with it. Believe it or not I feel like this would be a great backpack to take camping or hiking. I think the straps that are suggested to hold a yoga mat could actually be used for a sleeping bag or blanket.This backpack has a lot of nice features that make it great for those who are active. There's a compartment for your phone right on the strap that goes across your chest. I've included a picture of me wearing the backpack showing this strap and my iPod Touch inside the Velcroed compartment. I could fit my Samsung Galaxy S4 in it but it was a really tight fit so I think it works best for smaller phones or iPod Touches/MP3 players.This backpack is SUPER COMFORTABLE to wear! I am actually still wearing it right now while I write this review because it's that comfortable. I think it has to do with the strap going across the chest instead of having two straps like most other backpacks have. The strap is cushioned and the back of the backpack appears to be cushioned as well. I believe the back is cushioned to protect a laptop though so like I said before this is much more than a yoga backpack because it can be used for many different things.There are two main big compartments, a medium sized compartment that has a zippered compartment within it for small items, and a small compartment on the very front. There's also a water bottle holder on the side and as I've said before the phone holder in the front. This backpack will be able to hold a lot of stuff and I think a wide range of people could find different ways of using it.I received this item at a high discounted rate in exchange for an unbiased and honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2BTWS5AQMD8HS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0150BPWRO#wasThisHelpful","R2BTWS5AQMD8HS","A1F7XETXDDGRBE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1F7XETXDDGRBE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"So first of all I want to say that these would be great for a number of different things but for me personally I think that these would be perfect when you have a group going to a theme park. I've bought Disneyland ticket holders, official ones from the park, in the past and every time the badge holder always rips off. It's frustrating because this is meant to hold your admission ticket!These are much better than other badge holders I've used before. I actually feel secure using these because they are much thicker and the enclosure is a little difficult to open. That might sound like a bad thing but to me I think that's a great thing because that means it won't accidentally open up on you which is something I've experienced with the Disneyland badge holders.If you are going to an event where you have to have an admission ticket to get in or to use certain things (i.e. you need your admission ticket at Disneyland to get Fast Passes) get these badge holders! It's the safest way and easiest way to keep track of your tickets that you will be using for that day.

"This is a really small yet secure pouch. It's big enough to carry what you need though. With this review I've included two pictures showing the actual size of this pouch. As you can see it's about the size of my hand. With that being said you can easily fit a phone, passports, credit cards, ID cards, and cash easily into this pouch.The great thing about this pouch is that it has RFID blocking built into that. What does that mean? That means the cards inside of the pouch can not be scanned unless they are fully removed from this pouch. This means your stuff is going to be secure which is a really nice feature when you are traveling and carrying important things.This pouch is very lightweight and can be worn in many different ways. There are two belt loops on the back of the pouch in case you want to secure it to the belt in which you are wearing. There is also a strap on the bag so that you can wear it around your neck or wear it like a purse. This pouch is what I like to call ""gender neutral"" meaning anyone can use it and you don't have to worry about it looking like a ""purse"".I received this item at a high discounted rate in exchange for an unbiased and honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R17DXCWRDJSRYC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010S2QXMS#wasThisHelpful","R17DXCWRDJSRYC","A1F7XETXDDGRBE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1F7XETXDDGRBE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These are neat stylus because they are a 2-in-1. It functions as a stylus AND a real pen. The pen has black ink and writes just fine because the shape of this is the size of an average pen, so longer than other stylus you might use.The pen pops out of the stylus so there's actually a hole in the middle of the stylus. This hole doesn't make the stylus not work(that's a good thing). I also tested pressing my finger on the stylus tip and it didn't at all touch the pen when it was retracted. This means you don't have to worry about pushing the stylus too hard on your device and accidentally having the pen tip touch the screen. With that being said make sure you have the pen retracted when you are using it as a stylus!Overall I felt this was a simple design and the overall stylus pen was lightweight which I find to be a good thing. I did find the stylus tip to be a bit smaller than other stylus I've used which I actually liked because it made drawing on my Kindle easier. You can really hold it like a pen/pencil when drawing with the stylus and I enjoyed that very much.I received this item at a high discounted rate in exchange for an unbiased and honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1OVCKITJAXJK2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015XI33V6#wasThisHelpful","R1OVCKITJAXJK2","A1F7XETXDDGRBE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1F7XETXDDGRBE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I ended up testing these out with 4 different devices that I have. I tested it out with my Samsung Galaxy S4, iPod Touch, Amazon Kindle Fire HD, and Lenovo laptop. These headphones interacted with them all differently but they all were able to produce good sound with them.Long story short if you want these to really work you need to be using them with an Apple branded product. I was able to play and stop my music when I used them with my Samsung Galaxy S4 but the volume control just wasn't happening. Interesting enough these would turn on the music on my Amazon Fire Kindle HD but would not stop the music nor would the volume control work either. When I used them with the iPod Touch everything was working the way it should. I could stop and play music and also change the volume with no problems.These will make the world dead to you. What I mean by that is you won't be able to hear anything beside what you are listening to. This ended up being a little scary to me as I tested these outside so what I would do is just have only one in my ear and then clipped the other to my shirt, by the way these come with a nice clip so that's something you can do! I've always been on the fence with noise isolating earphones because sometimes it's not the safest thing to not be able to hear what's going on in the world.If you look at the pictures I've provided with this review you'll see just how small and compact these are. They come with a nice carrying case and when you first get them they come in a rather nice box as well. There are several tips to choose from which are a really nice feature so that you can find the right tips that are going to work for you specifically.I recommend these for people who have an Apple branded device. You won't get the most out of these unless you have an iPod, iPhone, or iPad. If you want to use the remote and be able to control the music you'll need to have an Apple branded device. I also recommend these to those who want to silence the world because these will really block out any outside noise.I received these at a high discounted rate in exchange for an unbiased and honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R16H27JEV0NL6T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00G4UQ6U8#wasThisHelpful","R16H27JEV0NL6T","A1F7XETXDDGRBE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1F7XETXDDGRBE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a cute and small ""purse"" or a large wallet. I think that this is perfect for when you don't want to bring along your entire purse. I go to concerts a lot and I usually will bring along something like this so that I can bring just what I really need.I have a Samsung Galaxy S4 and I was able to put my phone with the case still on it in the biggest compartment of this bag. There was still a little room leftover too so I don't see any issues for people that have even larger phones, i.e. the Note phones.This bag has a little heaviness to it that I like about it. It says synthetic leather but I don't feel like it's ""cheap"" feeling at all. It feels very similar to a real leather purse which I think is a good thing because then the purse isn't going to be easily flying around when you are wearing it. The strap is adjustable so you can make it into a crossbody or a shoulder bag. The two compartments in the front are great for ID cards and debit cards and so on. Again I think this is a great alternative to bringing you entire purse. I think it's a great size that can carry what you need and then it's small enough so you can keep your valuables close to you.I got the black one that has a red lining. You can see in the picture how the red is a little noticeable even when it's closed but I think it's very stylish on top of being functional. I have the bag on my measuring board in the picture too so hopefully you can see the actual size of it.I received this item at a discounted rate in exchange for an unbiased and honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R304QHOJOZZX03/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011FO9HXA#wasThisHelpful","R304QHOJOZZX03","A1F7XETXDDGRBE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1F7XETXDDGRBE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"First of all I just want to say don't point this towards anyone when you decide to open it because it opens right away!This is a really nice umbrella. I feel like it's well made and it's quite sturdy. I included a picture with this review showing it with the tag still attached to it. This tag has instructions, which I hope that you can read in the picture because it's really nice to know how to actually use this umbrella. The only issue that I think some people might find with this umbrella is when it comes time to close it. You really have to have a lot of strength to close it until it clicks, as it says to do. If you don't have a lot of strength it might be an issue for you but I didn't have too much of an issue when it came time to close it.This umbrella came with some sort of sleeve and honestly I don't know if it's just meant to be for packaging or not because I didn't find it to be a necessity to put the umbrella in it but I can see it to be a great tool for those who don't want a wet umbrella lying around. Simply just put the umbrella in the sleeve and then you can put the umbrella anywhere without worrying about getting other things wet.This umbrella is a very nice size. I found it to be big enough where it's really going to protect you from the rain (or even the sun if you need it for that!). It's pretty much your standard sized umbrella but has an intense open and close. I think it's great because you really don't have to hassle with it. Just unsnap the closure strap, push the button, and there you go! I suggest trying it out before you really need to use it so you know what you're dealing with. Again make sure it's not pointing at somewhere when you do it though! It's a real quick release so make sure you have enough room around you when you open it.I received this item at a discounted rate in exchange for an unbiased and honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R28K39SFXAZK3E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B017CQI8TY#wasThisHelpful","R28K39SFXAZK3E","A1F7XETXDDGRBE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1F7XETXDDGRBE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"So first of all I want to say that I actually did test these out (semi accidentally) at the local Dollar Tree here. I was at the checkout and the sleeve was very near to the card reader as I slid my card into it and what happened was it gave the checker an error code which wouldn't let it read the card. I was a little shocked at first but then I put the sleeve in my purse and then ran my card again and it worked. So long story short these sleeves do work and your card can't be read when they are near them.These sleeves will only be able to hold one card at a time. I saw some reviews saying they are fitting two cards in them but I don't know how that's possible and I think that would be counterproductive when you're trying to protect your cards. If you put two in them they will rub against each other and will stretch the sleeve out so I suggest just putting one card in each sleeve.Unless your card says what it is on the edge (like how the PayPal business debit cards do) you might want to label what each sleeve contains so you don't have to pull all of the cards out when looking for a specific one. That's what I did, I simply just wrote on the edge with a pen which card the sleeve contained. I think doing something like that will keep you rather organized.I received these at a high discounted rate in exchange for an unbiased and honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2QAB5MN9M2V4R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WNCQ1GK#wasThisHelpful","R2QAB5MN9M2V4R","A1F7XETXDDGRBE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1F7XETXDDGRBE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I think that these are a great thing for those who love to be organized. I used to use just a regular hanger and just throw all of my scarves on that which wasn't being well organized at all. The regular hanger would always bow too because it just wasn't meant to be holding a bunch of scarves like that. These hangers, however, are a life saver because they are specifically designed to organize and hold many objects at once.These are rather nice looking. I think that they look rather stylish and will fit into anyone's closet. They aren't heavy at all but I feel like they are very sturdy and can handle the weight of multiple items. I've been able to fit even my thicker scarves on here but weaving them through the slots. There's a space between each slot that has been working out perfectly for my scarves.I can see these being used for many different things. I think they would be good to help organize ties, scarves, and accessories including necklaces and bracelets.

"I've actually been using this to read books at night time in the dark. Sometimes when I can't sleep I like to find activities to do but I don't want to turn on the light in the room because I don't want to disturb others with it so this has been working out fabulously.Things I like about this LED Lighted Handheld Magnifier include the following:  -It's lightweight. It's not too heavy which means my arm/wrist doesn't get tired while I'm holding it for a long period of time while I'm using it to read in the dark.  -It lights up the pages pretty well in the dark! I've been actually using this in the dark without any other light source and it gives off enough light to do so.  -It's very easy to make things bigger. It's really easy to use, just like a regular magnifier glass. I do have glasses but I hate wearing them because I just never liked how glasses felt on my face so this is great because I'm able to see things more clearly without me having to wear it on my face. Also the light button is very easy to turn on and off.  -It's pretty compact and easy to store. This device isn't too big and I'm able to just put it in my pencil holder when I'm not using it.Things I don't particularly like about this product include:  -The only thing that I really don't like too much about this product is the fact that it uses 3 AAA batteries. There are no batteries that come with it either. It's not THAT big of an issue to me because I do have rechargeable batteries but I can see this might be an issue for some people.I recommend this product to those who read in low light settings or in the dark. It's been working out fantastically for me and I really recommend this to people who want an alternative to wearing glasses because honestly I've been able to use this instead of wearing my glasses which is what I enjoy the most about this product.I received this item at a discounted rate in exchange for an honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RA3308WB74EV0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0140WO6KS#wasThisHelpful","RA3308WB74EV0","A1F7XETXDDGRBE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1F7XETXDDGRBE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I actually love this top but I was a little surprised with the material. It reminds me of a bathing suit but I don't know if I'd be comfortable to actually wear it out in public as one.I am personally using it as a bra top. I'm normally a 34 B for my bra so I got the Medium/Large size for this top and it fits perfectly. The picture is a little misleading with the cleavage. Wearing it as it is doesn't really produce a lot of cleavage for me but I did come up with something to make it look like the picture. All I did was simply wear a strapless bra underneath this top with it and it produced cleavage like how there is in the picture.Overall I am very happy with this top and it was easy to put on and take off. It's really stylish and I recommend it to those who love a classy vintage/retro look.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1DC3I0VU7QHS1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00L3ZFODO#wasThisHelpful","R1DC3I0VU7QHS1","A1F7XETXDDGRBE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1F7XETXDDGRBE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I'd like to think that he likes this bedding instead of the shavings and other ""litters"" too.

"I do actually have an Apple brand case and overall this case compared to the Apple brand case isn't really all that different. They both overall function the same and they both look the same as well. The only major difference that I noticed was the backing. This particular case here has a more ""cheaper"" backing but that's to be expected with the price. Honestly I think that this case is perfectly fine and it'd be smart to just get this case instead of spending a lot on an official Apple branded one.This case has the following features:-It can be folded into a stand. The front flap can be folded so that the case turns itself into a stand for the iPad. This is really nice if you're in the kitchen and you want to be following a recipe. I can also imagine that it would be good if you're following a tutorial and don't want to be holding the iPad while following along.-There are cutouts where you need them. There's a cutout for the camera, volume controls, power button, ear phone jack, and most importantly there's a cutout for the charger which means you never have to take the case off for anything.-It can put your iPad to sleep thus saving battery life! When the case closes onto the iPad it safely puts the iPad to sleep which helps conserve the battery.-Comes in a really pretty color! Ok, I guess I'm a little biased about this one because I LOVE the color blue and the many different shades of it but I really enjoy this color and I think overall it's a very stylish case.I received this product at a discounted rate in exchange for an honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3S5FDSOJQKUAO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015A4ZRAS#wasThisHelpful","R3S5FDSOJQKUAO","A1F7XETXDDGRBE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1F7XETXDDGRBE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I think that this is a great ""case"" for those who are a little rough with their iPads and especially great for children. When I first received this product it wasn't really like your normal case that you would get for a tablet. It's super bendable but the great thing about it is how it molds onto your iPad. Simply just put your iPad into the case and it transforms it into something that I think is much better protected than other cases.This case does add a little more bulkiness overall to your iPad but because it does there's a protective barrier. Other cases that I've seen tend to be on the same level as the screen meaning if you accidentally dropped it the screen would end up having contact with whatever the iPad landed on. With this case if you dropped it there's a little barrier that prevents the screen from actually hitting whatever it landed on. I honestly can't say that this case would protect the iPad completely in the event that you do accidentally drop it but I believe that this case would definitely protect it better than other cases that I've seen.With all the being said I recommend this case to those who are prone to dropping their iPads or children who might be a little rough when using an iPad. It's really a good investment to get a case like this because accidents do happen.I received this item at a discounted rate in exchange for an honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2K78Z1TO814LB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010MPMSR0#wasThisHelpful","R2K78Z1TO814LB","A1F7XETXDDGRBE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1F7XETXDDGRBE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was a little hesitant about getting a selfie stick in the first place because honestly I rarely take pictures of myself BUT after receiving this particular ""selfie stick"" I was just amazed by what I could actually do with it. It ended up turning into something that is really useful for me.So the long story short of why I personally ended up LOVING this particular product was the overall ease of being able to use it and how it made taking video so much easier. I have a pet bunny that I enjoy filming and taking pictures of. Many times he gets ""camera shy"" but now that I've used this selfie stick to help capture videos and pictures of my bunny I've come to the conclusion that he wasn't really that shy of the camera but he was shy of my getting into his personal space. With this selfie stick I've been able to get my phone closer to him without scaring him off and I'm truly loving it because now I'm able to capture the moments of him that I couldn't before.Specifically this selfie stick is amazing technical wise because of the following:  -It's compact. It folds up nicely and compact so when you're not using it you can simply throw it into a backpack or purse.  -It comes with a wrist strap. This is nice because if you do in fact accidentally ""drop"" the stick while wearing the strap it won't fall to the ground but simple dangle from your wrist. You can actually just carry the stick by the wrist strap while you're not using it as well.  -Bluetooth built in. There's a button on the handle part that you simply push to take a picture with your phone. This is very convenient and I had no trouble pairing the stick with my Samsung Galaxy S4.  -It's not heavy. I was able to hold the stick in the air for quite some time, never once did my arm get tired of holding it. It's not heavy at all.  -It pretty much is compatible with any smartphone. The clamp that holds the phone is easily expandable so I imagine that most smartphones would be compatible with this selfie stick. I don't really see it being compatible with a phablet(like a large Note phone) or a tablet though as it doesn't expand THAT much.  -There are many angles that it can be adjusted to. I really like the fact that it isn't just set to one angle. There's the option of changing the angle of where the phone actually sits which means if you ever needed to take a picture of something that's hard to reach this selfie stick would work out perfectly for that. For an example, if you needed to take a picture of something under a car, in the engine, or in a place that's hard to reach this would be a great tool to have to do that!I received this product at a discounted rate in exchange for an honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1VGMN0RTTKLS3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01502ROHY#wasThisHelpful","R1VGMN0RTTKLS3","A1F7XETXDDGRBE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1F7XETXDDGRBE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is my favorite song on the Tangled soundtrack for many reasons. It's a wonderful catchy song that is really uplifting for the most part. It does go into the chorus that can be not as uplifting but I still enjoy it none-the-less.I think the reason why I enjoy this song so much is because it's actually relate-able.

"This is a very interesting ""bag"" and I actually tried it out with my Samsung Galaxy S4. With my phone there was plenty of room still in the bag so this can easily be used with larger sized phones as well. There are many different reasons why I like this bag and I think that it can be used for more than just a phone.First off I want to go over specifically why it does in fact work really well with phones. For my phone I was still able to use the phone while it was in the bag which was awesome. There's a window on the back side too which I assume is there so that you can use the camera on your phone while it's in the bag. I felt it was secure and when it latched close it seemed to give it a good seal. It's a little tricky opening and closing it at first but I think that's a good thing because it really does feel secure in there.With the bag you'll get an armband and a lanyard. The armband might be a tad too small for those with bigger arms but I think it works perfectly to put around your wrist. It's really nice to have these things so that the bag stays attached to you directly. With that being said I think that this bag can also be used for other things besides a phone including:-car keys-money-ID cards/credit cards etc.-ticketsBasically anything you don't want to get wet is great to put into this thing and like I said with my phone there was a little room still so I don't see why you can't slide in some money and other flat items in there with you that you want to keep dry. I couldn't fit my phone case on my phone with it into the bag but this bag basically becomes your case for the time being.I really recommended this to more than just those who want it for when they go swimming. It's also great to bring to theme parks, especially if you're going on rides that may have water/waterfalls, it's also great for other elements where you don't want your phone getting dirty like going in the snow or off-roading in the dirt/sand.I received this item at a discounted rate in exchange for a review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2BPT8XUCM40EZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014VZNTXE#wasThisHelpful","R2BPT8XUCM40EZ","A1F7XETXDDGRBE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1F7XETXDDGRBE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"An all-in-one case! This is an amazing case for a couple of different reasons. First off I want to say that overall this reminds me of back in the 90s when it was common to have your cell phone clipped to your pants. Now with that being said obviously this is an updated version of that but let's face it phones are getting bigger to the point that they are difficult to fit in your pocket so this set up hear helps that problem out.This is definitely a ""rugged"" case meaning it's going to be there for you when your phone accidentally goes flying which they tend to do from time to time don't they? Since this is a rugged type of case it's a little bigger and will add some extra size to your overall phone so take note of that. I don't think it's too bulky and again phones in general are just big these days anyway so it really shouldn't be that big of an issue.When you get this phone you're going to be getting a couple of awesome accessories including a screen protector, cloth, and stylus. These are all things you really need with a smartphone. The packaging isn't excessive so you can get right into the product and it's pretty self explanatory how to put your phone into the case. I will say the only ""issue"" that I saw with this case was that the kickstand was a little hard to pop out the first couple of times but it gets easier to pop out once you figure it out.I received this item at a heavily discounted price in exchange for a review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2W0QFFUYVOOON/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013HTWKJY#wasThisHelpful","R2W0QFFUYVOOON","A1F7XETXDDGRBE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1F7XETXDDGRBE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It's the song that's probably stuck in your head right now ""and I love it"". This song reminds me of Bruno Mars and Michael Jackson in a way.

"The thing that I like most about these labels is that to me they give off a ""vintage"" look. These are simply amazing for mason jars and I consider them to be on the large size. I think that these labels would also work perfectly for shoe boxes as well.First of all I don't think this really gives off the ""chalkboard"" look too much due to the marker that it comes with. It's more of a paint look to me as it's not a piece of chalk that you'll be writing with. With that being said if you are quick enough to wipe the marker off of the label it does come off but if you leave it on too long it doesn't seem to want to come off. So with that being said make sure you know what you're writing before you jump right into it to make it have a clean look. I tested out a couple of labels and I suggest waiting for the marker to dry completely before removing the label so that you don't accidentally smudge it.Like I said before I consider these to be a large size so there's plenty of room to write a couple of words on it. I ended up putting one of the labels on one of my plastic bins and it appears to be holding so the adhesive is nice on these labels.I recommend these to people who aren't afraid to hand write something as these will pretty much turn out the best to those who can write well. You might have to test out a couple labels to really get a feel for it but the marker writes rather smoothly.I did receive this product at a high discount in exchange for a review but my review is real and honest.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R10XJHHS6TMDOG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010HN0FN6#wasThisHelpful","R10XJHHS6TMDOG","A1F7XETXDDGRBE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1F7XETXDDGRBE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Hopefully my review was able to get your attention so that you can find out why you should NOT get this game! First of all it's an app that costs money (99 cents or 99 Amazon coins) but it still has WAY TOO MANY ADS! So much in fact that it's really the main reason why I'm giving this game just 1 star. I wish I could actually give this game 0 stars because the ads really killed this game.Every ""round"" that I played ended with an ad popping up. Every ad was automatically clicked on with a popup that read along the lines of ""Are you sure you want to follow this external link outside of Amazon"" which means that it wasn't ads that were going to take me to the Amazon App Store but to games that were located outside of it which can really be an unsafe thing. There was an option to say no and to keep that setting to always say no but once I clicked on that setting the game just locked up and froze and nothing could be done.I'm pretty sure this is a knock off game even though it says ""Flappy Bird Official"" because it was WAY TOO HARD! You tap the screen once and the bird goes flying into oblivion. I was literally only able to get past two tunnels because the touch was just way too sensitive.I recommend this game to NO ONE! Everyone should avoid it at all costs and I wouldn't be surprised if it gets taken down from the store because it's basically an app that shows you a bunch of ads. There really is no game here since the controls are way too sensitive and it's impossible to play.","1.0 out of 5 stars","September 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3LKDHGPBRRVDD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0141GMIX0#wasThisHelpful","R3LKDHGPBRRVDD","A1F7XETXDDGRBE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1F7XETXDDGRBE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I ended up really enjoying this lamp a lot more than I thought I was going to! There are so many things that this lamp can be used for and there are several suggestions on the box. For me I'm going to use it as a nightlight, when reading, for emergencies, and out during camping.I tested this lamp out in a couple different areas and although it doesn't light up a whole room it does light up a specific area. The dome shape of it helps the light travel. The light can go to a pure white light setting as well as to a yellowish light setting. I think the yellowish light is easier on the eyes and I would use that setting for when you are reading or when you want a calmer light at night.What I really love about this lamp is the many different settings. There are 4 ""buttons"" on the actual lamp and I like how there really are so many different settings. You can go super bright or very dim, and everything in between. You can switch from yellow to white for the light. These 4 buttons though are simple touch buttons which I enjoy very much. I think that they are great because all you have to do is simply hold you finger down until you get the setting that you want. With that being said I think that's great for people who have a hard time pushing buttons as it's much easier to use these.This lamp has a very sturdy retractable strap on it. I can see myself hanging this light from a hook with this strap. It's located on the bottom of the lamp so if you would hang it from a hook it'll then act like a chandelier.The charging is very nice. I like that you don't have to worry about replacing batteries. All you have to do is charge this and it's good to go. It's very portable and very lightweight.I received this product in exchange for a review but I stand by my 5 star review. I love this lamp so much that I think I want to get another to keep in the tent trailer for camping.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3JY2RYF0CHCWD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013FPNN3M#wasThisHelpful","R3JY2RYF0CHCWD","A1F7XETXDDGRBE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1F7XETXDDGRBE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a rather tricky game for a number of reasons. First of all you're going to have to find a place to put your tablet/Kindle when you play it. For me I just put it on top of my bookshelf and then it seems to be at the right height. If you can't find a place to put your device that can make a big different for if you can actually play the ""game"" or not.I don't like that this is a rather expensive app and you don't get everything. It is, however, a great alternative to buying the game for a system. So when you compare to buying the full game for a system this seems to be much cheaper BUT you are still going to have to spend some money if you want to unlock more than the couple of songs that it comes with.This is a great workout. For some people they see this as a game while others see it as a workout. It really is both and I find it to be fun and enjoyable. It's very comparable to the Just Dance games.I gave it a 4 out of 5 because it's a little difficult finding the right height each time of where your device should be. Sometimes it just won't cooperate and will tell me the room is too dark or another issue. I also don't like the it's much more expensive than other apps and you still have to pay extra to get more content. In the end I think it's good though because it's still cheaper than going to actual Zumba classes or buying it for a console.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Z2BIX72VO0E8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DVA6ZCI#wasThisHelpful","R1Z2BIX72VO0E8","A1F7XETXDDGRBE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1F7XETXDDGRBE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This review might get a little personal and a little TMI but I just want to express why I like this product and needed to give it a 5 star review. First of all I usually use some kind of liner most of the time. I have irregular periods and I spot a lot. With that being said I need a liner but it's annoying having to deal with them all the time. I like this product for a number of reasons and now I'll discuss each reason in detail:The packaging is nice. It's not a plastic wrap but almost like a cloth wrap. This is nice because that means if you're out and about and need to use a liner you can do so discreetly. Anyone that may hear you in the bathroom won't notice you opening up the packages all the time if you are doing that which is a plus because I know at my own home questions will arise if package opening noises are heard a lot.It's a little thicker than the regular liner and that's a good thing! These liners are just the right thickness to catch things. They are also thin enough to be worn comfortably. I actually prefer these over the regular liners and I feel like they are just overall constructed better.I felt that these were a good price for what they are. They aren't meant to withstand too much but I think they are perfect for me to wear daily as extra protection, for ""just in case"" moments.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1CC31WQ42GJKT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NAZ32P2#wasThisHelpful","R1CC31WQ42GJKT","A1F7XETXDDGRBE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1F7XETXDDGRBE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is one of those catchy soft songs that can be found on various different radio stations. I think it can appeal to a wide audience.

It's good because you can easily pop a whole one in your mouth, it's bad because it's easy to eat a lot them!I'm giving these a 5 star rating for a couple of reasons.

"I have issues with headphones and I seem to go through a lot of them but I've had these for several months now and they are really perfect to me. The issue that I usually have with headphones is ear related. Back in April of this year I developed an ear infection that developed from wearing my gaming headset too much when gaming. Ever since that happened I've been hesitant to put anything on my ears in general but the thing is I need headphones!Now to get to why these headphones are PERFECT to me! First of all they don't hurt. I usually have issues with headphones pushing too hard on my ears. I believe that's how I got the ear infection with my gaming headset. These headphones, however, are quite comfy. There is a cushioning on the ears that makes it feel rather nice. The ear pieces are not gigantic too and I really think that helps. The headphones that have ear pieces that cover the entire ear and press on hard can make it so there's no airflow between the ear piece and ear which (I'm thinking) is the recipe for an ear infection.So yes I'm going on and on about the ear infection but it's important because I know a lot of people that have had ear trouble and with a rise of the use of technology and things being put on the ears I don't think people realize what's happening. I can not use ear buds and I hate spending a lot of money on headphones so these are awesome!Now to the sound quality! AMAZING! Wow! I'm actually listening to Strobe by Deadmau5 right now and the overall sound quality is just amazing. You really wouldn't expect this great of a quality given how cheap these headphones are but they are amazing.Lastly I just want to say that these come with a nice sturdy cord. I feel that it's thick enough to last and overall this pair of headphones is amazingly built. Just overall everything is amazing that's why I HAD to give these a 5 start rating.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RK8W4KU3YFTGF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004RKQM8I#wasThisHelpful","RK8W4KU3YFTGF","A1F7XETXDDGRBE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1F7XETXDDGRBE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When I received this item I was pleasantly surprised to see just how small it was. Sometimes these new kitchen gadgets are quite large which makes storing a nightmare. I love this little slicer because it's quite compact enough that I can keep it one of my drawers in the kitchen.One of my biggest issues in the kitchen is being safe. I usually love using my grater but I have always had the issue of cutting my fingers when when washing it. This spiral slicer, however, seems to be rather safe when it comes to clean up. It comes with a cleaning brush which means my fingers are safe! Overall I think this is a safe enough gadget that if properly shown how to use to them a kid could use it. (Again I do suggest adult supervision since it has a blade but I felt that this is a much safer gadget than a grater)I'm giving this a 5 out of 5 mainly due to the design of the product. It's small and compact and most importantly to me it's safe. I've tried to cut pasta out of my life and now I technically don't have to because now I'm making zucchini pasta! I just love it and I recommend it to anyone curious about veggie pasta and want something that's easy to use and easy to clean.Disclaimer: I did receive this item at a highly discounted rate in exchange for a review but I think anyone would love this product and best of all it comes with a free e-cookbook!","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RBQ7111N5H3MI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00P2MF646#wasThisHelpful","RBQ7111N5H3MI","A1F7XETXDDGRBE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1F7XETXDDGRBE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I actually found these shoes at a Converse outlet but I wanted to do a review on them here to give a little detail on the color. This color is ""sassafras"" and to me the best way to describe it is that it's a purple brown color. With that being said you can really match these shoes with a wide range of other colors since it's not just one set color. I've worn it with purple outfits and I've worn it with tan light colored outfits. It's not too dark as black would be which I think makes it easy to wear with many different outfits.Converse in general aren't known for their arch support. It's basically been the same shoe this whole time so you either love them or you don't. I think that these are great for people who want a shoe that's going to stay on. I have always felt that Converse will somewhat mold to your feet and aren't really for those who have extra wide feet.

"How do you really rate water? Well it's a personal decision! To me I think Dasani is the smoothest bottled waters out there at this price level. Sure you could spend a lot more on the fancier waters but this is really all I want to spend on bottled water. Plus to me some of those more fancier waters had an odd taste to them. Dasani is smooth. It's comparable to Aquafina but just a step above which is why it makes sense that this costs a little more.These particular bottles are the smaller ones. They are not the full size water bottle which means you can easily throw them in your purse, backpack, or whatever you're carrying around.

"First things first, I view this as a drink and not ""water"". Yes it's called Vitamin-WATER but let's be real here. All you really need to do is read the label to find that there's a lot more than water in this drink. With that aside though I love this drink. It has a good flavor to it and is rather refreshing when it's cold. To me personally it's a substitute to soda, which makes sense since Coca-Cola is the company who makes this drink.Full list of ingredients in this drink are the following:Reverse Osmosis Water, Crystalline Fructose, Cane Sugar, Less than 0.5% of: Citric Acid, Vitamin C (Ascorbic Acid), Fruit and Vegetable Juice (Color), Natural Flavors, Berry and Fruit Extracts (Apple, Pomegrante, Acai and Blueberry), Magnesium Lactate and Calcium Lactate and Potassium Phosphate (Electrolyte Sources), Vitamin B3 (Niacinamide), Vitamin B5 (Calcium Pantothenate), Beta-Carotene, Vitamin B6 (Pyridoxine Hydrochloride), Vitamin B12, Manganese Citrate, Gum Acacia.So as you can see it's NOT water! I'm just making that clear to everyone but also, as you can see, it's packed with a lot of vitamins. I don't think it should be a something to be drank with the hopes of getting your daily vitamins but I think it's a great substitute to soda and is a good drink when you want something besides just plain 'ol water.I'm giving it a 5 out of 5 because I personally like it. I like that it's not that strong of a drink but still has good flavoring. I like that it's not carbonated. To me it's the ""in between drink"" between soda/sports drinks and water.

Long story short you're going to get softer hands when washing dishes if you use this soap. It's a little weird at first and I had my doubts thinking ""how can a soap soften hands and wash dishes at the same time?"" but that's basically what it does. Other soaps tend to dry my hands out when washing a big load of dishes but not this soap and most importantly it cleans the dishes as well.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2KL2WNOB4C9BC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00R1CR3VO#wasThisHelpful","R2KL2WNOB4C9BC","A1F7XETXDDGRBE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1F7XETXDDGRBE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've recently been getting into essential oils and I'm happy to have been fortunate enough to be asked to do a review of this product because I think it's truly amazing. It comes in a nice compact bottle that is sealed very well. Upon arrival it was sealed with a ""sealed for your protection"" wrap which I'm thankful for because that right there shows it's good quality.This particular oil is great for calming. I deal with depression and stress so that's why I've been getting into aromatherapy and essential oils lately. So how do I use this lavender essential oil? Well I use it as aromatherapy of course. I must warn you if you're not familiar with this scent it can be rather strong to you at first. This isn't a cheap body wash product that has imitation of lavender, this is the real stuff. With that being said I think it's wise to use this when you want to be calm and are at home relaxing.I was given this product at a highly discounted rate in exchange for a review but I'm happy to report that this is a product I honestly love. In fact, I just used some of it before I started writing this review and I'm at ease and totally relaxed right now. I really recommend this to those who want to calm down.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2RMD0PXSOLN6X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N78I6HQ#wasThisHelpful","R2RMD0PXSOLN6X","A1F7XETXDDGRBE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1F7XETXDDGRBE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Katy Perry is the ""Pop Princess"" for adults. That's really the only way that I can describe her. Her songs are fun and catchy but they have a hard edge to them. This is an explicit album meaning that there is foul language in it. Even if you bought the ""clean"" version though she makes references to harder things, such as drugs and sex. I think overall she's a nice balance though as her songs are rather meaningful for the most part. It might not seem like that with her poppy image and radio presence but I think she's great at songwriting. After all, she did start out in the industry as a song writer.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R32SSUP8EBWV99/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003Y3ZTGA#wasThisHelpful","R32SSUP8EBWV99","A1F7XETXDDGRBE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1F7XETXDDGRBE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This was bought for my cousin's baby who is now 6 months old. This is a board book which means it can handle being tugged at which is something babies love to do to books! This is a really nice beginner book and I think it's perfect for even being the FIRST book shown to a baby.I got the gift set which came with two books of the same size. These books are rather small and that's a good thing! It's the perfect size for a baby to hold on to and so far I haven't heard any reports of the baby ripping it apart.I really recommend this to anyone with a baby.

"I was really pleasantly surprised when I received this brush set. It ended up being a lot bigger than I thought it was going to be which is a good thing to me! I measured the case itself to be about 14 and a half inches long with all the brushes being longer than 10 inches each.This is a really nice set that I think all painters would love. It truly is nice enough for even professional painters to use. I really love that the thinner brushes even have a plastic tube protector on the tips. I feel like these brushes were built to last and this case does a good job protecting them. I really like that there's such a large assortment of different brushes. There are 15 of them and each are different which means this set probably has the brush you want/need.I think the case is really nice because it can be turned into a stand on both sides. Simply just pull the velcro panel on each side and it will stand up. The case closes with a zipper. Overall the case reminds me of one of those higher end binders that are used for school. I believe the brand was ""5 Star"" is what I'm referring to. This case for the brushes remind me of one of those binders which I think means that it should last and protect the brushes well.Please note I was able to get this set at a highly discounted rate in exchange for an unbiased review.

"I think that this is a great makeup set that would be perfect for travel or for around the house. I think it would be good even for the house because it really is a great way to hold your brushes without them being spread all over the place.The container itself I measured to be 6 inches long which was actually bigger than I was expecting so I'm happy about that. I love the ""tin"" it's in and I feel like it can really protect the brushes which is why this is perfect for travel. I like the color of it as well but to me I think it's more of a purply pink than straight pink, like a metallic pink.The brushes are very soft. They each have a different shape so you can create some interesting makeup styles. I recommend this set to those who enjoy wearing eye makeup. I also think that these brushes would be good for mineral makeup.Please note I was given this set in exchange for an unbiased review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3LLM453BNOOJH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013GDOW56#wasThisHelpful","R3LLM453BNOOJH","A1F7XETXDDGRBE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1F7XETXDDGRBE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Well this is different from your regular mouse ""trap"" because it doesn't really kill them. It's basically an extremely sticky device that will catch the mouse and won't let it go. With that being said, if you do not find the mice it can possibly die from being stuck to it for too long and not being able to get out and be free, so keep that in mind if you are trying to be humane.These are great traps though! I actually prefer them over the regular traps with the cheese because these are much easier to set up. Not to mention you don't have to worry about them accidentally going off on you or other animals, i.e. cats, that shouldn't be messing around with them.Please take note I was provided with free samples of this product but I have enjoyed this product so much that I do plan on buying them in the future. I really recommend these to those who do not like how ""regular"" mouse traps work and want an easier way to catch and dispose of mice in and around your house.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3UVZ923M32KN3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YEEKGWK#wasThisHelpful","R3UVZ923M32KN3","A1F7XETXDDGRBE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1F7XETXDDGRBE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I just love Sun Chips! I do not, however, like spicy things in general but these chips are not THAT spicy! The first time I had these chips I was a little hesitant because of the words ""Garden Salsa"" on them since when I think of salsa I think of spicy. There is a little kick to them but it's not at all as spicy as one would think. If anything they have a fresh salsa taste to them, like someone just made salsa from the vegetables that were growing in the garden that's growing in your backyard!So these chips are absolutely wonderful and are my favorite Sun Chips. I recommend them to those who enjoy a fresh tasting chip. They do have an overall more healthy taste to them, as they should since they are made with whole grain. Pair these with a freshly made sandwich that has fresh ingredients and a water or iced tea and you're going to have an amazingly fresh tasting meal!","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2CUKTA26N8MPF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00R1J44XW#wasThisHelpful","R2CUKTA26N8MPF","A1F7XETXDDGRBE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1F7XETXDDGRBE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A ""coloring book"" is a weird concept on the Kindle. I do love this app but I have a hard time calling it a ""coloring book"". To me a coloring book you're actually using something, a marker, pencil, crayon, etc., and physically coloring with each stroke. This app you're using a stylus or finger (I just use my finger) and you simply just touch each section and it will fill in the area with the color you want. It's enjoyable to me but it still is not exactly like a coloring book.This is one of those apps where you have to spend money to ""unlock"" everything. You are given several pages and colors with the app but if you want to really get creative and have a wider range of colors to choose from and bigger selection of pages you'll need to ""unlock"" each thing by buying them. Sometimes apps that do that disappoint me which is why I've given the app just 4 stars instead of 5 because you are only given 2 color palettes to choose from right away.Another reason why I couldn't give a full 5 star rating was when sharing time came. I couldn't easily share after selecting the share button which was a little disappointing. I ended up getting the share button to work after restarting the app but I don't know why it wouldn't quite work at first.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RARMVDUX5AAH7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01248YO8E#wasThisHelpful","RARMVDUX5AAH7","A1F7XETXDDGRBE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1F7XETXDDGRBE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have seen others say that their body gets used to a deodorant and thus the product doesn't work as well after a couple months or so of use. With that being said, for right now this product has been working amazingly for me. I was a little skeptical with the gel because for some reason I've had this idea that gels were for men so I never used a gel deodorant before. I was pleasantly surprised to find that the gel dried very fast! I put it on and it felt like only a couple seconds later it dried on me! This was a good thing to me.This deodorant is amazing to me and lasts...I mean it really lasts. I tested it and didn't put on deodorant the next day one time and it was still working! In fact, I've tried the clinical strength deodorant and I find this Secret Outlast deodorant to actually work better and longer!I recommend this deodorant for those who have long days and want to stay dry and fresh smelling throughout the whole day. For me personally I deal with the issue that many other woman deal with and that's having deodorant not work after awhile after continue use. I do love this particular deodorant the best right now so what I do is rotate through my deodorants. I will simply use a more plain deodorant when I plan on staying home for the day but when I go out now I want this Secret Outlast especially if it's going to be a hot day and I know I'm going to sweat.Please note I received this item as a free sample through Bzzagent but I did in fact like this product so much that I do intend on buying it again.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R6NXVHSQYFQ4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007K6K0IY#wasThisHelpful","R6NXVHSQYFQ4","A1F7XETXDDGRBE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1F7XETXDDGRBE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It's advertised as a mobile mouse pad but honestly I use this as my main mouse pad. I usually don't like spending too much on a mouse pad but for around $20 this is a great mouse pad. It's not that big at all but I put it on my desk long ways so that I can slide my mouse up and down instead of back and forth side to side.I mainly play League of Legends for the PC and I use this mouse pad with my Razer Deathadder Chroma mouse. It's amazing and together they work perfectly. The mouse smoothly slides on this mouse pad and stays on my desk when I use it. I have a glass desk and the mouse pad stays put which is something other mouse pads might not do.When you get this mouse pad it'll come rolled up in the packaging. Save this packaging! It really doesn't take up that much room at all and I use it when I travel. I just roll up the mouse pad and put it in it's original packaging and since the packaging is rather sturdy it protects the mouse pad.I think this is a great mouse pad and I recommend it to anyone really. It's so much better than one of those cheap pads and it's really nice for gaming.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3A2XJ5O9OYCGI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002JCSCQ6#wasThisHelpful","R3A2XJ5O9OYCGI","A1F7XETXDDGRBE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1F7XETXDDGRBE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've had many gaming mice over the years from various brands and this is by far my favorite mouse. I've had Razer mouse before but the problem I had in the past is that the mice were just too small. This particular mouse is much bigger than other Razer mice I have used which is perfect for me because I have somewhat ""bigger"" hands. (even though I'm a girl!)I mainly play a game called League of Legends and this mouse is perfect for it. Another game that I regularly play is Orcs Must Die 2. In that game I play a mage and there is so much clicking in it my arm actually tires from it every now and then. This mouse is able to handle the constant clicking. I'm reviewing this mouse several months after owning it and it's still preforming as well as I first bought it. I game a good 5-8 hours a day (I'm actually on a competitive League of Legends ranked team) so that's pretty good that it's last this long to me.I love the color scheme. It's on a constant rotation that rotates through all of the colors in a rainbow and it's beautifully done. It just doesn't go from one color to the next it actually smoothly transforms into the next color creating a wonderful light show. It's not distracting at all when gaming which is a plus. Honestly it's something that probably won't even be noticed when using it because your hand covers the lights for the most part when using it.I recommend this to those who play games that click a lot and someone who needs a mouse that's easily gripable. I stated before that i have bigger hands but I don't know if that translates to the size of guy hands since I'm a girl. I think your best bet is to go to a store, like Best Buy, who has the mouse on display to feel in person if it's the right fit for you. I can say though that I recommend buying this mouse on Amazon and not Best Buy though because it's much cheaper on here than at Best Buy.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3EDTZ0B4FDOAL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MYTSDU4#wasThisHelpful","R3EDTZ0B4FDOAL","A1F7XETXDDGRBE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1F7XETXDDGRBE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"With so many devices being charged via USB these portable battery chargers are becoming increasingly popular for those who need to top up on the go. This battery holds a massive 50000mAh, which is enough to keep charging a single mobile over and over again. I charged my HTC One X from only this for a week and it showed no signs of running low on power.The battery has 2 USB charging ports on it so you can, for example, easily charge a mobile and a tablet at the same time. I also liked the addition of a torch which is activated by a double press of the only button on the battery. This really adds to the use of the battery and makes it really handy to keep in the car or take camping.But you only get one cable. For most this isn't really an issue, it's likely you will just use your existing USB cable, but the addition of a carry case for the battery and accessories would make this an even more brilliant travel gadget.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3C4NGAKBNUO5C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FDLPMH2#wasThisHelpful","R3C4NGAKBNUO5C","A18N6P1LXMTLZ0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A18N6P1LXMTLZ0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Adams Plus Flea and Tick Control for Dogs is a monthly application to get rid of those pesky pests that bug our best friends.It's simple and effective against  fleas, ticks, flea eggs, and flea larvae and very easy to apply. However you must follow the instruction and take care not to squeeze too hard or you will make a mess and end up spraying everywhere other than your dog. It's only for use on dogs 12 weeks and older and 15-30 lbs.I would highly recommend giving this a try, your family will thank you and so will your dog.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R12OMKW03D602R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HE5N240#wasThisHelpful","R12OMKW03D602R","A12E0Y0J6584RT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A12E0Y0J6584RT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I fitted these to my motorbike and was skeptical whether they would make any difference but was very impressed with the overall improvement in performance.  This wasn't just the improvement in power but also in the ease it now starts.  I would say the investment in these is definitely worthwhile and a quick way to improve your vehicle.

"The Hideaway with Stand by Gumdrop Cases is the Otterbox Equal for your Tablet. It is specifically for your Google Nexus9 Tablet, but they do make them for other Tablet models. It's Rugged design is tough and great for kids and adults.It comes in 6 different color options and has two different viewing options with the pullout stand. There is no need to purchase a screen protector as this comes with one already built in.Because the case is made of thick rubber it is shock proof, and scratch proof, however I have never met a case that is dirt proof especially with children, however the built in screen protector is easy to clean and so is the case itself.This is a wonderful case and offers supper protection It's definitely worth the price to protect your tech.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R20OEFPT2F1018/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SOXMXMI#wasThisHelpful","R20OEFPT2F1018","A12E0Y0J6584RT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A12E0Y0J6584RT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This player is under $100 so now you can have Blu-Ray at a price which you would have bought your standard DVD player for not that long ago.  Also the move forward with technology means this player is compact and light so can conveniently fits into almost any entertainment area.  Another plus is that it will stream movies so connect to a network and you can have Amazon prime streaming through it like I do.As far as Blu-Ray playback quality and features this is a very impressive player for the price plus you get the reliability of Panasonic who are in my opinion one of the top electronics companies.  This player matches perfectly with my Panasonic Plasma TV and movies are a joy to watch.

"This is an Adorable Apron from the company ICUP. It features the character Elsa's Body from Frozen a popular Disney Movie. The Apron itself is 100% Cotton however the print of Elsa is a screen print/plastic and if stretched too much of scrapped will begin to break apart.Although there isn't a size listed this is an Adult size Apron, I'm quite curvy and it easily fits me with room to spare. It also fits my 8 year old daughter although it is a bit long on her. Because it's 100% cotton it's machine washable, and easy to clean just simply wash on cold and dry on the lowest setting to avoid damaging the design or hang to dry.Overall this is a very cute apron, that is functional easy to clean and a great present for any Frozen fan.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R25PYGIV4UGF2E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00V2TT62G#wasThisHelpful","R25PYGIV4UGF2E","A12E0Y0J6584RT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A12E0Y0J6584RT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Goodnite Bedtime Pants aren't you basic Pull-Ups pants. These are made specifically for nighttime and for older/bigger children who occasional have problems with bed wetting. The Large/Extra Large size is for boys 80-125lbs / ages 8-14 and is 40% more absorbent than pull-ups.The cooling alert effect tells boys when they're leaked a little and they have to go potty. From what I can tell it's not always a strong enough sensation to wake my son up from a dead sleep, but he has had some success with it and is getting up in the night to go potty on his own now.They come in a variety of designs from Iron Man to Skateboards etc. And since they are stretchy there is quite a bit of room to grow in to. They are thin enough to fit under most outfits with ease without any uncomfortable bulk.I would highly recommend these Goodnites for any parents with young ones still needing that extra help at night time.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1FBLY0CLMCPXS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00U0O56BE#wasThisHelpful","R1FBLY0CLMCPXS","A12E0Y0J6584RT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A12E0Y0J6584RT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have always been a big fan of Thirsties. As a mother of 3 diapers can add up and there are quite a few options for cloth diapers these days. Originally I tried Thirsties with Pockets.  These worked excellent, but a friend recommended the All in One so I thought i'd give it a try.The Thirsties All in One snap diaper is for babies 8-40lbs ( so quite the growth range). It comes with multiple snaps for easy adjustment and easy removable. Inside you'll see a thick 100% polyester/micro fleece layer as well as the layer underneath for twice the leak protection.These have worked very well for me and my two younger boys.

Keep in mind this is supposed to be like a real baby so the diaper is a one use thing.If you're really careful i find that using a hair dryer on low setting can dry it out for a second or third use, but you will have to purchase the Baby Alive Diapers Super Refill Pack.Overall it's a nice doll, but it's not a great investment.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RL1QTXXG5A1OM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00O5COSQG#wasThisHelpful","RL1QTXXG5A1OM","A12E0Y0J6584RT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A12E0Y0J6584RT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Doctor Waselkov really knocks it out of the park with ""A Conquering Spirit."" There aren't a whole lot of books written on the Redstick War; those that exist often focus on the role of Andrew Jackson. Waselkov chronicles the dynamics of the Alabama frontier--how the white Americans, Creek Native Americans, escaped black slaves, and people of mixed-ethnicities blended into a community. The community fell apart when the Creek nation split, with some members backing a Prophet who advocated fighting the whites; and the second group of Creeks opposing the Prophet (essentially a Creek Civil War). As so often happens in Civil Wars, the violence committed by all parties was amped up--as can be seen in the Battle for Fort Mims & Horseshoe Bend. In the end, the Redstick War was the excuse needed for the US to gobble up Creek land. Even the Creek members who aided and fought alongside the white Americans suffered and lost their lands.All in all, ""A Conquering Spirit"" is a fantastic historic work; it reads like a novel, but with a sociologist's eye for the human condition. If you're interested in frontier America or Native American history, you will enjoy ""A Conquering Spirit.""","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RXRIAJLGZKCV6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0817355731#wasThisHelpful","RXRIAJLGZKCV6","A2FKDV5I2Z69Z7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FKDV5I2Z69Z7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have never regretted purchasing this game set! For me, Hnefatafl is a borderline addiction. Since the game is relatively unknown, I mostly play online. But I still wanted a set, to work through different strategies and problems. I found this version to be the best balance between price and quality. A few random points:1) The pieces are resin, cast in such a manner as to look as if they were carved from wood. That's a cool idea that balances the authentic look of the Hnefatafl pieces with a sturdy modern material.2) The board is also very sturdy and well made. I often take my set to the park, and I've carried the set while flying (carry on). Quite often when I play at the park, people come up and ask about the game. So this nice Hnefatafl set is a great way to introduce people to the game.3) The set includes directions for playing the game, as well as some strategies. One of the great things about Hnefatafl is that one can learn the rules quickly, and start playing. This rulebook pamphlet does help.4) Its produced by a small-business.

"""Illinois: A History of the Prairie State"" is possibly the best general history of Illinois currently available.

"""Rising Up from Indian Country,"" is an outstanding Historical work. There are quite a few good books about Illinois during the War of 1812, but the themes of this book sets it apart. Ann Durkin Keating approaches the Battle of Fort Dearborn from the perspective of the pre-war local community, composed of the Native Americans, Europeans, and Metis who were involved in the fur trade. These three groups, from disparate cultures, created a fusion of all their cultures in order to successfully prosper in the fur trade.When the War of 1812 was declared, members of this fusion culture were forced to choose sides. Despite being official enemies, their interpersonal connections continued to serve them throughout the war--and resulted in lives saved during and after the Battle of Fort Dearborn.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2Y8VYG2FB3643/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0226428966#wasThisHelpful","R2Y8VYG2FB3643","A2FKDV5I2Z69Z7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FKDV5I2Z69Z7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I bought two of these, and I am extremely happy with them both. The canteens are brand new, dark green w/ dark green caps; they do not have the tzahal property marks. I have three Israeli issue canteens, and these canteens are pretty close. The size is the same, but the canteens in these sets are a harder plastic.  The canteen covers are the best--they are heavyweight canvas with standard snap closure. The color is a type of light khaki that looks like the British Commonwealth color of World War Two. The back of the canteen has a wide strap for wearing on a regular belt; ""c"" clips for mounting on the British style pistol belt; and the M1910 style hook for hanging on US pistol belts. The two canteen covers I received were clearly dated 1968, and had the tzahal property mark.  For what its worth, I have never seen an Israeli canteen cup so I have no way of knowing if they would fit in the canteen pouch with the canteen. I was able to fit a US canteen & cup in the pouch.  All in all I think the Israeli canteen set is well worth the money, and I'm glad I purchased them.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 12, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1RPUTGFMEPVU2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CFRIQY8#wasThisHelpful","R1RPUTGFMEPVU2","A2FKDV5I2Z69Z7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FKDV5I2Z69Z7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I try to read every book I can get about guerrilla warfare, and this has become one of my favorites. ""Pinoys at War"" is part political science, and part oral history. The author interviewed Filipino guerrilla veterans, in order to learn about what motivated them to become guerrillas. The results are riveting, as the veterans tell their stories about their wartime experiences. At the same time, this is a political science book, and the author fits the guerrilla veterans' personal journeys into the ""big picture"" of guerrilla warfare and political violence.I enjoyed ""Pinoys at War,"" and recommend it to anyone who wants to learn more about insurgent warfare theory.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 25, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3RD001BQYQGDB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0578118440#wasThisHelpful","R3RD001BQYQGDB","A2FKDV5I2Z69Z7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FKDV5I2Z69Z7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought this watch five years ago when I was on leave from Iraq.

"For me, the title says it all--these are awesome gloves. We started using Mechanix Wear gloves in Iraq, because the issue nomex gloves couldn't stand up to the use & abuse we put them through (we were convoy escort, so we were always working on our vehicles & 50 cals). At that time, Mechanix Wear geared their gloves to the civilian market, so we had to buy the black gloves, and use sharpie marker to color in the white logos. Still, we had to hide the gloves from the Sergeants-Major, who would go into convulsions if they saw us using non-issue gloves...Anyhow, most of us brought our Mechanix gloves home at the end of our tour, because they were still in good shape. Now that the company is producing a more 'tactical' style glove, I bought a pair, and love them as much as the originals (plus the new ones don't smell like Iraq).  A few points about the Mechanix Wear M-Pact gloves:* Love the coyote brown tan color; works just as well with civilian clothes as with a military uniform.* The rubber finger & knuckle guards provide great protection, but are segmented so you can still flex your fingers.* The black rubber on the palms and fingers is 'grippy,' I can put away & take my car keys out of my pants pocket without taking off the gloves. The same feature helps with magazine changes, as well as working in the garage with tools.* The logo is also coyote tan, so it blends in with the glove...No need for a sharpie marker.* The price point is fantastic; I can get a pair for the garage, and one each for my hiking kit and for each car trunk.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 5, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1D95QYSJFHOQV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007INZVGA#wasThisHelpful","R1D95QYSJFHOQV","A2FKDV5I2Z69Z7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FKDV5I2Z69Z7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"""The Collapse of Yugoslavia 1991-1999"" is an excellent introduction to the wars of the 90's in the former Yugoslavia. Yes, it is an Osprey book, so know it will be a quick read, and not too in depth. But really, that is typical of Osprey publications: they are often a great intro to military history topics, though they do not bring anything really new to the historiography.A few minor points about the book:* Professor Finlan's writing style flows nicely, and is easy to follow; this ""reads well,"" and not at all like a textbook.* The author does a wonderful job describing the numerous ethnic armies fighting for land in the former Yugoslavia (this was the first Yugoslavia Wars book I've read where I didn't need a cheat sheet listing the various sides). He carefully and easily documents the twisting alliances between the various Croat / Serb / Muslim factions.* The maps are excellent, and add greatly to the text. Best of all, the maps stand alone, so one does not need to keep flipping from maps to text.* The section on the Netherlands Battalion's attempted defense of Srebenica is both heartbreaking and infuriating. It is amazing how the Dutch soldiers were left without a real chance to defend themselves or the ""safe zone"" they were tasked with guarding, due to the bureaucratic mess in the UN command. Their failed defense of Srebenica is heartbreaking, knowing that thousands of civlians were murdered when the ""safe zone"" fell to the Serbian army.* Professor Finlan is British, and is understandably a fan of the British Army (I had the opportunity to serve with some Brits in Iraq, and I'm a fan too). However, his fan-boy praise for the British generals is a little over-the-top; I don't think a 95 page book needs a full-page photograph of General Smith, and a 3/4 page photograph of General Rose. Lest it seem I'm judging too harshly, the 7 page vignette on the Cheshire Regiment's tour is a great read.I have read about a dozen books on the wars in the former Yugoslavia, and I highly recommend ""The Collapse of Yugoslavia, 1991-1999."" Other books that would go well with this one would be Osprey's Elite series ""The Yugoslav Wars (1) & (2), which are studies of the uniforms and equipment carried by the combatants.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 5, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2BCL5NGEWNK5F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1841768057#wasThisHelpful","R2BCL5NGEWNK5F","A2FKDV5I2Z69Z7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FKDV5I2Z69Z7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm familiar with Doctor Borsarello's writings through ""Camouflaged Uniforms of the Warsaw Pact & Non-Aligned Forces."" So I quickly bought a copy of his latest work. I was not dissapointed; ""Camouflage Uniforms of European and NATO Armies 1945 to the Present"" is excellent. The book is not really an encyclopedia of camouflage, rather a survey, which shows how various countries have decided to hide their soldiers. A few points about the book:* This is a survey, not all-inclusive. So you may not see your ""favorite"" camouflage pattern. On the other hand, I'm sure you will find patterns you never knew existed.* I'm glad Borsarello lists a wide range of countries, not just the big countries whose militaries are often in the news.* Quite a few of the photographs and text are the same as Borsarello's ""Camouflaged Uniforms of the Warsaw Pact."" If you've read that book, be prepared for repeat. Since ""Warsaw Pact"" came out ten years before ""Camouflage Uniforms,"" I hoped that Borsarello would include new photos, not merely rehash old photos.* As is typical with a niche book, this did not come from a large publisher, with highly paid translators. So the English language version can be tough to understand because of the broken English. It isn't a show-stopper, but will take a little effort.* Borsarello has a confusing tendency to invent names for camouflage, rather than using each country's designation. This can be confusing because he often gives different names to the same pattern. An example would be his using three different terms for the same pattern of Czechoslovakian Warsaw Pact camouflage; or his using two very different descriptions of the same Spanish camouflage.* Finally, a word of note...Though this book covers ""1945 to the present,"" Borsarello's present ends when the book was first published in 1999. A lot of changes have come about in the 13 years since the book came out. Perhaps Doctor Borsarello will publish a second edition?All in all, Doctor Borsarello is one of the most distinguished military historians on the field of camouflage theory and patterns. I recommend this book to all my friends who collect militaria, and I recommend it to you, too.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 3, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3SC4C8KUNCWS5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0764310186#wasThisHelpful","R3SC4C8KUNCWS5","A2FKDV5I2Z69Z7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FKDV5I2Z69Z7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"One thing I've always found interesting about the Cold War, is that military historians have effectively ignored it since the fall of the Berlin Wall and the end of Communism in the former USSR. With a few minor exceptions, most of the information we have on the Warsaw Pact armies is the same info NATO had in the 1980s.Doctor Borsarello has attempted to rectify that within his historical specialty of military camouflage. Though this book was written in 1989, at the sunset of the Cold War, Borsarello used a lot of original research. Borsarello documents about 40 different camouflage patterns that were all used by Warsaw Pact nations. Some of the photographs are of the actual militaries, and many of them are Doctor Borsarello's collection. All the pho. tos are good quality, and show great detail.I've always been interested in the Warsaw Pact, having grown up seeing them on television (as the ""enemy"").

"I'm a big fan of Martin Brayley's writing, and have bought all his books I can find. Niche writing is always hard, because your readers tend to be knowledgeable on the subject. Brayley, however, always does a fine job of covering new information, and ""Camouflage Uniforms 1940-2010"" is no different.It would be impossible to list and photograph EVERY type of camouflage used in the last 60 years, as many are still classified or exceedingly rare. On top of that, many countries use the same pattern--it would be tiring to look at page-after-page of all the countries that use US M-81 woodland camoufage. So don't be surprised if your favorite camouflage uniform isn't featured.

"The Nite Ize figure 9 series have been around for awhile, but I just recently got turned onto them. I have to say, I totally love them. If you are not familiar with the product, it takes the place of knots on tent lines or guy lines, as well as allowing faster adjustment. The figure 9 does this by a series of angles and ""teeth"" that grip the cord.PROS:* Lightweight! You can throw these in your pack, and not feel any weight difference. Yet they'll allow you to secure a tent, or rig up a tarp for use as a shelter. Perfect for a survival kit, or in a ""get home"" bag.* The directions are actually molded into the plastic, so if you forget which order to manipulate the cord--it's right there. By the way, the directions are not complex; there's only two steps to locking down a cord.* For me, the true worth of the figure 9 is that I can use it with gloves on, or when my hands are cold. If I was in a survival situation where I wasn't operating at 100%, I would definitely want this tool with me.CONS:* This is a premature concern, and I have not had a chance to test it out. But, the figure 9 is plastic, and I wonder if it will get brittle and crack when used in sub-zero weather. I'll have to wait until winter and then post an update.All in all, I think the Nite Ize figure 9 is completely worth the money.

"Just a quick caveat--I don't have an opinion on Bear Grylls. It seems that many of these reviews are a referemdum on the man, and not the equipment. Love or hate him, he won't be there when I'm out camping or hiking, so all I care about is the quality of the firesteel.That being said, I found the Gerber-brand, Bear Grylls endorsed firesteel at the local big box store. It was on clearance for a price that was less than Light My Fire firesteels, or the military issued magnesium firestarter, so I bought it. I'm always looking for better (or more) equipment, regardless of who's name is on it, and this was a good opportunity to try a new product.General Info:* The Gerber firesteel is relatively light; it weighs about the same as the military issue magnesium firestarter & striker but more than a Light My Fire-brand firestarter. It is just over 4 1/2"" long when closed.* The ferrocerium rod is 1 1/2"" long. As a point of contrast, it is 1/4"" shorter than the Light My Fire, but the Gerber is thicker.* The two halves of the striker are held together by 22"" of parachute cord. This cord can be removed from the firesteel in the event you need it. Minor point, but it is 3 strand parachute cord, not the military 7 strand.* A nice point about the Gerber firesteel is that it serves multiple functions in one tool. The body of the firesteel will hold tinder; I was able to fit a couple vaseline soaked cotton balls inside. I probably could have forced in more than 2, but I want to be able to get them out if my hands are wet or cold, or I'm not functioning at 100%.* The Gerber firesteel also has a small whistle which, for it's size, is very loud and piercing. My whistle & whistle housing broke off the parachute cord as I was taking it out of the package. The whistle still works, it just isn't attached.How Well Does It Start Fires???I tested the Gerber firesteel in my backyard here in northern Illinois. It had not rained in about a week, and everything was dry. The weather was in the mid-70's; breezy but not windy. I used the Gerber firesteel, the Light My Fire, and the military issue magnesium firesteel. For tinder I typically use vaseline soaked cottonballs, but for this test I also used cotton dryer lint.The Gerber firesteel threw great sparks! It only took two ""swipes"" to get enough coating off the ferrocerium rod to enable good sparks. Once I got the coating off, the Gerber lit the cottonball in two swipes. It lit the dryer lint on the fourth swipe. In an emergency situation, I would consider that acceptable. The Light My Fire took the same number of swipes, and the magnesium firestarter took one more swipe when lighting the dryer lint. Honestly, I consider them all about equal.In comparison to the Light My Fire and the magnesium fire starter, the Gerber performed well. I'm not sorry I purchased it, as it functions well, and I always like to have as many fire-starters around as I can find. I have no problem recommending the Gerber Bear Grylls fire starter to my friends.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 11, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ECI1AJB6O9FN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008PI6F9O#wasThisHelpful","R2ECI1AJB6O9FN","A2FKDV5I2Z69Z7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FKDV5I2Z69Z7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""Total Resistance"" is a Cold War guerrilla warfare manual prepared by the Swiss government for distribution in the event of a Soviet/Warsaw Pact invasion. I mention this first because all the different techniques, tactics and procedures in the book flow from this thesis. If you have read Mao or Che, and found yourself rolling your eyes at their overly-wordy political rants, then ""Total Resistance"" is for you.PROS:* The concepts are easy to understand & easy to implement. I get the impression that this manual was meant to be handed from guerrilla-to-guerrilla, rather than sit on a bookshelf as a reference.* The manual covers a broad range of scenarios for combat action. Whether you have two guerrillas or two hundred, this manual will list an operation that works at your manpower level. Typically, the safest operation for a guerrilla unit to engage are the enemy's logistics and communications network. ""Total Resistance"" follows this concept, and shows how to perform roadblocks, attacks on trains, and attacks on telephone lines.* Beyond small unit tactics, ""Total Resistance"" explains how to grow your resistance movement (page 103-109). This is important, since insurgent movements can wither when members quit believing in the cause. As a historical example I would mention the large number of Sandinistas who became Contras after being disillusioned with the 'revolucion.'CONS:* The manual leans on the assumption that you will get support from fellow citizens (page 20-21). Historically speaking, this is incorrect. Most citizens in occupied areas will keep their heads down and merely try to survive. Studies of the French Resistance in WWII showed that roughly 1% of the population actively took part in the resistance movement. The Mujahadeen in Afghanistan, while resisting the Soviets, were at about 3% (and they had the 'jihad' concept to help recruitment).* As an adjunct to the above, ""Total Resistance"" posits that very little of the population will collaborate with the enemy (page 84). Again, history shows otherwise. In the Philippines in WWII, almost the entire pre-war power structure sided with the Japanese. The only major figure to refuse collaboration was the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, who was subsequently beheaded. For European examples, look at Yugoslavia and Ukraine in WWII. Both had significant segments of their population side with the Nazis.* One complaint I noticed with other reviewers is the belief that technology has changed to such an extent that ""Total Resistance"" is obsolete. In this case I respectfully disagree. Guerrilla fighters typically fight with what they have available. This is the lure of guerrilla warfare--that the weak can use what they have to fight the mighty. Look at the rockets and IEDs that were used in Iraq; most were home made using parts one could find in hardware stores (we were hit by one that was made from Christmas lights left behind by GI's). The point is that, as long as there are men and women willing to fight, guerrilla war will continue.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 6, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZN7K0GVCULPF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0873640217#wasThisHelpful","RZN7K0GVCULPF","A2FKDV5I2Z69Z7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FKDV5I2Z69Z7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love reading any book about outdoors skills, and I regularly practice the skills I find valuable. That being said, I'm the furthest thing from an expert--more of a perpetual student. I'm always looking for new techniques or tricks. With that in mind, I received ""Hawke's Special Forces Survival Handbook"" in the mail yesterday, and spent all night reading it cover to cover. In short, it is now my favorite go-to survival manual.PROS:* Hawke's writing style is conversational, and easy-to-read. It reads as if he is standing in front of you, explaining the concepts directly.* Hawke's survival techniques are part of a system, which he easily explains. This framework helps because it shows the reader why & when to perform the techniques. Since so much of survival is mental, Hawke figures that in, as well.* The diagrams stand on their own; unlike many survival books I've read, where you have to flip between the diagrams and the text to figure out the concept.* The medical section on first aid is fantastic. I went through the Combat Lifesaver Course when I was in the Army, and this chapter blew that away.* Hawke's descriptions on how to forage for wild plants is the most straightforward & easy to remember that I've ever read.* I found the book to be lightweight and well built. The cover and the pages are water resistant. It is also small enough to fit in the dead space in your pack (or in your cargo pocket for a day hike).CONS:* None. I've seen some reviewers who were upset that they found this book heavy; they might want to try cutting off the front- and back cover, that will help a bit.In all honesty, there is no ""one"" survival book. Each has something to offer, and some technique you have not seen before. Of course, you can't go around carrying fifty different survival books. So if I can only have one book, it has to be the book that has the most useful information. For me, that book is ""Hawke's Special Forces Survival Handbook.""","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 6, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R5PXNPCJMEVS6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0762440643#wasThisHelpful","R5PXNPCJMEVS6","A2FKDV5I2Z69Z7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FKDV5I2Z69Z7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Despite only being a state for roughly 40 years, Illinois was fourth in the Union for ""most soldiers"" sent to fight the Confederacy. Professor Hicken set out to write a book about these men (and a few women) who fought to preserve the Union--and he succeeded marvelously. ""Illinois In The Civil War"" is a fantastic book that balances the ""map level"" war of strategy with the war on the ground, as the soldiers saw it.One thing I really enjoyed about the book was Hicken's detailed writing about the units themselves. Because each regiment was raised in a specific area, they each had an interesting ""flavor."" For instance, the 33rd Illinois was made up of college kids from what would later be Illinois State University. The 45th Illinois were tough lead miners from the Galena area. Some units seemed nondescript, but for the fact that they always seemed to be in the heat of battle--like the 36th Illinois, that helped save the day at the Battle of Franklin.I'm a big fan of Illinois history, and this book has never left my nightstand. I've visited many of the places Professor Hicken wrote about, and I've used the book on the battlefield parks as a guide. I've recommended ""Illinois In The Civil War"" to all my friends, and I recommend it to you, too.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 6, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RAQ4MZVYX494Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0252061659#wasThisHelpful","RAQ4MZVYX494Q","A2FKDV5I2Z69Z7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FKDV5I2Z69Z7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Glenn Garvin was a newspaper reporter who spent six years living with the Contras in Honduras & Nicaragua. The results of his interviews is this book ""Everybody Had His Own Gringo."" Garvin is an excellent writer; had he changed paths slightly, he would have been an excellent novelist.The book covers the history of the Contras; how they came to be and who filled their ranks. If there is a central theme to ""Everybody Had His Own Gringo,"" it is that the Contras were a living Rohrshach test--everyone saw in them what they wanted. To the Reagan administration they were brave freedom fighters; to the American left they were the worst type of terrorist. Yet neither of these camps really made an effort to find out what the Contras were about; they were just a means to a political end. Garvin took the time to meet the Contras, and find out what actually motivated them. What he found was a complex organization that was often at odds with itself, and which often had differing visions of what they wanted to achieve.In ""Everybody Had His Own Gringo,"" Glenn Garvin has produced the best first hand account of the Contra insurgency in Nicaragua.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 4, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R171LS4QWAMONQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0080405622#wasThisHelpful","R171LS4QWAMONQ","A2FKDV5I2Z69Z7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FKDV5I2Z69Z7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I read ""Beating Goliath"" for a PoliSci course in grad school. I've always been interested in insurgencies and guerrilla warfare, and I like to read every book I can get my hands on. This was one of the better books, as the writer's style is both informative and well written. Record's central idea is that the side with the greater organizational will to win is the side most likely to prevail in an insurgency. An example he cites is the British Empire during the American Revolution; part of the English lack of will was knowing that they had a stable homeland to return to. Record also addresses the importance of the insurgency having outside support as a factor in victory (ie Chinese support for the NVA & Viet Cong).All in all, ""Beating Goliath"" is a well written political science book, that adds to the rich literature on insurgent warfare.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 4, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RKKRNOSXZVIGM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1597970913#wasThisHelpful","RKKRNOSXZVIGM","A2FKDV5I2Z69Z7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FKDV5I2Z69Z7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought this knife just before my first deployment. I have a cursed habit of losing pocket knives (and sunglasses, but that's another story), so I didn't want to pay too much. Against character, I haven't lost this knife, and it is now nine years old.A few random points:* This knife is sturdy! I've used it to cut, stab, poke and pry. It is still going strong.* The star-head screws that hold the handles on, and hold on the pocket clip, are still tight and have not needed to be re- tightened.* This knife takes a great edge, and was quick and easy to sharpen (even in the field, under less than optimum conditions).* The handles are magnesium, and covered with a black protective coating. Though the handle feels smooth, I've never had problems with it slipping. I've dropped it or banged it hard a number of times. Despite rough handling, only a little of the black coating has chipped off.* The blade has two small guards; this was the main feature that lead me to buy the knife. The guards allow you to open the knife one handed, and very quickly. It also provides a bit of safety.The Smith and Wesson Magnesium HRT is a rugged knife, and well worth the money.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 4, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RL25YJU4I1G5O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0016KHRBS#wasThisHelpful","RL25YJU4I1G5O","A2FKDV5I2Z69Z7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FKDV5I2Z69Z7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Coke Zero is a crisp and robust soda. It has no calories (as the name states) and it is sweetened with aspartame. It contains glorious caffeine. It's been so long that I tasted regular coca-cola that I am in no position to say if this is truly similar or not. Sorry. I do prefer it to Diet Coke but honestly I think the reason is that the black can is just better looking. Not sure they taste different.Coke Zero has a very low pH but so does your stomach, so no worries. I've been drinking it for years and I'm fine. Something I've noticed about the coca-colas that have no real sugar is that I have yet to meet a microbe that can live in them. I'm no expert on microbes that live in soda. But I think that if you leave a bit of Coke in a tumbler and forget it in your bag for weeks in the middle of summer (ehem), the tumbler will in fact not have grown any sort of mold unlike your roommate's, who may have washed hers and left it slightly damp and did grow mold.It is likely this drink will not be conducive to empowering your gut's microbiome. But I have seen research that suggests Coca-cola is a super-cheap treatment for gastric phytobezoars. So if you think you have one, you can treat it drinking Coke. No need for expensive medications until you try this drink and see if it works. So it's medicinal.On a different note:I was a little skeptical that these cans would arrive as they should in the pantry box. But they did.

"I am very pleased with this set of tools. I'm always trying to clean my teeth with various tools and I am fond of toothpicks for teeth polishing. These tools do not disappoint. They are sharp and sturdy. So many things nowadays are plastic... its important to note these are indeed metal. Even the mirror, that at first I saw as a silly doodad comes in handy! Really, looking at your teeth to monitor dark spots or to figure out what is exactly bothering you in the back of your teeth is useful.The picks are very effective at removing layers of bacterial growth. It's essentially ""elbow grease"". Bacteria sometimes needs to be physically disrupted in order for a regular teeth brushing with toothpaste to really help with the removal of the plaque. Back when I was a poor undergrad, the university offered free teeth ""cleanings"" which I tool because I didn't have insurance. I was always baffled that all they did was use these sort of tools. There was no polishing of the teeth with anything fancy. Yet, I am guessing that alone was effective. So, if you can't afford to go to the dentist twice a year, maybe tools like these can help wait it out just a little longer. Not that I am a dentist or in any way qualified to give advise about teeth. All I mean is that my teeth feel very clean after a session with these and I am most pleased.

"I have been reading Life of Fred, apples (LOF in online forums) with my five year old as bedtime math. I think the stories are strange, but my son thinks they are funny and that's really what matters. Imagine a 5 year old kid who at 7pm will gladly sit at the table to work on 4 or 5 math problems at the end of a story? Yup. That's what Fred is accomplishing, so I'm happy.It is concentrating a lot on the numbers that add up to 7. This doesn't bother me, I think it is very appropriate as a supplement for my son. We have been working on adding doubles, and using manipulatives to add up to 10 on his regular schooling. So it works out well.They have questions that require some thinking for little children, such as: ""Sunday is the first day of the week, Monday is second, what day is Saturday?"" The question made him think and feel a sense of accomplishment when he figured out the answer.We may get some more of the books in the series. One pet peeve I have is that some people claim this can be a full math curriculum. I disagree! I think it is a great supplement.

"I received these cubes for a discount in exchange for a review.Very lightweight, which is important nowadays. You certainly don't want to add too much weight with a luggage organizer in an era when weight matters as you get charged extra by the airlines. If you want to pack them in empty to fill as you go, you can as they fit inside each other and lay relatively flat at the bottom of a suitcase. Each bag has its own handle, and they are all breathable since they all have mesh. It is a good organizing solution, not only to keep things separate and to easily pack/un pack, but you could just use the smallest cube for your toiletries or makeup and leave the rest at home if you wished.The zippers are good, the material is thin but sturdy. Do not put sharp objects in these bags.I thought that while we were not traveling, these could be used to store things under the bed. And yes, you could use them for that. However, because of the mesh it isn't practical. Dust could easily accumulate. Further, bugs could get in the cubes. So these are not suitable for long term storage on their own. To be fair, these cubes are not advertised for that purpose. They could organize items inside a larger plastic container that is sealed. The mesh allows you to see what's inside easily.Main con:Because of the mesh on each one of these bags, you do not want to rely on these to pack just a few stinky items together with clean ones. The odor will easily spread trough your luggage. You could put the dirty things in a plastic bag, and then pack them in the ""cubes"".

"After doing Saxon Math K last year, I decided to continue with Saxon Math 1 last September with my son. We stopped on lesson 35 and I'm switching to a new curriculum. Saxon has a spiral approach to math. That means that it teaches a little bit of a topic for one or a few lessons in a row and then it starts a new topic or picks up on a topic that had been covered some lessons before. I am giving the curriculum 4 stars because it is solid, and I am sure for some children this approach is the right approach. For my son, who wants to understand things really well right away, this approach is not the best fit. We have switched to a mastery based curriculum (which can be tedious as well, but for different reasons) and I will absolutely update if I have to return to Saxon.This curriculum can get very repetitive. ""The meeting"" starts every day with similar questions about the calendar, counting to 100, setting the clock and so on. It adds little bits of material and it starts at about 40 min of math per lesson and you end up with about 1 hr of work each day. We are using this curriculum for kinder, so that is a long time for a 5 year old. We always did at least one 5-10 minute ""wiggle break"" depending on how much writing or sitting we had done. I think that is a decent amount of time to spend on math. That's fine, but the routine had my son just repeating answers by memory and doing worksheets without really thinking about it. And he was doing them fine. It wasn't until I completely changed the calendar routine that I noticed that even though we had been doing calendar daily for a year and a half (Saxon k and 1) he couldn't tell me today's date! We worked on it a few different ways, and it took a couple of weeks and now he has no trouble. But I panicked a little. What if he wasn't translating this dry information into an understanding mathematics?I started supplementing with Life of Fred as bedtime math. And I started adding other math games to add more variety to our math routines, to ensure he was grasping the concepts.As far as parental prep and involvement, I find this curriculum is intensive on the parent. This is not a problem for us, as we work together on all the academics. But I dislike having to cut circles, apples and finding 10 toys you can sit on chairs!I prefer to open the book, find the worksheets and/or manipulatives and go. To use this curriculum you really need the manipulatives kit and the workbooks (there's two of them). The meeting book,  in my opinion, is optional.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R37GT17MDHG8VK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1565770145#wasThisHelpful","R37GT17MDHG8VK","A3NRRBCW93V84Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3NRRBCW93V84Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I received this thermometer using a discount from an online coupon club in exchange for a review. I'll answer questions posted to the review.I have been a decent home cook for about 12 years. I have never had issues getting anyone sick with my cooking probably because I tend to over cook chicken and pork on purpose, to make sure it's done.With the exception of the thanksgiving turkey that comes with its own thermometer, this is the first time I actually use a thermometer to make sure my chicken is cooked, but not overdone.My observations are as follows:1. It is very intuitive. On/off button. C or F for temperature. Handy chart on the back of the thermometer to see what is the correct temperature of your meats.2. It has a cover. It's a little hard to get it out of it, but you don't need to call your strongest family member to help you.3. Easy meat insertion. Quick to get to temperature, just a few seconds.4. Comes with batteries. Ready to use after a simple wash. Package opens easily.5. Looks exactly like the thermometers I've seen used in food shows.6. I don't believe you are meant to bake this in the oven with food. Remove food, check, remove thermometer.Unfortunately I cannot compare the reading of this thermometer to one more expensive since this is my first one. I didn't give it 5 stars because I don't ""love it"". It's nice and adequate. It isn't overly wonderful for the price or particularly beautiful. It is functional. How long the battery lasts remains to be seen. So far, so good.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3TCA6YMCIPQQ9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00P88BMAQ#wasThisHelpful","R3TCA6YMCIPQQ9","A3NRRBCW93V84Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3NRRBCW93V84Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My daughter got Peppa and her family for her birthday last March. Since, we have read several Peppa books from the library. One of the favorite books has Peppa's friends playing with instruments and going to school. I got her Peppa's friends and it has been a good call. She can play with Peppa and her friends for long periods of time. Imagining jumping in muddy puddles and playing school. This is a good companion to the basic Peppa family set of toys. And it's good to have a spare Peppa in case you loose one.These figures are about 2 inches tall. I think it is a good size. I like they are all made of some sort of rubber/plastic material. Clothes cannot be taken off, the figures look exactly as in the stories and show - so what more can you ask for? I think the price is fine for what you get: a toy that your child can play with and act out all sort of stories. These work well with Lego Duplos. We have made a Lego Duplo farm where the friends can play among Lego flowers. The size is exactly right to combine with Duplo play.The paint comes off.

"My son is in kindergarten and we are on lesson 27 of Saxon Math 1. For Saxon Math 1 An Incremental Development: Home Study Teachers Edition the workbook is an essential part of homeschooling (unlike for Saxon Math K Homeschool: Teacher's Manual 1st Edition 1994). The parent's manual has the workbook pages printed in a small picture. You *could* make your own workbook pages using the parent's manual - I did this for a few lessons. I soon grew tired of doing that and bought the workbook. Now beware: this listing is workbook part one. You will still need to buy workbook part two. Also, I don't bother with the Saxon Math 1: An Incremental Development Home Study Meeting Book - I didn't use it for Saxon K and I am not using it for Saxon Math 1 either.We are using Saxon Math 1 for kindergarten because we did most of Saxon Math K last year during pre-school. While Saxon Math is not common core aligned, due to the changes in the curriculum for the country, kids in K are now doing addition and subtraction. For this reason, I did Saxon Math K for pre-school and now I am doing Saxon Math 1 for K. This keeps my son more or less aligned with peers doing common core at public school, while still providing a classic approach to math. My son is doing fine with math. In fact, it is his favorite subject. I -the parent- am not in love with Saxon. It is very parent intensive and you have to read the instructions to your child if he is still not a fluent reader. However, my son is thriving using this program and he enjoys it. For this reason we are using it on a daily basis. We have modified a few things (how we approach the calendar for example) just to keep things fresh as it is very similar to Saxon Math K and we did that all last year.The workbook itself has great content. Most days it has one side with the day's work and on the other side has the homework. I like this as it helps reinforce the work you did in the morning later that day. It also includes the assessments. We do them because they can be enlightening for the parent. Not to give a grade to your child. Rather, to understand what areas the child needs to review or what he did not understand.The pages of the workbook are thin. My son has made holes in a couple of pages trying to erase. Now I ask him to call me when he needs to erase something. I wish the paper was of better quality. One good thing about this workbook is that you can easily remove the pages using the perforated top and it comes with three holes to place the pages in a binder if you wish. The workbook opens from the top. This is great for left handed children.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1O9T4689N30U3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=160032570X#wasThisHelpful","R1O9T4689N30U3","A3NRRBCW93V84Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3NRRBCW93V84Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I received this product free for evaluation.While I've been growing my own herbs each spring for over 10 years, I am a relatively new gardener to more labor intensive plants because until recently, I lived in places with no backyard. I've had rose bushes, tomatoes and peppers for two years. During this time, I've used regular scissors and kitchen scissors to remove dead roses from the bushes and other assorted pruning.This method works but it can tire your hand. Then I got these pruners. I didn't realize how nice it is for the pruning tool to be opened and all you have to do is squeeze! This is so much more comfortable! These have a little locking mechanism that is very easy to use. A little yellow cube located between the handles holds them together. You slide it down with your thumb and the pruners open. This does not require a whole lot of effort, which is very nice. I would say these are meant for small jobs only (nothing thick), as they are relatively small. I am left handed.No trouble! Big plus, as us lefties know to use our right hand to cut as a general rule.The grip is nice and non slip. Unlike scissors, these do not enclose your fingers. My husband cannot use the scissors I usually use for pruning because one time he did and he ended up with blisters all over his knuckles. These work for people with thin or thick fingers equally well.They have a good weight to them, enough that they feel substantial, but not so much that your hand would tire immediately. The package is an easy open package. I appreciate this as I detest having to wrestle with a package that contains a sharp edge.I have not yet used them long enough to comment on long term durability. I am constantly reviewing on Amazon, and if I find something particularly fantastic or terrible, I will update. As of now, I would recommend them.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJU3TVYUK1T8N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QGEAO2S#wasThisHelpful","RJU3TVYUK1T8N","A3NRRBCW93V84Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3NRRBCW93V84Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I received this bottle for a large discounted price in exchange of an honest review. This is the first time I use an infuser bottle.This is a very good quality bottle. The plastic is hard and sturdy. The filter is also made of a hard plastic. It all comes apart, so it is easy to clean. The fruit stays at the bottom. The holes on the filter are relatively large, so small pieces of fruit can come out of the filter. This does not bother me, but it may bother children.You can use the bottle with or without the filter. When locked (there's a picture of a lock on the side of the bottle for locking/unlocking the bottle cap), the cap does not open. It is large and slim enough to fit in a standard cup holder. It is nice the opening is covered in case the bottle falls on the ground.I think this bottle is best for us to make infused water at home and pour in glasses. It pours very well.Why did I give it 3 stars?First, my glove size is between a small and a medium. I am female. It was difficult for me to slide the strap over my hand and ditto for removing it. That said, the strap is also very sturdy and if your hand is slim you should have no trouble. This should be no trouble if the bottle will be hanging from a stroller or on a cup holder. The cup is fairly large, so it is a little heavy to carry on a wrist strap for a long time.So, say you are walking with your water bottle. You and your kids are thirsty and you forget to slide the thingy on the cap to unlock. Or your hands are sweaty. This lock/unlock mechanism is very annoying.I prefer the convenience to take a quick sip and I keep it unlocked. It does not leak when he cap is on anyway. It does spring open when pressing the release button.You have to make sure to drink with the cap on the side. My nose bumps the cap if I drink with the cap perpendicular to my nose. I find that annoying. I do not like the design on the side of the bottle.Also, it does not keep liquids cold at all. Again, best for infusing at home.Overall, I think this bottle is a fine bottle.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RL9RMR4ZIL0LK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014T8EYDC#wasThisHelpful","RL9RMR4ZIL0LK","A3NRRBCW93V84Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3NRRBCW93V84Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am currently half-way through using the manual for the level A-1 with my son. I am a homeschooler and I much prefer my manuals to be all inclusive and for them to tell me exactly what to do and say each day. This is that kind of manual. The format is similar to Saxon Math in that it tells the parent what to say, how to correct the student, and it is very thorough. The only thing I had to make so far is little squares with letters so my son can make words when the program calls for spelling games.The daily lessons are not very long, which is perfect for a young child. We are using it even though my son can already read Bob books and simple readers, but he is starting to write this year. Last year we used the Ordinary Parent Guide to Teaching Reading, which is why my son can read a little. But that other program, is very boring and does not include writing. This one is tying it all together and it is not overwhelming at all.This book (together with the workbook, which should be used together) is fantastic and I highly recommend it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R342APU630KIIQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1936226243#wasThisHelpful","R342APU630KIIQ","A3NRRBCW93V84Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3NRRBCW93V84Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I'm giving this product 2 stars because the pants are comfortable, do not smell and are inexpensive. Also, they have a cute cut and fit as expected. I wear jeans size 14-16 and I bought the XL and it fits fine. I am 5'3"" and they are a little long, but not overly so. These would be too short for someone taller than maybe 5'6"". They offer a hipster young kind of look for lounging or sleeping. It even has two pockets and a string to adjust at the hip. I just wished they were made better and with better material. If the quality was better, these would be easily a 5 star pant.All I've done is try them on and the seam on the side of the pant ALREADY ripped a little. I'm like, what? Horrible seams on the inside. Just a single row of stitches. I took a picture of the busted seam - look it still has the tag ON.Also these pants are made of a thin material. It is soft to the touch, yes. But it is thin.

"This book is short and easy to read. I am pleased with the content because while I am writing this review at the end of September it is 100F outside on a Sunday and I was looking for a couple of ideas of things to do with my kids that do not require a TV. Of course, I can use google and Pinterest. This book is nice in a way, because it has the instructions on how to do the activities and it is already divided by categories. Pinterest doesn't always link to instructions and Google sometimes gives you so many results that I end up in the computer or my phone way too long going through information...Anyway, it has several lists of educational activities to do with toddlers to learn basics like letters, numbers, colors and shapes. Some of these activities require a lot of preparation but I have all the tools required already (I mean who has toddlers and doesn't have construction paper?).I found a couple of typos in the book. Nothing outrageous (hold instead of hole - for example). It is generally well written and easy to read.

"I suffer from GERD and as a result my stomach and digestion can be a little delicate at times. For this reason, I'm usually skeptical about supplements as due to my reflux if there's anything in them that is a little foul and can cause me stomach trouble I will know. This drink has done no such thing! My stomach has remained undisturbed while drinking this.I mix the drink with a spoon in about 8oz of water. I suppose you could add more water, but in my opinion that would be too diluted. While the powder dissolves enough simply using a spoon, it stays a little grainy while drinking it. I found this is not a drink to linger over as the powder will eventually precipitate to the bottom and form an unpleasant looking sludge. It is best to keep the spoon in the glass and mix a little before drinking. Be ready to finish it all relatively quickly. The taste is truly pleasant and it is a natural tasting berry.As far as I can tell, the ingredients are all natural. I'm thinking of this drink as a raw multivitamin. A small peeve is that FOS (fructooligosaccharide) is labeled as a probiotic. I believe it should be labeled as a prebiotic, as probiotics are actual bacteria. It does contain Lactobacillus, but I do not believe they are live cultures.Overall, I recommend this formula for people interested in ingesting ground up fruits, Cyanobacteria and vegetables in a powder form. I cannot comment on energy or skin changes. You would need a controlled trial for that. But I can say, this drink does not bother my stomach, it tastes good for a green drink and if the label is correct, this is full of good things for your body.I received this product at a big discount on a coupon club online to test it and provide my opinion and review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RL3X1TCT58UDU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010CCO5Y2#wasThisHelpful","RL3X1TCT58UDU","A3NRRBCW93V84Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3NRRBCW93V84Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"While I have read about using a holistic approach to teaching preschoolers elsewhere, this short book lists strategies for teaching groups that can easily be applied at home. The author tells us why and/or how these strategies help make the child a better reader.A couple of years ago, when I started teaching my son to read I started with letter sounds, which is the obvious thing to do. Of course, I read to my child and we did many of the activities mentioned in this book. But it wasn't clear to me how playing with play dough, following instructions, understanding left and right and other life skills come together to help learn reading and comprehension. This books explains, superficially but with enough detail, that as a parent you can be more cognizant of why you are engaging your child in making a collage. Or perhaps, the other area I can improve on: asking the kids more questions before and after the story.This book is easy to read, well edited and well thought out. Appears aimed at teachers, but I'm sure many parents of young children will find this book very useful.Why I gave it 4 stars and not 5**This book is very short. For the category of short books this is an excellent read. There are plenty of places in this book where the authors can add information, activities, web links and so on. While the book is very good, any buyer must beware that it is short.

"We've had two Skip Hop lunch boxes for two years and we use them once or twice weekly. We have the monkey (still has the banana zipper puller thing, and the ladybug).After a few months of use for the ladybug lunch box, the flower detail fell off the zipper. This little detail is how you pull the zipper so it was a major bummer. I solved the problem of how I would pull the zipper by putting in a key chain ring. That ring has been in place for over a year with no issues. Its not cute, but it is functional. Not removing a star because I like them and the monkey lunch box is still fine.I like that the lunch box has a little mesh pocket. I use it to contain ice packs, napkins or cutlery. It keeps items fresh and cold for about 4 hours in the heat with two ice packs. After that time frame, I'm not sure I'd trust it unless items are still cold.This lunch box is the right size for a small kid lunch for preschool. You will need the right containers though. It is a relatively small lunchbox, with a rounded top so it is sometimes hard to fit larger containers.When my daughter was attending a Mother's Day out program, I had no trouble fitting her lunch. We are homeschooling now and mostly use it to take snacks for me and 2 kids when we go out. We used to use both: one for items that need refrigeration and one for items that do not like crackers. It worked well for us until recently, as my son is now 5 and eats an actual regular amount of food. For this reason, I've started to use a larger lunch box if we will be out of the house for a while. But it's fine for toddlers and mom.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RH6I2MB2FMV2T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005SZKICW#wasThisHelpful","RH6I2MB2FMV2T","A3NRRBCW93V84Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3NRRBCW93V84Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you are wondering if these crackers taste like boxed animal crackers, let me tell you that no. In no way do these crackers taste like the traditional $1 version animal crackers.These remind me of the flavor of those cookies they serve on Delta flights. Or Trader Joe's cookie butter. These are almost flaky, crumbly and deliciously addictive crackers. We used them for a Kinder school assignment where we grouped the animals by habitats (camel for desert, lion for grasslands...).

"I used these with two babies. Mostly as backup, as I found that I preferred using the all in one cloth diapers better. These are worth having around with pre-folds.I found I used these when the others were still in the wash, as extras in the diaper bag or in between short periods of time between a change and bath time. That sort of thing.The covers themselves are great. I never had leakage or a blowout with these. But again, these were not my everyday diapers. It wasn't because of the cover, it was because the prefold diapers I used with these covers stay wet and the constant wetness irritated by babies skin. I did change them often, but little babies sometimes will wet the diaper a little shortly after changing and I wouldn't necessarily notice, then I would find irritated skin. So, I used the all in ones more often.They covers are easy to wash and air dry. I also used the dryer on low and never had any problems.It is a matter of what works for you really.

Like I said, it is best to watch with the kids to help with the curriculum and understanding of the situations.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R19CA50E5KDG1W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IIT9B28#wasThisHelpful","R19CA50E5KDG1W","A3NRRBCW93V84Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3NRRBCW93V84Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This show is aimed to pre-schoolers and younger. The first episode of this season helped me potty train my 3 yr old daughter. We watched it many times and sang their potty song over and over. The curriculum is good for the parents too as it features excellent ideas on how to deal with life situations with little children. Including having the kids understand that there are bathrooms everywhere.My second favorite Daniel Tiger episode is also in this season and it's the vegetable tester episode. It's just a great help for mommy when the kids become interested in tasting new healthy foods just watching a tv show.Highly recommend.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1JHCVIIYEQNXM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BI0ODIQ#wasThisHelpful","R1JHCVIIYEQNXM","A3NRRBCW93V84Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3NRRBCW93V84Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"My husband (then fianc) and I listened to Rich Dad Poor Dad by Kiosaki in 2006 on a long car trip shortly before our wedding (this is how I remember the year we listened to it).

"With the word rose in the name I was expecting an old fashion rose smell. The fragrance is very faint and more soapy than flowery. Personally I didn't care for the smell of the soap, but I didn't dislike it. In any case, the fragrance does not linger at all.The feel of the soap is very clean. It lathers well. I use two pumps of soap to feel like I worked a good lather all over my face, but you can probably use only one pump.My face feels squeaky clean and soft. However, it does feel like the first step of a cleansing routine where you need to at the very least apply moisturizer after washing your face. At first I did not moisturize and some parts of my face were a little tight. I'm oily on the T-zone and that area was fine. This is probably best suited for oily skin and people who always use moisturizer after cleansing.I bought this at a discount to provide my review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1RIFGE7N780J3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0149HCQ38#wasThisHelpful","R1RIFGE7N780J3","A3NRRBCW93V84Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3NRRBCW93V84Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The content of this book is straight forward and no-nonsense. The book is short but full of ideas on how to approach weight loss and muscle mass increases. It feels like picking the brain of a personal trainer, which ultimately that is what the book intends. It is not a biochemical thesis or an elaborate diet with products to buy. I think it is useful, needed and great for the person who wants the information but doesn't have a lot of time to read a long elaborate book.The reason I gave the book 4 stars and not 5 is that this book needs a professional editor. Someone who will correct typos, grammatical mistakes and the like. Some readers will find the mistakes difficult and will not be able to enjoy the content of the book. I imagined the trainer had a charming accent and it didn't bother me.

"This little sweater fits my daughter, who wears 3T but can fit in some 4T clothes, very well if slightly large which is what I was going for. The size on the sweater is 4 not 4T which I think means it is slightly larger than a 4T.The sweater is well made and true to the color shown here. It is made in Philipines and has a Disney copyright symbol on the label. The ruffle detail on the cuffs and the hips makes it very feminine. It looks very pretty on.Note of caution about picky dressers. My daughter is 3 and loves pink which is why I bought this sweater in pink. But she is slightly confused as she feels like Sofia's merchandise should be purple. She'll wear it eventually.I washed and dried it with all my laundry on the normal cycles and had no trouble.

"It works well to keep the hot sun rays out of the car. It offers full window coverage for our basic Honda. Prior to this shade we had a terrible one from the dollar tree that did not cover the whole windshield and broke in days. This one is made of a paper like material that feels like it has a coating of some sort. It pops open so it is easy to place in the windshield. It's white with some writing (I wish it was just plain white). That's another good thing as I find the reflective shades that look like aluminum foil annoying when you walk past them.The material feels like if you punch it you will easily break it, but with some gentle handling it should be fine. The shade is a bit clunky to fold and slide back into the pouch it came with.The material is of questionable durability. Again, it should last if you take care of it and don't keep it near sharp objects.When we first opened this product I was appalled at the terrible chemical smell emanating from it. I immediately made my husband (who didn't think the smell was that bad) put this outside to air out. I thought we wouldn't be able to use it since the car would simply smell horrible.After a night spent outside airing out (we live in Southern California - no worries it would get wet), I'm happy to report it had no odor.We received this product at a discount in exchange for a review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R32TAYK4M1GG4G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013S7AF7O#wasThisHelpful","R32TAYK4M1GG4G","A3NRRBCW93V84Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3NRRBCW93V84Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is an ok toy for a child that is around 2 years old. By the time most boys are 5 they would be more interested in a remote control monster truck or car - something that could go over dirt or ride fast.We got this for our son when he was 3 for Christmas so we've had it for two years. Needless to say this toy is on its way to the trash pile as I don't think it would be worthwhile to donate it. It doesn't really work properly anymore - although the car itself (body) is not broken and looks fine. It works when it's new, and it was fun for my son at the time. I found it very irritating that you must make sure to turn it off. Otherwise you will all of a sudden hear a random noise - you go looking for it and eventually you'll see this car randomly moving or just making noises. But for the price I thought it was fine.My daughter got a remote control car from my little pony this past Christmas that works much better than this and my son was incredibly frustrated as the police car could not keep up.

"Well, this was a fun read! It was a short easy read and free. This ebook was very well written. The ideas these ladies share are really good for any couple. I am a stay at home mom and my husband and I have been married for almost 10 years. These ideas are excellent and we are surely going to do at least two. I appreciate the fact that you offer suggestions on how to do the dates on a budget. Well done.I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 for two reasons. One is that while the book itself is solid, it is an advertisement for another book. It isn't clear if the content on that newer book includes this shorter ebook or not. I actually wouldn't mind reading the advertised book if there are new date ideas in it :) so in a way, the advertising is working. But for some reason it bothers me a little. Like I downloaded a teaser or a commercial instead of a stand alone book. I suppose you don't get that too much anymore as everything has advertising.Second, the authors are Christian. And I am not trying to say that is a bad thing at all! It is evident from the description that this is their world view so you know, don't read it if Christian references will be irritating to you. The book has a few biblical references and typical evangelical phrases about blessing each other and such. This is fine, but if they were to remove all those references they could bless a larger audience and reach beyond the Christian consumer. Again, the content and ideas are great and it would work for people of all religions or non-belief so it's a shame to limit the audience when your message is more universal. And I know people who could benefit from a book like this who would not read it due to Christian language.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3MTLU28WFNHUH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0112WVWTW#wasThisHelpful","R3MTLU28WFNHUH","A3NRRBCW93V84Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3NRRBCW93V84Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We've had this TV for about a year and we are happy with it. Our comparison was our former TV which had been a hand-me down as my husband and I see the TV not as an essential appliance, but rather a nice to have item.My main complaint is that the volume controls are not great. Sometimes we have to increase the volume to the max setting, but it doesn't seem to really be any louder. The sound from DVDs played from the play station is rather terrible.

"Crispy, delicious, kid friendly, individual portions, no stale goldfish bags...I usually get the regular size bag of goldfish and pack a portion using ziplock snack bags to take as snacks for the kids.The reason I got this box was to use the goldfish bags as a snack for my kid's soccer team. It's better to offer something that has not being touched by anyone: it's overall easier and more sanitary.And so, last night I distributed these bags amongst a group of 3 year olds. All of them eagerly grabbed a bag of goldfish and all were happily eating after the game with zero complaints. Right there is why I have these 5 stars Note of caution: if you are planning to keep a box like this as long term storage perhaps buy it at a store where you can check the expiration date. The box I receive has an expiration date of November 2015 - which is fine as we will use them before then, but not fine if you'd like to store them a bit more long term.

"These look nice in the picture on Amazon, don't they? Well, they are exactly as nice as they look. I'm pretty sure the handles are made of wood.

And as a testament of how comfortable these are to maneuver, my 3 year old can paint contentedly for 30 minutes without saying she is tired. For little kids it is also fun to ""pick"" a special brush for the day's activities and as they grow and actually paint pictures, then the different brushes come in handy.The brushes are made of different materials, different lengths, stiffness and so on. For this price each brush is less than $1 and they are nice quality.

"I've had this belt for a few weeks and I have mixed feelings about it.It has a strong Velcro closure that stays in place. However, every time I remove the Velcro the material gets fuzzier and fuzzier. I wonder how long this belt will really last. It isn't very expensive, so if you really want to wear a belt this will do. In particular this belt is excellent for those who only want to add that sauna effect around the middle. It really does make you sweat. The material has a faint chemical odor similar to plastic that I find unpleasant and makes me a little weary of wearing this on bare, sweaty skin. For this reason I only wore it once to work out. And I was really sweating. But I don't like the smell, so I would rather not wear it during a workout.It does not fit me correctly. My waist is about 8-9 inches smaller than my hip measurement (depending where you measure). It's fine if I only wear it above my hips. But then my lower belly bulges. If I wear it partially on the hips to cover lower belly, then the upper belly isn't as snug as I would like it to be. And it isn't like a corset for waist training, because it will bend with bulges and curves.So for me it doesn't work as I was hoping it would.

"I had very high hopes for this program.

I know that you can find these references free online so I'm not sure how impressive this program is for us.I know this program is more than a workbook and includes pieces to form letters, an expensive chalk tablet and so on.

I feel that by itself is expensive compared to others you can buy (like the Kumon workbooks).I  am very disappointed and cannot give this a high rating. Perhaps this should not be sold by itself?

"I first tasted these pureed carrots when my children were babies. This was one of the first foods my son had. I always tasted their baby food and I preferred the Gerber carrots to the carrots from other brands. These are a bit runny and juicy. Very easy for little babies to eat (and make a mess).I bought this large case of baby food, not to feed babies as my kids are now 3 and 5, but to add to baked goods. Because I actually used these as intended (for babies) I had some of these in the pantry when my oldest was 3 years old and going through one of those extra picky eater phases. He would eat cornbread and so one day I added his sister's carrot baby food to the jiffy mix. The result was very good! Not only was the corn bread less dry, it tasted better and looked better. From that time, I've added carrot puree to pancakes, sweet potato muffins and spaghetti sauce. This is easy to disguise to increase the nutritional content of what the kids do eat. So, I like to keep it in the pantry. I received eight 2-packs for a total of 16 individual containers of carrot puree.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RALUCP7ZWUEYS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00W4H616E#wasThisHelpful","RALUCP7ZWUEYS","A3NRRBCW93V84Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3NRRBCW93V84Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When I first got these gloves I was unimpressed. They looked huge. I was disappointed because I figured they would only fit my husband. I'm the one that cooks around here and I've been doubling kitchen towels and dollar tree pot holders to get pans out of the oven for years now. I was hoping these gloves would be a solution for myself, not for once a year when I bake a huge turkey for thanksgiving and I get my husband to take it out of the oven.So the first to try out the gloves was my husband. He is not prone to praising items but he kept saying how comfortable these gloves were. I decided to try them on, and surprise! They are a little big, but snug enough that I would have no trouble using these on a regular basis. They are comfortable because they have some sort of cotton lining on the inside and they are cushy.I tested these gloves by cranking the oven to 500 F as we have no grill. I regularly use 500 F to finish off baked chicken to crisp up the skin (yes I bake chicken with the skin on - it's yummy). I have been burned a few times taking the chicken out of the oven as I let it cook in its own grease and removing a pan with hot grease using kitchen towels can easily result in burns. Anyway, I placed my hand in the hot oven for several seconds and it took about 15 seconds for me to feel any heat at all in my fingers. Not burning mind you. I just felt that I was touching something hot (yeah, a 500F oven lol). It started to get ""hot"" at about 30 seconds and I dare not test longer...  Normally you would have a place ready to place things you remove from the oven, no? 30 seconds is plenty of time.

This flavor, blood orange, pairs very well with red wine for a slightly sweet sangria.This is worth the splurge. It is much better tasting than orange soda.

"Can't go wrong with Nutella. I ate this as a kid and I'm glad it's become more commonplace. My kids like it on bread (who doesn't?) and on pancakes. This is also excellent on pretzel sticks and any salty cracker. I've seen a number of recipes that use Nutella too but it always seems like a waste not to eat it straight from the jar.The Nutella I got from Amazon feels a little thinner than usual.

"Amazon, when a mother of small children orders Trix she does not expect ""mini-Trix"". I see in the description that the item may not be exactly the same as shown, but it makes me wonder if I want to bother with pantry any more. This mini-Trix may be amazing for teenagers who eat their Trix with milk in a bowl - but it is obnoxious for little toddlers who eat it dry.Don't get me wrong. I cannot return this because my kids were ecstatic. Little balls of Trix - how cute. Taste the same as the normal Trix, makes the milk pink (if that's your thing), they are crunchy and so on...But I'm really annoyed. Why? Because mini-Trix are really small. They end up under tables, stuck in between the legs of the dining chairs and I have to squat to remove them. They are balls - so they roll from wherever the kids are eating their dry cereal all over my open-living plan dining room, kitchen, living room. It's a huge area. It is annoying finding little balls of sugar, insect magnets, under furniture. I H-A-T-E mini- Trix. Sticky balls that cause rage. And trust me when I tell you, whomever thought of this marvel - stay at home mothers do not need anything else to clean up.A non-mother could maybe say that Trix is bad for kids anyway. And big Trix are still balls that still end up under furniture. Yes, yes true. But they are larger, easier to catch and see and easier for 3 year olds to grab and eat one by one in the car. This tiny things are just extra trouble, mess and stickiness.As for the healthfulness of Trix... Well I have nothing to say. I like them because they are a treat for the kids, come in fun colors and full happy mouths are quiet ones :)I gave this 3 stars because the product itself is fine and my kids will likely eat it in record time. But I did not order mini-Trix and I will not be ordering this again nor will I ever buy mini-Trix at a store for the reasons listed above. Maybe when my kids are older and less messy.Can you tell I'm irritated?","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R11TWHTTYYNI9K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SMYM9LO#wasThisHelpful","R11TWHTTYYNI9K","A3NRRBCW93V84Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3NRRBCW93V84Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love Dasani. Of the 'cheaper' waters, this is my favorite. To me it tastes crisp and exactly just like water should. I live in CA and while I drink tap water, I don't particularly care for the taste and so I end up drinking less than I should.It doesn't hurt that the bottles are nice and sturdy.

"Pros:1. While the lid is plastic, it has a no-leak seal and does not drip.2. You do not need to fill it completely with ice, if you leave some space it will easily mold to a knee or a cheek.3. It will stay cold for longer than an hour - we had our room temp at 75F when tested.4. It is better than putting ice in a ziplock bag for boo-boos.5. You can use it with hot water.6. With two kids in sports I can see using this often.Cons:1. When I first opened the package, this pouch had a stench of plastic. I put this away and several days later I checked and the smell was gone. It has not returned.2. After use, I drained the water (on my plants as I live in CA) and put it on my dish drainer overnight to dry. This item has so many folds that it was still wet in the morning. I find this irritating, but important to know. It can take 2 days to dry out. I decided to store it without the lid.I received this free using a purchasing code from an online deals club.Update:After several months of use I have increased my rating from 4 stars to 5. We use this A LOT. I've used it with hot water for cramps (great). Used it with ice and we all like that it doesn't sweat. This turns out to be a big deal to not have to wipe water off your boo-boo. It does take a while to dry (which was my original pet peeve) but I've had no issues with mold.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1MMEYRGFJUSVS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YBASCB4#wasThisHelpful","R1MMEYRGFJUSVS","A3NRRBCW93V84Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3NRRBCW93V84Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is an ingenious organizing solution that does double duty because it will lay flat and the kids can use their creations on a surface with a road and train track.Most of the time though my son just uses this to put his Legos and Lego instructions away and it stays in the box shape most of the time. When it was new we played with it a little, but my son is 5 and not as impressed by the landscape as you may think.That being said, it is still a nice neat box with Velcro on the sides so the lid stays on. The zippers on the side sometimes unzip while he is playing, but it is not a problem to pull them back up. Overall I am pleased with the functionality and the neatness of it.I do not know how many Lego fit in the box.

"Made in the USA, this shirt is 92% polyester and 8% Spandex. This means this shirt can really stretch. For this reason it is comfortable all over, including the arm band that is hard to fit for me.This shirt is rather form fitting so size up if you prefer a looser look. It is very flattering, airy and soft. This material is very opaque and does not wrinkle. The inside seams are well done.I own several eVogues shirts and this is one of my favorites. I normally order 1X and this one fits me as expected. I wear a 38 B bra (because I have never seen a 40B) and waist is around 35 in.

"I have five shirts from eVogues. I usually order 1X and some of them are actually a little loose. The fit on this shirt is a little strange for me. I read the other reviews and ordered a size larger, 2X. The cap sleeves are a little tight on my arms and the top part above the chest is a bit snug. Then it is rather loose on the hips! I think a 3X would have fit me better on top but it would have been too big on the bottom. This is strange as my bottom is bigger than my top. It's ultimately fine as I want to wear this as a cover for tank tops and leggings when it's hot out and it camouflages tummy. The little front pocket was a surprise. Somehow I didn't notice it while shopping.The material is nice for the price. It feels a little delicate, but not so delicate that you can't wear it to the park with the kids - which is where I'll be wearing this. I am 5'3"" and change and this shirt stops slightly lower than mid thigh, which is nice if you want that look.I do not believe this shirt is a true plus size and if you are bigger on top with smaller hips I don't think this shirt would fit well. But, if you are pear shape this top would be great.I gave it 4 stars because I can see myself wearing this often as I want to camouflage certain areas but not be overly hot when it's 100F outside... But it's more of a 3.5 stars due to fit.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RP9RCEJLBTNAL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004V2N8RA#wasThisHelpful","RP9RCEJLBTNAL","A3NRRBCW93V84Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3NRRBCW93V84Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"These are nice looking shoes with stretch woven fabric uppers.  Tan color is great/a good neutral. The heel is flat/barely elevated in the back and the insole is padded though there's no arch support. For my slightly wide size 10 foot, the medium fit fine if not a tad short though it could be that the toe box is a little low - but I expect that to ease as these stretch out.  They kind of hug your foot and have a higher heel area that's padded so they feel good on. But because they are snug, doubt you could get inserts in here.  I like the ""v"" cut - makes my feet look a little smaller - and covers the bunion area without cutting into it.

They are well made coated fabric - a material ""creatures"" haven't been able to chew through like they do the vinyl/thinner covers. Like the tan ones, seams are tight and there are straps to attach to the furniture to keep them from blowing off.  Unlike the tan ones, these have ""rope"" like handles instead of fabric ones but seem firm/not easy to tear.Though this hasn't spent a season outdoors, I expect it to hold up just as well as the tan ones which have no tears, ripped straps or popped stitching - just some ""drag"" wear on the bottom of the cover which reaches the deck (really windy here so things get pushed around by nature a lot...). And I actually prefer the darker color - the tan ones get rather dingy after the first year - and will be replacing the tan ones with these.My only gripe is that they're only 24 inches high - something that seems to be the case for most table covers (tan ones were the same) - so the legs will always be exposed. Since I live in the snowy northeast, I usually buy a larger size to cover them.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2QV7BEDL8PBI8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HNJVWSA#wasThisHelpful","R2QV7BEDL8PBI8","A601IGAG8FWGW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A601IGAG8FWGW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"True to size, well made and comfortable but like others have said, the bottom band does curl up a bit. It could be because I'm short-waisted so those with normal/long torsos might not have that issue. But since I don't wear trim fitting tops, it's not a problem for me and the overall comfort makes it a keeper for me.  Re the back smoothing, it does a good job of hiding the band line in the back (that doesn't curl up like the front).","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1OQ35OZSGWNGQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00E9HT4A2#wasThisHelpful","R1OQ35OZSGWNGQ","A601IGAG8FWGW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A601IGAG8FWGW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I haven't marked up and bent back so many pages in a book in a long time but I couldn't help myself.  There is so much information and insight packed in this book.  While the emphasis is on how technology has changed shopping habits, it also paints a picture of the new American psyche.  Social interaction, feelings of connectedness (or not), attention span, emotional intensity - technology has changed them all.  The author's contention is that understanding these changes is more important than big data when it comes to marketing since the accelerated speed of change makes predicting future behavior based on past data risky.There are numerous strategies for how marketers can tap into the consumer's psychology to gain their attention, trust and loyalty. But I read this book more to get an idea of how to recognize these tactics. The idea of using people's psychology against them to induce them to buy or believe certain things has always bothered me so I want to know what I'm up against.  I recommend this book for parents and teachers so that they can understand and mitigate some of the negative effects of this type of manipulation.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3U4MUG5ZPWESQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1118647688#wasThisHelpful","R3U4MUG5ZPWESQ","A601IGAG8FWGW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A601IGAG8FWGW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Couldn't wait to try this - really liked the concept of a tinted moisturizer for the body.  While the cream itself is nice and absorbs quickly, there wasn't much of a tint though it did impart a nice ""glow.""  As for a color build up over time, I didn't find that to be the case over the few weeks I used it.  There was no color ""run"" or staining though I'm not sure it's because there is so little color or because of the formulation.The reason I'm not likely to buy it again, however, is the overpowering fragrance.

"Amplixin Volumizing Styling GelI have flat, baby-fine hair that breaks easily. Since I have been old enough to care, I have used a ton of products that promised to give me body, or volume, or texture  and for the most part, I had been disappointed. Amplixin is one of the few products that I have ever tried that actually really delivered on increasing on the volume and texture of my hair!Amplixin is a clear non-greasy gel that is applied to damp hair. The slick gel is not heavily diluted so a little really goes a long way for me. The gel has a fresh light scent with no overpowering alcohol base smell. The texture is slick and smooth with no tackiness to the feel. Applied to my hair in small amounts it does not increase drying time. Applied with a more aggressive approach the gel can be used to effectively style wet hair (this is convenient for me when Im leaving the gym  I use a little more than I typically would, comb into place, and Im good to go without having to take the time to dry and style).Amplixin creates volume and texture in my baby-fine hair. My hair looks and feels thicker, healthier, and is easier to style. Amplixin additionally gives enough hold that I dont have to use hairspray to keep my hair in place!I received the Amplixin Volumizing Styling Gel at a promotional cost in exchange for an unbiased review and love the fresh scent, the non-greasy formula, and I especially love the way my hair feels thicker, fuller and healthier!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2XM0THJTQAULH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01420XVIQ#wasThisHelpful","R2XM0THJTQAULH","ASZFKI9I3VZKF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ASZFKI9I3VZKF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Security Decals for Commercial or Residential UseMy youngest son has a small antique store in a sleepy little eccentric town a few miles from here. Security isnt typically a huge concern for our store but lately the little town has experienced a rash of late night break-ins that are being attributed to some economic problems the area is having. We installed security cameras but hope to never have to use them to react to something that happens in our store. My son is a lot more comfortable with being pro-active, than being reactive, and these security decals are an excellent way for shop owners like him to be proactive in thwarting burglars, shoplifters, and vandals.Each of the four self-adhesive decals measures six inches by six inches and clearly indicates that the premises are under 24-hour surveillance. In some areas, it is legally necessary to clearly and conspicuously disclose that you are using video or audio recording equipment and these are large and bright to meet the clearly and conspicuously criteria. The adhesive adheres securely and is not impacted by damp or cold. The 6 x 6 size is perfect for our shop window  clearly visible without negatively impacting aesthetics.I received this excellent set of four security decals at no cost in exchange for an unbiased review and appreciate the excellent quality, the ideal sizing, and I especially love knowing that we are taking a pro-active approach to keeping our little storefront safe and secure.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RO4LAJWKCWA93/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015XJ3VT4#wasThisHelpful","RO4LAJWKCWA93","ASZFKI9I3VZKF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ASZFKI9I3VZKF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Multifunctional Vegetable and Fruit Slicer ToolMy kids will never say that tastes just like moms cooking to anyone unless they are being insulting. Im just not good at the whole cooking thing. Its generally a boring chore that I undertake only when Pizza Hut is closed. With that said - when I have to cook, or when Im having a domestic-bliss moment (those are becoming significantly less frequent as I (and the kids) get older), I do get creative with the food. The Multifunctional Vegetable and Fruit Slicer is the perfect tool for the gourmet cook, and it is the perfect way for me to make food that looks like it was prepared by a gourmet cook!This handy kitchen tool is a one-stop gadget for slicing, dicing, cutting and shredding anything. From cool cucumbers to hard cheese to crispy bacon, the Slicer makes it easy to get excellent results that are table-ready.The Slicer is based on a collection/storage container that holds and stores all of the delicious things that you process. The vast collection of extras are all well-made and durable. Everything cleans up beautifully and the component pieces, when not in use, can be stored tidily. The blades and cutters are exceptionally sharp which makes the actual work fast and efficient. The design is genius, considering that I still have all of my fingers and I have been playing with this for days, you can be assured that they designed it with a keen eye for safety.

"WickedHD WRC-221 Pre-mounted Car License Plate Rear View CameraLast year a friend bought my cousin a back-up camera for her car (she is forever backing into things  we are definitely related <sigh>). Anyway, the camera that was given to her did not come with a mounting kit so she and her friend created this insane rigging system to hook it up to her car. That lasted all of about a week before the camera fell off and was dangling on the wire long enough to get ruined. The monitor that she had in the car for that camera was still good so this WickedHD Rear Camera was the perfect solution.The WickedHD camera comes pre-mounted in a handy and durable license plate frame that installs super easily. Wiring and hardware are included with the camera and all parts are well made. The license plate frame is sized perfectly for US license plates and only covers about an eighth of an inch of the plate so there is no interference with reading the registration sticker or the plate ID.Video quality is better than I expected, and honestly better than anyone would ever need in a back-up camera. All images are relayed clear and sharp and spatial/proximity distortion is nil. Viewing angle is generous and wider than other brands. There are eight infrared LED lights to assist with capturing images at night.I received the WickedHD Back-up Camera at a promotional cost in exchange for an unbiased review and love that my cousin might not back over my lightpost at Thanksgiving this year, and I also love the cameras quality and exceptional performance!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RRP8QYPAXOO74/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YNRK3XA#wasThisHelpful","RRP8QYPAXOO74","ASZFKI9I3VZKF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ASZFKI9I3VZKF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Wireless SENHAI Optical Gaming MouseHands-down the most responsive and comfortable computer mouse that I have ever used. The SENHAI mouse has a soft rubberized feel that is enhanced by the contoured body shape which makes it a dream to work with.

"BESTEK Yoga TowelI love this gorgeous yoga towel! And the minute Im ready to tackle my New Years Resolution (its only November, I still have time) I will use this towel in a wonderful yoga class. For now Im using this towel as my little indulgence when I get out of the shower in the morning.The BESTEK Towel is made from a high-quality blend of polyester and polyamide. The blend is insanely absorbent and luxuriously soft  it dries off my skin just by gently brushing over it with the towel  no coarse feeling, no rubbing  just gliding the towel wicks away the droplets of water. The oversized measurements of the towel (72 by 24) make it the perfect bath towel for drying off quickly. The best part, for me, of using the BESTEK as a bath towel is that there are little tiny PVC dots integrated into one side of the towel: these are perfect for holding the towel in place on a yoga mat Im sure, but they are also perfect for letting me toss the towel over my shower rod when Im done. The towel doesnt slip off the shower rod thanks to the little traction dots and my BESTEK dries lightning fast.I received the BESTEK Yoga Towel in a beautiful dusty-violet color, at a promotional cost in exchange for an unbiased review and love the great quality, the perfect size, the wonderfully effective anti-slip design, and I especially love having a big, soft, absorbent towel mat that is incredibly versatile!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R16NTQYP4CTQNY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZOQV7RK#wasThisHelpful","R16NTQYP4CTQNY","ASZFKI9I3VZKF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ASZFKI9I3VZKF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Womens Lace Top Thigh High Stockings  in blackThere is something deliciously sexy about wearing stockings that pantyhose will never capture .. something wickedly good about a flash of thigh and a hint of lace that just cant be beat for feeling feminine. These beautiful stockings give all of the suggestive benefits of old fashioned silk stockings with none of the challenges. The stockings are silky and soft but strong enough to resist snags and runs and they wash beautifully (hand wash, line dry).

"Fast O Vacuum Wine Preserver PumpWOW! This is a must-have accessory for the serious wine lover as well as the occasional wine drinker.The Fast O Vacuum Wine Pump gives you the freedom to open any bottle of wine, guilt-free (!), even if you have no intention of finishing it. The pump removes the air from the remainder of your opened bottle and then seals the bottle so that when you do have the opportunity to get back to the wine, it is as fresh and wonderful as when you originally opened it.Anyone can use one of these pumps easily. You get the rubber stopper seal a little wet (tap water is fine) and set it in the opening of the bottle. Take the pump and settle it on top of the stopper, pump a few times, and ta da! You have just made sure that the next time you visit your wine it is every bit as good as the first time. There is a guide on the package that details how many times you press the pump based on how full (or empty for you cynics) your bottle is  the range is between 4 and 8 pumps.The pump is about 6 inches tall and is well-made. The package includes not only the pump, but also two (yes, two!) re-usable stoppers.I received this handy device at a promotional cost in exchange for an unbiased review and love that I can proudly say that Im a conservation activist (conserving wine does count for this, right?). 5 gold stars for a well-made product that makes it easy to do right by your bottle of wine!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R24XAY8OUNAOGZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PCCLE7Y#wasThisHelpful","R24XAY8OUNAOGZ","ASZFKI9I3VZKF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ASZFKI9I3VZKF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"6-Watt Chandelier LED Light BulbLOHAS knows lighting. I have a chandelier in my entry hall that is nearly impossible to get to. Changing the bulbs involves using a ladder that is set on a tile floor and it is a time-consuming and difficult task that always made me nervous. A while back I replaced all of the bulbs in that fixture with LOHAS bulbs and I have not had to change them since! I love the extraordinary long life of these quality bulbs so when two of the small base fixtures on my second floor were due for the light bulbs to burn out (this happens frequently with standard incandescent bulbs  I have teenagers who apparently have no idea how to turn off a light switch)  I ordered two of the LOHAS bulbs. This 6-Watt dimmable Soft White 3000K LED bulb was the first to arrive and I love it! At the highest setting this bulb gives off light that is indistinguishable from a warm cheery day time light  gently bright, clean, and natural light that is perfect for daytime and early evening activities. At the dimmed setting this bulb gives warm softer light that is more cozy and intimate  perfect for those hours when my household is gearing down for bedtime.I received this excellent 6-watt dimmable LED LOHAS bulb at no cost in exchange for an unbiased review and can honestly say that LOHAS makes the best light bulbs on the market  I love the great dimmable feature, the consistently reliable performance, and I especially love the long life of these great bulbs!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2XC3N0J6VFPN9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N2P31VA#wasThisHelpful","R2XC3N0J6VFPN9","ASZFKI9I3VZKF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ASZFKI9I3VZKF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"A while back I was being seen by a neurologist for Trigeminal Neuralgia. Before the MRIs, before the x-rays, before the host of prescription med trials, the doctor had me start on a prescription Magnesium supplement. Apparently nerve impulse transmission is directly impacted by magnesium levels and it is sound practice for people with nerve damage to take magnesium. The prescription that my doctor put me on was for 250 mg, and it was costly  and not covered by my insurance (because its also available OTC).When I started taking a magnesium supplement I learned that a LOT of people take this for a multitude of reasons  primarily the people that I know that are taking it do so to offset the insane risks associated with inflammation (everything from diabetes, to heart disease, to some cancers), as well as to help maintain healthy blood pressure. Also, one of my friends takes it because she is on a maintenance script for an antibiotic (to combat adult acne) and was told that sustained use of antibiotics contribute to a decreased magnesium levels.BRI Magnesium Citrate gives me all of the benefits of my prescription magnesium supplement, in a more powerful dose, at a lower cost  and I dont have to run to the pharmacy every 30 days, hassle with my insurance company, or wait on hold while the receptionist tracks down my doctor for refills.I trust BRI Nutrition to provide a high quality supplement that is made with only pure ingredients in a US facility that is FDA inspected.

I dont mind the actual driving but I do mind not being able to be productive while Im driving. I have learned over the years to take advantage of my time in the car by doing things like planning my day, dictating notes to my voice recorder, and taking / making phone calls. For years I used an in-car Bluetooth speaker to be able to talk easily on the phone while keeping my hands on the steering wheel but grew frustrated with being able to hear whoever I was talking to over road noises, engine sounds, etc The Archeer Hands-Free Earpiece has given me the perfect solution!With the Archeer earpiece I have all of the convenience of making and receiving hands-free phone calls without my callers having to compete to be heard over any road noises.

"Outtek 6-Outlet Fireproof Surge ProtectorThis Outtek Surge Protector may be the most often-used thing in my home. We recently started a not-so-well-received No Electronics at the Table policy during meals. Because no one can bring their phones, tablets, video games or laptops to the table anymore, its the perfect time for everyone to get charged up before they head out for the evening. We plugged this Outtek into a 3-prong outlet in the breakfast nook and when the kids come in to eat, they stop there first and drop off their electronic links to the outside world.The Outtek has 6 safe extension-cord style outlets and 6 USB ports that can all be used simultaneously. One of the best features of the Outtek over other brands that we use is the spacing of the outlets  some of our chargers come with insanely sized housing on the plugs and with other chargers you cant actually use a neighboring outlet when you have one of those plugged in  the spacing on the Outtek is very generous and there is more than enough room for even the greediest of space monster plugs.This great charging center has excellent safety features including overload protection, fire-resistant PC shell, anti-oxidation copper wire construction, and built-in surge protection.

"Beam Electronics Charging CableMy iPad is a wonderful little machine full of happy things like cat videos and photoshopped pictures of people I knew in high school. Throughout the day my iPad stays easy to work with and I really enjoy our time together. At night though, my iPad would become a drama queen. I would plug in a charger and my iPad rebelled. Sometimes it threw a tantrum through increasingly complex error messages, and other times it did the passive-aggressive thing and just completely ignored the charger. I had grown increasingly frustrated with this nightly struggle and was considering retiring the iPad altogether when my cousin suggested that I try yet another charger, but this time he said to go through Beam Electronics. He told me that they not only offer excellent quality products at great prices, but that they also have a seriously solid guarantee. His suggestion was gold  my iPad is happily cooperating with this terrific charging cable. I have not got even one error message!

"I needed a portable speaker to use when I make conference calls in the field. Often when I have to make conference calls its in a noisy environment so mic sensitivity and ample volume were key considerations for me. Also, it was important to me that the speaker would pair not only with my phone, but also with the variety of phones that my team members use. Finding a speaker that did all of the things that I needed it to, while looking professional and being portable, was more difficult than I thought it would be.In September I received the Rebelite Brio Bolt Bluetooth Speaker Soundbar at no cost in exchange for an unbiased review. I had immediately put the Rebelite in our study to listen to my music while catching up on paperwork  and loved it for the long continuous play time (6 hours!) and great sound. Last weekend I walked into the study and my son was using the Rebelite as a speakerphone and it sounded AMAZING! Excellent voice clarity, Bluetooth compatible and completely portable  it was exactly what I had been looking for and it was right there in my study!I love all of the terrific features that this speaker offers but especially love how versatile it is  not only is this great for my music, but it is also great for my telephone conferences: loud volume capability and great mic sensitivity. And, not only can I pair this speaker with my ZTE Grand Max Plus, but my son and the people that I work with can pair it with their phones too  everything from an iPhone to a Galaxy to a Nokia Lumia.The speaker can be used with Bluetooth devices, with a micro SD card, via an Aux cable or through a USB connection and has a great design with easy to use controls.5 gold stars for a great speaker!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1K3I0Q6MC7XWO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YPI3HGW#wasThisHelpful","R1K3I0Q6MC7XWO","ASZFKI9I3VZKF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ASZFKI9I3VZKF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This terrific USB rechargeable LED headlamp is incredibly versatile. Of course its the perfect headlamp for camping and outdoor activities with a comfortable adjustable elastic headband (seriously a wonderful head band  softly finished elastic that holds the lamp on my head absolutely securely with enough give that I forget that Im wearing it). Also this versatile light is perfect for reading at night, working on small handicrafts, and engaging in just about any activity that requires illumination thanks to the awesome rotatable multi-directional light source. I found that I love wearing this pulled down over my head and draped at my neck/chest when Im on the computer to light up my keyboard. I dont have to have any other lights on in the room and can work late at night without disturbing anyone.The barrel design allows for the light to be directed up, straight forward, or down  you just rotate the black grooved side gears of the barrel and you can easily change the direction. Also the light itself can transition from a clear strong spotlight, to a diffused robust white light, to a red emergency light just by rotating the blaze orange barrel.The housing is constructed from a rugged durable plastic that is lightweight and waterproof. All design features function smoothly and all parts are well-made and precision fitted.The ThorFire headlamp comes with a white USB charger included in the box. Initially I charged the light for 3 hours and I have left it on the diffused white light setting for over 5 hours now and there is no dimming or flickering (and this is after I spent a bit playing around with the other settings and making it flash). The specs indicate that I should get about 7 hours of use on the lower setting and Im guessing that estimate is right on target. Specs also indicate that on a full charge I will get 4 hours continuous use on the highest level setting and 10 hours on the flash mode.I was provided a sample of this excellent headlamp at no cost in exchange for an unbiased review and love the high-quality construction, the USB-charging feature, and especially the exceptional versatility.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1G3DU06CNRPLP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015R2IY5I#wasThisHelpful","R1G3DU06CNRPLP","ASZFKI9I3VZKF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ASZFKI9I3VZKF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I started using Matcha Green Tea right after the first time that I heard it touted on a popular talk show as the ultimate Super food. I have continued using Matcha Tea for not only the incredible physical health benefits, but more importantly (to me), for the mental-health benefits. A good quality Matcha is essential to my diet to enhance mental clarity, concentration, and short-term memory.Zen Bliss Matcha Green Tea powder gives me the premium quality powder that I love, from a company that I trust, in a form that I appreciate. This is a 100% pure green tea powder that is incredibly versatile: because of the fineness (versus the coarseness of most store brands) this powder can be added to almost any recipe. The high levels of Chlorophyll give this tea an exceptionally awesome color that attests to the pureness. The taste is delicate, sweet, and subtle with no stale taste or bitter punch which makes adding it to smoothies or protein shakes perfect.I received the Zen Matcha Tea Powder at a promotional cost in exchange for an unbiased review and love this easy delicious way to get the antioxidants that I love and the amino acids that I need.

"Our construction company has a small fleet of corporate trucks. I know that if someone is set on staging an accident to fraud an insurance company out of money, in 8 out of 10 times they are going to target a commercial vehicle. For a lot of years we just simply didnt put commercially identifiable markers on the trucks  no advertising at all  in order to reduce the risk of being targeted by scammers. We knew we were missing out on an effective means of advertising our company but our insurance guy, and a lot of others in our industry, said that it was the safest way to go. Dash cams have changed that  high quality dash cams allow us to proudly display our company name and company information on our vehicles without worrying about being the victim of someone intent on filing a sham accident claim.Over the past year we have fitted all of our trucks with dash cams. We have bought a few different brands, with various features, as our needs  and the technology  has grown. Weve been pretty reliant on Garmin Dash Cams and have been impressed with the performance but were searching for an alternative that would offer better value with the same or better features and performance. The Eachine AT55C is the perfect solution for us.The Eachine AT55C Dash Cam offers exceptional quality at a great value. The Eachine has all of the features that we need and gives clear, crisp, high-quality playback. There is an excellent 2.7 inch LCD display, full HD video, and a black box feature that locks the video in the event of an accident. Set-up is super easy and performance is reliable and consistent. The high-resolution wide-angle lens is one of the best on the market. This cam needs a micro SD card which is not included (*Note  invest in a good quality memory card  the quality of the recording can be impacted by the quality of the memory card). Cradle and cables are good quality and are included.I received the AT55C Dash Cam at a promotional cost in exchange for an unbiased review and am impressed with the quality of the unit, the excellent performance, the inclusion of tons of handy features, and the ease of use.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Z9JVYGGJL0A6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PL3NOTK#wasThisHelpful","R1Z9JVYGGJL0A6","ASZFKI9I3VZKF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ASZFKI9I3VZKF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was talked into going on a Relaxation Retreat by a good friend. I had visions of massages, drinks with little umbrellas, fuzzy slippers and binge-watching Netflix so I agreed to join her on this adventure. Apparently my idea of relaxation isnt even close to my friends idea of relaxation. The Relaxation Retreat involved showing up at 7:00 am on a Saturday morning (I didnt even know that Saturday mornings had a 7:00 am), in the gym of a small High School and sitting on scuffed gray floor mats with 17 other middle-aged women listening to a Mother Earth looking young woman tell us to breathe ourselves to inner peace. If this had occurred in the 1970s, the day would have ended in a smoky haze. Anyway, the one thing (the only thing) that I took away from the Relaxation Retreat was that the trend in these relaxation classes is for everyone to wear nasal dilators during meditation and relaxation breathing exercises to promote healthy breathing. As much as the philosophy behind it is convoluted, the science of it is sound  nasal breathing has benefits over mouth breathing  and when you effectively combine the two you have optimal breathing.I was familiar with nasal dilation devices: the Yeti that shares my bed has worn them with success to combat a wicked snoring challenge  but I had never thought about them in any other context. I received the Silent Angel breathing helpers in exchange for an unbiased review about a month after the Relaxation Retreat and thought I would try them in the manner that the breathing guru from the retreat had suggested. Im officially sold on the concept  they work. Opening my nasal passages changes the way that I breathe, changing the way that I breathe changes the way that I feel.The Silent Angels come in a handy little 2 clear plastic carrying case. There are 4 sizes of the Silent Angels in the case. Each one is a one-piece unit with two sections that are connected to each other. There is an excellent explanation of why people snore on the outside of the box. The Silent Angels are constructed from soft, medical-grade FDA-approved silicone that is non-irritating and comfortable to wear.Im excited that Ive found a safe and easy way to promote relaxation and feelings of well-being and I love that wearing the Silent Angels is comfortable. I have seen people also wearing these in the gym lately  I think Im going to try that next. Great product that seriously works!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RV4PXUFMCQHD0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WT1D61I#wasThisHelpful","RV4PXUFMCQHD0","ASZFKI9I3VZKF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ASZFKI9I3VZKF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"One of my favorite people is a Fugitive Recovery Agent and he has a certain *style* relative to what he wears and how he looks. Im sure in certain environments his look is completely appropriate but when he is given the chore of taking me to the grocery store  young moms hide their children and other men wont look him in the eye. Its funny to me because this is the same guy that organizes many of the more successful charity drives in the neighboring community (and once organized a needlepoint craft show as part of a benefit although he will deny that one). Anyway, point is  he looks bad to the bone and dresses to maintain that illusion. I was creeping on his Amazon wish list page to try and get some Christmas gift ideas and saw he had saved the page for the fingerless tactical gloves.These Toncy Tactical Gloves are insanely masculine looking  jet matte black in color and rugged in appearance. Even with a tough appearance they feel like a dream  the outside has durable, super-soft leather that is flawless and the inside is lined with silky soft cotton. The quality is terrific: all stitching is double-stitched for extra durability and longevity, the seams are finished beautifully with exceptional attention to detail, and the adjustable wrist design allows them to be worn tight against the wrist so there is no slipping or chafing. I love the tight low profile of the protective EVA mats that will keep my friends knuckles armored during whatever activity he wanted these gloves for (I honestly have no idea  for all I know he could be intending to rescue stray kittens with them  I didnt want to give away the surprise, or the fact that I was creeping on his wish list page, by asking him).I received the Toncy Fingerless Mens Tactical Gloves in Black, size XL, at a promotional cost in exchange for an unbiased review and love the excellent quality, the outstanding protective features, and I appreciate that they have a one year warranty. 5 gold stars for an awesome pair of gloves that I cant wait to give my friend!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3GR2OT33TGIUF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015ROKOPY#wasThisHelpful","R3GR2OT33TGIUF","ASZFKI9I3VZKF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ASZFKI9I3VZKF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It works!! I was soooo skeptical that bugs could hear (who knew?!). I honestly thought it was a long shot that anyone would ever spend the kind of time, money, and energy necessary to research what level of ultrasonic sound waves that bugs would not tolerate. I had underestimated the ingenuity of people.This electronic pest repelling device does something that (to me) might as well be magic  except it really works. I plugged the unit in at my sons little antique store, he gets inundated with pantry moths this time of the year. Within about 20 minutes of plugging it in, there were MORE pantry moths than ever. I thought yikes!  it makes a moth mating call or something but then read the information and this sudden increase in bug activity actually proved that the unit was working. See what happens is that the sonic waves disturb the bugs, they come out of wherever they are living/breeding/plotting against me/hiding and they fly around going WTH? They fly around for a while, hoping the sound will stop so they can go home. The sound doesnt stop and they get frustrated and go find new quiet homes, like at the neighbors or their parents basements.Anyway, at my sons store  the moths increased on the first day, a few days later they are GONE!Im especially surprised that something that works this good I honestly cant even hear  and thats remarkable considering that I have auditory sensitivities, and nothing about the sound has any impact on my little furbuddy either.Love this safe, easy, fast way to rid our store of those annoying pantry moths.

"These gorgeous blingy heart zebra decal stickers are EXACTLY what my old black leather tote bag needed!I have an old trusty black leather tote bag that I carry my work stuff in every day.

"My kids game, a LOT  everything from League to Counter Strike to WOW to Minecraft  my kiddos have sacrificed sleep, meals and homework <sigh> to play them. They enjoy the time they spend playing, and they are particular about the equipment that they use to play. Both boys use high-end, top-quality gaming computers, and they insist that the peripherals that they use meet the same high standards. A week or so ago I received the EasySMX Gaming Headphones at no cost in exchange for an unbiased review and gave them to the boys to review. I was really surprised at how impressed they were  they are typically VERY difficult to impress! The features that these two gamers found important are: Sound clarity  Both boys mentioned that the sound is stellar. They described it as high-resolution sound. Appearance  Both boys also said that they love the look of these. This surprised me a lot, we have had other gaming headphones and the appearance wasnt important to them. Im guessing that since they were evaluating these together that they were able to actually see the other one using these headphones so they were more apt to really pay attention to, and appreciate, the high-tech appearance. Wearability  They appreciated the comfort and the fit  this also surprised me  they are different from each other in size, and they wear different hat sizes so the fact that both of them found these headphones really easy to wear was not something that I expected. Responsiveness of Controls  the younger one mentioned that the mute key and the volume control mechanism were really easy to use, and very responsive.Other informal observations that they made include; perfect cable length, lightweight enough to be comfortable without being fragile, and mic sensitivity is phenomenal.5 gold stars for a quality set of headphones that impressed two serious gamers!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2UPRQ7LIESUG6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XU05KRK#wasThisHelpful","R2UPRQ7LIESUG6","ASZFKI9I3VZKF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ASZFKI9I3VZKF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The art of Calligraphy has enchanted me since I was a little girl. I love the beautiful way that a talented soul and a creative touch can turn mere words into works of art. I spent hours in my teens and twenties practicing letter styles  I enjoyed it so much but just never had the gift of talent that would transform my passable works to beautiful art. When my oldest son was about 21-years-old he found one of my old calligraphy pens. He picked up the pen, found an older bottle of ink and proceeded to create amazing examples of fonts that he has seen over the years. I was stunned, and extremely happy that he has inherited his fathers artistic talents. I was so excited to be able to give him this gorgeous and unique feather calligraphy dip pen set.This beautiful set comes complete with an excellent quality feather, the copper pen stem, 6 steel writing tip nibs in graduated sizes, a generously sized bottle of good quality black ink and a well-made wax seal in gold. The set is packaged in a handsome box and makes an exceptional gift.The pen itself is beautifully weighted and feels, and performs, exceptionally well. The steel tips are well made and they fit perfectly with no additional modification needed (other pens that Ive owned in the past needed a great deal of support to be used securely  this fit perfectly without any additional support).

"Polarized sunglasses are a must for fishing enthusiasts that spend hours on, and in, the water. Because lighting conditions change over the course of a day, often times more than one pair of sunglasses is needed  with the polarized option, color, and tint of the lens lightened or darkened depending on glare, ambient light sources, and shade.The Ponosoon Sports Sunglasses are the perfect one-pair option for meeting the changeable needs of active anglers that spend their days chasing the big catch.The big guy that kills the spiders in my bathtub is an avid fisherman.

"I live with a crew of three big guys that snack  all day, every day. Because the equation pretty much boils down to the more filling the snack, the less snacking theyll do, I look for snacks that can not only have some impact on their voracious appetites but that also have nutritional benefits (Im the mom, its in my DNA to worry about that kind of stuff).My crew has grown tired of the standard mom-issued, mom-approved snacks like granola bars, fruit bars and fruit cups, and protein bars.

"I have a car and a job. I also have two sons that live at home when they arent at college. Because I need my car for work, I put gas in it on a regular basis. My sons seem to believe that at the point the gas is in my car, it becomes community gas. Since they have been about 16-years-old, they always seemed to prefer my car  with a full gas tank  over any other car that we own (that they would have to put gas in). This became expensive and really annoying so I turned my car into the PrincessMobile. Tiaras line the back deck, I have princess sticker decals on the windows, there is a pink feather boa resting on the Hello Kitty seat covers, and my front license plate is a stick figure of a princess with the words Princess Lauren. They no longer take my car and use my gas. I saw this beautiful fancy license plate holder and knew it would be perfect on the PrincessMobile!The Carfond Pure Handmade License Plate Frame is gorgeous: 7 rows of sparkly rhinestones topped off with a beautiful pink sparkling bow give the perfect amount of feminine whimsy to my car. The frame fits the car perfectly and holds my license plate on securely. I did have to remove, and then reglue the sweet bow-knot because the clearance over my license plate is nil and the bow sticks up a wee bit - I took the bow off and reglued it (using Superglue) about a half inch below where it originally was placed (this is the reason you see a tiny area in the upper right in the pictures that isn't covered in pink sparkles). Late model Chryslers with low license plate clearance may need to do the same - it's really easy to do.

"I bought these awesome looking gaming headphones for my son so that he can better ignore me while playing Minecraft <sigh>.These are great high-tech looking gaming headphones that fit well, perform beautifully, and have a ton of features that give a fully immersive video game experience. My son has worn them a LOT over the past two days and when I asked him for his impression, he shared the following: Super comfortable  ear cushions that are well-padded, soft on the ear, and that dont get hot, itchy, or irritating. Adjustable  able to be worn over the head, or behind the head easily and comfortably. Versatile  can be used with his laptop, desktop, tablet or Galaxy phone. Noise reduction  he swears he really cant hear me while hes wearing them, that nothing that is going on in the room around him bothers him or intrudes on his concentration on the game. Volume control feature  adjustable volume control that lets him adjust how he wants to experience different games, and different aspects of the same game. Built in mic with boom  lets the players he is interacting with hear him clearly without having to speak loudly and without having to reduce other sounds in the room. Excellent sound effect transmission  terrific sound quality. He started telling me specifics about this but I guess that I made a face that gave away how lost I was, he stopped and said It sounds epic, mom (high praise coming from my audio-snob kid).I expected him to rave about how awesome they look and when he didnt, I asked him about that. He told me that the looks werent really important to him, they were more just a great bonus  and he said that sound and performance out-shine the sleek looks.I received the Simpeak Game Headset at a promotional cost in exchange for an unbiased review and love that they make my kiddo happy with excellent sound, comfortable wear, and great gaming features.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3THYHOPFE8U63/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015O9O84U#wasThisHelpful","R3THYHOPFE8U63","ASZFKI9I3VZKF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ASZFKI9I3VZKF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I own the red version of this EasySleep Pro Chin Strap that my spider-killer Yeti wears to help him sleep better. I knew from his experience that the EasySleep offers a safe and comfortable wearing experience that stops snoring but what I didnt know is that it also helps stop teeth grinding.One of my best friends was suffering with a lot of facial pain and knew it was related to her habit of grinding her teeth at night when she was going through stressful times. She had been shopping prices on a specific wearable device that was recommended for people that grind their teeth at night but she was really put off by the insanely expensive price. The device was touted as a medical grade apparatus and was priced in the Hope that my insurance covers this range (insurance doesnt cover them). She showed me a picture of the device she was hoping to buy (at $700.00), and I was floored  it had the exact same design at my Yetis EasySleep chin strap.I received the EasySleep in exchange for an unbiased review and gave it to my friend to use. She is so incredibly thrilled with everything about this great chin strap! She said that it does stop her from grinding her teeth, she wakes up without any facial pain and can now brush her teeth as vigorously as she wants without feeling like she was socked in the jaw. She loves the soft comfortable material that doesnt irritate her skin and she really appreciates that the EasySleep is adjustable enough to keep it on snugly without creating an uncomfortable pressure on the top of her head.5 gold stars for a great product that is well-made and does a lot more than just stops snoring!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1IB6ZJ0HJ48V5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014XM3LVU#wasThisHelpful","R1IB6ZJ0HJ48V5","ASZFKI9I3VZKF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ASZFKI9I3VZKF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Im typically a really sympathetic person. I rescue stray kittens, I donate to those charities that run late-night ads on TV that break my heart, and I volunteer to help just about anyone that starts the request with I really need your help. With that said, when the big tough guy that kills the spiders in my bathtub and opens the stubborn pickle jars gets a cold, I *try* to be caring and sympathetic. The thing is, as much as I want him to feel better, and as much as I want to help him  I dont want to get that icky cold  I just dont have the time or patience to be sick. When my spider-killer gets a cold, inexplicably his arms and legs must quit working  he cant walk to the kitchen to get his own lunch, he cant fold laundry, and he cant do much that doesnt involve staying on the couch and looking really helpless. So obviously, it would be too much for him to take his own temperature and that task falls to me. I havent found a thermometer that would allow me to take his temperature from another room and I cant talk his mom into letting him spend a week on her couch, so I use my Innoo Tech thermometer to get an accurate read on his temperature while limiting my level of contact with whatever germs are making him sick.This Innoo Tech thermometer is packaged with 2 AAA batteries (actually good quality batteries that I have not had to replace yet). It measures easily and quickly (which gets me out of the germ zone quickly), and there is a very handy memory recall feature which gives me the ability to prove to him that not only isnt he really sick now, he wasnt really sick the last 30 times he asked me to take his temperature.I received this Anear Innoo Thermometer at a promotional cost in exchange for an unbiased review and love the terrific quality, the ease of use, and especially that I can get a quick and accurate temperature reading while reducing the amount of direct contact that I need to have with my buddy while hes sneezy, sniffly and sick!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2D48948XR2YYX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013WPN54M#wasThisHelpful","R2D48948XR2YYX","ASZFKI9I3VZKF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ASZFKI9I3VZKF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I fell in love with Seized by Love the moment I get to read an excerpt from the last Melissa Foster book I have read. It piqued my interest, never really believing that Lizzie got that in her. Oh yes, I was excited to see the other side of this wonderful, amazing and good girl.And when I say other side, its the kind that would make your jaws dropped and eyes wide. Oh yes, because our good-responsible-and-hardworking girl right here is the Naked Baker herself. But what made me love Lizzies character is the fact that she runs the sexy webcast not for herself, but for her youngers sister education. No one knew about it: not her friends, most especially not her family. She promised herself shed stop once Maddy is done with school.She built walls around her, to protect her heart and most especially her secret. Even though she wanted to be with Blue, she refused his invitations. She just knew that once she says yes, shed fall right into him.Blue already fell for Lizzie Barber the first time he saw her. He didnt know the reason behind why she refuses him. But he never gave up. They were still friends, and every time she needs him, he was just a phone call away.And when FINALLY Lizzie said yes, he couldnt believe his luck. He was going to do everything to make her feel and see that they were perfect for each other. He was ready for Lizzie Baker, but was he ready for her secrets?Two of the most important ingredients in a relationship are honesty and trust. I may not have agreed with Lizzie keeping it a secret from Blue, but I understood her reasons. It wasnt easy for her, but it was necessary. She wanted nothing else but for Maddy to finish her education without suffering financial problems the way she did. Somehow, this had justified what she was doing. As for Blue, it was heartbreaking to see his initial reaction, which almost had me hate him. One has to step back though and think from his point of view: love struck and he has waited for quite a long time to be surprised with her revelation. It took sometime but realized his love can overcome everything.I love the ending. You can fell how much Blue love her, and is willing to do anything for her, even fix broken bridges to make her happy. It was such a beautiful, and touching scene that made this book even more perfect.What to expect in a Melissa Foster novel: (1) swoon moments (2) a whole lot of romance (3) to-die for dialogues (4) heartwarming scenes (5) great family dynamics (6) interesting plot  and the first book in the Ryders Series has it all. Seized by Love was a great way to start a whole new branch of Lovers in Bloom at the same time the first book in the Ryders Series.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R12CTOVGWSTBD3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012YJ1YG8#wasThisHelpful","R12CTOVGWSTBD3","A1F5ZAUCP4KDVG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1F5ZAUCP4KDVG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Because I wanted to be the one to touch you. Another step, and he gently pressed me back against the wall with his body along mine. Because Im the one that can barely sleep at night, knowing youre just down the hall. In your bed. Practically naked.It has been a while since Scarlett Logan made it past the second date with men, and she was determined to know what went wrong. After several graphs and analyzing it intensively, she formed a hypothesis that maybe she havent passed a second date because she was a bad kisser! She decided that one way to get out of this drought is to get kissing lesson from her best friend, and roomie: Finn Mackenzie.Unknown to Scarlett, Finn was the reason she couldnt have a second date. Hes been secretly chasing off her dates ever since she came to live with him. He thinks no guy is good enough for his friend, and when she told him of her plans: hed be damned before he allow her to get those kissing lessons elsewhere. So, he offered himself and his world turned upside down.Finn was a great character, being projected as a caring, responsible older brother who acted as guardian to his two younger sisters. Scarlett is pretty amazing too: shes sweet and patient and does not think twice about lending a hand with Finn when it comes to his sisters. I think thats why they were perfect for each other.I love how the story goes, their journey from friends-lovers was indeed a delight  couple it up with his sisters and her parents, not to mention an adorable dog makes this one a really enjoyable read.If you want to read something that is fun, sweet and easy on the heart  this one is your book! And ordinary plot of two best friends falling in love add in an extra nerdy and sexy twist in between.""The Scarlett Factor is that you are worth any risk. In fact, I vote we forget your charts and graphs. I have a formula you might be interested in testing with me. You plus me equals happiness.""","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R24TUVPKF7DX6G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0140NXXAG#wasThisHelpful","R24TUVPKF7DX6G","A1F5ZAUCP4KDVG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1F5ZAUCP4KDVG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"And let the games begin!I had tons of laughs because of this book. I like the plot, its somehow familiar and yet different. The way how Elizabeth Fanning desperately need to put some sparks back in the bedroom can be a little hard for our soon-to-be-groom, Landon. What she didnt expect is that it would also backfire to her. Because who can resist someone as talented, hot, smart and humor-filled fianc?Who will win this game? Who will get what (s)he wants?But somehow, it didnt revolve only in rekindling the fire in the bedroom, but the problems that soon-to-be-hitched couple is facing: the wedding, the in-laws, the future, and yes, theres the taboo money problems on the side.How can you not like the couple? They had their imperfections which make them realistic, and yet they didnt let go between their loves for each other. The sacrifices they had to make, making things easier for each other and prove how much the other meant to them.To sum up my review Doing It For Love is a light read, tons of fun and sexual tension and sweet.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3MCE16L5416YO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SPVZBP0#wasThisHelpful","R3MCE16L5416YO","A1F5ZAUCP4KDVG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1F5ZAUCP4KDVG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" My Thoughts: Dane was pretty much amazing, I love his alpha-male but sweet tendencies. He tends to be overprotective most of the time, but I adore the way he took care of his own. Ari, the girl he saved from unwanted advances, was his. He knew this the first time he saw her. There was chemistry and sexual tension between them. How I wish this was a dual-POV. It would have been greater if we get to be inside Danes brain. He has mysteries and secrets that surround him that youd be dying to know.As for Ari, I like her relationship with her father. But dont ask me anything about her mom: OMG, what kind of mother does that to her child? Argh. This is the reason why she guards her heart and built walls around it. Sometimes youd get frustrated with how the things were going between them because of her insecurities.You get to meet some secondary characters whom you cant help but love as well and plays a role in their romance.Just like FSOG, the sex was pretty much off the charts. The steamy scenes were never dull from the start down to the last page. Although, I must admit it tends to be pretty much overwhelming.Then the ending, I cant believe how fast it wrapped up. It was almost rushed, and yet there are some things that were left unresolved which made me think there must be a second book sometime in the near future (*fingers-crossed*) because the mystery is killing me alive!

" My Thoughts: Ilsa Madden-Mills is already on top of my favorite author list since reading her Briarcrest Academy Series. This one just made me love her a little more. She knows how to push your buttons: make you swoon, make you laugh, make you ache and make you fall in love one page at a time.Especially when it starts with a heartbreaking scene. My heart literally went out for Elizabeth and I wanted to wring someone elses neck at the beginning of the story. No girls should ever feel that way, despite what others may say, or others may think.Elizabeth is a strong, stubborn, and beautiful. She had built strong walls around her, and didnt let anyone came near her heart. She has rules about dating, sex and the like: until Declan came along.I can hear him in my mind #SwoonOvertheAccentDeclan is your typical Alpha-Male, but he can be sweet and attentive when he wants to be. Hes a Lit Major and reads book! Definitely someone to add on your book boyfriend list! Hes a street fighter, but he has dreams to build his own gym in the future without asking anything from anyone, most especially his father. The death of someone close to him had him broken at an early age, and unlike his twin brother (oh yes, there are two of them), he seemed to be the more serious type.The two of them meeting was just pretty epic and funny. I never expected that. I think I just went red on embarrassment for Elizabeth. Good thing, Declan already noticed her prior, and he just wouldnt settle to be her next one-night stand.Declan made her want to break all her rules. Can he be the one to destroy the walls around her heart?""Loving Declan was like the rain storms I loved to dance in. Crazy and unpredictable, sometimes turbulent, sometimes gentle. I didn't know if I was going to be struck by lightning, but one thing was for sure, I wanted him anyway. ""This one is sweet, steamy and fun. I cant help but stayed glued to every page. I finished this in one sitting. The end was perfect, with (almost) everything falling into place, I couldnt ask for anything more except I was wondering if Declans twin got a book of his own too?I I have a mountain to climb in life, and I want you next to me. I want you to walk up it with me behind me to give me a push or next to me when I need to hold your hand. And when theres a jungle there, I want you to fight with me. Well have machetes, and it will be tough some days when I try to figure out who I am and what I need, but with you next to me, itll be okay. I want you to carry me when Im tired, and Ill carry you when youre tired. I want you to rub my fingers when Ive worked a hard day making pretty things, and Ill rub your muscles when they get hurt. I want to be the blanket that covers you when you are cold. Or vice versa. I want all of it all the blood, sweat, and tears no matter what dream you decide to follow. Im here. Forever. I love you.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2SU3GV6KSY3CT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016HBRORW#wasThisHelpful","R2SU3GV6KSY3CT","A1F5ZAUCP4KDVG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1F5ZAUCP4KDVG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This one is new to me, but nevertheless, it had me hooked to the very last page and panting for the next one in the series. Molly OKeefe gives her readers something different this time: the mystery, the steam, and the anticipation make this one a very unputdownable read!Annie was finally free from her painful past, but she wasnt clear yet. She had to be very careful. She dyed her hair and hiding in a Trailer Park. What she didnt expect was to hear a cellphone ringing on her first day, and more so, talking to a mysterious stranger named Dylan. Her life just get a little more complicated and a little more interesting as their phone calls became hotter.I cant blame Annie from running from her past. After what she has been through with her mother, and not to mention her ex-husband, shes one of those women who really deserve a happy ending. Nevertheless, I like the complexity of her character: she can be nave, sweet and innocent at the same time she was courageous. Not only she was brave enough to run out from her abusive husband, but she was bravely crazy enough to allow Dylan (a total stranger) to help her explore her sexuality.As for Dylan, I like the air of mystery that surrounds him. His alpha-male tendencies, being protective and all. The connection they have was intense and consuming, and it started over the phone. It was too hot that the lines were burning. But it was all there is, they might have that connection, but it never went over than just getting each other off via phone. Dylan was very clear that there wont be more to them than what they already have. Everything was fine, as each conversation brings them closer to each other Until Annie decided she wanted something more, but will the mysterious Dylan allow it?The story is filled with secrets and mystery, with twists and turns that you wouldnt expect. Each of the characters has their own stories to tell, which was pretty amazing. This book is a sexy and entertaining read. The ending had me groaning, with my heart up my throat.

" My Thoughts: I was speechless. This is my first time to read books from both authors, and I wasnt disappointed. I finished this book in one sitting, because there was NOOOOOO way I was going to put this down without knowing what was happening. This was the kind of book you took a gamble on and end up winning so much than you have ever expected.The words were perfect  it heartwarming, heartbreaking, inspiring and filled with so much emotions. My heart was overwhelmed by the rollercoaster of emotions, the surprising twist and turns and the heart-stopping ending of this book. I thought my heart stopped for a while there. I was ready for a different ending, only to be offered by another (which was a complete relief!)Another second-chance romance that I am sure you will add on top of your favorite list, because it is already in mine. This is one of the most beautiful novels I have ever read this year. This second-chance story does not only pertain to love, but to life as well. This story was about forgiveness and moving on. And I must say, this will solidify your faith in fate. Because it really moves in mysterious ways. If you are meant to be, no matter what the distance is, or how long you have been apart  when you are meant to be, fate will always find a way to bring the person back to you.Besides the characters, one of my favorite parts in this novel is the letters. I really appreciate it started with snail mail. I always love written letters, and what are the odds this will bring them back together, right? Every letter you read is filled with emotion: it can make you smile, touch your heart, and make you swoon. The letters have helped the both of them, not just connect with each other, but heal from every pain that life threw at them.Lovers Lament was more than just a great read. I cant recommend this book enough, Five stars isnt enough the way this book have moved and shook me.

" My Thoughts: I always have soft spots for second chance romance, and this one was not an exception.  Trent Rockwell and Reese Nicholson had a great love ten years ago. They were so much in love and promised each other forever. They got married but eventually, they went their separate ways without so much as a closure.Ten years later, both Trent and Reese are back in Cape Cod. The chemistry was still there, so are the emotions, Trent was willing to take the risk and gamble his heart. Can Reese do the same?I always believe in one great love and that right-time thing for everything. I guess they were young, and were misguided in the past. Reese was just nineteen and Trent was trying to build his name and career. But now, theyre ten years older and wiser  they knew what they have given up in the past, they knew the risk if ever they took a leap right now, and they both knew how strong they still feel for each other. They were each others IT, and it never changed. Fate was kind enough to bring them back together. I was glad that Trent was wise enough to take the chance, and I couldnt blame Reese for stepping back and think about it for a while. Nevertheless, if its love  nothing is going to stop it. Love the second time around is much sweeter and steamier. Ah yes, they couldnt even make it to the bed. #hawtThey were just too happy and everything was too perfect and I was looking forward for their bubble to burst, only that it didnt happen (and Im sorta crazy to say but Im a little disappointed, I was looking forward for a little twist here and there, a little conflict). Nevertheless, the dialogues can melt your hearts and make you swoon. I mean, the writers are the royals in contemporary romance  they knew how to melt and break hearts!Its a feel-good, sexy second-chance romance that you will surely love.

"Its a sexy story of revenge and getting even.Another hot Powers brother to fall in love with, but apparently not for Simone. Oh, she used to like him. They used to be best of friends, but after what happened: the humiliation she had experienced because of him, she wants nothing from him.Until someone encouraged her to get her revenge: I didnt know whether Id love her best friend, or strangle her for getting that revenge thing into her head. The idea didnt take long though, because the Loch that she was seeing right now was way different from who he used to be. He was sweet, caring and fun to be with. How can she possibly plot revenge against this guy?As for Loch, hes pretty much amazing. Yes, he wasnt that great when he was young, and he was such an a**, but he made up for it big time. Despite the fact that he can have anyone in his bed, he senses something special and different from Celeste. He was determined to have her, and there was no stopping him. But what will happen when he finally learns of her secret and her scheme for revenge? Will he be as forgiving?It was a fast, sweet, sexy and entertaining read that kept me up until the wee hours, although I must admit, it would have been grand if we get to know Loch a bit more. Nevertheless, we get to read a whole lot about Simone, how she battled her past, her broken heart and insecurities.I enjoyed every book in this series, although I started this one, (you can read these books individually but trust me when I say you should read every book in this series so you wont miss any hot Powers brother!).","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3YR8DWWARE70/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015UG9PU4#wasThisHelpful","R3YR8DWWARE70","A1F5ZAUCP4KDVG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1F5ZAUCP4KDVG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Lt. Grayson Masters wanted nothing more than to graduate on top of his class of the Apache Helicopter Course. Nothing can distract him from his goals, or so he thinks, until Samantha Fitzgerald became their new roommate, distracting him from everything possible. He doesnt need a hot, smart-mouth and free-spirited beauty who knows how to push his buttons. I love this guy despite the serious personality. He has his own secrets, most of them heartbreaking, and I wonder until when can he keep it? He separates his school life, his friends from his life back home, and there is a big reason why. Reasons I was not sure at first weather to applaud him or slap him. Nevertheless, he was trying to do what he thought was best.If our hot helicopter pilot has some secrets, our girl, Samantha Fitzgerald has some too. Fresh from being kicked out of the university, Samantha flew over a hundred miles to escape her past and start over. But how can she, when every time she opens a computer, its staring her right in the face? Or every time knocks on the door, the past would stare back at her. But this girl is pretty much amazing, because shes holding herself together,  her strength is pretty much admirable. There was no way her past is going to stop her, not if she can help it. And then theres the enigmatic Grayson, unlike the rest of the bunch, hes a bit cold and lacks charm, and she cant help but wonder why.They have chemistry, even during the first time that they met, and it was slowly burning. Although, their past wouldnt let them cross the thin line between friendship and being lovers. I was glad that they started out as friends at first. I gotta watch them falling helplessly in love one day at a time and fight off the intense attraction they have for each other.Grayson is not perfect, but you couldnt help but love him. He is strong, loyal and very much honorable. He does things one would not expect him to do, and despite the fact I would like to question it at times, I couldnt help but for my heart to just break right there. He was torn, and he wanted to do something about it, but he didnt want to hurt anyone that was important to him.I love the emotions that grip my heart throughout my read: its a rollercoaster ride, exhilarating and addictive. Rebecca Yarros gives us another set of wonderful characters to pin and fall utterly in love with.  Imperfect, but definitely people you cant help but love. It had me swooning, and I didnt have the heart to put down this book. With all the twist and turns, and what was happening between them, I couldnt miss anything!!!

The offer was very, very tempting...There goes the chemistry between these two...Sex was amazing, and their relationship didn't really changed. It evolved, into something deeper, something more meaningful. Something neither of them was ready for. Just when you thought everything was going well, and getting serious, here comes the ex...Parker's decision? It was unexpected. One of the most stupid things I've ever read. I wanted to go inside the book and shake the heck out of her. Argh.And I thought they were best friends. How can she think poorly of him? How can she do that to him? Indeed, Parker totally annoyed me at this point. What in the world is wrong with her? How can she not notice that this man, who have been right with her all along is the best thing that could ever happen to her?As for Ben, he might have started out as a manw***e, but as we get to know him more we get to see the real him, we realize that he has the potential to be a great boyfriend, he's sweet, caring, funny and really, really good in bed. Now if only Parker can see that potential.It's an old plot - I have read a dozen of this one, and still it never gets old.

"Logan finally has enough. She broke it off with her boyfriend who seemed to have a penchant on breaking up with her to sleep with other women. At last, she had the courage to break the cycle and be on her own.

For now, she will be concentrating on herself and her career. But going to Hawaii changed everything.

It sent her running. FAST.What she didnt expect was to see him again. As her new boss. Hes a rock star. Working for him made him off limits, or so she thinks. Because apparently, this guy wasnt over her, and he was going to push himself against her walls until it crumbles. Can she fight the attraction?I was expecting for someone cocky and arrogant  but hes neither of the two. But hes never boring. Kacen is a swoon-worthy, I-want-him-to-be-my-next-book-boyfriend-type of character. He can be intense, sweet and he doesnt let fame get into his head. As for the rest of the band  they were so much fun. I laugh through their banters and teasing.Kacen was sure of Logan, but it was Logan who was wary of starting a relationship, not to mention her ex is still in the way. She tries her best in resisting him, but to no avail. How can you resist this six foot temptation? Kacen proved himself every chance he got, he never gave up in her. She might pushed him away, but he still comes back.Its really, really sweet, heartwarming and fun read. The anticipation was the main driving force of this book: will they or will they not? It has a sprinkle of steam, and a whole lot of emotions.

"Its Masons book!Mason thought he was in love with Brinley, thinking that his heart was broken, he went to work for his uncle and cousins in the family fishing charter for the summer. He wants to have some fun, and perhaps found someone to med his broken heart. You cant help but love Mason, I adored him ever since, and I was glad that he was finally going to have his happy ending. I admire his patience and tenacity to stand by Felicity. Because being with this girl was a piece of work, a really piece of work (but proved to be worth it). But his patience has also some limits, and when it did  ah, it was something else. Something I never thought he was capable of.Heartbreak caused Felicity to build some walls around her heart to protect it. From then on, she just placed some silly rules that only summer boys are allowed in her life. Theyre predictable, and there was no way she was going to fall in love with someone in a short amount of time. Her rules kept her life stable. At first, I thought Felicity was not good for Mason. I mean, all she wants was her summer fling. She was a lost soul who didnt know what to do with her life. She didnt want any help from anyone around her  and that was the most frustrating thing of all. Nevertheless our heroine does have some redeeming qualities.The chemistry was obviously there  it was off the charts. The sexual tension was just overwhelming as much as the emotions that were all over the page, how can they be together with that kind of stubbornness?Well, if Felicity is a runner, Mason knows how to chase someone relentlessly. It took a lot of running, road bumps and twists and turns, but it ended up pretty well. This is the third book in the series that just got hotter and better, with a lot of feels. Good thing they can be read as stand alone, with relatable characters that will surely win your hearts.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RT4SH5Z9PK6H7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00R04IRM2#wasThisHelpful","RT4SH5Z9PK6H7","A1F5ZAUCP4KDVG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1F5ZAUCP4KDVG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have been waiting for Gabriella Masinis story ever since I have finished the previous book in the series. She did not deserve what happened to her, how those people have used her, and how she was left scarred and haunted by the people she trust. Now, she was trying to live on her own, off the island. Gabriella is now with the Alliance, and she was great with numbers. But when she came across Hunter Blackwell, something doesnt add up.Hunter Blackwell NEEDS a wife, and he needs it now. It doesnt matter how he gets it. So when his application was declined, he used an option meant for desperate people. He forced Gabis hand with an offer she cant refuse. But she fits his needs perfectly  now if he can only separate the growing feelings he has for Gabi.Both of them have a problem with trust due to their painful past. His life is filled with secrets: his past and his present. What happens when it goes out in the open? Would he be brave enough to come clean with Gabi? Or will his secret drove them apart?The attraction was potent, but the emotions grew, and you can feel it. The characters might have underwent denial first, they might not notice it  but it was there, and watching them uncover their feelings, fighting against it, fighting for it was pretty much excruciating as it was amazing.The perfect mix of romance, steam, mystery and thrill makes Treasured by Tuesday an enticing, memorable read. Catherine Bybee wows me once again with the rollercoaster of events, twists and emotions. The danger kept me on the edge of my seat, and the steam? Enough to set your Kindles on fire! Indeed, what a way to end the series. Certainly, she saved the best for last.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RTDWARDDS1CJT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00O5EYHH4#wasThisHelpful","RTDWARDDS1CJT","A1F5ZAUCP4KDVG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1F5ZAUCP4KDVG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Toni Aleo has done it again: made me fall hopelessly in love with another hockey player!!!Get your hearts ready for Jordie Thomas!!!!His life was spiraling out of control, and he was about to lose his contract with the Nashville Assassins, thank goodness Ellie was giving him another chance. But she had some conditions he grudgingly followed. After all, it was his fault, and he wanted to stay with the Assassins. It started when he lost the girl, and an injury that has been keeping him off his game. His life was in shambles and it was up to him to bring it back into whole. First he needs to admit that he has a problem.Kaceys dream already came true and that is to win an Olympic Gold medal. She should be happy, but how can she be when shes still nursing a broken heart? All she wanted was him, and yet he didnt seem to share the same sentiment. She wanted to move on, and go forward with her life.""I want the guy who's gonna keep me on my toes, make me live, and love me with so much intensity, I feel it everywhere. I want him to f**k me, to make love to me, not to 'plan to get intimate.' I want him covered in tattoos, with a crazy beard, and to play hockey. I want you,"" she said, her eyes meeting his. ""I've always wanted you.""It took some time, but when Jordie finally realizes that he was about to lose the best thing that ever happened to him, he was ready to up his game and be the man Kacey needs him to be. He wouldnt come to her half-baked  she doesnt deserve it. But question is: can she or will she wait for him after he broke her heart?""So while I may not fully know how to love someone, I don't want to try with anyone but you.""Toni made sure I (and the rest of her readers) can relate to both characters by throwing them into realistic situations. It was something you didnt want to get into, but is happening around you. Emotions were all over the page, and you cant help but get hooked to it. Every single emotion was felt: Jordies difficult road back to his old self, and Kaceys heartaches. All the feels!!!!!""I loved the old you, and I love the new you. I think it's just the YOU part that has my heart.""One of my favorite parts was seeing the old characters back especially Lace and Karson who caught my heart in Tangled in Laces! Lets not forget Ellie and her big part in the story. She truly has a big heart.Just like the other Assassins novels, this one is another page-turner, emotion and steam-filled romantic story. I always loved second chance romance, and despite the heartache Kacey suffered, I think Jordie made up for it big time. When he was ready to love, he gave more than his heart, he includes his soul. And it was something Kacey was thankful for. Her wait was really, really worth it. He was someone you wouldnt want to at first, but people change, it wasnt easy but he made it. He ended up being an ultimate book boyfriend.""I'm an alcoholic who is standing in front of the woman he loves, asking her to put the past in the past and love him for every single flaw he has because, believe me, I have a lot. But one thing is for sure, I'll love you with everything inside me and more.""","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3PMF7IQVD65DY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0111EOXRO#wasThisHelpful","R3PMF7IQVD65DY","A1F5ZAUCP4KDVG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1F5ZAUCP4KDVG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Okaaay, Sawyer Bass had me speechless. He has his way with words which is really sweet (and his words has the power to make the hair on my arms rise)  but *okay* it borderlines cheesy at times. He was a boxer and can fight an opponent fiercely, but off the ring, hes a different persona. He was an artist through and through: sensitive, and creative. But also, this guy has a big heart enough for someone to love and his family.Sky Lacroux was living her dream: she just opened her tattoo shop and was preparing for its grand opening. She was renting a cottage at the Seaside community while renovations to her new apartment are being done. But despite all these, there was still something missing in her life, she longed what her friends had found  LOVE.It was an unexpected meeting, but the words and voice from Sawyer Bass had piqued Skys interest. Needless to say, it was the same thing that happened to Sawyer. The moment he laid his eyes on Sky, she became the focus of his next song, and perhaps more.They have chemistry, and Sawyer was everything a girl could want, hes a great guy: honest, sensitive, sweet and good in bed, problem is Sky wasnt that fond of boxing. She wasnt that comfortable with his chosen sport. But the more he gets to know him, the closer they get. There is more to this alpha male than just being a poet and a boxer. He has his own personal baggage he carries and one is heartbreaking after the other. One thing about this guy though is that he is a great guy, willing to do anything for the people he loves.It was good to see a few familiar couples in this book who are living their happy ending. Not to mention the pranks that seemed to get funnier and funnier with each book. Im looking forward for the next prank they will do. Considering what they did here.They fell in love fast. It almost made my head spin. I wished there was a breather somewhere in between. But I guess, when you know, you just know that the person is the one for you. This is what happened to the both of them. And yet, Seaside Nights is more than just your steamy, whirlwind romance that can knock you off your feet. Its a story of a child who would do everything in his power for his family, even at the cost of his life. Its touching, its sweet, its Melissa Foster.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RS1IE0RVS2N39/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Z8A3ZV8#wasThisHelpful","RS1IE0RVS2N39","A1F5ZAUCP4KDVG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1F5ZAUCP4KDVG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"With Cosplay, Chloe Talley could be someone else: she can be more beautiful, bolder, and sexier. It was her shield to the world, to hide who she really is: shy, awkward and broken from the tragedy that stroked her family. She wanted to escape even for just a night, so sue her for wanting to have little fun, and indulge herself in one awesome, unforgettable night with a stranger.But when Grant Osprey woke up, the sexy woman who rocked his world the other night was no longer beside him. Although disappointed, he went back into his real world, not expecting to see her again. Especially not in a business meeting with his best friend, who happens to be the vixens brother (talk about awkward).But this Chloe seemed to be different from the one he spent the night with. The Chloe he remembered was more confident and exudes sexiness: this one was shy. Since she was his best friends little sister, he tried to stay away, only to be pulled again in a frenzy. Because every time they were together, Chloe hides herself in a costume. Oh, our boy loves a little kink, especially role playing. But games like this is tiring, will he ever convince Chloe to reveal her real self to him? Can he ever convince the girl that she was more than enough and she doesnt need all those costumes?The moment they met, Grant and Chloe already had that chemistry, and it even went off the charts as they get to know each other better. He understands her, what she has been through and what was going on in her life and he just proved it to her by means of a grand gesture that had me swooning  but not without the help of his equally charming daughter.Chloe  this was her story. I love how her character bloomed with the help of Grant, his daughter and even Ethan. She might start with zero self confidence at the beginning of the book, but as the story progressed, you can see how she was finally embracing and loving life.And theres Ethan, the overprotective brother who has his own share of baggage, I want nothing but his happy ever after, and I hope he gets his fast. He truly deserves it.Playing For Her Heart was indeed a great read. It was not just sizzling hot, with all those role playing and crazy hot scenes, it was also fun, and sweet. It can be emotional at times, with the baggage Chloe was carrying, but your heart can surely handle it: just enough drama to add into the mix. This was the kind of book that once you start reading, you.just.couldnt.stop.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1TPSLDFD7D8N7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011I42XQU#wasThisHelpful","R1TPSLDFD7D8N7","A1F5ZAUCP4KDVG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1F5ZAUCP4KDVG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"How to get a boyfriend via blackmail?Talk to Haley Patterson. Shes an honor student, totally invisible and just like the rest of the girl population in school, she has a massive crush on the rich, golden boy Bryce Colton. Now rumor has it that she hooked up with him. To save him (from her brothers and the cage-fighting boyfriend of the girl he really hooked up with) and save her (reputation), she blackmailed him into being his boyfriend for a month.

His Class-A personality made him want his life to be in order, and made him want to control every aspect, with Haley: his life just went over the edge. He didnt know what to do with his new boyfriend. It was a good thing though, she might help him take his ex off his back. He finds out that being her boyfriend was quite interesting, meeting two three-legged dogs, her crazy brothers, her father who mows the grass at the country club, her mother who seemed to hate him, and well, even Haley herself: she was different and difficult at times.They have undeniable chemistry despite the difference in their personality. Theyre good together, and when they kiss, the world stops. They had set backs, they had some hurdles. They bring the best and worse in each other.I wanted to remind Haley that Bryce is her FAKE boyfriend. He wasnt her REAL boyfriend, and sometimes she needs to be reminded of it.

"Dani Wilde was the sole person who glued her family together. It doesnt matter if her dreams of attending Columbia and live a normal college life came to a halt. She was needed by her family, and she came back for them.But now, her brothers have settled down, and it was time for her to make her dreams of going to New York come true. She will go there, nothing will stop her this time, not even an old flame.Ben Denton is coming back home, alongside the daughter who was pushed into him by an ex. He didnt know what to do with a kid, he didnt know how to act around her. He was trying, and his latest action was to bring his daughter back to Montana. He spent some of his childhood there, and he knew it would be a great place to raise his four-year old daughter. But will coming back home be enough for him to figure out if he was cut out to be a father?Dani tries to figure out what she really wants in life, was it going to New York or staying with her family? She was finally getting some memories from her past  memories she didnt know exists, especially the truth about her own mother. Talk about a surprising turn-out of events.What I love about Dani is her big, generous heart. She took care of everyone and did it flawlessly. I dont think her brothers would be where they are right now if it wasnt for her. She forgot about herself, about her happiness, her dreams. I was glad she was finally given a chance of going to New York and making her dreams come true. But it was not that simple.And what I love most about this book is that it is more than just romance (which is really sweet, by the way!), it talks about family. Their relationship  the ups and downs, the perfections and imperfections, the struggles. They may argue at times, they may have some misunderstanding, but at the end of the day  youre family would always be with you. Supporting you and wanting nothing but the best for you. Although there would ALWAYS be some exceptions: it was just sad both Ben and Dani experienced it.Ben  he may have some hesitations at first, but after Dani gave her some tips and support  he was at it like a pro. I mean playing dolls with his four year old daughter: it was just priceless. Pretty much adorable and one of my most favorite scenes in the book!Even though it broke my heart a bit, I was glad of Danis decision  she needed it. It needed to be done not just for her, but for their relationship to go on. I was just crossing my fingers that shed decide fast before Ben changes his mind!I was surprised that this one is a stand-alone, considering Dani has some interesting brothers.

Theres that baggage on her as well. Nevertheless, their chemistry was overwhelming, and soon they found themselves succumbing to it.But just as when they seem to head off to their HEA, threats came in. Danger was lurking in every corner, and was waiting to pounce on them. Was it her past? Or was it his? One bad decision placed Emma in a dire situation and her life in danger. Would she survive? Or will their happy-ever-after end before it even begun?Emma and Trace  they had this powerful chemistry whenever their together in one room, and tried to fight it because of the circumstances of their work. But it was just too strong to ignore. I love them together, their banters, how they care about each other, and not to mention all those steamy scenes that will get you got all over.I found it heartbreaking for kids to suffer the kind of experience that Emma and Danny did. It happens a lot, some of us might concern ourselves with it, others might turn a blind eye  but these awful things happen. Michelle Leigh had once again brought it to our attention and snapped us out of our haze. Some of these kids might get lucky, and some not. As for Emma and Danny  they both were. They were children and yet their strength and courage to survive was unbelievable.More than just a love story, Surviving is a story of survival, a story of a journey of a strong and courageous girl who fought her way (with her brother) for a better future. Its heartbreaking, especially when the past comes out in the pages, but when you see Emma, and how shes holding up  you couldnt be more proud. I cant help but to get wrapped up in her story, and was thankful enough I had the second book on hand, because when you reach the end of book one, youd be instantly grabbing for it!","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/ROBX52LGU3RRC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MPYRHK0#wasThisHelpful","ROBX52LGU3RRC","A1F5ZAUCP4KDVG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1F5ZAUCP4KDVG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I followed almost every book in this series and was delighted to see who starred in this book. Its Noahs turn for his HEA.Knowing Noah in-depth with this book was quite enlightening. You got to love him more after his light-bulb moment. His realizations might turn him into a chick  but it was just quite adorable him wanting to have what his others friends have  his very own happy ending. He was tired of the mindless sex, and every girl wanting a piece of him. He wants to find the one.Their first meeting was epic, and I just knew it would be as epic as their story. I didnt expect for them to happen, among all the girls in the world: IT WAS HER! It was a bit awkward and both of them had to think so hard before jumping in  but everything was worth it.I had a love-hate relationship with the girl. She was strong as she was frustrated. I can understand her wanting to protect everyone from all the dramas and unnecessary worries: but in this case, I think the worry was necessary. She was in danger, and she was taking it lightly. She assumed it wouldnt come to that point.Relationship is all about trust and honesty, and lying by omission isnt honesty. You need people around you to support you, guide you and protect you even though you seemed to do okay by yourself. Asking for help is never a sign of weakness. You might be strong, and people who loves you knows it, they will stand right by your side and will patiently wait until you finally need them.Perfect combination of steamy hot and sweetness. The characters and the plot can wrap you around in the pages, until you can find yourself hooked in the story. I loved it and enjoyed reading it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1VZGF6YG0XTQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VO2ING6#wasThisHelpful","R1VZGF6YG0XTQ","A1F5ZAUCP4KDVG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1F5ZAUCP4KDVG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm emotionally exhausted.It's one of the most emotional, gut-wrenching, heartbreaking stories I have read this year.It was a struggle as it was a beautiful tale of love. The emotions were intense and most especially the pain. You can feel it in every page, and I think I heard my heart break a couple of times in this book.I didn't think anything could go wrong between Hadley and Reed. They were so much in love and perfect for each other. They love each other deeply, madly and truly - what in the would could happen? Life that is. Dreams. Someone thought they need to follow their dreams, someone thought it was better that way, that somehow they will once again cross paths and find their way back into each other. But that someone had thought wrong.Hadley - ah, she'll win your hearts I loved her fate in their love. She didn't give up at first, until he gave her (or so she thought) the reason to do so. And then everything just spiraled out of control. A whole lot of things happen, that brought Hadley to the lowest point in her life. It was good that she had family and friends who were always there for her, trying to dig her out from whatever she was digging herself into.Five years, and their paths finally crossed. Things were not they were right now, a lot has already change, and a whole lot of things had happened in their lives individually. Will he ever win her back? Can she ever forgive him for leaving?The ending?I just knew it. I was struggling, in terrible pain and was hoping to be rewarded with something good - perhaps a happy ending. But no...Because we are in for the cliffhanger of our lives - so many questions were left unanswered, so many things were left unsaid, and I was in desperate need for their happy-ever-after. How can I possibly wait for Fall 2015?!!!!Nevertheless, this is the kind of book that despite all the emotional ups and downs this book gave me, the moment you will start reading this book, you will be hooked and can't help but get wrapped in the story, hanging on to every word, to every scene, to every dialogue in it. And if this is what the first installment is like, I wonder if I can handle the next...","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R24FTIB93FVIEF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XD5EIJS#wasThisHelpful","R24FTIB93FVIEF","A1F5ZAUCP4KDVG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1F5ZAUCP4KDVG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Im not a fan of love triangles, of cheatings and the like. I like my characters honest, one-woman (or man) kind of person. But this is Vi Keeland! And I have loved her books ever since, so I took the plunge, and lets say I was happy I gave it a shot.It was every girls dream: Lucky is dating one of the most popular and hottest rock stars whom she had been infatuated with since she was in her teens. But here comes Flynn, sitting silently in her bar one night and her life was never the same again.Flynn was our bachelor in THROB, and Im glad hes going to finally have his happy ending. Hes the kind of person who I can easily fall in love with. He has the talent, a very kind heart and not to mention an awesome uncle. He didnt let fame get into his head and remained humble, he loved his niece to pieces and even sings Frozen songs to her (isnt this adorable?) and hes the ultimate boyfriend package.Problem is, Lucky has already a boyfriend.It was an undeniable chemistry and connection on the first moment that they have met, and yet both of them had tried to shrug it off the moment he knew she wasnt available. But things just happen, and how can one possibly stop the inevitable? Because I think thats what these two people share  an inevitability of being together. They are perfect for each other because they understand each other  all their baggage, their fears and stuffs. I was glad Flynn was able to help her in his small ways. Lucky made such great improvement in a small amount of time  this just shows how persuasive Flynn can be when he wanted it.Sometimes, you get to hate Lucky for not dumping Dylan. It was like: what the heck are you waiting for? Dump him already and be with Flynn, cant you see youre perfect for each other?! It was quite a long journey towards it, sometimes it gets frustrating, but as the story goes we get to know more about Lucky, her fears and what she really wants in life.The ending was just perfect with a dose of reality. Some problems cant be solve in a couple of days or weeks, some needs time, and Im glad our author made the ending just the way I envisioned it to be. Our girl is on her way, making progress and is almost there. But aint there yet.I love the fact that it was written in dual POV, which makes me get into the thoughts of both characters and made me know and love them more. I was easily hooked on BEAT. Vi Keeland made sure the moment I opened this book, and took that one shot, there was no way Id put it down unless I was done.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1LJFC42Z55IDP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZOMUV12#wasThisHelpful","R1LJFC42Z55IDP","A1F5ZAUCP4KDVG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1F5ZAUCP4KDVG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Alexis Caine defined the word determined. She made her dream and is doing everything she can to achieve it. Shes almost there. She and Ava, her best friend and partner on their soon to be business didnt need any distractions, most especially boys.Soon, shed graduate with a business degree and is about to launch a fashion label, Travesty with the artistic Ava. The label was their blood and sweat, and everything should be perfect. Failure is not an option.Then here comes the distraction came strutting in, all grown up. Dylan Cameron, Avas problematic brother returning from the East Coast. They havent seen each other for quite sometime, imagine her surprise seeing him all grown up and filled in the right places. His reputation precedes him, although, he might not be the boy she thinks he is. There is more to Dylan that what she perceived him to be. And it can be very, very dangerous.The two year gap didnt bother me. I like Dylan, he was a big surprise to me  there were times you want to love him, and there were times youd like to strangle him for some things he did. And yet, he knows how to work his way back into your hearts. Talk about subtle grand gestures.I love their honest talks, the clash of their personalities: since our girl here is pretty much and determined control freak and he was the grounded one. He was mature enough to handle her or so he thinks. They have chemistry, and although Lex tried to fight it at first, but it was too powerful to ignore.I think it was Alexis sheer determination and perseverance that made her successful at what she does. She might got side-tracked, she fell in love along the way  all those pain and heartbreaks were worth it because in the end, she got her forever.Schooled is my first Piper Lawson book, and I enjoyed reading it. Its a great way to start the series. Im looking forward for Avas turn for her happy ending.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1QBI7N0IFQMTX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YDK4NPG#wasThisHelpful","R1QBI7N0IFQMTX","A1F5ZAUCP4KDVG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1F5ZAUCP4KDVG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""Sometimes the hardest, bravest thing in the world is to let someone love you. ""Since her Marriage to a Billionaire series, I have loved Jennifer Probst and now, I loved her even more with her Searching for Beautiful. Its romantic, sweet, and highly emotional. The feels!!!!!!! The roller coaster of emotion was just overwhelming  there were light moments, and then there were heavy. There were times when I can smile and laugh, and there were times when I couldnt help but shed a few tears, or the hair on my arms would raise, or an intense, consuming rage.I love how the story went, there were no boring moments, I think I was on the edge of my seat since the first chapter and never moved. Didnt have the heart to put down this book either, because I might miss out on something. Especially the growing chemistry between the two best friends.Gen and Wolfe had been best friends since the moment they have met five years ago. But the relationship Gen had with her fianc brought a strain to their friendship. However, it was Wolfe who took her away when she finally followed her instincts and ran away from her groom on the day of her wedding.It wasnt her type to just make impulsive decisions. But her instincts were nagging her, and she couldnt help but follow it. She needed some space, and it was Wolfe who provided it. They fell into their easy comfort, and familiar camaraderie.Finally, Wolfe had his best friend back. He missed her company, he missed his best friend. He took a step back when she was in a relationship with David, but now that she finally realized that David wasnt the one for her and danger lurks in the corner, he appointed himself her bodyguard.Wolfe has secrets, and every now and then, readers would get a glimpse of what his life was, of what he was trying to forget, and it was utterly heartbreaking. No wonder he wanted to forget about it. Gen respected his secrets, she never asked and waited for him to spill it himself.What he didnt expect was the growing attraction between them, the buildup of emotion, the powerful attraction that consumed them both. They tried to put it aside first, thinking about their friendship. But temptation was too hard to resist. Would they be able to take the risk?Gen was amazing, I think her transformation was brought about by the love she had for Wolfe, not just as her best friend. Wolfe had helped her heal the wounds from her previous relationship, and now she was ready to fight for what they have even if Wolfe was pretty adamant in saving their friendship. Gen now knows her worth and is ready to fight for it. Will Wolfe be brave enough?Friendship will always be one of the most solid foundations of a relationship. But both parties should be brave enough to cross the line. Love, that all-consuming, powerful thing, would always be worth it.The steamy scenes were jaw-dropping, but the emotions were just as intense as well. I think Searching for Beautiful is one of the most well-written book I have ever read so far this 2015. Jennifer Probst knows how to push your buttons, how to engage and satisfy her readers.""Not every path in the road needs to be followed. Sometimes it's smarter to quit and go home.""","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2K2022S3SD42N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LD1OLTG#wasThisHelpful","R2K2022S3SD42N","A1F5ZAUCP4KDVG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1F5ZAUCP4KDVG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I love his sense of humor and his charm. He may not have won the girl in the first book, but now  he has girls (yes, with an S) fighting over him (or is it the money?).Max Emory was the best friend. After graduation, everyone moved on. Milo had married Colt, and he was left where he was standing. He had no ambition, so it was up to his crazy friends to make him see the light. They decide to sign him up to be the next bachelor on the reality series Love Island.

But Becca, shes such a surprise. The more he gets closer to her, the more he wanted her.But is she after Maxs heart as well, or will it be all for the money?I just want you. Every day. Every night. Every moment. I want you.If youre tired of all the dramas, the heartaches and the like from your usual reads, and you want to have a good laugh, you have to pick this one.

"According to her contract, it wasn't supposed to happen. She wasn't suppose to date, to have sex, and disclosing the terms of the contract. She needed to win. She needed the money badly. It wasn't for her, but for the people she hold dear to her heart. Eight weeks ago, it didn't matter. She had not met Cooper yet.Cooper was very, very hard to resist. A hot, alpha-male who knows what he wants and which buttons to push. He was rich, successful and owns one of the biggest production company in Hollywood, and he only wants her. Problem is, he couldn't have her. He could offer her the world, but she declined, needing to earn it for herself.Things got a little heated, when jealousies flare, tempers ran off, and blackmail were put in the table. Would they survive? Would luck be on their side?I seriously liked Flynn. He may have appeared to be the third party between these two - but he was respectful. He wanted her, but respected her boundaries. Probably why he makes a good friend. I am excited to hear that his story is next. He deserves his happy ending too!My heart throbbed loudly for THROB!Right from the first time they met, down to the very last page. I think the excitement of the affair, of keeping it, not to mention the contest was keeping my adrenaline on very high level. From the moment it was sent on my Kindle, I couldn't put it down.

"""I would say I couldn't love you more than I do right this very second, but it'd be a lie, because I know without a doubt that every second will be better than the last.""I just cant believe that this short read had me in tears! The first book in the Bradens from peaceful Harbor and Im already a crying mess. I loved this book, the perfectly fast-pacing of the story, and the characters (most especially the new set of Bradens).Just like the rest of the Braden men, Nate Braden is simply irresistible. Who wouldnt want one of em? Certainly, Id fly anywhere to meet one. Theyre flawed, sometimes with baggage, and yet theyre perfect. Theyre the kind of men you want to bring home to your parents (*sighing*).""Every f***ing fantasy I've ever had involved you.""Anyway, back to Nate here, he has been in love with his best friends younger sister Jewel for a very long time. But mainly because of his respect for their friendship, he didnt make a move. But things change, years later, he was back at Peaceful Harbor, with a lot on his plate and guilt riding in his heart and Jewel, the girl of his fantasies and his dreams is no longer sixteen years old. Even though he wanted badly to make a move, he cant. Until he confesses something to her, something that might make him lose her.Jewel is the responsible sister in the family. Dont get me wrong, her moms great. No family issues right here, but since they have lost their dad, and then Rick, she had made sure she helped her mother and protect her siblings in the best way she can. She might not won the most-fun sister award, but she only wants what she thought was right and best for everyone.I always love the family dynamics that Melissa Foster brings to her stories; its the very heart and the very essence of it. I always look forward for the relationship they have with their families.  It warms my heart all the time. But lets not forget the romance and the plot, my friends. Because no matter how many Bradens are there in her series right now  she managed to make each one uniquely lovable and each story different from the rest.Trust me  YOU. WILL. FALL. IN. LOVE. WITH. NATE. BRADEN. His heart is just so big and so generous, I love how he loved not just Jewel, but Rick and the rest of their family. Its a little heartbreaking that Rick wasnt there to watch their love bloom and get their HEA, it would have been perfect.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R38MPPCZZUJS5U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UYD7J7K#wasThisHelpful","R38MPPCZZUJS5U","A1F5ZAUCP4KDVG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1F5ZAUCP4KDVG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Even bad boys need their happy endings, and Michelle Lynn made sure Rob Winters got it in this wonderful love story that will make and break hearts.Everyone who has read this series knew who Rob Winters is. I hated him until book number 4. He was an a**, sometimes I wished him ill, and he really didnt deserve a happy ending, until Chrissys story, where he did something that no one had expect him to do.Is he set to redeem himself in front of the readers eyes? Or will he continue to build all those walls around him and continue to act like he doesnt care about anyone?It was a tragedy that made him close off himself to the people around him, a heartbreaking, life-changing accident that had broken relationships he valued along the way. It has been seven years, and so far, he had distanced himself from people by being rude, mean, douche and again, an a**. But what people dont know, even his friends are the anguish that has been eating him. Can he ever move on?Then here comes the new roommate who caught his attention the moment she walked into his life. Paige had been a breath of fresh air with an ounce of sunshine. But she doesnt take any s*** from anyone even if its from the hottest guy he had ever laid her eyes on. She knows her worth, and she wasnt going to settle for less. She had seen what loving someone who doesnt reciprocate the love can do to oneself. I love her sense of responsibility, the way she takes care of things even if she wasnt the one who should be doing it. She saw through him, and she will do anything to unleash the guy she saw in him. Its not going to be easy, but if theres someone who can do it, it was her. Just like the rest of the girls in this series, shes easily likable.You cant help but swoon and pin over the characters in this series, I was glad to see the rest of the group living up their HEA, all the surprising scenes, those heart-stopping twists and turns that will make you see the characters in different lights.I have never, ever thought Michelle Lynn would teach me to love this bad boy. It was slow, deliberate and she made sure once you fell in love with this guy, hes going to stay in your hearts forever.I love this series, and even loved it more when this bad boy got himself redeemed.

"Lady Sophia Barnes is a woman to be admired. Shes brave, shes strong, shes stubborn, and shes generous. She doesnt take no for an answer and poses as a man when she goes on a mission roaming Londons underground.What shes doing is dangerous, but living for a cause, and being brave enough to fight for it is pretty much amazing. She usually comes out of it unscathed, until she needed to use a gun. First, she had to know how to shoot it. Who else would be qualified to teach her discreetly but Lord Quint? The man who broke her heart years ago.I like Quint. He is handsome and smart  complete package. But his family history might bring out something in him that he didnt want. Something he was studying for a long time but still hasnt figured anything out. So, he doesnt allow himself to go out of his house. He became a hermit, and he valued his solitude, until Sophie invaded his home.These two are pretty much amazing. They are easily likable characters even with their secrets and baggage. These are the type of people you want to be friends with, and you want to help badly.The attraction was there, it was since they met and it was brewing, waiting for the perfect time. But with danger lurking and unsure future  would they have a chance to be together?The book was one big adventure and romance. This was one of those reads I couldnt put down, and have gone through the wee hours of the morning to finish.You know that book that you couldnt help but love because of its exemplary tale of woman power at the same time the vulnerability of woman because of their emotion? This is the book. It amazed me, made me laugh, had me in tears and made me fall in love. Joanna Shupe sure knows how to end her series with a bang.

"Because with them, it always started with a kiss.These are two are pretty much frustrating and will test your patience, and yet you will admire them for what they have been through, and how they manage to survive what life threw at them at their young age.Alyssa was the new girl in town, and Johnny was a sweet-talking country boy who likes to play in mud. They were perfect for each other. The chemistry was there, the attraction was palpable. The girl just needed to put a label on it, since she was getting more and more confused.Just when everything was going perfectly, tragedy happened that destroyed their relationship. He was grieving, he was pushing her away, and she was hurting. They didnt realize that their choices and their action could dampen their new budding relationship until it was already too late.I couldnt blame Alyssa, really. She made a bad choice, but heck they were both in pain. It was a bad move, but he somewhat pushed her to it. He was acting as if she doesnt exist anymore, as if she meant nothing to him and it stings.When he came back, he was surprised to find the love of his life was different from what he imagined her to be. He tries to win her back by wooing and promising  but the trust has been broken. He needed to do more than groveling to bring himself back into her good graces.I wanted to welcome him back, after all, he was all sweet and attentive. But coming from Alyssas side, I knew it was hard for her to look through everything that has happened to her. The trust has been broken, and she was not the girl he left behind. A lot of things had happened already.Will they get their second chance?Lucia Franco pushed it. She bravely wrote this book and awed me. Topics that are considered taboo, but are happening in closed doors. It creep me out because its raw, its real and its heartbreaking. Its happening around us  we might have been blind at some point and nonchalant at the next but its true. She pointed it out, made her readers see, and gave her readers something to ponder on.We always have choices. Every one of us.

"""If my heart beats 100,000 times a day, that means 100,000 times a day, it's thinking about you.""I finished the second and third book in one sitting. It was THAT highly addictive. The urge to know the Macys secret was eating me alive, and I wanted to know what it is that had made her that was. What was in her past that she couldnt share with Cal?Despite the initial guesses, Sawyer Bennett still managed to pull off some amazing twist to end this series. It was heartbreaking, gut-wrenching, and it was enough to wish somebody ill (grrr.) Nevertheless, I was just happy that Macy was finally able to share her secret to someone than her best friend. It was freeing, and you can feel the load in her lighten up, especially when Cal stayed, and never left her.It was a dark, dark secret that might have sent someone running, but not Cal. He was strong enough for it: strong enough to catch her, strong enough to be with her, and strong enough to fight for her.It might have taken some time before Macy trusted Cal with it, but Cal was patient. He waited, and Macy risking every single thing within her found it worth it. Cal was everything she deserved, no matter how much baggage she had on her back, he was helpful enough to carry it for her.The sex was still mind-blowing, the chemistry was still off the charts. But this time, YIELD offers us everything we ever asked for: the secret, the emotion, and the happy ending that both of them deserved. Its the best ending to the start of their happy-ever-after.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1FCBWTQ5MR286/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VZ0Y21C#wasThisHelpful","R1FCBWTQ5MR286","A1F5ZAUCP4KDVG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1F5ZAUCP4KDVG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love the Sinclair brothers!!! I have read the first book  who starred in Jude, and I was eagerly waiting for this one.Baylor is one of the most determined, strong, and ambitious heroine I have ever encountered. She can be too much, her attitude could rival some men, her temper needs to be in check at times, but hey  this girl could prove to be the first one to be drafted in the NHL. Because she plays really, really well. Enough to topple all the men in college hockey. She had been trained that way. She has been in skates even before she can walk. She was trained to be the best, and determined to be the best there is. Now if she can only tweak the attitude a little, live life rather than competing in every turn  this girl could have been perfect.If Baylor is a worry wart and control freak, Jayden worries, but he was set off to live his life (as pushed by Jude, the other hot Sinclair brother we met at Boarded by Love). It saddens him that he didnt get to be in the draft when Jude did, but his agent insisted he needed to have one more year in college to hone his skills. What came unexpectedly was meeting a girl when he went into a vacation with his brothers.It was the most trying time in their lives: Jude being away, their father leaving them and their mom struggling. He worries for everyone, I was glad Jude talked to him. He still worries, but he gets to enjoy life too. He had never met his match, until Baylor. Not only he challenges him on ice (or street-hockey), but off-ice as well. It would have been perfect, but he got all gentlemanly (didnt handle things real smooth!) instead, he broke her heart. He thought he was never going to see her again  much to his surprise.Because Baylor was now in Nashville. Playing for his team. With her father as coach. Trying to get the captainship of the team. Well, not if he cant help it.What I love about this Sinclair brother is it didnt bother him that a girl could be as good as him. He wasnt a chauvinist who thought girls couldnt play college hockey as roughly as them.  Jayden knew he was good, and he knew Baylor was great as well. But being on the same team, fighting over a championship after what happened could indeed get rough.The passion these two has for the sports is overwhelming. It makes the competition a little bit fiercer, but nonetheless healthy. I love how Jayden is protective of Baylor, and how he tries to get into her skin. But what I love the most is the change in Baylor. From enjoying (or living) in solitude, she was taught not only by Jayden, but by Jace, and sweet Markus that having friends (besides her two crazy female friends who are twins) can be great as well. So day by day, she tries to put down those walls, be a member of a team and finally realize that they were more than just a group of men (and woman) who play hockey. They were a family.Their chemistry was off the charts, they tried to fight it at first (or Baylor) did, but if she was determined, Jayden was persistent. He wore her off, she agreed if only to keep it a secret. She didnt want anything to change. She wanted to protect him from her father. But I was right when I thought keeping it a secret was a disaster waiting to happen.Jayden was a swoon-worthy boyfriend. He cares about her, he wants to show her off to the world. If she will only let him. He respects her decisions, and he wouldnt push her off her comfort zones. So, despite the fact the emotions he was feeling was a bit overwhelming that it shakes his chest fiercely, he bottled it up, until he thought she was ready to let him all in. Problem is, this girl is a control freak. And love is a very uncontrollable emotion. Would they ever make it?I enjoyed Clipped by Love as much as I enjoyed the first book. It made me laughed at times, fall in love in most pages, and had my adrenaline pumped up during those games I felt I was watching while reading it. More than that passionate romance friendship and love for sports, this story taught me that you make things happen if you are determined, and stubborn. But sometimes you cannot do it alone, you need another people to boost you up and support you for you to reach your maximum potential.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R25C4GWS8RBW9T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UGB2SAI#wasThisHelpful","R25C4GWS8RBW9T","A1F5ZAUCP4KDVG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1F5ZAUCP4KDVG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Fall in love so easily with this great contemporary romance from Alannah Lynne. Its my first read from this author, and Ill be looking forward for the rest of the books in the Heat Wave Series.It was suppose to be a one-night stand, or so Kat thinks.

He didnt expect for the girl who shifted his world to run away while he was in deep slumber.Kat Owens was trying to put her life together after a devastating loss to her career and love life. Moving in a new place is hard, but what is harder is resisting her supposedly one-night-stand who tempting her to have a repeat.

More than just starting for scratch, she needs to prove to her grandfather that she can be someone. Distraction was not a part of her game plan. But he was temptation personified. How long can she resist what he was offering?Just as when Kat was ready to open her heart, walls begin to rise around Eriks heart as old wound starts to ache again. Will he be brave enough to face his emotions? Or will he end up running away?Easily likable characters, not-to-heavy drama, just enough to pique your hearts, and great romance makes Saving Me one heck of a read.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RNJQSH6SKUOEF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008UCCXXM#wasThisHelpful","RNJQSH6SKUOEF","A1F5ZAUCP4KDVG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1F5ZAUCP4KDVG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Bella Andre and Melissa Foster separately make great novels that have touched millions of readers worldwide, but together? Theyre unstoppable. So yes, my expectations were quite high, and ever since the news went out, I was pretty much excited to read this novel. It didnt disappoint.Both authors have books that tell stories about great romance and amazing family ties, this time we are introduced to a new family that will surely earn a spot in your hearts. Not only that, we are transported into the magnificent Rockwell Island.More than just an island I have fell in love with, Rockwell Island is more of a tight-knit family than a community. More than half of the people are employed by the resort  and are about to lose their jobs if the Rockwell kids choose wrong.They might have grown up in a warm and loving environment, but their grandfather was quite different. He was cold, controlling and one of the reasons why some of them preferred for a life outside the island rather than be in it.Quinn have left the island and built a shipping empire on his own. Returning to Cape Code wasnt on his to-do list but he was forced to do so when the patriarch of the Rockwell family, his grandfather, had summoned them and his four siblings to take over the resort. Each of them had their own business, and Quinn was spending a whole lot of time with mergers and contracts  how can he find time for his grandfathers demands? Not only that, the unexpected happened on his first night on the island.Meeting Shelley.Shelley Walters is a breath of fresh air. Shes wonderful, she follows her heart and her dreams. Shelley came from a prominent family with parents who were too busy to pay attention to her. She didnt want to have a future like that. She wanted something normal, so rich men were off the table. Until Quinn.If Shelley makes him once again appreciate the old things he used to enjoy in the Cape, the things he forgot. Quinn makes Shelley forget about her apprehensions with regards to rich men. Quinn was really trying so hard in changing, in trying to prove that he was different, that he can have time, that she can be a priority. He might slip sometimes, but, he sure is trying. With that  he already won me over.I always believe if you want something, if you want to find time for something  you can do it. It was hard, especially for Quinn at first, but when he finally decided, and found a solution to his problem, making the right choice was easy.I fell in love completely with the Cape Cod Kisses. I love both characters, including the warm characters that surround them. Even Chandler, I think there is more to him than his initial coldness. The dialogues were to swoon for, and you will look forward for the couples small chats. In a short time, they have known each other and fell hopelessly in love.This is the first book in the series, and in no doubt, I will be looking forward for more from these two amazing authors.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQNPMA0FQ6J8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00X1GL4DW#wasThisHelpful","RQNPMA0FQ6J8","A1F5ZAUCP4KDVG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1F5ZAUCP4KDVG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The past was not kind to Lady Hawkins. It started with her debut that had shaped her future. She just wanted to forget it, along with the whispers, the feeling of betrayal and the heartbreak that went along with it. Not to mention, her first marriage. Now a widow, Maggie had transformed into a new woman, a modern woman who valued her freedom and expresses her passion for art. Secretly that is, because she is now the renowned political cartoonist, Lemarc who seemed to have a penchant for ridiculing the Earl of Winchester.He broke her heart in the past, but now the Earl of Winchester, Simon Barrett is the rising star in the parliament just like the rest of his men in his family. But the art was ruining him one at a time, he needed to put a stop to it, now if he can only find who Lemarc is.Maggie tries not to let her reputation dampen her spirit. Instead, she lived in it. She valued the freedom and living life that came across in being the Half-Irish Harlot. After all, she couldnt do anything about it. But having Simon near her again, the man who joined the ton in not believing her innocence, proved to be a danger in her heart. She will never fall for him again, she wont risk her heart.But Simon was a formidable force. She broke his heart years ago and left him feeling like a fool. He wouldnt let her do it to him again, but question is can he resist being close to her once again?Can they be both wrong about what happened years ago?Their love story is ten painful years in the making, and I was glad they got their happy ending, not matter how farfetched it was initially. Indeed, love can do everything, even move mountains and surpass whatever painful past there is. Another captivating romantic novel from Joanna Shupe. The Harlot Countess proved to be as engaging as the first one in the series, the anticipation of solving the mystery was up until the final page, and not to mention the sizzling romance between the characters did not allow me to put this book down.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3UPGBNRPL8I6W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ONTR6BA#wasThisHelpful","R3UPGBNRPL8I6W","A1F5ZAUCP4KDVG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1F5ZAUCP4KDVG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I love this book way, way more than I loved BAIT, because this time  Blake & Casey were fighting for their feelings. The fight was worth it. They were finally enjoying each other without that guilt feeling that has been nagging them (and me too).Their secret was out  and it was finally a relief. Blake was finally getting braver to do what is right, and not what was expected of her. What surprised me the most in here was Grant. Never in my whole reading of BAIT did I imagine Grant would resort to that. But I guess, pain, and betrayal can push you off the edge. But hey, Blake came clean, she was finally honest about her feelings and was doing something about it.I simply adore Casey. Yep, he can be all alpha, protective and possessive of her, but he waited (or he did try his best) and proved to Blake that he was more than a good lover. He was also a great friend. He tried it slow, putting off temptation and showing her another side of him, and it worked.Their relationship grew, they grew as a person, as a couple and they were finally seeing the light at the end of the tunnel, but theres that certain twist that got my heart up on my throat. THAT COULDNT BE HAPPENING. NOT. NOW. Not when everything is almost perfect. Arggghhhh.This book was the perfect. I dreaded the start, but truly adored the ending. I couldnt stop reading, crossing both my fingers, praying that theyd finally have the happy ending they deserved and waited for. This proved that no one, or nothing can stop true love.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1MCL1VPYT57X3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VF3M4NW#wasThisHelpful","R1MCL1VPYT57X3","A1F5ZAUCP4KDVG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1F5ZAUCP4KDVG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"They were trouble waiting to happen, I knew it, everyone that surrounds them knew it. I think they were the only one who were clueless of the situation. Both of them were too busy living inside their bubbles to care about anything else in the world.We have this old adage in our country: masarap ang bawal, which translates to: forbidden acts are more satisfying (or the like). Youd be hooked, until such time truth will slap you right in the face and youd be caught red handed.Im uncomfortable with the plot, and even though I love both Casey and Blake, I need to black out that thought that Blake was committed to a clueless man. Someone who was boring, but was good to her. I guess it would have been okay if Grant was cheating or if he was an a**, but no.She made some decisions that I hated, perhaps out of pressure, out of uncertainty, she wanted something that Casey could not give her.

For a while, they were happy. Nicole has some insecurities, but she never lets in the way, because Gabriel was always assuring her. But she couldnt help to feel that he was still keeping something from her.And that something was his past, something that he was not proud of, something he wished to bury, something he was afraid that Nicole couldnt understand or take. But it was something that was haunting him right now.One important thing about relationships is honesty. People who truly love you will accept even your darkest side, no judgment.

"I've been using the Gerber Suspension multi-tool for several months, and recently picked up the Tekton as a cheap alternative to keep in my vehicle.  I thought comparing the two tools might be useful, since they are reasonably similar in design (see the photo I posted).  The Gerber currently costs 2-3 times as much as the Tekton, so this tool wins on value, assuming you can still get it for around ten bucks.  I think the construction of the Gerber is slightly better, though both tools feel sturdy and I think each will hold up to reasonable use.  The Tekton pliers are of good quality, and they are spring loaded.  Like the Gerber, the tool handles fold around the plier head, so that all tools can be accessed from the exterior of the handle while the tool is folded.  The knife blades and other tools on the Gerber lock in place, whereas the Tekton has no lock.  The lack of a locking mechanism on the Tekton is the tool's greatest shortcoming. You'll need to use care to avoid the blades folding onto your fingers.  Advantage, Gerber. The Gerber also comes with a nylon sheath, while this tool does not.As for the quality of the tools, they are pretty close.  Most tools are common to the two units, though the Gerber lacks a file and the Tekton lacks scissors.  The blades on both tools are reasonably sturdy.  The Gerber has a rather poor flattened phillips screwdriver, while the Tekton has a real phillips head, albeit a small one.  As for size, the handle of the Tekton is a bit shorter, which I consider a slight disadvantage, though the tool is almost as large as the Gerber.  The pliers on both tools are sturdy and provide wire cutters, and I have no trouble applying a strong grip to either tool. Both pliers have a needle-nose design, with the Gerber having a slightly more narrow plier tip.I find the Tekton to be a decent multi-tool that compares reasonably well with the lower end tools from mainstream brands like Gerber or Leatherman.  It's a solid choice for throwing into your toolbox or vehicle for occasional or emergency use.  If I were looking for a tool to use continuously, I would pass on the Tekton and buy a tool with locking blades. Overall, this is a solid 3 star tool that rounds up to 4 stars if you can buy it at a low price.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R791HU9KT17UT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005G7QG7I#wasThisHelpful","R791HU9KT17UT","AU7O296O6PXZM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AU7O296O6PXZM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The product description is correct in saying that this book contains ""enough minutiae of the space shuttle to enable, it seems, the building of one's own orbiter.""  On technical matters, this book is brilliant.  It contains a depth of information about the shuttle that is probably unmatched anywhere else.  The printed information and diagrams are exhaustive, not just about the shuttle as it was built, but also about the dozens of proposals that came before the shuttle and influenced its design.  If a technical history is what you seek, you'll find none better than this book.Although I enjoyed this book, it bills itself as a complete history of the shuttle, not just a technical history. The real shortcoming of the book is its failure to examine the shuttle program critically. A 2012 Forbes article said that ""criticizing the Space Shuttle is like punching America in the face.""  While many people do have an instinctive need to defend the shuttle at all costs, the fact is that the shuttle was delivered years late and came with enormous cost overruns, limited capability, and multiple safety problems that were impossible to remedy.It's important to remember the promises NASA made for the shuttle. In the 1970s it was sold as a safe, extremely low cost, reliable means to access space on a weekly basis.  It would serve the needs of both commercial launch customers and the US military.  In short, it would be so cheap and versatile that it would make disposable rockets a relic of the past.  These promises turned out not just to be unrealistic, but unrealistic in the extreme. Just five years into operating a vehicle that endured for three decades, NASA found itself with a spacecraft that had killed seven astronauts, entered service years late, was exorbitantly expensive to develop and operate, was prohibited from launching commercial satellites, had been abandoned by the military, and had failed to outperform the expendable rockets it was designed to replace. Few technical programs could have survived after such an extreme turn of fortunes, but NASA doubled down with a brave face, and the program carried on. The circumstances of how NASA kept the shuttle going in the face of harsh realities is a story that really should be told.The people selling the shuttle in the 1970s were promising reliable access to space for the low, low price of $118 per pound of payload.  If Congress would just allocate a few billion dollars to develop this revolutionary vehicle, the extreme savings made possible with shuttle operations would pile up year after year. It all sounded great, but the promised per-pound cost of $118 per pound ended up being as high as $27,000 per pound. Shuttle launches that were projected to cost $12 million ended up costing well over $1 billion, a staggering sum of money for one launch to low earth orbit.  This book explains such discrepancies in terms like ""estimates had been unrealistically low"" (page 288).  That sentence deserves the lifetime achievement award for understatement.  Any way you look at the shuttle's performance on cost, it was a complete debacle. The shuttle failed to deliver on lots of other promises too. You get little sense of that reading this book, little explanation for why NASA's predictions were so tragically wrong. On topics such as these, the author's long association with United Space Alliance may be telling.  USA's bread was buttered on both sides by billons of shuttle dollars, which is a reasonable explanation for why the author goes out of his way to present a ""go shuttle!"" attitude while steadfastly avoiding asking unpleasant questions.I could give dozens of examples, but here are just a couple.  The book give the impression that NASA management had no idea that cold temperatures endangered the Challenger mission.  ""No critical issues were identified to NASA or contractor management officials"", the book claims (page 277). It's common knowledge that Larry Mulloy (NASA's manager of the SRB project for Marshall Space Flight Center) was on the phone the night before the Challenger launch, arguing with Thiokol management, pressuring for their support to launch against the advice of Thiokol's best SRB engineers. (How is Mulloy not considered part of NASA management?). If you look at the history of that conference call, NASA managers were clearly more concerned about maintaining shuttle flight schedules than they were about the safety questions raised. True, there probably were higher ups in NASA management who didn't know of the debate over the Challenger launch, but NASA's failure to coordinate and communicate the risk to Challenger across multiple levels of management was a big part of its failing. Donald J. Kutyna raised the issue in a very revealing manner at the Challenger review board hearings:  ""If this were an airplane and I just had a two-hour argument with Boeing on whether the wing was going to fall off or not, I think I would tell the pilot, at least mention it.""  The Challenger disaster was as much a failure of management as a technical failure, but in this book, the people managing shuttle come in for only the mildest of criticism, and that criticism is delivered very gently.  ""The review board said these bad things about us"".  The fact that poor NASA management later contributed to the Columbia disaster (another 7 astronauts killed) only confirms that the Challenger review board had gotten it right about NASA's poor management of the program.Similarly, the book takes an uncritical view of the shuttle's inherent design shortcomings. The shuttle was a vehicle with little to no margin for crew safety during critical times during both launch and landing. With shuttle, there were numerous failure modes that would spell certain death for the crew.  There was no practical way to quickly get the crew away from an exploding booster in time to save them, a capability that all previous NASA vehicles had. The shuttle was also susceptible to destruction on landing in a way that previous NASA spacecraft were not, as evidenced by the loss of Columbia.  The fact that NASA would build such a vehicle so dangerous when compared to previous spacecraft is presented uncritically. The shuttle might make a risky business much more dangerous than before, but this is a bold new vehicle and we must ride it. Really?In numerous instances, the author presents data that raises unpleasant questions, yet he refuses to acknowledge the obvious implications of the data. On page 246, the author says that NASA anticipated 581 shuttle flights over a 20 year period.  Later, he says NASA had determined through repetitive studies that an average of 2% of shuttle flights would end in catastrophic failure during launch, as well as an additional 1% that would fail on landing (page 281).  If NASA planned to fly nearly 600 shuttle missions, losing 3 shuttles for every 100 flights, does it not logically follow that they would necessarily lose 18 shuttles and crews to various disasters?  How would shuttle continue to fly with such a loss rate when NASA intended to build only 5 orbiters?  If they did anticipate losing 18 flights, why would they max out shuttle flights with crews of 7 astronauts per flight?  Did NASA actually consider it acceptable to lose 126 astronauts during the normal course of the shuttle program?  Clearly that seems wildly implausible, but as with so many things related to the shuttle, NASA's numbers were little more than fiction designed to sell the program to Congress.  It shouldn't be news to anyone that manned space flight will always involve risk to life, but why did NASA behave as it did for so many years?  Knowing that 3% of shuttle flights would fail, why would they promote shuttle flights as routine and safe, touting the advantages of safe, reliable ""shirt sleeve"" access to space?  Why recruit civilians like Christa McAuliffe (the first of many civilians intended to fly on shuttle) if they knew full well that 3% of those flights would end in disaster? Yet, the author never asks these questions. In a book of over 500 pages, clearly there was an opportunity to do so. But the approach here is matter of fact.  Space is hard and we always knew people would die (Go shuttle!).All in all, I found this book to be an unparalleled technical history, though one that lacks an honest evaluation of the shuttle's performance. It steadfastly avoids an realistic discussion of the ways in which the shuttle didn't live up to its promises, never asking what could have been accomplished with the $209 billion NASA spent on the shuttle, had they developed a more practical vehicle instead. While this book is excellent on technical details, readers would be well served by seeking other perspectives on the program that consider the failures of the program as well as it successes.  3.5 stars.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RM5NDFG8XVK1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0963397451#wasThisHelpful","RM5NDFG8XVK1","AU7O296O6PXZM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AU7O296O6PXZM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I picked up this bag a couple weeks ago from REI on end of season clearance. My first impressions are very good. The bag seems to be well made from quality fabrics and it has been comfortable. The reflective thermal lining is such a good idea I'm surprised I've not seen it before in other sleeping bags. The interior proportions are generous for a mummy bag. I'm a 5'10"" male with a few extra pounds, and while it's not as roomy as a rectangle bag, I'll definitely be able to make it work.The best feature of this bag is its low weight and ability to compress tightly. While it's easy to find an inexpensive sleeping bag for car camping, finding a lightweight bag at this price point for backpacking is much more difficult. The Reactor 35 is almost as lightweight as expensive down bags, so it's a great option for backpackers on a budget. My bag wasn't quite as light as advertised. With the stuff sack, mine weighs 2.5 pounds. Still, it's quite a lightweight bag that packs up tight with the included stuff sack.As soon as it gets cool enough outside, I'll be testing the temperature rating and updating this review with those results.

My only excursion so far was on a mild night with lows around 50.  Should be no challenge for a 35 degree bag, right?  Overall, the bag was warm.  However, under my bottom where the bag was most compressed, I felt cold coming in early in the night and had difficulty sleeping.  A fleece jacket added under the bag remedied that problem quickly, but again, it wasn't a cold night.  Be aware that this can be a problem with many lightweight bags, and be prepared to supplement the bag with extra insulation as needed.  I will update this review after I've had more experience with the bag.Overall, a good bag that makes some compromises in insulation to achieve low weight.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3FFFETB6VD6LY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00A72W3GA#wasThisHelpful","R3FFFETB6VD6LY","AU7O296O6PXZM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AU7O296O6PXZM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"After spending some time using the $100 tactical light my friend bought for his semi-automatic pistol, I decided to shop around for one of my own.  When I saw this budget option on Amazon, I didn't expect a lot considering the low price.  After giving it at try, I was surprised to find this light is really well made and works well.  In some ways, I actually prefer it to my friend's more expensive light.  It doesn't have any bells and whistles, just an on/off switch and a sturdy clip to attach it to the accessory rail.  But, I prefer simplicity on a self defense item like this.Unlike some lights that have a screw mechanism that tightens onto the gun, this one has a spring loaded hinge that snaps into a notch on the rail to keep the light in place. I prefer this setup, as I think it will do less damage to the gun frame.For what it's worth, this light fits great on the Smith & Wesson SD9VE and SD40VE.  That pistol is similar in size to the full size M&P, so it should work well on the M&P as well.  Even though I have a full size pistol, I prefer my light to be as small as possible and this one fits the bill perfectly.  (See the photo section for my photo of it installed on the S&W SD9VE).A good light at a great price.

"I've been using this stove for about a year now.  It's a heavy, well-made burner best suited for car camping where size and weight are not big concerns.  For backpacking, you'd do well to explore one of many other stove options that are much lighter in weight. One major advantage of this burner is the low cost and wide availability of the 16 oz. propane canisters that power it. You get far more bang for your buck with this stove, as compared to stoves using the smaller isobutane canisters. At my local big box store, a 16 oz propane canister costs about $2.50, whereas an 8 oz. isobutane fuel canister costs $5.  Twice the fuel for half the cost is never a bad thing. In addition to being inexpensive, propane canisters last a long time and are widely available at retail stores and campgrounds.Lighting this burner is easy. There is no pumping or prep as the fuel is already pressurized in the tank.  Simply turn the knob to release the gas and provide a spark, and you're cooking instantly. The simplicity of this burner also has advantages in reliability. As far as cooking performance goes, this stove excels at any cooking task that requires a high flame.  Boiling water and warming liquids is a breeze.One downside to this stove is that while it does have multiple flame settings, it doesn't have one that I would describe as truly low.  If you're cooking foods that are prone to sticking or burning on thin camping cookware, you may find that this stove burns too hot, even on the lowest setting.  A couple times I've made pancakes on camping trips, and I had to hold my pan in the air above the stove to avoid burning, even on low.  It hasn't been a problem on most foods, but the lack of a very low setting can be an issue here and there. Other than that, this is an inexpensive, reliable, and well-made burner that works great in the outdoors. If simmering or low-flame performance is a must for you, I might pass on this stove. Otherwise, it performs well at a low cost.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2A3XAXJ397PHT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0009PUR5E#wasThisHelpful","R2A3XAXJ397PHT","AU7O296O6PXZM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AU7O296O6PXZM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This review refers to the chili mac variety. For shelf stable backpacking food, you could do a lot worse.  Just add 2 cups boiling water, stir, and wait 8-9 minutes.  For the most part, the product reconstitutes well and you can't tell it was freeze dried.  I find that lots of stirring is the key to making sure all the product reconstitutes as it should and there are no crunchy bits.  The meal was tasty enough that I didn't mind eating it at home, which means it's going to be very popular after a long day on the trail.  I also tried the beef stroganoff version and found it pretty tasty, if perhaps a little heavy on noodles and light on beef.As far as portion size, one pouch will feed two people who aren't very hungry, or one who is.  An adult male who's been hiking all day will probably want his own pouch.  For what it's worth, these meals really stand out for backpacking because of their very light weight, durability, and the fact that they leave no dirty dishes behind.  If I were car camping with a big cooler and weight was not a concern, I wouldn't buy freeze dried meals since you could make more tasty dishes with ""real"" food.

"I've found this to be a good quality hammock stand for the money.  Having a 10 foot hammock, I originally bought both the 12' version of this stand, but found it to be a bit too small and almost unworkable for a 10' hammock.  I returned the smaller stand and replaced it with this one.  The 15' stand is more substantial in every respect and has a higher weight rating.  It is really built for 2 people, whereas the 12' version seems built for one.  If you're uncertain which to get, choose the larger stand.  It's easy to manage a stand that's a bit too large for your hammock, but very difficult make a too small stand work properly.  I was also pleasantly surprised that the stand will easily break apart for transportation or storage.I would agree with other reviewers that Algoma ships this stand in a box that's too flimsy considering its considerable weight.  My stand arrived with the box all torn up, but the stand was undamaged except for one broken plastic end cap.  All in all, this is a good stand that I believe will hold up to regular outdoor use.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1OA5F014HG7QT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007FE5KXG#wasThisHelpful","R1OA5F014HG7QT","AU7O296O6PXZM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AU7O296O6PXZM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This film gives basic information about the early US and Soviet space programs, but it perpetuates old conspiracy theories that are now discredited.  For example, the film claims that Vladimir Ilyushin preceded Yuri Gagarin into space, but was so injured during the mission that his flight was kept secret.  Though that might have been a plausible theory decades ago when the Soviet program was shrouded in secrecy, we now know a lot about the early cosmonauts, including the ones who were injured or killed. Ilyushin isn't among them, and there is no evidence that this supposed flight ever happened. I suspect this film was originally produced years ago during the Cold War, then recycled recently for digital distribution. That could account for some of the egregious errors this film contains.  Bottom line, the film has some interesting footage from the dawn of the space age, but take the commentary with a very large grain of salt.","2.0 out of 5 stars","April 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1A01W8KCJ7OA2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00I6H7RVE#wasThisHelpful","R1A01W8KCJ7OA2","AU7O296O6PXZM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AU7O296O6PXZM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Unboxing this bag, I was impressed with the quality and materials.  I love the size of the bag and the feel of the fabrics. It seems to be very well made and I love that this isn't a confining mummy bag. The bag is soft and comfortable, but it's also a pretty thin bag that's not very lofty.  Down is expensive and Kelty certainly didn't use any more than it had to. The lack of loft doesn't bother me too much, as long as the bag is warm.I have taken it camping only once, on a night where the low was about 45, and had mixed results. I was sleeping in a tent with a polyethelene tarp underneath for a ground cloth.  I also had a cheap inflatable mattress underneath that's about 3"" thick but provides no insulation other than air.  Around midnight I felt cold coming from the ground in the spots where the down was compressed, like under my bottom.  When I first felt the cold spots, I checked the temperature: 48 degrees.  Those cold spots were present until I stuffed some clothes under the bag for extra insulation. During the night I never felt cold coming from the top of the bag or the foot area, just underneath where the down was compressed.Based on my one experience, I have mixed feelings about this bag.  My theory is that if you slept on a good insulator (like a thermarest foam pad), this bag might keep you warm to its rated temperature. However, if you throw this bag onto the cold ground, you're probably going to get cold long before the thermometer reaches 30. I'm tempted to return it and look for a bag with more fill, but it's not terribly easy to find down rectangle bags. I will probably give it one more go with a good pad and see how it performs. I will update my review after I've done so.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1KV1THGXGN8SD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004H8TL24#wasThisHelpful","R1KV1THGXGN8SD","AU7O296O6PXZM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AU7O296O6PXZM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These spoons are made from heavy stainless steel, not the thin metal you'll find in many big box stores. Each spoon is made from a single metal blank, so there's no weld between handle and spoon. I expect these to be quite durable. They would be right at home in a commercial kitchen.  There is little smoothing to the edges, so the spoons feel slightly rough in the hand. I have no issue with the finish, but if you expect a very smooth feel you might want to look elsewhere.  If you're the handy type, I think a few minutes of polishing with sandpaper would improve these spoons. A solid set and good value.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RKRZWXW5KMGLK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001PZ7I2M#wasThisHelpful","RKRZWXW5KMGLK","AU7O296O6PXZM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AU7O296O6PXZM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I decided to try this spork in an effort to reduce my pack weight for backpacking. Having used it several times now, I am sold.  The TOAKS spork functions very well and feels like you're eating with a normal utensil, not a specialty utensil that's awkward.  It is also quite strong and weighs almost nothing.  The tines work well for picking up food in fork mode, though retention on any spork isn't quite as good as a real fork.  I have no problems stabbing myself with the tines while eating, as you can do on some sporks.  I prefer this to plastic sporks (Light My Fire, etc), because barring some heroic effort, you're not going to break this one.  The length is also good and the metal is very well finished.  I also enjoy the simplicity of packing only one eating utensil on any trip.I recently got a chance to compare this spork to the Snow Peak titanium spork. Overall, both are good utensils. The spoon is slightly larger on the Snow Peak, and the tines are a little longer and more prominent. Advantage, Snow Peak. But, the Toaks spork has a larger handle that is textured, which improves grip and feels better in the hand. Advantage, Toaks. (See the photo I uploaded). Both seem very strong, so it really comes down to personal choice. After having used both, I still prefer the Toaks spork.  It comes pretty close to spork perfection. Five stars, recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RBKWFUVRSBEJC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009AO19MK#wasThisHelpful","RBKWFUVRSBEJC","AU7O296O6PXZM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AU7O296O6PXZM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"First off, accurate specs are hard to come by on the 96 oz. bottle.  Mine weighs in at exactly 2.9 ounces.  For comparison, a conventional 1 quart (32 oz) Nalgene bottle weighs 6.2 ounces.  So this bottle carries 3 times the water for less than half the weight.  Impressive.So far, I have found these bags to be tough and reliable. I love the wide mouth setup and the fact that the bottle collapses as needed.  The 96 ounce size is probably overkill for the average hiker, but I like having the capability to carry a large quantity of water without having to carry a heavy container.  It's also handy for filling up in the evenings for camp use. At some point I'll probably pick up the 48 oz. bottle too, for shorter excursions. At any rate, it's a good product.

"I had originally considered a $50 name brand hammock, until I came across this cheap hammock with good reviews.  I ordered the base hammock for ten bucks without the tree hardware.  These kinds of hammocks are pretty simple in construction, and my initial impressions are quite good. The hammock seems well made, and easily packs up tightly in a small stuff sack sewn into the side.  Fabric is thin but feels strong.  It feels silky, like parachute material.  There are no tags on the hammock showing the actual fabric or fabric weight.  There is single stitching along the sides of the hammock, and triple stitching on the ends that bear weight.Speaking of weight, specs are pretty hard to find on this item.  My complete hammock in the pouch weighs exactly 14.4 ounces.  That includes two heavy steel carbiners on each end that weigh 1.4 ounces each.  Backpackers who are serious about weight reduction could replace the steel hardware with rope and shave another couple ounces off.  (See the photos I uploaded for a better idea of how the hammock is made).Overall, I believe this hammock is a bargain.  I saw a very similar hammock on the shelf at Wal-mart this week for $25 plus tax, and the $50+ hammocks I've seen on Amazon are very similar.  For the price, it's a no  brainer.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3QRUVIP82TI08/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00E1O96LA#wasThisHelpful","R3QRUVIP82TI08","AU7O296O6PXZM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AU7O296O6PXZM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've found Lifestraw to be a very good product that has changed the way I hike.  I can now hike long distances without having to carry large quantities of water.  Last weekend, I hiked all day and never carried more than 16 oz. of water with me.  The rest of the day I used my Lifestraw to drink from creeks and streams.  Obviously, this only works in areas where I know there will be natural water sources, but most places I hike fit the bill.  This is both a convenience and a big weight savings.  The product is ridiculously easy to use and it doesn't use charcoal, so there's nothing to leech into the water.For what it's worth, it's easier to drink out of a container than to lie on the ground over a stream, so I usually pack along a disposable red Solo cup that weighs nearly nothing.  Fill up the cup with creek water, and use the straw to drink from the cup.The one shortcoming of lifestraw is the word ""personal"" in the name.  There is no way to filter water into a container other than your mouth.  You can store dirty water in a bottle and filter it as needed for drinking, but if you need to filter water for food or some other purpose, you're pretty much out of luck.  If that's a requirement for you, I would consider the Sawyer Mini water filter, which costs about the same as Lifestraw.  The Sawyer is similar in concept, but has a bit more flexibility.A very good product that I recommend.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2LFB2H08DJOMO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006QF3TW4#wasThisHelpful","R2LFB2H08DJOMO","AU7O296O6PXZM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AU7O296O6PXZM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I bought this bed just over three years ago.  It has been a great purchase.  It is quite comfortable, and has been trouble free.  During that time it has had moderate use.  We have had guests sleep on it at home, have taken it on trips where we were a bed short, and have loaned it out for friends' trips to the beach.  It has gained the reputation of being more comfortable than hotel and condo beds.  Over the fall we took it camping for the first time, and I slept far more comfortably than any previous camping trip. The bed lost only a small amount of air over two full nights loaded with two adults.  The built in pump is probably the best feature.  Just flip a switch and the mattress will inflate or deflate. Even with a slow leak, the mattress would be pretty usable considering the ease of adding extra air.  Obviously any air mattress can develop leaks and some people will get a bad mattress.  But considering how comfortable it is and Amazon's easy returns, I have no problem recommending it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 1, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R6166EKNHKZFC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000M0MJU2#wasThisHelpful","R6166EKNHKZFC","AU7O296O6PXZM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AU7O296O6PXZM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Emits enough light to navigate a medium sized room with no other light source.  The automatic on/off switch works fairly well, though it may stay on in low to medium light conditions.  It is also fairly green, consuming about 90% less energy than a traditional night light with an incandescent bulb.

Good for travelers who might wake up in unfamiliar surroundings but don't want the room illuminated.  The very low power consumption (.25 watts) is a good feature.

"Overall, this is a great, inexpensive item.  The mallet is appropriately heavy and does a great job on steaks.  Unlike the metal tenderizers, it is also dishwasher safe, so you can throw it into the machine and not worry about the finish falling off.  (I chose this one because like the idea of having a mallet that can be easily sanitized after coming in contact with raw meat.)  Feels sturdy and quite heavy, as it should be.  As a very amateur grillmaster, I've long been curious why cheap cuts of steak at restaurants are always juicy and tender, while the ones I grill at home emerge with all the tenderness of an old boot.  Marinades and tenderizers didn't help much, but now I think I've figured it out.  I used this mallet for the first time this week, and my steaks came off the grill noticeably more tender and juicy than before. Simply cover your steaks with cling wrap on both sides and give them a good whacking with the flat side of the mallet.  Then marinade as you like and proceed as usual.  I think you'll notice the difference.  Five stars for an inexpensive but eminently useful kitchen tool.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 5, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZWW3VSG038AF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000066OJD#wasThisHelpful","RZWW3VSG038AF","AU7O296O6PXZM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AU7O296O6PXZM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The blade is very effective against briars and other tough vines.  It should be noted that this attachment does not cut ordinary grass particularly well.  You're better off using the normal string head for that.  But for heavy work, it does the job admirably.  I find that it will take down small trees up to about .75"" to 1 inch diameter with ease. This is not an attachment to use near fences or other objects you intend to leave undamaged.  The action is not unlike a circular saw.

"Pouring a walkmaker sidewalk looks like a very easy project, but don't forget that mixing hundreds of pounds of concrete will always involve a good deal of work.  I'm fairly happy with my results, but I wish I'd known a few things before I began the project.  Here are a few tips.First, the mold is available off the shelf at some Lowe's stores for a lower price.  I was able to check availability on their website.  It seems some stores carry it and others don't.Second, the mold will not accept 80 pounds of concrete as recommended.  I bought 60 pound bags(cheaper) and then added 1/3 of another 60 lb. bag to get up to 80 pounds.  When I was finished pouring 4 molds, I was surprised to find that I had used only about 60 lbs of mix per mold. It never hurts to have an extra bag lying around if you run short, but I would use 60 lb. bags.  The 60 lb. bags are also plenty heavy without adding another 20 pounds.Don't be afraid to use a bit more water than is recommended.  I used the minimum amount of water and the mix was dry and hard to work with.  In retrospect, I should have added more water. About 3 quarts per 60 lb. bag works well and is still within Quikrete's guidelines.When pouring, it is very easy to spill new concrete onto the adjoining mold that you've just finished.  You learn to fill subsequent molds very carefully to avoid this problem.  One reviewer here recommended spraying the mold with cooking spray to avoid sticking.  I did that before I began my first pour, and I found it worked great.  Even after working with the mold for over 3 hours, the cooking spray remained.  Pulling the mold up after filling was very simple.One word about the Quikrete cement color.  You can use somewhat less coloring agent if you like.  I divided one bottle among four 60lb bags (not two as instructed) and while the end result is more gray than black, I am happy with my results. (Charcoal color).  I used a 1/4 cup measuring cup to get the same amount in each batch, and still had some color agent left over at the end.  It's your walkway, so don't hesitate to experiment.This is a project where you'll get better as you go.  If you are doing multiple pours, do your first mold someplace where imperfections will be less obvious.  I'd practice once behind the shed before I poured next to the front door.I should note that using this form alone results not in a sidewalk, but in a series of individual pavers. I assumed the ""stones"" would connect.  They do not, though one person who commented on this review says there is a way to connect them.  (See comments).  If you don't follow that second step, grass will crop up between the stones and they can also lay unevenly when the ground settles.  It took about two weeks for grass to appear in my walk.  The walkmaker is an inexpensive alternative to a poured sidewalk.  But as such, it is definitely a compromise.Finally, don't forget to water cure your new concrete when finished.  Quikrete says the surface should be sprayed with water for 5-7 days to achieve full strength. Covering the walk with a tarp or plastic sheet also helps to keep moisture in while it cures.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 26, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3MOQ5I3BSKTXF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00002N8SO#wasThisHelpful","R3MOQ5I3BSKTXF","AU7O296O6PXZM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AU7O296O6PXZM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"For the price, I'm quite pleased with this necklace.  I'm always suspicious of jewelry ordered online, but with Amazon I knew I could return it if the quality was poor.  When it arrived I inspected it with a jeweler's loupe and couldn't really find any substantial flaws. The pendant is beautiful, large, clear and sparkly.  To my untrained eye it looks more like real jewelry and less like costume jewelry.  The wife also seemed impressed, which is really all that matters. The chain is just adequate, but at this price level that's what I expected.  For what it's worth, the back of the pendant is very rounded, so it does tend to turn slightly to the side.  Not a big deal, but something to be aware of.  If you need a better idea of scale, see the customer image I submitted to Amazon.  The pendant appears about the size of a quarter.

"I picked up this vacuum over two years ago at my local Walmart for 46 bucks.  Although there were few reviews on Amazon at the time, the other store's website has over 500 user reviews that are mostly positive.  For the minimal price paid, it's been a really good vacuum. It is better constructed than I would expect, and I am very pleased with the job it's done on my carpets. It uses no bags, a long-term money saver.  You can see the collected dirt swirling in the transparent collection chamber as you vacuum. My old vacuum would clog up frequently, so it's nice to be able to see the unit working without stopping and removing a bag.  One possible downside to this system is the fact that you must clean the washable filters on this vacuum for it to work properly.  I count 4 filters, so you will need to spend some time maintaining this vacuum.My only real complaint is that the handle seems slightly short. It feels as if I have to reach a little farther than I do with other models.  This could just be my perception, and it doesn't pose a major problem.  If I were six feet tall or more, I would want to compare this vacuum's physical height to others before buying. My vacuum came with a one year warranty from Bissell, which is more than you'll find on a lot of consumer products.  No, it's not a Dyson, but for a budget vacuum it does a good job.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 17, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/RLPO83QJIVLG4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004RD0L64#wasThisHelpful","RLPO83QJIVLG4","AU7O296O6PXZM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AU7O296O6PXZM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"First of all, looking through the reviews and comments, it is fairly apparent that the author monitors the reviews of this book and upvotes/downvotes legitimate reviews posted here in order to support sales of his book.  I recommend reading through all the reviews here before making a purchase decision and take the ""helpful"" vote with a grain of salt on this title.This self-published ""book"" contains surprisingly little real content, for a book described as 148 pages.  Chapter 1 begins on page 17 and the last chapter ends on page 93.  Describing 76 actual pages as 148 is a real stretch.  The 76 actual pages are printed in huge typeface that reminds me of a large print edition for the visually impaired.

About 20 pages of the book are nothing more than the same form (of very dubious value) duplicated over and over again.  Really?  Was the goal of this book to reduce stress on the local copy machine?

Those expecting a full length book for their money will be disappointed by these shenanigans.From a more practical standpoint, my experience in the industry convinces me that most people need professional representation when applying for Social Security disability, especially in cases that are denied at the initial level and later proceed to the hearing level.  If you do decide to represent yourself, there are lots of websites dedicated to SSDI that cover this material in much greater detail with more current information, at no charge. Disability Secrets, published by NOLO, is one very useful website, though there are many others.","2.0 out of 5 stars","January 27, 2010","http://www.amazon.com/review/RC9W0Z8TZNOV6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0595125743#wasThisHelpful","RC9W0Z8TZNOV6","AU7O296O6PXZM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AU7O296O6PXZM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"One reviewer advises not to use screens because the pizza will stick and then is ruined, etc. Not so. Screens are a great way to bake pizza, as evidenced by the fact that most major pizza chains use them. Your local Domino's or Papa Johns cooks dozens (sometimes hundreds) of pizzas per hour on screens.  If they all stuck they wouldn't be in business long.  Screens stick very rarely when prepped properly.A new screen has to be coated in cooking spray and baked in a hot oven several times before it is ready for use.  The more you treat a screen before first use, the less problem you will have once you start baking pizza.  It's a bit of an inconvenience with new screens, but it only has to be done once.After a few treatments, the cooking spray will bake on and the screen will start to turn a coppery brown color.  When you get this dark coloration on the aluminum, the screen is ready for use.  The screen should come with prep instructions.  It's also best not to wash screens, as this can lead to sticking.  Pizza places don't wash screens.  You can dust the screen with a brush to remove crumbs, etc, then bake it in an oven to sanitize the surface.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 1, 2009","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1BJ819S3TETTU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000638HWY#wasThisHelpful","R1BJ819S3TETTU","AU7O296O6PXZM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AU7O296O6PXZM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought this humidifer about three years ago at Walgreens, which carries the identical Sunbeam unit labeled with their store brand.  This unit is very inexpensive, requires no filter, and I've had great results with it. It will literally blow a cloud of steam four feet into the air, which is much better than most other humidifers I've tried.  That said, it is important to note that these units are a little finicky.  They will often require a pinch of salt be added to the water in order to produce steam, especially for the first couple uses.  Also, the unit will last longer if the heating element is removed from the water when not in use.  The vaporizer has metal plates that extend into the water tank and heat up to boil water into steam.  Over time the plates can rust and eventually the unit will fail.  Allowing the plates to dry out when not in use should reduce their tendency to rust somewhat.  I have mine for several years and it still works great. I love mine, especially compared to others out there I've tried.  A big help during both flu and allergy seasons.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 1, 2009","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1VJ7NPMSCV9WK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001CTU5BC#wasThisHelpful","R1VJ7NPMSCV9WK","AU7O296O6PXZM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AU7O296O6PXZM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Before buying this new Venture HC, I had spent many hours trekking with several of the original eTrex models over the years.  I think it's fair to say that while the concept of the original eTrex was great, the execution was frequently disappointing.It disappoints no more.  The Venture HC is the eTrex perfected.  It remedies almost every shortcoming that plagued the original models.  The new high-sensitivity receiver is amazingly effective.  Countless times I've stood in wide open spaces cursing my old eTrex because it wouldn't acquire a single satellite.  Last night I turned on the Venture HC on the bottom floor of my two story house, and it locked onto 8 satellites...through the roof and the upper floor!  No more ""need a clear view of the sky"" messages. Amazing.The old monochrome display has become color, and the user interface is now substantially more intuitive, while adding even more functionality. The cable, which was serial on previous models, has been upgraded to USB, another welcome improvement.  The case is somewhat wider than before, but the design bears a strong resemblance to the original eTrex.A basemap is included but it's just that - basic.  It shows the largest highways, bodies of water, and has some limited capability to display highway exit services.  If you need turn-by-turn street directions, an eTrex is not for you.  This is a GPS receiver true to Garmin's outdoor GPS heritage.Promised battery life (14 hours) is near the bottom of the range when compared to the existing eTrex models, but is still perfectly adequate and has posed no problems.One weakness that remains is Garmin's waypoint manager PC software.  It has the feel and functionality of a software product released circa 1994.  Garmin could certainly develop a better PC interface.  For $75 you can buy ExpertGPS from Topografix, or download the free version (EasyGPS) from their website. I use the free version and it meets my needs very well.  Either is far more functional than the Garmin OEM software.Still, the software criticism is a quibble.  The Venture HC itself is great.  It is a market changing product that renders all previous eTrex models (and many competitors) obsolete.  Finally, an affordable outdoor GPS receiver that I can wholeheartedly recommend.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 4, 2008","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2816LPXMQE5JV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000PDR230#wasThisHelpful","R2816LPXMQE5JV","AU7O296O6PXZM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AU7O296O6PXZM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've owned the original eTrex, two different eTrex Legends, and the high-sensitivity Venture HC.  This Legend adds some functionality to the old (basic) eTrex such as basic maps and longer waypoint names, but is obsolete when compared to Garmin's new high sensitivity eTrex models.The problem I have had with both my eTrex Legends is signal acquisition.  Both Legends have had a problem acquiring and keeping signal even in wide open places with a perfect view of the sky.  At times, it simply refuses to find any satellite at all.  At first, I thought I had a faulty unit.  But my second Legend has the exact same problem.  More than once I've had the Legend fail me at a crucial time when I really needed it to work. It's pretty frustrating. I never had this problem with the original eTrex, or the Venture HC.Overall, this has been a device that is great in concept, but very disappointing in reality.  I would strongly recommend skipping this unit and buying the eTrex Venture HC or another newer model with the high sensitivity receiver.  The HC has great signal performance, even in rough terrain.  It has a color screen, basemap, long name support, and sells for about the same price. I think you'll find the difference in performance to be night and day.","1.0 out of 5 stars","October 20, 2007","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2PHLSJDMS6MEI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000058BCQ#wasThisHelpful","R2PHLSJDMS6MEI","AU7O296O6PXZM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AU7O296O6PXZM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I received my frame today and have been playing with it a couple hours.  There seem to be a lot of widely divergent opinions here, so I'll attempt to bridge the gap between the two sides.  The frame is made of plastic, but is sufficiently attractive.  It does not have that inferior quality, sold-only-on-TV look.  It could be confused with wood from a distance, which is good.  The frame didn't immediately recognize my SD card, but I popped it out and then back in, and it worked fine.  The user interface is pretty clunky, but not so bad as to be infuriating like a cheap digital watch.  After a quick look at the user manual and five minutes playing with the frame, I could make it do what I wanted.The main area I was concerned about is picture quality.  The resolution is fairly low - 480 x 234, which is pretty standard at this price point.  This is a device clearly aimed at mainstream consumers - proud grandmas and the like.  If you are a camera snob you should probably look elsewhere.  This should be obvious, but it bears repeating.  Your images are *not* going to look as good as they do even on an LCD computer monitor.That said, most of my decent quality images look decent.  Keep in mind this is a 16:9 wide ratio display.  I put a couple images on the frame that were shot vertically, forcing the frame to shrink them substantially to make them fit.  These shots looked pretty bad, and I ended up deleting them from the memory card.  I also had one shot that was slightly out of focus.  It looks okay on my computer, but looked pretty bad on the frame.  Garbage in, garbage out definitely applies here.  If your pics are shot with an inferior camera or they have other flaws, their bad points will most likely be magnified by this frame.With the bad photos deleted, the ones I left on the frame ended up looking pretty good.  Just don't be surprised if you can't get all your images to look their best.  If you want your ""wow"" photos to wow others, you might want to spend a bit more money.  But if you start with good looking images and just want something to set on your desk at work, this should be adequate.  For the minimal price, I consider the frame good if not great; a reasonable choice for those with reasonable expectations.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 29, 2007","http://www.amazon.com/review/RG04ACS8TGGIG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000NRSWYQ#wasThisHelpful","RG04ACS8TGGIG","AU7O296O6PXZM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AU7O296O6PXZM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was aware of this film's poor reviews going in, but it's George Clooney - how bad can it be?  Well, pretty bad.  I could forgive the self-righteousness of this film, but not the mess that is the screenplay.  I spent the first hour wondering when the disjointed plot elements would come together, and the second half realizing they probably never would.  To compare this movie to Traffic is a flattery it does not deserve.  Basically what you get is a rather confused propaganda piece that can be summed up this way:  US government: bad.  Oil companies:  extra, extra bad.  Clearly, Mr. Clooney the politician got ahead of Mr. Clooney the actor on this one.","2.0 out of 5 stars","September 12, 2006","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3VOP0ROT0GB4H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000F7CMRM#wasThisHelpful","R3VOP0ROT0GB4H","AU7O296O6PXZM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AU7O296O6PXZM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I heard Taubman touting Secret Empire on NPR and was expecting a really good book. Nevertheless, the book disappointed me.  Although it does contain some useful background material on US reconnaissance efforts in the 1950s, I thought the book contained perhaps one hundred pages of interesting material interspersed with over three hundred pages of dull banter about bureaucratic turf battles, tedious personnel background info, and other tiresome and uninteresting detail.  Oddly, what I felt were the most compelling stories often got short shrift. The development of the SR-71 Blackbird, for example, merits only a couple pages.  The U2 spy plane's remarkable operations over Cuba received only a brief mention.  I find it unseemly that this book would skip over the most remarkable parts of U.S. spy activity in those years.I was also caught off guard by the non-chronological format of the book. Taubman will spend an entire chapter discussing the United States' utter inability to get a reconnaissance satellite into orbit, then a few pages later he will jump to another subject in another decade, casually referring to an entire constellation of advanced US spy satellites.  Wait, where did those come from?  I couldn't help but think that the subjects were portrayed in a hit or miss fashion, and perhaps I had missed the best parts.Finally, the terrorism add-on at the end of the book seems like a half-hearted attempt to make the book more relevant in the post 9/11 world.","2.0 out of 5 stars","January 12, 2005","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3FGMMKPCSJAGP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0684856999#wasThisHelpful","R3FGMMKPCSJAGP","AU7O296O6PXZM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AU7O296O6PXZM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"A must read on how and when America turned left and the slow creep to socialism that is reaching fruition today. As mentioned in the book, it was remarked by One Republican movie producer that sadly, ""I guess we started something in 1934."" Indeed, this campaign (1934 Governors election) inspired a liberal turn in the movie industry, seemingly forever."" And The New York Times called it ""the first serious movement against the profit system in the United States."" it would appear that Hollywood is for the socialist left as TASS is for Putin or Xinhua News for China.

"This stuff is great! I have been using Dr Bronners for a while now and I decided to try a less expensive alternative. The only downside to Nubian body wash is that not all of the ingredients are fair trade certified organic, but quite a few are. The upside is that it has a very lasting lather, a little bit goes a really long way, so the 13 ounce bottle lasts a lot longer than 13 ounces of Bronners or any other competing brand that I've tried for that matter. Another benefit would be the scent. It smells good and leaves you smelling good for a few hours after showering. That's always a plus. It also doesn't leave the skin dry, the oils inside leave the skin moisturized and radiant. It's good stuff.

"If I could give this dog bed 100 stars, I would. This is hands down the best quality dog bed I've ever experienced. If I had it my way, my 105lb pit bull would be on the bed right next to me, but unfortunately my fiance is really allergic and she makes him stay in his own bed in the corner of the room. I told myself, fine... If she's going to make him stay in his own bed, the least I could do is make sure his bed was top of the line. I tried two other brands of dog beds (also purchased here in Amazon) which ended up being a horrible disappointment. They were cheaply made and didn't last very long at all. This bed arrived and from day one my dog has been in love. Finally I don't have to feel so bad about making him stay off our bed anymore. I also got the pillow topper. It helps keep the bed protected (will ensure it has a very long life) and of course I lay blankets down for comfort and further protection as well. But the bottom line is - your dog is going to fall in love with this bed. For the price you aren't going to find anything else like it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R324MWVZ5EHKUS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001E3RPKK#wasThisHelpful","R324MWVZ5EHKUS","A3GTIBV31D3ITB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3GTIBV31D3ITB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My all time favorite from the Amy's organic soup line. Last year I ordered around 20 twelve pack cases of Amy's Organic and although they are indisputably all delicious and savory, this one is the best by a long shot. My other go-to's would be the Thai Coconut Soup, No-Chicken Noodle Soup, and the Indian Dal Curried Lentil Soup... I like my curry spicy though so I always add some chilli's and some himalyan salt and kick it up a notch. All around, I am quite thankful to have Amy's in my kitchen. All of their food is wonderful and what it stands for is something you really have to appreciate - non GMO - low sodium - low cholesterol - a 10x healthier alternative to anything you'll find at the grocery store.

"Okay, the cover is comfy, but my dog ripped a hole in it in no time, and the foam underneath is cheap and impossible to clean. You can get the cover off to throw it in the wash, but DON'T DRY IT! If you put it in the dryer it will shrink and it will not fit back on the dog bed. I purchased two of these, one for the bedroom, and one for my office. Both of them lasted about 3 months until they were completely destroyed. I ordered two dog beds from Dog Beds 4 Less on here, they are thick solid memory foam pads with two heavy duty covers, a water proof cover and a micro suede exterior cover. My dog loves them, they're easy to wash/clean and you can dry the covers without them shrinking. A little more expensive but sometimes you really do get what you pay for.

"This is a very amusing and enjoyable Nero Wolfe novel in which the fat detective is asked by a board of publishers to investigate a case of what he calls ""plagiarism in reverse."" That is, instead of unknown authors stealing from well-known authors, it's four well-known authors who are accused, one at a time, of stealing from unknown authors. Though the famous authors deny it, the facts make it look as if they did it.Wolfe studies the plagiarized manuscripts and concludes, from style and syntax, that they were all written by the same person. He also tries to bribe each of the four unknown authors (who successfully sued for damages) to reveal who put them up to this. The result: a first murder, a second murder, and a third murder. Wolfe is so upset by the murders that are a result of his ""bungling"" the case that he refuses to drink any more beer until he solves everything. Fritz is distraught, but Nero is adamant (about the beer).A wonderful read.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 3, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3AF2DSDA814G2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004SOQ11G#wasThisHelpful","R3AF2DSDA814G2","A232HUAELH5J6V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A232HUAELH5J6V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book does not live up to its title. It's not so much about HOW to write a poem, but rather about WHERE poems come from -- which part of our life experiences do we remember and tap into in order to produce poetry. So if you're expecting this to be about HOW, you will be disappointed. Prelutsky writes perhaps twenty chapters about his personal experiences, and after each chapter is the poem that came from that experience. Included in this mix are sidebars called Writing Tips that define things such as ""Voice"" or ""Rhythm."" The poems might be funny if presented alone, but when they come after a chapter that details the experience, the poems seem flat. What might have been funny if it was fresh is no longer funny. Still, teachers might want to use portions of this book to encourage students to write poetry.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 2, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R30FU79Z7CRS4W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0061434485#wasThisHelpful","R30FU79Z7CRS4W","A232HUAELH5J6V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A232HUAELH5J6V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Unfortunately, I had an extremely difficult, almost impossible, time reading this book for the simple reason that I could not believe the events that occurred, starting with the fact that the Montreal police simply let Dr. Tempe Brennan, forensic anthropologist (as well as a ""foreigner"" from North Carolina, USA), attend the scenes of crimes as if she were a member of the police force.

"In this, the fifth Cadfael novel, the beautiful and wealthy Iveta de Massard, who loves a young squire named Joscelin Lucy, is forced into an arranged marriage with the old and cruel Huon de Domville. But before the marriage can take place, Domville is murdered: strangled to death by a man who wore a ring. Cadfael recognizes the marks of a ring on the neck of Domville. Joscelin is accused, but, as is typical in a Cadfael novel, is arrested, escapes, is hidden by those sympathetic to his cause, tries to flee with Iveta, and is caught again. Then Iveta's legal guardian is strangled. This time Cadfael notices that the strangler was missing a few fingers, and that reveals to him who the murderer was.

"First, I enjoyed this novel very much: I think it's one of Smith's finest. Second, I found myself asking, ""What Limpopo Academy of Private Detection? There's no Limpopo Academy of Private Detection in this book."" I asked myself that question about a third of the way through the book, half way through, three-quarters of the way through . . . why did this book bear the title it has? Finally, in perhaps the last 10 percent of the story, we're given the answer.And the answer, I think, indicates that Smith will either end the series as it now stands, or send it off in an entirely new direction. He seems to have gone as far as he can with Mma Ramotswe and Mma Makutsi and their spouses and families and friends. All seem comfortable in their lives, and, truth be told, the ""mystery"" part of the series dwindles more and more into simple and somewhat obvious underhanded dealings and dishonesties. The characters and the setting, however, are so awesome and inspiring that the lack of any traditional mystery can be overlooked. I'm eager to see if my anticipation is correct . . . or if Smith deliberately planted these hints but intends to ignore them.In any case, the story involves dishonest building contractors, Mma Potokwane of the orphanage, a new house for Grace and Phuti, Charlie and Fanwell, incompetent lawyers, the appearance of Clovis Andersen, and much, much more. And it all flows smoothly and effortlessly. So sit back in y our favorite chair with a cup of your favorite tea and delight in another book in this wonderful series.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 26, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3E18EKAC6Y3TX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0307378403#wasThisHelpful","R3E18EKAC6Y3TX","A232HUAELH5J6V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A232HUAELH5J6V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This was an unexpected delight of a film. It starts with Jeff, who lives ""at home"" with his mother, apparently in the basement flat, receiving a wrong-number phone call. The phone rings and Jeff, stoned on marijuana, answers. The caller asks for Kevin. So it's a wrong number, right? Not from Jeff's point of view. He sees this as a call from Destiny, and so he starts looking for the cosmic connection. The first Kevin he encounters robs him. The second Kevin unknowingly leads him to an encounter that will change his (Jeff's) brother's life. For the better. Throughout, Jeff's brother Pat and Jeff's mother either subtly or overtly dismiss  Jeff, particularly since he ""lives at home"" and is not, in their eyes, a fully functioning, responsible adult.But as it turns out, living at home means listening: being in touch with your ""home"" -- your core self, your core values. By listening to messages (from other people, from the universe), Jeff behaves as a good person would. At the end, he meets the Kevin that Destiny led him to, and that meeting is a life-saving event. For all concerned.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 25, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R117TD41OAPVLJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007L6VPL4#wasThisHelpful","R117TD41OAPVLJ","A232HUAELH5J6V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A232HUAELH5J6V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"While I enjoyed reading this book and learning about what it is exactly that fact checkers do, and how they do it, I was also made a bit nervous by the amount of detail that fact checkers must check. That's my problem, of course, not theirs: apparently fact checkers love checking facts.The one weakness this book has is that nowhere is the reader given any idea of how long it might take to fact check, say, a 5,000 word article. After reading this book I have no idea whether a fact checker working on an article needs one day, three, four weeks, or more to check an article. Does a fact checker work on several articles at once? It would have been very good for the author to reproduce a double-spaced typed manuscript with a fact checker's notations on each page: this would give the reader a very clear idea of how things work.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 23, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3O594HFLO3HNH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385721064#wasThisHelpful","R3O594HFLO3HNH","A232HUAELH5J6V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A232HUAELH5J6V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I encourage people to read this book because of the importance of the topic (mass murders in exploited nations, in this case Nigeria, so that oil corporations can lay claim to the land occupied by villages) and the power of Little Bee's Voice. The story is told in alternate chapters: first Little Bee, a sixteen-year-old Nigerian refugee who has been kept in a British detention center for two years; then Sarah, a 30-something editor of a women's magazine who, with her husband Andrew encountered Little Bee on a Nigerian beach two years earlier.The chapters from Little Bee's point of view are engrossing. She is a person who has encountered brutality and horror but has survived. The chapter's from Sarah's point of view are less convincing. She has a very limited range of emotions: usually she sits with tears streaming down her face. When it comes to her husband and her lover, and her husband's death, she behaves abnormally, without common sense it seems. At some point her behavior seems to be nothing more than a plot device, particularly with the trip to London and everything that happens afterwards.Little Bee is very intelligent: I'm not sure she would make the phone call. From the London scene onward, the ending of the book meanders and dissipates, particularly in the final Nigerian scenes.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 21, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RXC6Y26D4RGA1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1416589643#wasThisHelpful","RXC6Y26D4RGA1","A232HUAELH5J6V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A232HUAELH5J6V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I read a review of this book somewhere and decided I'd give the book a try: I like action, I like strong heroes (especially strong female heroes), and while I prefer mystery to slam-bam action, I don't mind if the two appear in some combination. Still, even though I bought the book, I thought I might be disappointed: oftentimes the action element dominates to the exclusion of rational thought. However, this isn't the case with Riot Act, which turned out to be a good mystery-action novel with a strong female hero, Charlie Fox, ex British secret service. The plot is complex, and I like that.

This, the third, struck me as a bit less memorable than the others, but I still very much enjoyed it and would probably rank it 4.5 stars if Amazon allowed for such rankings. In this book Croft is asked to take on the ""missing persons"" case in which a woman has disappeared with her child. The woman is the ex-wife of a Hollywood star, and she had accused him of child molestation. A court found the star not guilty, which is when the woman and child disappeared. The ex-husband wants Croft to find the missing pair, but Croft won't work for him.Croft does, however, decide to work for the star's uncle, a member of the crime scene in Santa Fe -- that is, a member of the criminal side of that scene. As Croft and his boss, Rita Montdragon, investigate, the case broadens to include assassinations, undercover feds, and illegal immigration.

Greenblatt takes the reader on a tour of 15th century monasteries, the papacy, Lucretius's philosophy, Greek and Roman art and thought, the Inquisition, and the intolerance of Christianity as a religion (although he never calls it intolerance).

"In this Nero Wolfe mystery, written near the end of the 1950s, Stout returns to his best writing (as exemplified by some of his earlier Wolfe novels, such as Some Buried Caesar and Too Many Cooks). In this book Archie must attend a party for six unwed mothers, one of whom, Faith Usher, carries around a vial of cyanide just in case she feels like committing suicide. During the evening, Faith dies: poisoned by cyanide in her champagne. Was it suicide? No, says Archie, who had been keeping his eye on Faith and her drink and her behavior the entire evening. Archie claims that nobody had any chance to put anything into Faith's champagne, and therefore she was murdered.The pressure for Archie to change his statement is intense. Pressure not just from those at the party, who don't want a scandal, but also from the police and the Police Commissioner. Archie won't back down, and Nero stands behind what Archie says. And then Edwin Laidlaw hires Wolfe to keep something from being revealed: that he was the father of Faith's child. So Nero promises to solve the murder case before the information about Laidlaw and Faith is revealed.A well-plotted story, with lots of Archie-Nero dialogue.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 15, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2HEBKH35LY19R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0553244388#wasThisHelpful","R2HEBKH35LY19R","A232HUAELH5J6V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A232HUAELH5J6V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've seen Jeff Stetson's one-act drama, The Meeting, which imagines a meeting between Malcolm X and Martin Luther King, two leaders with very different philosophies. It's an exciting play, a rapid, intense look at the issues facing these two African-American leaders during the 1960s. I didn't know about Stetson's novel, Blood on the Leaves, until I read about it in an article by a college professor who uses mysteries to teach social issues. So I bought Blood on the Leaves and read it.Here is the central question of the plot: should whites who committed crimes against blacks in the South during the years of the big civil rights struggles, and who were then acquitted by all-white juries even though some on those juries knew for a fact that the people on trial committed the crimes they were accused of -- should these whites be called to account decades later and brought to justice? In the novel, an African-American professor espouses that Yes, these people should be brought to justice. And then some of the whites start turning up dead. Murdered. And the professor is brought to trial for murder. And the man prosecuting -- not defending, but prosecuting -- the professor is black. The man defending him is white.A highly-charged, complex, gripping premise. But despite the gripping ideas, the story just wasn't exciting. It was slow. There seemed to be no building action, with things becoming more and more tense. Never at any point did I feel I was reading a mystery novel. I DID feel I was reading a book that wanted to raise and have readers think about important questions. I can understand why professors might use this novel to teach social issues: it's certainly more interesting than most, if not all, textbooks. But is it as interesting as a well-written mystery? I think not.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 14, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2I842VCJWM1VE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0446615927#wasThisHelpful","R2I842VCJWM1VE","A232HUAELH5J6V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A232HUAELH5J6V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I loved part of this book: the story of the 1893 Chicago World's Fair and architect Daniel Burnham, responsible for the design and construction of the ""white city."" I learned things about Chicago I never knew before. The nonfiction story was interesting and gripping and read almost like fiction, with a hero and a conflict and resolution.Sad, then, that the author felt he could improve this story by interweaving it with the story of murderer Dr. Holmes. You would think that the killer story would be more interesting than the architecture story, but it isn't. In fact, the killer story is so uninteresting that I almost stopped reading the book a couple of times. But wanting to know the entire story of the buildings and exhibitions of the World's Fair kept me going, and I'm glad they did.Recommended, with reservations: you will most likely strongly prefer one story over the other.

"I read this book when it first came out, and I've read it and re-read it in the years since: the story is wonderful, the illustrations are magnificent, and the writing draws you in. Or, I should say, it draws some people in. Others may have difficulty relating to or caring about a story told from the point of view of a giant meteorite -- 70,000 pounds of cold stone. I think children will not have any difficulty in relating to the meteorite, Ahnighito, because children have not yet lost the ability to imagine that objects have feelings.That is not to say that this is a weepy, sentimental book. Far from it: it's very informative, conveying to the reader the story of how long the meteorite waited there in the cold, snowy Arctic, and how many times its ""rescuers"" had to return. There's humor in the story, too, as when the ship carrying Ahnighito is underway, and the meteorite tells us: ""Once at sea, the men were upset with me because all the ship's compasses pointed at me and at nothing else.""This is an informative, interesting, beautifully-illustrated story that connects all living things.

"I'm not normally a fan of sci-fi or fantasy, but I do love reading about time-travel. I also love realism: kids (or adults) in common situations, learning how to act, taking steps that shape them into the people they become. When You Reach Me mixes sci-fi and realism. The realism comes from the basic story premise: 11-year-old Miranda lives in New York during the 1970s. Her mother is obsessed with becoming a contestant on a tv show, The $20,000 Pyramid, and spends meal times studying and practicing. In school, Miranda encounters the types of people we've all met in school: true friends, false friends, and classmates you just can't figure out. The friendship issues, as well as the true-false issues, drive the story forward.But so does the time-travel aspect of the plot. Miranda witnesses some seemingly weird actions on the sidewalk: she keeps encountering one particular homeless person who acts strangely. Then somebody starts leaving notes-- notes that Miranda does not understand. The first note reads, in part: ""I am coming to save your friend's life, and my own. I ask two favors. First, you must write me a letter . . . ."" Soon after, a pair of shoes are stolen from Miranda's apartment.This story is well written with believable kids in believable situations (except, of course, for the time travel). Of all the time-travel stories I've read, this is the only one that delves into the ""how"" of time travel. The ""how,"" coupled with the ""why,"" is especially poignant.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 11, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1H4TE5A4725JZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385737424#wasThisHelpful","R1H4TE5A4725JZ","A232HUAELH5J6V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A232HUAELH5J6V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I used to buy these books every year, for a long time. Now I check movie reviews online, on Amazon and Netflix and other such places. But I sometimes miss having one of these books around. I don't even know if they're still produced every year. As time went on, the yearly editions just got larger, and Larger, and LARGER, until, as another viewer pointed out, the books often broke in half at the spine. And as the years went by, the typesize was decreased so that more words could fit on a page. After a while, using these books ceased to be fun. But what I liked best of all about these yearly editions was that they were fun to BROWSE: I was introduced to many movies I had never heard of simply by browsing through this book and reading the descriptions.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 10, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R29N5P532SP8FO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0345449975#wasThisHelpful","R29N5P532SP8FO","A232HUAELH5J6V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A232HUAELH5J6V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Saint Peter's Fair, the fourth book in the Cadfael series, works well as a mystery. There's an initial murder, an initial arrest, then more murder. The story takes place during St. Peter's Fair, so the town and Shrewsbury Abbey are stuffed with visitors, tradespeople, and nobles. Meanwhile, the civil war between the forces of King Stephen and Empress Maud continues, and it looks as if Maud's support may be increasing in strength. The question of which nobles might or might not support her, either secretly or openly, is at the heart of this novel and at the heart of the murders.Although the book, like the town, is stuffed with characters,and sometimes it seems like there's too much of everything going on, the plot is relatively easy to follow, with just enough twists and complications to keep matters interesting, but not so many that the main thread is lost. However, as another reviewer pointed out, Cadfael doesn't seem to play as central a role in this book as he did in the others. In some ways, he's more of a reporter and observer of events than an active participant in them. Still, its his observations, especially about the rose petal on the floor, that lead him to make the right conclusions. Unlike in the previous novels, Cadfael reaches the right conclusions almost too late, and because of this an innocent person is injured. I like this plot element because in real life a hero is sometimes slow or late, so this makes Cadfael seem less infallible and more human. Recommended.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 9, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3BJ5MP5D9FU25/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002CMQR7Y#wasThisHelpful","R3BJ5MP5D9FU25","A232HUAELH5J6V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A232HUAELH5J6V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I own both this book and the first one, and I use both of them. The first  (The Deluxe Transitive Vampire) was funnier, and more fun to browse through. This one is shorter and easier to use, with clearer explanations. It's difficult for me to choose between them, which is why I keep both on my shelf. It's true that other grammar books are much, much bigger, covering all the grammar rules one can think of, and that a book as clever as this one might really be meant for people who already know the rules of punctuation.This book covers only punctuation, and that is one of its strong points: if you have a question about punctuation, this is the book to consult. Either this or the Chicago Manual of Style, which is about 10 times the size of The New Well-Tempered Sentence.

"I have an earlier edition of this book and use it often for the valuable information and examples within. However, as another reviewer stated, there seems to be no thought given to the organization of this book and, therefore, to the way one develops a story character. One does not, for example, start with Labels, proceed to Fleshing Out, and so on. I'm not sure how a writer does create a character, but I doubt it's done by jumping around in random fashion from one method of characterization to another. This book would be so much more valuable if there were some sort of organic flow from one chapter to another, from beginning to end. I vacillated between giving this book three stars and four stars and decided to go with four stars because of the valuable insights the book offers: but the reader has to search for them and dig them out and then reorganize them in some beginning-to-end fashion.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 5, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RYUUR1B1D6LC0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0806139188#wasThisHelpful","RYUUR1B1D6LC0","A232HUAELH5J6V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A232HUAELH5J6V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the first of the Rosemary Rowe books about mosaic-maker Libertus that I've read. I thoroughly enjoyed seeing ""London"" during Roman times: for me, the setting was the strongest element in the book, and I will read other Rowe novels in order to experience more of this setting. The plot, too, was interesting, involving the murder of Caius Monnius, the Roman magistrate in charge of grain distribution in Londinium. Rowe does an outstanding job bringing to life the grain storage areas and their administration. But if you find grain a bit boring, never fear: the story also involves chariot racing and the fixing of races. There are additional murders and intrigues. The solution is a classical ""rounding up of the suspects."" The character of Libertus is less vividly portrayed than are the others in the novel, and the writing is a bit wordy. But I enjoyed the book from beginning to end and plan to read more.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 4, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R7YF1W9JFQ4FD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0747265194#wasThisHelpful","R7YF1W9JFQ4FD","A232HUAELH5J6V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A232HUAELH5J6V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I found the book informative, well-organized, and easy to read. The first chapter introduces the people: the Pueblo tribes who have made pottery for hundreds of years. Next comes a chapter on the techniques of these potters. After that come separate chapters on the various pueblos, usually grouped: Taos and Picuris; Tewa; the Middle Rio Grande pueblos; then the Acoma, Laguna, and Zuni in one chapter; and, finally, the Hopi.

"This is the first P.C. Doherty novel I've read, and I must say that I thoroughly enjoyed the Medieval setting and the way it was rendered. At all times I had a sense of the cloaks used for warmth, the weapons, the buildings, the foods, the transportation. In many places I had to look up words (""frumenty,"" for example, and ""arbalest""), but that's to be expected in a book about Medieval times. I also enjoyed the fact that much of the plot was based on actual events: the theft of King Edward's treasures from Westminster, and the subsequent capture of the thieves.The plot kept me interested. I definitely wanted to know who the deadly archer was and why he was killing the people he chose to kill. I wanted to know what horrible crime Lord Scrope had committed at Acre, and even though it's pretty easy to guess what it was, the revelation was satisfying. When it comes to the unmasking of the killer, however, I was disappointed: the clues, if any, were so private to Hugh Corbett's observations that I couldn't go back and reconstruct who was where at what time. I wanted Corbett or Ranulf to list who was where, and discuss it. Even then, the identity of the killer seemed to come out of the blue. Further, Corbett demands to see the manor ledgers (household accounts) near the end of the book, studies them, and reaches some conclusion. What that conclusion is, we never know. It doesn't seem to figure into the solution at all.Two of P.C. Doherty's writing quirks (for lack of a better word) bothered me. Each time I encountered either of them, I felt myself leave the world of the book for an instance. The first of these quirks is that while Doherty keeps to the third-person-limited point of view, there are times when he's writing about Corbett and Corbett's two aides, Ranulf and Chanson, that the author simply switches from one point of view to another in the middle of a paragraph. We may start out in Corbett's mind in the first two sentences, then, Poof!, we're in the mind of Ranulf. Or Chanson.  The other writing quirk is that whenever any character in the book uses a Latin phrase, he or she immediately says it in English after the phrase, as when Edward tells Corbett: ""Look, Corbett, Scrope acted sine auctoritate -- without authority."" To read these translations this way, in dialogue, is disconcerting. It wouldn't happen in real life, because in real life Edward would know that Corbett knew what the Latin words meant, and he would not translate them into English.All in all, though, I enjoyed Nightshade sufficiently enough to want to read another in the series.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 2, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R250UM5XHSPW5J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0312678185#wasThisHelpful","R250UM5XHSPW5J","A232HUAELH5J6V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A232HUAELH5J6V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Even though I much prefer Stout's Nero Wolfe novels to the Nero Wolfe short stories, I enjoyed this shorter-than-usual batch of four. In the first, Wolfe plays Santa Claus because he thinks Archie is going to get married and leave him. Naturally a murder occurs -- and it looks as if the man playing Santa did it.In the second story, Wolfe goes to embarrassing lengths to procure black orchids that don't belong to him, and the result is murder. And it looks to the police as if an employee of Wolfe's (not Archie) committed the murder. If the police only knew that Wolfe was having the event filmed and has hidden the film from them, there would be even more trouble.The third story involves a Fourth of July picnic, Wolfe as the invited speaker, and somebody stabbed in the back while recovering from eating bad snails. The fourth story goes back to the French Resistance during World War II, the murder of traitors, a new life in New York City and then -- more murder.All told, short but satisfying.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 30, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RPVF697TGWXAC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0553249851#wasThisHelpful","RPVF697TGWXAC","A232HUAELH5J6V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A232HUAELH5J6V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a very good book, an inspiration to all aspiring poets and even to writers in general. In easy-to-read, humorous accounts of his life as a child, a student, and a professor of poetry, Skinner summarizes the ""6.5"" practices of, as he calls them, ""moderately successful poets."" That is: not geniuses, not off-the-scale talent, but ordinary people who, if they have a poetry flame inside, can nurture it and live by it. The 6.5 practices range from the first (and possibly the most important), which can be summarized as Protect Your Talent, to the last, Take the Long View.Each of the practices Skinner lists is of great importance to a writer, and each is presented in such a casual, just-talking kind of manner that the truth of what the author says shines through. His anecdotes, particularly the ones from his days as a security guard, are interesting and intriguing, even. But they're also a bit frustrating to read because in a few cases it seems as if more, not less, is called for. In the chapter on Makes Use, for example, we're given the story of Bobby the Ape (a man, not an ape), and although the story seems unrelated to anything that came before in the book or anything that comes after, it's clear that the story must be there as an example of a poet ""making use"" of everything that has happened to him or her, everything he or she has experienced. While as a reader I can intellectually understand that Jeffrey Skinner must have made use of the experience of knowing Bobby the Ape, I as a reader also yearn to see an example of HOW he made use of this material. Was it in an entire poem? A stanza? A line? A word choice, even? Surely the writer knows how he made use of it, else how could he put it in the book as an example of making use? In general, I think this book would be even better it it contained some poetry in addition to the one poem by Thomas Hardy that it does contain, and if that poetry illustrated the point the author was making.My other complaint about the book is that a little bit of the author's humorous sidebars (letters to the editor, Pre-MFA Quiz) goes a long way. These sidebars are so long that they cease being funny and seem to exist only to give the book more pages.But my objections are minor in comparison to the worth of the book. If you are a poet and need inspiration to continue writing poetry, read this book. If you're a writer with whom the world is too much late and soon, and need to know that others have trod the writing path and can point out the serpentine trails, the box canyons, the quiet brooks, and the resting places, read this book -- you will welcome it as a thirsty traveler welcomes water.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 28, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1U15B1COFGHIQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1936747278#wasThisHelpful","R1U15B1COFGHIQ","A232HUAELH5J6V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A232HUAELH5J6V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Many second-in-a-series novels are a touch disappointing, either because they're really stepping-stones to the third in the series, or because the author hasn't taken as much time with the plot and the characters as he or she did in the first novel. At Ease with the Dead does not fall into the ""touch disappointing"" category. In this novel Satterthwait continues with the characters he created: Joshua Croft, private eye who works for Rita Mondragon, who has been confined to a wheelchair since the shooting in which her husband was murdered (and she was injured).In this book, the client is Daniel Begay, an elder of the Navajo nation, and the crime goes all the way back to 1925, when Dennis Lessing, exploring for oil, robbed a grave, stealing the bones of Ganado, a Navajo warrior. Lessing stole the bones in order to give them to his 12-year-old daughter Alice, who was interested in anthropology. Within a month of the grave robbing, Lessing was murdered -- and the bones disappeared. Now Begay wants Croft and Mondragon to recover the bones.Croft starts with Alice Lessing, now in her 80s. She suggests possible motives for her father's murder and the second theft of Ganado's bones, and Croft investigates these leads -- investigates them despite the fact that he is beaten up and Alice is murdered. Do the theft and murder have to do with academic advancement? With oil rights? Or with something else altogether?This is a very satisfying mystery, well-written, with good pacing and plotting, and interesting characters. If you haven't read any books in the Croft and Mondragon series, start with the first, Wall of Glass, and keep on going.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 28, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZM5V1SAUYG99/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0826329705#wasThisHelpful","RZM5V1SAUYG99","A232HUAELH5J6V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A232HUAELH5J6V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Before watching this documentary, I knew only its subject (West Indian cricket team), nothing else. As the film began, with shots of the West Indian bowlers throwing the cricket ball at such high speeds that the opposing batsmen were usually hit by the pitch, I was a bit horrified. This did not seem like sport to me. But I continued to watch and thus I learned (and saw) what the Australian team did to the ""Windies"" in their 1970s matches. The Australian bowlers intended to hit, maim, cow, intimidate, and obliterate the West Indian players. In fact, that is what the Australians did, with the crowd chanting vile racist epithets to boot. The West Indian bowlers returned home defeated and humiliated -- but only in the cricket matches, not in mind, body, or spirit.In fact, the West Indians analyzed the situation, sized up their opponents, and set about building a team that could defeat those who had defeated them. Yes! A thousand times Yes! If the Australians hurl high-speed cricket balls at you in order to win, then hurl high-speed pitches right back at them. Those who dole out this kind of play should be treated to the same kind of play coming back at them. And when they were -- they lost. The West Indian cricket team proved superior in every way: it could receive the high-speed pitches and hit them, it could deliver high-speed pitches and prevent the opponents from hitting.This is an informative, uplifting, powerful story about a group of men who, despite their differences, formed a team that had the discipline, the intelligence, the strength, and the skill to become a dominant force in world cricket.

"Fascinating how and why so many middle book in a trilogy are a touch disappointing. I experienced that feeling with the second book in Stieg Larsson's trilogy, as well as with this book -- though I must admit that Larsson's book ended with a bang, as does Catching Fire.I read The Hunger Games after I saw the movie, and I liked the book even better. But I usually make a point of not reading reviews which give away important plot points, and so I deliberately didn't read any reviews about Catching Fire or Mockingjay, so that I could come to the books without knowing much about what was going to happen. I much prefer that: it allows me to experience the story as the author intended me to experience it. So, what I expected from Catching Fire was threefold: (1) I thought we would learn more about the other districts in Panem; (2) I thought President Snow and the Capitol would, in order to get rid of Katniss, force her to participate in the Hunger Games again, then arrange to have her killed off by the other tributes, or by the Gameskeepers; (3) because we got to know Peeta in the first book, I expected that we would get to know Gale in this book.How did my expectations compare to the book itself? Expectation #1: we learned a tiny bit more about the other districts, but in reality not much. We did learn that they were rebelling. I wanted to know more, but I can accept that Katniss and Peeta were closely guarded and not permitted to speak to people from other districts.Expectation #2: I was finding the first third of the book interesting but not riveting: much summary, not much action. And then the author met my expectations about Katniss having to fight again, but on a much higher level than I anticipated, and so I was very pleased with this plot development because I thought it reflected what an entrenched privileged power would do: try to smash every last hope the people have, so as to quell any spark of life or rebellion. Collins' plotting exceeded my expectations, and I was thrilled with the developments. I also liked the unexpected sea-and-jungle setting of the games this time around, and I liked the alliances being formed. However, the game action seemed perfunctory, something to happen quickly, and in a way, off-stage. This slowed the pacing of the games section. I did like getting to know some of the other tributes, and thought their introduction and their roles were well done.Expectation #3: I was disappointed that we didn't get to know Gale in any depth at all, and I was even disappointed that Peeta remained pretty much the same as he had been in the first book. We see that Gale has changed, but I didn't see a change in Peeta. There's a slight change in Katniss as she comes to admire those who defy the Capitol outright by speaking of revolution. But Katniss herself is a touch disappointing here: she comes across as more naive than she should be for a 17-year-old who has lived what she has lived. I would expect somebody in her position at this point in the plot would be a bit quicker on the uptake, a bit more able to intuit and reach conclusions (as when Plutarch showed her the watch with the mockingjay).These disappointments aside, I still enjoyed the book a lot. It flows quickly and in a very logical (and dire) direction. The people of the districts are heroic in their resistance against the draconian Capitol which enslaves them. I am looking forward to the final book!","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 25, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RMVVG7JOT1C76/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0439023491#wasThisHelpful","RMVVG7JOT1C76","A232HUAELH5J6V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A232HUAELH5J6V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In this, the third Brother Cadfael novel, Gervase Bonel of the landed gentry prepares to legally turn over his manor and lands to Shrewsbury Abbey in exchange for the Abbey allowing him to live in a small house and to take care of him the rest of his life. But before the agreement can become legal, Bonel dies suddenly: murdered by monkshood added to the sauce of his dinner. Cadfael had prepared monkshood as an ointment earlier, and is able to determine the cause of death. Cadfael also learns that Bonel's wife, Richildis, is the woman he had once been betrothed to, and that Edwin, her son by a previous marriage, is suspected of the murder. Even though Edwin was not Bonel's son, Bonel promised Edwin that he would inherit the manor and lands. So it seems that Edwin has a major motive to kill Bonel before the giving away of the estate becomes legal. But do others have an equal motive? What about Muerig, Bonel's illegitimate son? What about Richildis herself? And . . . could anybody at the Abbey be so unholy as to murder?Cadfael solves the mystery through keen observations and deductions, and, most importantly, by his knowledge of Welsh customs and law.A very satisfying read.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 24, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2UZC90N613719/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0751543772#wasThisHelpful","R2UZC90N613719","A232HUAELH5J6V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A232HUAELH5J6V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

That's bad enough, but when another girl calls Erin ""Jilly's puppet,"" Erin punches that girl in the nose. Not a good way to start off seventh grade. Erin then keeps a computer diary of all her thoughts and feelings about things.

"Although there's a lot of funny dialogue between Nero Wolfe and Archie Goodwin at the beginning of this book, the story as a whole seemed rote, as if the author were going through familiar motions without heart. In this story millionaire Otis Jarrell hires Wolfe to discover whether his (Jarrell's) daughter-in-law is stealing business secrets and selling them elsewhere. In order to uncover the truth, Wolfe has Archie take a job as Jarrell's secretary and move into the Jarrell penthouse. Archie does, and then murder follows. More than one. The mystery is solved at the end when Wolfe interviews the suspects and presents a piece of evidence given him by Inspector Cramer. Worth reading if you're a Nero and Archie fan. Maybe even if you're not and just want the taste of a 1950s mystery with lots of wit and cleverness.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 18, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R38BDA3C85GODA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0553762966#wasThisHelpful","R38BDA3C85GODA","A232HUAELH5J6V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A232HUAELH5J6V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I enjoyed the Sandilands mysteries that were set in India more than I enjoyed this one. Perhaps the setting helped move the novel along in the India books. This book is interesting in the way that any mystery novel set in another time and another place is interesting: the reader gains vicarious pleasure from reading about the transportation, communication, furniture, clothing, and customs of that particular era. If you enjoy reading mysteries more for the setting than for the plot, then I think you will like both this book and the other Sandilands novels.

"This book just got weird.First off, we get it, their related by marriage...WHATEVER...but the constant need for the author pointing out how taboo the two being together sexually was, was over the top.I felt like the story had great potential in the beginning. This bully shows his feelings through being a massive bully (high school years).The issue that forced both of them to leave their rich lifestyles and start their own wasn't even mentioned until late in the book as ""confessions"" like they were something that could keep the two apart (and they weren't).I thought the first sex scene was totally hot and loved the angry build up to awesome sex.But after that, it just fell.It's like he turned a total 180 and became everything he wasn't. He wasn't even alpha...he was just a regular man. LOL.The H turned too soft, the h became annoying...the direction the story took to bring down the uncle was boring and very unrealistic. The parent's having a baby together and being a daughter....a very sick thought.The fact that these two always referred two each other (in sex too) as brother and sister just over the top trying to be taboo that it was just silly and eye rolling.I do recommend this book, this could be very promising for anyone that loves a different kind of romance. Hopefully you enjoy it more than I dd.","2.0 out of 5 stars","June 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1OBP5E7QPI4PS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XLOJZZ8#wasThisHelpful","R1OBP5E7QPI4PS","AFLUSKCVBJ8UG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AFLUSKCVBJ8UG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

She feels like all he is doing is just constantly trying to save her.It is a little too sweet for the person that doesn't have a sweet tooth in romance, but the story and characters are captivating enough that its easy to over look once you get into the story.Overall the story is very entertaining, sexy and full of alpha goodness,","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZ1C0ACQZF5UN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Y228S2O#wasThisHelpful","RZ1C0ACQZF5UN","AFLUSKCVBJ8UG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AFLUSKCVBJ8UG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This book was recommend over and over in regards to a strong villain-ess H that falls for a sweet h.First off, it took the majority of the book for anything to happen. It had some hot moments, but overall, the h remained ""out of the loop"" from all the supposed feelings the H had for her. She just thought of herself as another prisoner he was trying to steal the powers from.It got a little old when the h retreated to this train of thought over and over and continued to beat the H over the head with it.The H does, IMO, cheat on the h after they discover their feelings are mutual. He does it because he's trying so hard to prove to himself and her that he isn't going to take advantage of the fact that she's there only because he has her imprisoned there.Toward the end, when everyone's true spots are shown to all those around, it's almost too little to late for me. Its so hard to believe that such a strong personality change can occur with the H without making him seem weak, weird or really...sane.So overall it was interesting, but got a little too long in regards to waiting for the h and H to figure each other out and then admit it all.Very different, so I guess that's why I was more into that if it was a more standard story line.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3ILWQVG1ZIHGE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ASM2I5U#wasThisHelpful","R3ILWQVG1ZIHGE","AFLUSKCVBJ8UG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AFLUSKCVBJ8UG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This definitely isn't for the easily disturbed.Basically after watching her BFF get murdered because a man used her as a shield, our heroine falls in love with the man that saved her.Add sex, insanely insane gross characters and some more vindictive psycho's and woo-la you have Outlaw Revenge.It was definitely OTT in the grit department. I mean, there is no sugar coating when it comes to a man that finds the human dead shield of a woman he used arousing because she was still warm to the touch....Luckily, the h and H in this were not as sick or I couldn't have read it.I do think it's a little unlikely the h would have sex covered in her best friends blood, befriend the man that used her as a shield and be able to try and live a normal life - even for a gritty MC romance story. It's just all a little much.I felt there was some rush, leaving several things unexplained or just not addressed at all.I'm not sure if i'll pick up more in this series and I would recommend this read.

"This was just okay for me.It was a little cheesy and predictable.The only UNpredictable part really did feel like it came from left field and made me wonder if I missed something that would have made the whole situation the h was in the middle of make more sense. I mean part of it was ""ahhhh"" but the other was like ""wtf?"".It was not the best told story, very basic, kept you mildly pulled in.The H was Alpha/Possessive, but only when pushed to be it or when he thought his brothers smiles were pointed in her direction.The h's past issues made her very vulnerable, however, also made her seem lacking. The things that made her have ""episodes"" didn't really make sense. Sometimes angry shouts did it, sometimes it was like she had a backbone of steel. It just seemed inconsistent. I also didn't get the whole school scene. I also felt the whole situation with the stalker didn't make sense when the author tried wrapping it up. It was also disappointing to the only excitement of the story.So overall, this is just okay for me. Nothing special, nothing that really had me connecting to these two characters - and really nothing that had me itching to read more about Serenity Springs.There was a lot of introduction to other characters and it was pointed out who the couples would be. This was done kind of cheesily too. Ehhh - we'll see.

"This is one of those WAYYYY OTT H stories. Like so OTT it's a little cheesy and weird instead of fun and sexy.However, since I don't mind those, once I get my head in the zone, it was pretty good.The reason I didn't give it too many stars is because one, it was too short for a story that would have been way better (even with our crazy Alpha) with some length. Also, I felt the h needed more time to heal. It was a little too unbelievable and some what off putting for the h to be totally okay with leaving one troubled, scary man to another. Especially one that warned and often showed his violent side.

Parts that brought the story and all the characters together as a whole and made you fall in love with the story that much more.I felt that both characters really had a great, fun chemistry and was totally believable.Great addition to the series!","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R6I6JO5Q2EGJI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00U9U223Y#wasThisHelpful","R6I6JO5Q2EGJI","AFLUSKCVBJ8UG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AFLUSKCVBJ8UG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This  fell flat for me.I felt like the H and h just couldn't and wouldn't get on the same page. The h was a little OTT with her rebuff of the H because he hurt her feelings ONE time when she was acting like a slut. She just needed to get over her hurt pride.The H was more possessive and concerned about his bratty, drug addicted sister than the h.I didn't read book 1, but honestly, wasn't too impressed with those two in this book to go back and want to read.Just one big ""eh"" all the way around.","2.0 out of 5 stars","March 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RY7N5JA9K8ZY8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UKLMFUC#wasThisHelpful","RY7N5JA9K8ZY8","AFLUSKCVBJ8UG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AFLUSKCVBJ8UG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This was a pretty good read.Basically these two meet, become attracted and then.....become Dr./patient.They both decided to become Dr./patient AFTER they met and knew they were both attracted to each other. However, the major angst/issue in the whole book is that it is unethical and wrong for the H (the Dr) to date or want the h. Especially since he decided it was okay to do a pelvic exam on her. At first I got it - it was new/exciting for them...but then about half way through, I was like, Get Over It Already! I mean these two acted like they couldn't sneak around or deny the fact that he made sure her ""goodies"" were still good. They acted like he was her High School Teacher or something. Yeesh.So other than that fact, it was definitely off the charts steamy. I mean, this H could DIRRRTTY talk. However, I felt like the smex scenes took way too long. >crazy for me to admit that< But they did. Everything was so long and drawn out.....overly detailed. I mean at first it was enjoyable...but every time?? Too much.Also I felt like, when the H found out the h's secret, he went OTT in jerk mode. I felt like he had some more groveling to do before >I< could forgive him.  The h was just the H's doormat too often as well. Whatever he wanted, he was more important, his career was more important, his life, his friends....it was all about him.So anyway, yes, good book, good smex and a good Alpha. Just some personal issues I took up with it, but it is still worth a read. Fun, short and sexy.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R7A1RM3KWQTHA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TCPKTVY#wasThisHelpful","R7A1RM3KWQTHA","AFLUSKCVBJ8UG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AFLUSKCVBJ8UG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I don't think I have EVER felt, identified or related to a heroine in a story as much as i did this one.When I cried....I CRIED. As a mother, I felt KA reach into my chest and rip out some of my heart strings in trying to relate to how this h  was dealing with her life.As much as you felt for the h, you did not feel sorry for her in a bad way. She earned and clawed her way back to the top and did it earning respect and dignity.It was amazingly told.Now that's just one part of it.Let's get to the totally juicy, funny, sweet, sexy, ANNOYING and amazing part - Amy and Micky....Micky was a well written classic KA Alpha H. Loved him.I don't want to give anything away.

"I have less than 10 authors that are an auto buy for me. Regardless of the series/genre/price - whatever. Kristen Proby is now officially one of them. Well, she became officially one of them a few books back, but I just wanted to throw that in here!This is a great kick off to a new series. Compared to her Seattle series, this one is going to be just as good - if not better.The H is the successful, man ho (who definitely knows how to treat and respect a lady) and the h is a successful woman really not looking for anything - but isn't going to say no either.The story line flows great and stays entertaining throughout the whole book. The characters introduced are excellent and a few of them are already getting the buildup in this book for what's going to come in their own.This is not your typical ""boss to employee"" story, as the h is there working for the H only as a guise. She's an old family friend that has always crushed on the H. She works as an investigator for companies that have someone within stealing from them. She comes in, looks like the new, low on the totem pole girl, and finds out what the heck is going on.Again, very entertaining and very good, sweet romance.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3F8UJ4JG9QJ1P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ROFITIE#wasThisHelpful","R3F8UJ4JG9QJ1P","AFLUSKCVBJ8UG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AFLUSKCVBJ8UG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is definitely my favorite in the series.Finally, less cheesiness (but still SOME), a more Alpha H and a more exciting story line.I don't think you necessarily have to read this in order.

"Ehh - this was just okay.Honestly - I went back and read this, because of read all the others after it. I have to admit, after you get over some ridiculously cheesy moments, that you soon grow to adore, it's a great series.The first two, however, are a little OTT with the cheese-ballness. Again, once you get used to it, it doesn't naw at you anymore and you enjoy the story. The others are better than the first and you really don't have to read them in order. Sure it helps, but it isn't detrimental.If you love super Alpha/possessive H's and love it when they find ""their one and only's"", this is a good series for you.  I didn't find the H in this book as alpha/possessive as the later H's.","2.0 out of 5 stars","March 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R159676LI4M72A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N9JVRUQ#wasThisHelpful","R159676LI4M72A","AFLUSKCVBJ8UG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AFLUSKCVBJ8UG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I felt like this book - and the characters - totally did 180s half way through.First off - Love me a good ol' ""my boss needs to spank me"" book. Always promising.However, these two went from totally denying each other (ridiculously and annoyingly so - not in a teasing way) to being in insta' love.  It didn't make sense. I mean, the h, is OBSESSED with the H from birth. Okay, maybe not birth,but pretty darn close to it. She even makes her whole career choice, which includes a master's degree, based on the fact that it's the H's passion. Then half way through the book, it's like it was her passion, even though she never really showed any love for it until she went to school. Even then it never expresses that the h liked what she did, it just kept referencing that she was trying to gain the H's attention with it.Then there's the "" I refuse to sleep with my employee"" rule the H sets about...at the h's interview with him...that the h tells him and herself she'll see through and get 'em. She's all ""...but what about after hours...""Then the H proceeds to UNPROFESSIONALLY bang his girlfriend in the office every day (okay, almost everyday). He keeps ignoring the h...bang girlfriend...ignore h...bang girlfriend....you get it, right? OH but he must remain professional and not date an employee in his tiny firm. WTFE, dude.This TRULY makes the h look like a crazy fan girl instead of the old family friend that respects and loves the H. Hell, it makes the H look like a hypocritical douche bag.Fast forward through the book...the finally start bangin'...two pages later their ""we only bang game"" is now ""we are madly in love game:"" but only the H shows it. Suddenly, out of left field, the h acts as if she must choose her suddenly important career over her temporary ""just bangin"" him"" boss. Like he's nothing....like she hasn't obsessed over him in forever...like she...she...she *shakes head* I'm so lost by this point.Don't even get me started on the creepy roommate that has story lines swirling around her that aren't only ridiculous, but serve no purpose and only distract us from what's supposed to be the main story line.Oh and PARIS - WTF? Yeah...you're thinking, ""what do you mean ""Oh and PARIS""""....EXACTLY! That's how I felt reading most of this book...exactly how you feel about reading this review.","1.0 out of 5 stars","March 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2Q2FUB71JBPAO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00U2PUZ2G#wasThisHelpful","R2Q2FUB71JBPAO","AFLUSKCVBJ8UG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AFLUSKCVBJ8UG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have fallen in love with these characters and I have envied the relationships they have. I'm not talking romantically (though they are amazing and what every girl truly dreams of) but I'm talking about the friendships. They are a family, not just a group of friends and to have a bond like that would be something truly special. I've said it in reviews regarding this series in the past and I stand firm about it. I'm jealous of their family. I want to be a part of that family. To feel as welcome and loved as all of them to do - it's truly something else.This is a book that even though it's an ending to this series, it's kind of like a new beginning, too. Josie and Liam are truly getting a second chance at experiencing everything from the beginning. He may have missed everything with Josie and especially with Noah but things are changing. There's a lot of baggage that they still need to deal with and that's the main struggle you'll see in this book. Josie, as much as I loved her, I wanted to ring her neck. And it's hypocritical of me because I would probably behaving in the same way but seriously, this man loves you more than he loves anything in the world. You have to see that. Everyone else does.This book is filled with surprises though. A character who I, along with many of the characters in this book, have hated for some time now show us their true selves and you can't help but feel pity for them. And you can help but respect them even though that's not something you ever expected to feel regarding them. What can I say...people surprise you when you least expect it.This series shows the potential for the series regarding the children. I have been chomping at the bits just waiting for the next series to come from Beaumont. We've gotten the love stories of all these amazing characters and soon it will be the children's turn. And it's going to be amazing - I just know it. A few things were hinted at in this book and let me tell you, if it happens, I may be the happiest person alive. I'm just so excited thinking about what's to come. So damn excited.This series has been very emotional from the first chapter of the first book to the very last page. You will feel every emotion imaginable and most times, you will feel it more than once while reading not just this book, but every book before it. These characters are real - I swear it . . . I just have yet to meet them. Until I do, I'm envious of them. Heidi McLaughlin has delivered yet another spectacular and memorable book. One you don't want to miss.Reviewed by Jessica @ Step Into Fiction","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3NI47UJYF2UMG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011CF78RO#wasThisHelpful","R3NI47UJYF2UMG","A2LNHLLIDZLZ21","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2LNHLLIDZLZ21?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am so glad I gave this book a chance. I know I repeat myself often but I rarely like YA contemp. It's not gritty enough for me but I'm starting to see that it's not the case anymore. I've come across more and more YA contemps that appeal to me. Not saying a lot, just more. This is one of them. It's a love story, which I am on board with, duh, but it's also not filled with butterflies and rainbows. It's darker, it's emotional and the entire book is one big struggle. It's what I like to read. There's no fluff but instead there's real issues with some dark backgrounds.I wanted to give this book 5 stars so badly. And this may be me being a bit too harsh on this book but there is one reason I couldn't give it a perfect rating. Do you want to know why this is? It didn't make me cry. Sure, I teared up a few times but I was expecting and waiting for that moment (or moments, really) that would just gut me and make me loose my s***. It never came. Emotionally, this book drained me (in the best way possible, trust me) but the tears never came. I wanted to cry; I know, weird, right? But I wanted it and I never got it and it makes me so sad. It makes me want to cry for not being able to cry which is weirder to begin with.I will say, if there is one contemporary book you should read this year, it's this one. I don't even care that it's the beginning of 2015, this is one you need to read. Also, this is coming from someone whose obsessed with fantasy and tends to cringe when contemporary is mentioned. That should show you how series I am about reading this book. I've already preordered it because I need it in hardcover. I also saw American Sniper after reading I'll Meet You There and some of Chris Kyle's reactions when he's home from war reminds me entirely of scenes with Josh from the book. So many things just brought this book more to life with seeing this movie - I don't know if it's just me.I'm not sure which character killed me the most but both Sky and Josh were equally intriguing and difficult and down right hard to read at times. Josh, whose recently come back from the military but certainly not the same guy who left to go to war. Sure, he's still there but then you add everything he went through during his tour and it's just a mess (rightfully so). Then there's Sky, whose about to be one of the few who get out of this small town but her family life is anything but solid. Her father is dead and her mother is on the verge of another breakdown - it's enough to have her questioning whether she should put off school and stay back. Which is the last thing she needs.There is not one negative thing about the book (me not crying is a personal thing, which is sad, but nothing against the book). It was everything I was hoping it to be and then some. Then so much more, really. The supporting characters are fantastic; their stories are unique in itself and not like anything you really read about in other YA books. Unless, of course, they're those contemps I stay away from. I can't even go in to detail about this book without wanting to talk about EVERYTHING so I'm opting for a vague review so I don't risk the urge.All you need to know is this is a book you need to read. If it's not now, please put it on your list to read some time this year or as soon as you can. What I wouldn't give for more from these characters - alas, why I also steer away from standalone's. One book with characters I love is never enough for satisfy me.Reviewed by Jessica","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQ6DDF51AO6V8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0805097953#wasThisHelpful","RQ6DDF51AO6V8","A2LNHLLIDZLZ21","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2LNHLLIDZLZ21?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This series is over and I'm sad about this. Character wise, probably one of my most enjoyed series. However, none of the books outshine the first book, The Madman's Daughter and I think I know why (besides the fact that it was brilliant). The only story I wasn't familiar with was the first one, The Island of Dr. Moreau, so it was fascinating to me. However, I am familiar The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll & Mr. Hyde as well as Frankenstein. While I loved the incorporation of those stories to the story and world Megan created I think that ignorance of not being familiar with the first book's story made it all far more fascinating to me.I did love this conclusion, even if it creeped me out (hello, this shouldn't be a surprise as there's been many times in the previous books I've cringed or been creeped out - it's what's made these books so great) and maybe I did cry a time or two. Maybe my heart hurts for a character or two, still but it was perfect. I was little bummed for the lack of romance for the first half of the book. Montgomery and Juliet almost felt like strangers to me, the way they were around each other and it made me sad to see. But have no fear, the second half of the book truly made up for it.There's not a whole lot I can say about this book without giving too many spoilers. It's a fantastic conclusion to a great series. It's dark, like all the books have been; it's violent but again, this shouldn't be a surprise. It's a perfect blend of every element. I was really sad to see it end because ever since the first book, I've been in love with Montgomery and have had a fascination with Edward and Juliet, as individual's. I've really become attached to them and it's always so hard letting go. Sometimes, I find myself not finishing series because I don't want to let them go. I had to read this thought because I needed to know how it ended and I wanted to see everything come together.I think if you've loved this series as much as I have then you'll be entirely satisfied with this ending. Sad, absolutely but happy at the same time. It's great and I really hope you'll agree.Reviewed by Jessica @ Step Into Fiction","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3CXXEL1OR11FS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062128086#wasThisHelpful","R3CXXEL1OR11FS","A2LNHLLIDZLZ21","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2LNHLLIDZLZ21?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Let's be honest here, this cover grabbed your attention before even reading what this was about, right? Who knows, maybe this cover sold you to read it without even reading the description - regardless, this book lives up to the awesomeness that is the cover. This cover is probably one of my favorites, especially from 2014.If you've been reading my reviews from time to time, you'll know I'm a big fan of romance in any novel, right? However, if the story is great enough that it gets me forgetting about the romance (most of the time) then you know it's going to be one hell of a book. So, if you couldn't guess, Snow Like Ashes doesn't have a whole lot of romance but what it does have are subtle things. Maybe like a kiss on the cheek, a hug that lasts just a moment too long to considered a friendly hug, a look of longing, a moment of hand holding that just makes me weak in the knees. I was actually more giddy over the small things that I could've been with anything else.The main focus is and should be on the story and the world that Sara Raasch has created. It's a beautiful world with amazing characters and historically huge problems. Who would've ever thought to create a book with seasons but having people representing those seasons? The Winter Kingdom, which was destroyed, all their people are pale, white hair, light blue eyes and cannot stand the heat. Whereas, say, people from Spring a more tan, darker hair with darker eyes. I don't recall meeting anyone from Summer in this book but we did meet some from Autumn.There's a huge twist in this book and I saw it coming. I know people who read it and didn't and I can't even imagine what was going through their minds when they got to this point. I was squealing like fangirl when I got there because even though I thought it early on, didn't mean I was actually going to be right (it happens a lot where I'm not). Obviously, I can't talk about this because you have to find out about it first hand, but it's a fantastic plot twist that will hopefully make you giddy, as well.Meira is amazing. I may, in fact, have a slight girl crush on her for how awesome she is. All she wants to be is a soldier for her future King, who also happens to be the person she's in love with and her best friend, and to be someone that is of use to surviving eight refugees of Winter. She is fierce, she is loyal, she is kickass, she is extremely intelligent and she does not like being told what to do when it's to 'keep her safe'.Mather is my man. I am just throwing that out there. I want him in my corner every day and every night. This guy needs to be real because I will hunt him down and I will find him. Read the book and you will understand what I'm talking about. There are not enough words to describe him so I will opt not to bore you. Just take my advice and read. However, Theron, I thought I might hate you but you are fighting for my heart, as well. You've put up a good fight, my dear, and I can't wait for you to keep fighting in the next book but you're still not there yet.Reviewed by Jessica @ Step Into Fiction","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2AF89PXSPNU2G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062286927#wasThisHelpful","R2AF89PXSPNU2G","A2LNHLLIDZLZ21","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2LNHLLIDZLZ21?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The grass isn't always greener on the other side.  I think that's one of the first thoughts that comes to my mind when trying to quickly summarize this book.  Falling Into Place tells the story of Liz.  Liz is pretty much the ""it"" girl at her high school.  But at the very beginning of the novel, Liz attempts suicide.  This book is told in a combination of flashbacks and present day, with stories from people in Liz's everyday life.  It sucks you in from the beginning and is a great fast paced read.Liz, Julia, and Kennie are a trio of best friends.  They are extremely popular in high school, but have all done some pretty hurtful things.  But their friendship is solid, you can tell that these three have a bond. This is exactly how you tell a story about characters that are seemingly unlikable,  One can easily try to write this story off as a popular girls with their materialistic problems.  But this is definitely not what this story is about.  The author has creatively made these seemingly unlikable girls likable for readers.  Which definitely is not an easy task.My favorite character in this book is actually not one of the three girls though.  It's Liam.  Liam is an unpopular high school student.  He has a crush on Liz and as his story progresses you understand why he has a crush on her.  He sees the true identity of people, even those who ridicule him.  He banishes the stereotype of the quiet kid. Even after something unspeakable happens to him, he pushes on and doesn't let himself become depressed.  He lives his life how he wants to live it, regardless of others opinion of him.I actually was able to guess who the narrator of the story was.  The narrator that the author chose is pretty genius.  And even though the narrator is subtle, the stories told bring a lot to the story.  This is definitely one of my favorite reads this year.  It's quick paced, and can easily be read in one sitting. It's an extremely strong debut from Amy Zhang.  I look forward to reading more from her!Reviewed by Sana @ Step Into Fiction","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2SL3G1V4W0YNN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062295047#wasThisHelpful","R2SL3G1V4W0YNN","A2LNHLLIDZLZ21","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2LNHLLIDZLZ21?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Fie!  A word that I have never before used has now become a new favorite.  It's an expression that one would shout when they are outraged or disgusted.  It's also a word that the main character in Illusions of Fate says quite a few times.  Jessamin I must say is quite a firecracker.  It's always a joy to read about a young woman who is not afraid to speak her mind.  Jessamin is also a minority of mixed race.  As a minority myself, I can't tell you how much it excites me to read about a main character in a young adult book that is of color.Jessamin is just so strong.  She really is the bread and butter of this book.  Kiersten White writes such strong characters.  I remember absolutely devouring the Mind Games duology, and that was definitely because of the characters.  Her characters are so memorable and they leaving a lasting impression on the reader.Storytelling on the other hand is where things are a little shaky.  And at under 300 pages, I find it difficult to tell a full fantasy story.  Especially since this is a standalone novel, so there will not be a sequel.  Majority of the novel builds incredible character development, but not so much of world building.  It's a world with secret magic abilities that people of noble background possess that doesn't go into much detail.  There are brief descriptions, and magic is such an enchanting story in any fantasy book, that it's a shame that it's not explored much.Dialogue was a major strong point in this book.  My gosh the bickering between Jessamin and her love interest Finn was quality work.  I found myself re reading certain parts because I enjoyed them so much.This last part is a bit hard for me to write, and I actually asked my blogmate Jessica if I should even put this in my review because it's not about the content of the book.  First I want to say that this no way shapes my opinion of the book at all.  It's just something that I noticed, and it nags me.  I do not like the cover of this book.  Jessamin is a woman of color.  In the book she refers and describes herself as being brown.  After doing research, I was relieved to find out that the cover model is of color (she's Polynesian). But parts of the cover are so brightened that if you quickly glance at the cover you probably wouldn't think a woman of color was the model.  Her chest and hand are so lightened. This was probably done to showcase the teacup in the model's hands.  But it is a bit disheartening for me.We Need Diverse books was a trending topic on twitter a few months ago.  I was able to personally relate to Jessamin.  I've experienced racism and it sucks.  It really does suck.

"I'm torn. There were parts of this book that I absolutely loved. But then there were parts that I didn't. But let's start from the beginning. I was hopeful, as I always am (though I'm not sure why anymore) when there's a hint at a best friend turned boyfriend theme to the story. I am one of those suckers that want more friend ends up with the girl stories since they are the ones that are usually screwed. That being said, after a few pages of this book, I knew this wasn't going to end well. Tristan isn't the one girl kind of guy and I was already feeling sorry for Lily. She has enough things wrong in her life (crazy mother, a father who left and allergies like you wouldn't believe). This party, you just knew how it was going to end, you just knew it. Though, there were definitely surprises along the way.I liked Lily, as a character. She had spunk, a fantastic personality and while she's rather fragile, she's got a very strong soul. She's the type of girl that you, while you may knock her down time and time again, she's going to get right back up and keep on trucking. I admire that about her because I don't think I could be as strong as she is. However, I do not like her alternative world Lillian at all but I do believe that is the point.The love story to this is just . . . weird. There's no other way to put it. While I enjoyed it, I also got creeped out by it. I don't know how Lily was so comfortable with it when, if it were me, I'd be cringing and questioning. Rowan, himself, is totally swoon-worthy. He's a good guy, powerful and dammit, he can cook like the best of the chefs. I want him cooking for me. My mouth was kind of watering just reading about him in the kitchen.I do like the Tristan in this alternative world, though. I really like him, even though he's very similar to the Tristan we met in the beginning of the story, he seems to be a bit more compassionate and loving. He's still not the one woman type of guy but I don't think he's as dickish about it. I adore the friendship these two have, while again, it's similar to the friendship her Tristan had, it's different and better, I think. I know, this kind of sounds confusing, right? It's really not, though.I love the world she created in this alternative Salem and the dangers that await us every turn. It fascinates me and terrifies me all at the same time. The science and the witch aspects woven into this story are amazing. To view the benefits of both when you've never really paid much attention to how incredible science really can be it mind boggling. I am, by no means, a science buff. Hell, I could've cared less about that subject in school but reading about it in this book actually makes it interesting.It got really boring for me in the middle of the book. I didn't like the alternative points of views. I understand the need for them but that's when things started dragging for me. I liked Lily's voice and I wasn't sure I cared for the rest of them. I also don't know if I liked the ending. It seemed rather rushed and jumbled. Especially a certain person's death. You knew it was coming but it was so . . . lackluster. I expected more, which sounds pretty awful, I know.I definitely am interested enough to read more and see where this story goes in the next book but I don't think I'm as excited for it as I was for this book (which is another that has let me down). Having high expectations for a book is a dangerous thing. I definitely recommend this book if you like witchcraft, science and maybe the idea of traveling between different worlds (which sounds like fun).Reviewed by Jessica @ Step Into Fiction","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZ1HNIBCSBKY1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=125005088X#wasThisHelpful","RZ1HNIBCSBKY1","A2LNHLLIDZLZ21","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2LNHLLIDZLZ21?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I devoured this book. And it makes me so happy to say this was one of my most anticipated books from Harper and it didn't disappoint. Lately, I've been disappointed by books I've been eagerly waiting for and it is really nice to break that pattern.There was one aspect of this book that I didn't love but it grew on me and that was the insta love. Maybe it's me but I don't believe in 'insta love' it's more like insta lust so I have a hard time believing any relationship (real or fictional) that is so sudden. But, I liked both characters individually and like I said, the more they were around each other and the more they had time with each other, it grew on me. He wasn't even introduced until halfway through the book so I was kept wondering when we might see some romance. Hell, I almost was wishing for her and Garnet, I'm not going to lie. But alas, it was not meant to be but I do like Ash and I'm eager for more of him.The whole world is pretty messed up. All I kept thinking while reading this book is how lucky we are that this doesn't exist. The Royals are all sorts of screwed up and inhuman; viewing these girls who carry babies for them as property, not as people. It's disgusting. The things you find out in this book just make the disgust towards these...these...people grown until you just can't take it anymore. You want to make them suffer probably more than Violet does or maybe it's just me, I'm not sure.Then, you look at the rest of the society and realize how little freedom anyone but the Royals truly has. You can't even seem to have kids without fearing they'll test positive for a surrogate. It makes you not want to have kids if you lived in those areas, especially the Marsh. The outer circle of this hell.I LOVE Lucien, seriously, I just LOVE him. I need more of him and I can't wait to get more of him. He's my hero of this story. He really is. He works for the devil (though, there are so many in this book) and yet, he's so damn amazing. You would think that darkness would eventually take hold of someone but not him.You know who else I love? Garnet. We don't know much about him but I loved him the second he stumbled into that dinner all the way through the end. I need more of him, too.Violet is strong. She is so much stronger than I ever would be. I admire her so much in this book. From her visit to her family to her torture in this home. They don't think it's torture but it totally is. How she isn't completely and utterly broken at this point makes me in awe of her. And her love for her best friend, Raven, who is also living in a hell much worse than hers, is refreshing. As a surrogate, you don't have friends and you never see them again once you've been sold but that's not the case with these two and their story breaks my heart over and over again.Dang-it, I just need more. Because . . . the ending is torture. The author likes to not only torture her characters but her readers and I'm going to go insane waiting a year for more. Because that ending is BRUTAL. You have been warned. Read with caution because a doozer is coming at the end.Reviewed by Jessica @ Step Into Fiction","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RFDR9JH954886/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062235796#wasThisHelpful","RFDR9JH954886","A2LNHLLIDZLZ21","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2LNHLLIDZLZ21?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"So, this book too me well over a week to read. It's a big book but that wasn't why. There were two reasons and I'm going to throw them both out there for you. One, I loved Crown of Midnight because of how much romance was in that book. There was so much that my heart couldn't take it and then in this book, it's basically non-existent. It made me sad for the first half of the book because I'm such a Chaol fangirl but after reading the second half of this book and finishing, I don't even care anymore. It was just hard for me to go from all that was in Crown of Midnight to what wasn't in this book. It's me being greedy, is all. The second reason it took me so long to read is because I wanted to savor this book. We're halfway through this series and I don't want to have to wait for the next book. I'm not a very patient person so I wanted to take my time, enjoy every word written in this book, each character and their stories. I wanted to take it all in and not miss a thing.Before reading this, I kept hearing all these things about Manon but then, I'm introduced to her and I'm wondering what all this hype is over this character. I wasn't impressed in the beginning and I was tempted to skip over her chapters but I couldn't do that because of how much I love this series. It would feel like I've betrayed Celaena somehow and we all know she's not one to piss off. But then . . . BUT THEN it was like How To Train Your Dragon: Bad Ass Style. I was hooked from that point on. I understand the hype y'all, it just took me some time to jump on board. Manon deserves all the talk and then some.You guys all know how I'm team Chaol, right? If you're not, check out this and consider yourself informed. That being said, my heart breaks for Dorian, it really does. He's this great guy and I've always thought this. I love him, but not like I love Chaol. There's just so much bad stuff that happens to him in this book and at the end, I nearly lost my s***. I'm worried for him. I am terrified for him, actually. I don't know how Sarah can do something like to not only him but to us, her readers. How could you do this?!There's so much that happens in this book. To all the characters, but Celaena is where it's at. She is training with this d-bag, Rowan, trying to shift into her Fae side and tap into her powers. I wanted to throw a few punches in Rowan's face but oh my gosh, did he grow on me. He also grew on Celaena. Let me backpedal a little here. He's a Prince, a cousin of Celaena and currently working for Maeve in a blood oath. A blood oath is forever and there is no betraying her. That being said, a bond forms between these two and he makes me swoon. In a completely different way from Chaol but man, if there ever is a time (and I'm hoping there will be) where Chaol and Rowan are in a room together, I may explode from too much swooning one in place.If you haven't read this series, I don't know why you're here. You're ruining yourself for the first two books, you truly are. Do yourself a favor and close out of this now. No, don't do that - go buy the first two books then come back here and continue reading. If you've read the first two books, I already like you, but get ready for excitement. This book is amazing. The next book promises so us so much epic . . . everything. This next year is going to be absolutely torture. I'm not even exaggerating. We need a support group for something like this . . . making us wait a year to read more.Reviewed by Jessica @ Step Into Fiction","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1DSLAF5J3ITXC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00I43Z1J0#wasThisHelpful","R1DSLAF5J3ITXC","A2LNHLLIDZLZ21","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2LNHLLIDZLZ21?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book is rough, emotionally. Olivia has been to hell and back but she's still recovering from her trip. This isn't something that easy to get over and it's only been six months. I won't talk details about what happened to her because it's a bit of mystery throughout at least a quarter of the book. It has you guessing what might have happened. I originally thought one thing and then it changed to something closer to what really happened. You already feel for her before you even know what exactly it was she's been through but once you find out, well, all you want to do is hug her and let her know you're there, supporting her.Besides the scars of her past, I really like Olivia. Her and her roommate, Kara, mesh really well and these are two friends I can get behind. I definitely am more like Olivia, personality wise, and Kara is the type of friend that definitely balances out Olivia. I really, really like this friendship.With trying to be vague about Olivia's scars, let's talk about the romance, shall we? The attraction to Preston was pretty instant but it's not insta-love. There's definitely a build up of their relationship and it's very gradual but sexy. You can see the sexual tension growing each time they interact and it's only going to get to a point where they'll give in to each other, it's how it always works, right? Preston is Kara's best friend and I love all the times they are all together or the times that it's just Olivia and Preston.Preston is delicious. He has a thing against relationships and just 'hang outs' with girls instead. There's a reason for his way of life when it comes to love and once you find out, you'll change your opinion of him. Cause, even though I liked him when I first met him, I was turned off by the fact that he just hooks up with girls and discards them. Not exactly swoon-worthy material right there. But he's such a great guy that you start to look past that.I freaking love Rose. If I ever get a therapist, she better be like Rose because I now have high expectations. She's got a sense of humor, she's a little weird and she talks to ghosts. However, she is brilliant. She quickly became a favorite supporting character in this book and I think she'd become one of your favorites, too. Her and Olivia definitely bonded, even if Olivia was paying her. I don't think that mattered.This is definitely a New Adult book but not so much for the sex, as it was pretty basic (as in, not very descriptive) compared to most NA books I've read but I believe it's more for the content of the book. It's definitely one I'd recommend to anyone 18 and over and looking for some good contemporary books to read. I'm excited for the next book which will be Kara's book and it's going to be so much fun, I just know it. You'll know it, too, once you read the epilogue.Reviewed by Jessica @ Step Into Fiction","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 31, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3F85REJEHSK64/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IXX4IYU#wasThisHelpful","R3F85REJEHSK64","A2LNHLLIDZLZ21","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2LNHLLIDZLZ21?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Very happy. My TR Hovey Papaya tree is almost 1.8 year old. It is about 5.5 ft tall. Expect it at maturity to be between 6 and 8 ft.  Started in pot on lanai Fort Myers Fl.  Then after much reading on the internet, looking at many pictures and videos of people growing them saw set of photos from someone with one in the ground. It had over 12 papayas on it... her husband braced it with wood supports because it was so heavy and her last photo was of the TR Hovey snapped broken from the weight of the fruit. At six months, I saw how fast my TR Hovey was growing in a pot on the lanai.. and decided to get it in the ground. I put it in back of the house in a garden bed with some afternoon light dappled shade.  There is a sprinkler system there.  I feed it regularly. Ground is covered with mulch. It has been about 1.5 years since I put it in the ground.  I noticed a prolific number of papayas and that the branches did not seem to be falling off around the papaya and rub the skin down. I also observed that there really was not a lot of room - papayas too tightly packed - they rub the skin of each other and rub the branches.  Also even tho I had it supported with a few tall stakes there were over 20 papaya and it looked very heavy. I decided to thin out the papaya (heart breaking) so each would have more room to grow big.  I immediately remove leaves that look like they are deteriorating (so they don't rub on the fruit).  Two days ago I harvested my first TR Hovey.

"Works great, flips up to clean under the metal sponge holder.  Liked it so much bought a second one to hang next to sponge... for a plastic cleaning brush I keep by the sink (to clean no knead bread items and other dough use items).  Recommend that the sticker is placed on the sink in a location that gets the least use so that it does not easily get bumped by pans/pots etc. Avoid bumping it or the plastic holder may snap. Be sure surface is clean and dry prior to attaching the sticker.  Take your time, make sure the sticker clips are level.  Only rated to .5 lbs so don't put anything too heavy on it.

"Worked very well for 9 inch pie pan because I want dough 12 inches wide. This crust bag is 14 inches wide however it is best to avoid rolling dough right to the edge (keep away from zipper). So I only roll dough to 12 inches (see picture).  I chill dough in a 4 inch wide flat round (puck shape) covered with saran wrap or in small zip lock bag for at least 45 minutes prior to rolling out.  Prior to rolling out the dough I have available on the counter a repurposed spice container that holds ""all purpose flour"" to easily sprinkle flour over the dough several times while rolling. See picture. Recommend in order to prevent dough sticking to the plastic that you sprinkle flour in steps: 1. sprinkle flour in the bag then zip shut and shake, 2. place dough in bag and make sure there is flour on both sides of the dough, 3. after rolling 1/3 of the way stop rolling the dough, unzip the bag and gently peel plastic back and check for sticking if it seems to be sticking at all (mine always does) sprinkle just a little more flour using the shaker, re-zip and flip to other side, gently peel plastic back and sprinkle just a little more flour, 4. after rolling out to 80% of the size you want, un-zip and check to see if plastic is sticking and if it is sprinkle a little more flour, also check the other side.  While the bag is open if you see any dough edges that have started to split you can pinch them closed.  When done rolling out to the size you want, unzip, flip one plastic side completely under the other side. Place pie pan upside down on the crust and cover with one hand.  With the other hand slip it under the pie crust plastic covers and gently flip it over onto pie pan. I place all my home made crusts in the freezer while preparing the filling.  For easy cleaning of the plastic bag, I fill sink with 2 inches of warm soapy water and gently brush the four plastic sides and zipper with a medium soft plastic brush I use for all dough utensil cleaning (no knead bread bowl, scraper, etc.).  A brush rinses out flour/dough much easier than a sponge. For drying, I place the washed rinsed pie crust bag on a kitchen towel and let it dry, turning it over to dry on both sides (see picture). I have also used a clothes pin and clipped it to a hanger over the laundry room sink.  I also use this crust bag (14 inch) to roll out no knead pizza dough - I bake the pizza on a 14 inch Lodge Cast Iron pizza pan.  Works great.. very nice product.

"Hydrated easily, all moss, no debris (no small sticks etc.).  Stored left over hydrated material in zip lock bag on patio where there is a bit of morning sun. Stored beautifully no deterioration.  Entire brick of Spagmoss wrapped about 25 orchids I mounted to trees or branches.  Beautiful product (like little blankets for the orchids).  See photos.  Update 7/20/2015 I kept the left over spagmoss in a zip lock bag on the lanai in partial shade and about once a month un zipped it to have some air exchange.

"Bright 60 lights and 20 ft long. Every light worked. Snap lid (yea) no screws to open and close box when changing the battery! The box has a loop built in to hang box. See pictures: I wrapped the light string around a pole on the lanai. Keeping the box at the bottom of the pole (inside away from the rain) it was suspended about 3/4 of an inch from pavers using Command Velcro hanger (so I can easily move it if needed). Placed zip lock bag around the box and white plastic to disguise the black box (see picture). If you are a perfectionist and using it on a flat surface, you can gently adjust the position of any lights that shine inward (they are directional).

"I have had the planter for 1 week. I have had many plant caddies over the years.. and this one seems to be top notch.  Works very well for a very large heavy planter on the lanai. Rolls smoothly.  Even with bumpy pavers on the lanai, I am able to push the caddy with the 200-300 lb. planter with one hand ! Truly amazing!  To make sure you planter drains properly make sure the hole at the bottom of your pot/planter is centered over the hole in the down under plant caddy.  A nice plus with the caddy is the markings across the arms which can help you make sure your pot/planter is centered on the caddy (see pictures I attached).  There are measuring marks along each arm on the caddy... and by making sure the same number of marks are outside your pot/plant on the caddy arm...  you can make sure your pot/planter is perfectly centered on the caddy (see picture). My caddy is outside in southwest Florida humidity and rain. Being able to easily move this large plant on the lanai will enable me to clean up the pavers get rid of the mold etc. more frequently and with so much less work. I am interested to see how the wheels hold up over time (do they get rusty?, do they fail?, do they continue to roll easily?).  A friend has four large pots on her lanai and I ordered her four of these caddies.  GREAT product.  (I put the coffee cup in one of the pictures for size reference.)  Update:  Using this for over 6 months now. Still easy to use with this heavy pot on the lanai (with bumpy pavers).","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2KPHQLWMQUO5Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001F5POIW#wasThisHelpful","R2KPHQLWMQUO5Z","A174ZRR1Q20V1J","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A174ZRR1Q20V1J?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"19 days after I put it up... the two little plastic mounts that hold the soap dish broke clean off the sticker.11/26/14 edited review: I had a StickerNizer soap dish hanging in the shower and the clips broke off (not sure how this happened). I liked this shower soap dish so much that I purchased the ""replacement stickers"" from Amazon and relocated the soap dish to a location in the shower where it may not be as likely to struck by something (brush?). - I also have two StickerNizer sponge holders (that I love) in my kitchen sink (in a location in the sink where pots/pans are not likely to bump the sponge holder). The sticker clips are rated to .5 lbs so be careful to not hang anything heavy on them or bump them too hard.  I am hoping that this soap dish sticker holds up a long time. Update: 4/20/15 After six months: 1. the two in the kitchen sink are doing well placed where they do not get bumped, 2. the ones in the laundry room sink also are placed where they don't get bumped and are doing well, 3.  The one in the master shower has broken three times and I have purchased new twice.  No matter where I place it somehow it is getting bumped. I have removed it totally from the shower.

"""Purchased EL2029A Ergorapido yesterday to specifically use on lanai pavers. Charge took about 16 hours. Charge lasted about 15 min & I was able to do the complete lanai on 15 min. & also the kitchen tile. For the lanai it did a great job picking up loose sand and loose mold chunks, small pine needles, dead bugs, leaves, etc. Of course did not pick up sand or debris in the cracks of pavers. This makes the lanai so nice to walk on barefoot and more importantly helps keep this debris out of the pool. Instructions state to totally deplete battery prior to re-charging in order to get the maximum run time. I clean the 2 filters (double cup filter one for fine dust) each time after use. I empty the dirt container & brush off the filters outside the house: a) since I may have picked up live bugs from the lanai & don't want to release the bugs in the house trash; & b) to make sure the dust given off when emptying the container and filters stays outside. I also rinse off/wash the dirt container and filters and let them dry off during the 16 hour recharge. Also great to be able to snap off the handheld to get in small areas behind planters on lanai. Note the brush attachment can be stored on the handle of the vacuum cleaner or on the charger stand."" Vacuum also has a feature to cut any hair around the brushes but must be charged fully to enable this feature. The orange bristles that contact the floor are very soft they do not mar my wood floors at all. The bristles simply assist lifting debris into the vacuum head and off the floor.  I have been using this vacuum for almost one year.  I'm a Prime Amazon member and normally purchase things on Amazon; however I purchased this vacuum for $99. at Costco.Note added 11/25/17 continues to work great.  After the first 16 hour charge, it seems to fully charge in 7 to 10 hours. I contacted the company by email with a question and they responded promptly:  They said even if I did not completely deplete the battery it was OK to return the vacuum to the charger and store it on the charger.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R37R1X0B2DG1XY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N7UFXZM#wasThisHelpful","R37R1X0B2DG1XY","A174ZRR1Q20V1J","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A174ZRR1Q20V1J?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Drip-less when pouring. Looks lovely.  Cap easily snaps snug and secure.  Sturdy and easy to wash. Nice weight and does not knock over easily. I put oil in both... extra virgin olive oil in one and canola oil in the other.  Ever so slightly tapered sides make it easier to hold on to the bottle when carrying or pouring.  And if you get the glass dirty.. so easy to wash because the cap is snapped snug... no risk of spilling or getting water/soap in the oil.  Could be a bit larger... but very easy to refill.Note added 11/25/2014  Still love these glass cruets. They never never drip!!!

To get the motion detector to come on at the distance you want it to... you can adjust it in several ways.  You can install it far back under the top cabinets or mid way, as well as, adjust the angle of the motion sensor so you get the light to turn on at the distance you prefer.

"Fairly large capsules with just a tad bit of odor. Actually the odor is barely there. But I'm letting you know there is some. I found once I left the cotton out of the bottle majority of it was gone. Though they are large these go down fairly easy. Only when I didn't have enough water was the problem. These have so much things listed not in them, I think they are trying to list it as a vegan product. But I think where they are gelatin capsules is what keeps then from being that.

"Now my hair color is a medium brown. So I thought since my hair is not that dark and the end are very light this would work. I tried four of the brightest colors just to see.  However it didn't really show. Only the bright orange one barely showed after going over my hair 20 times. By going up and down so many times it just frayed my hair. The strand that I did looked like I was trying to relive the 80s. So just out of curiosity I let my friend with blonde hair try it. It showed up perfectly in her hair. I also tried this on my son's hair, he has black hair. Which is very dark. It didn't show on his hair either. So I'm assuming this product is really on well for blondes and redheads.  I thought it would be cute for my hair.  It's a nice set, lots of colors.  To use take a section of hair, after brushing it.  Dampen the strand, the chalk sticks better with dampness.  Add a drop of water to the side of the chalk you are using. Then glide the chalk up and down that strand of hair, till desired effect. Repeat with other strand till finished. Not hard to use at all.  My friend said she had to wash her hair twice to get it all out.  Which means it does stay pretty well.

"Great for portion comtrol. As Americans we tend to oversize our portions. In this box comes five containers. A sandwich/meat open container. A vegetable container with a yellow lid. A fruit container with orange lid. A small sweets box with purple lid. An open container for condiments. And a slot for utensils. I found the containers with lids did not leak. I filled then with water and lined to l the top and bottom of the box with a paper towel. I then proceeded to turn the box on its side and over each way it stayed that way for five minutes. The paper towels came out dry. Another great feature I saw is that on the bottom of the containers is a place to write your our your child's name.

"The yellow and green tray are excellent. I just had to fill then once and place in the freezer. But the red tray is very shallow and flimsy. I had to freeze the tray and then re-add more water for it to do well. It's because the little Lego men are very tiny. Just two steps and the place down. Half of the water disappears. I tried these with jello, they didn't turn out well. Ice did fine. I didn't get to do the other ideas yet.I'm going to make chocolates and soaps on these next. These well make great tiny gifts.

"My son loves this cup. He's not ready for regular cups but he wants the big cups. This is the perfect solution. The lid screws on making it spill proof. The only way any liquid comes out is through the straw. The straw itself pops into the lid. You will have to pull the first bump through the straw opening to make it seal. It is smaller than the sippy cups. That is the only flaw. I do wish it was bigger. This has become our main cup for our son. We will be buying more.

The waist is where is runs small. Most of his 18 month pants are loose on him. However these pants are snug. The top is great no problem. Just the pants are snug. And my son isn't very chubby just really long. He's as tall as a three year old. So thats why I am so surprised. The set is made really well and they keep his body warm. Overall I really like it.

"Very much different than traditional stylus pens. It comes with a pen clip on the side. The tip is the silicon end. The difference is that you click down the top and the pen comes out of the silicon end. When finished click again and the pen is retracted back inside. Now art first that made me weary. Worried that if I put pressure on the tip am I going to scratch my screens?  Rest assured that the tip goes so far inside that it will not write or make a dent into your electronic devices. I fully tested it on my hands and papers to be sure. My electronic devices are precious to me, so I made sure. I've been using these for a week now. They have been great. I have one everywhere. One in the diaper bag, car, kitchen, living room and in the bedroom. This way I have one near me at all times. The kitchen once it's the most important one. I look up recipes online.

"It smells like an old woman product. Remind me of the after shower powders. But we don't but much based in smell. The instructions say to apply it after you wash your hair and towel dry. Then work it through your hair from the roots to the tips. Leave on 5-15 min. I'm guessing the longer time is for severe damaged hair. I did five minutes, though it was probably more like 7. I got in the shower to rinse it out, due to having somewhat long hair.  My hair did come out soft and stayed that way for three days. It does soften dry split ends really well. The smell fades when it dries. Overall its a great product. But..... I do feel I need to state something. Like I said I did rinse my hair in the shower/bathtub. So I came back later to bucket wash my delicates. I don't trust the machines and I had quite a few to wash. When I had got in the tub to run the water into the bucket. I noticed the bathtub was really slippery. I'm glad I had noticed it, I dread to think what would have happened if my toddler would have got in the tub. So word to the wise where you rinse your hair will be slippery afterwards. Be prepared to clean the surface after rinsing and drying your hair. If you have shorter hair, rinse in the sink. Much easier to clean. The product itself is great.

"Very nice set. You get the hard case, an drawstring bag, a cleaning cloth, a cord, frames and five lenses. These fit most face shapes very well. I have a round shaped face. These did well on my face. They have soft feeling arms that fit very comfortable.The muli colored one has different shades depending on where you are looking. I tried these while driving. The clouds had lighter shading (the top of the lenses). Whereas the road area was much sharper and darker.(around the bottom of the lenses).Clear lenses, for the good vision days when you just need protection from air and bugs.Yellow lenses. These are used when it at dawn or dusk.  When its starting to get dark or light out. It brightens your view. Allowing you to see much better.The black lenses are your polarized lenses. These allow you to see things very sharp. Increasing your view greatly. To me these are the best lenses.These are easy to remove. Just kinda pull down and slide the next lens up into place.The eyeglasses/sunglass string is so you can get a snug fit, tp make sure the glasses will stay on while cycling.You get a clothe drawstring bag. This is to protect the lenses when your not wearing the sunglasses. Also made of microfiber. So it's great for cleaning the lenses.The case is a hardshell case. It comes with a clip on the outside.

"The picture they show is false advertising. My pictures show a one and a half year old, my son. I really should give it one star. But my son is using it. Ppl like myself make purchases based on pictures. So have a baby Photoshop in gives ppl a false sense in what they are buying. But its not just the size I have a problem with. The mat was folded up in half when sent. It came in an envelope directly from the manufacturer. This causes the mat to have a crease. The only thing I can think to do to correct this will be put it between some books and hope it works. Another problem is the ""water"" pen. Mine drips like crazy. You don't even have to press in it and it drips. We made the mistake to fill it up. Not even the minutes and it was almost completely empty.  The only reason for two stars is my son did play with it.

"Great lightweight wooden watch. This is a very handsome piece. You can adjust the band to your size simply by removing a pin. This will take it down quite a bit. After removing the pins take it down a section. Then you will insert the pin to connect it. This is easy to set the time. Pull the turn dial as far out as it will go. Then turn it to set the time.  Along with time this watch also features three small display dials. One is for the day of the week. I found that to be interesting. The second and third one is to tell the date. One has even numbers the other has odd numbers. So if its an even date you will set the odd one on a dot before the next odd day. And you would set even one on the date that it is. This is so the next day it comes up on the dot and the odd day will show the date. This is an attention getting piece. It goes great with everything. It's fall time.

"It's the mighty pillow that could. Very good massage pillow. It is easy to use. Plug in the power cord and connect it to the connector the pillow. Place pillow where desired and push the power button. Push once to cut it on with heat. Press twice to cut the heat off. Press and hold to cut the pillow off. Really simple. The massager heads are hidden under the flap. Which can be unbuttoned if you want to have strong heat.  The outside design of the ""pillow"" allows you to use it almost anywhere your body needs a massage. You can do the back of your upper thighs easily. And then turn around in one movement and do your calves. The design gives you more ability to work the angles of your body. This pillow has a 20 minutes shut off timer. This helps to keep the motor from overheating. I believe it will stay off for 20 min after shut off. Honestly I have not had it go to 20.  It is a very strong massage.  And I only can do ten min at a time max. This its small and compact. But very powerful and easy to use.  This goes perfectly with modern decor.

" 2:56 MinsI have owned a ridiculous amount of Bluetooth speakers. After several months since my last Bluetooth speaker purchase (RIVA turbo X) I began getting that nagging itch to continue my seemingly endless search for a product offering me complete satisfaction. I had been impressed with several of my previous speaker purchases, but now the AIWA Exos-9 has significantly elevated my standards.DESIGN: This speaker is clearly designed with the emphasis of maximizing sound, rather than style. This is evident by sharing a similar platform as the highly regarded ac powered Peachtree DEEPBLUE2.  As shown by a previous reviewers photo of the AIWA next to the Soundlink 3, this is a big speaker. It is roughly 2.5x the size and 2x the weight of the JBL Xtreme, but can easily be moved around one handed using its handle.  The build quality is solid and although wont win any style awards, it has a contemporary design that will flow well with the dcor of practically any environment. The chassis is mostly a textured plastic similar to many home speakers with exception of a glossy top strip that also houses the LED display. This may offer some sort of resonance benefit as the body of my Martin guitar is made from a similar material. The handle is rubber adding friction for easier carrying. It would have been nice for the corners to have been protected with a similar material as the size of this speaker will make it prone to knocking obstacles when being moved around.  The large old school style volume dial is metal along with the speaker grill. The grill is not removable which may be a bummer to some people, but I prefer to keep the drivers protected. On back is an easily removable battery and on/off power toggle switch common on subwoofers. I would prefer the power control be more accessible being placed on the top or front, but thats getting a bit nitpicky. On top is the touch capacitive LED control panel. The panel provides a 4-band EQ, play/pause and Link controls. The Link control is to pair with a 2nd Exos-9 for people better off than I who can afford 2 units. Absent are fwd/back track and Bluetooth pairing controls. The absence of the Bluetooth pairing button is actually a benefit Ill discuss later. The speaker does not have a proximity sensor, only being activated by touch that has a bit of response lag. Once activated, the controls provide easy navigation and response lag is barely noticeable.  The Blue LED displays will only remain lit for a few seconds which is good or bad pending your preference. I personally like it as it extends battery life and prevents a bright distraction when listening to while falling asleep.FEATURES:  This speaker reasonably lacks features commonly found on the smaller Bluetooth speakers such as speakerphone functionality and water resistance. However, it offers some uncommon features I find more valuable. The inclusion of an on board EQ is something I had truly missed from the boombox days. Sure most music player apps provide an EQ, but if youre like me and use your phone or tablet to watch video you will be glad to have to ability to tune the audio to your preference. This was a downfall of my previous favorite portable speaker. Unlike most portable speakers, the RIVA Turbo X comes to life at higher volumes sounding fuller as you crank it up, but lacks luster when listening at mid-level or below without offering a means to adjust the frequencies (low-end) that our ears are less sensitive to at low volumes.  In contrast, the Soundlinks (including the mini) provide ample sound fullness at low volumes but washes out the mids making it hard to hear dialect during movies. The large knob volume control is a welcome uncommon feature. Adjusting the volume via your media player one tick can make a pronounced volume change, whereas, the knob allows infinite volume control precision. Another notable feature is the swappable battery.  Not only does it allow you to keep music playing during extended outings, but AIWA is planning to release an extended battery pack.  If you plan on keeping your speaker for a couple years, keep in mind other speakers will increasingly need to be tethered to a wall as charge capacity diminishes and offer no simple way to swap out for a new battery.  I have yet to test out the battery life, but coming anywhere near the 8 hours listed will be phenomenal with how loud this thing is and how hard it hits even at mid-level volume. The Bluetooth reception is outstanding with a range notably better than any other speaker Ive owned. Additionally, pairing is the simplest experience Ive had. There is no need to enter the speaker in pairing mode as it continuously sends its signal out for other devices to discover. If its already paired with a device you can still connect it to a different device without having to disconnect first from the previous device. Sure this can backfire as pranksters or an angry neighbor can hi-jack your speaker, but in reality it is quite convenient if you have multiple devices you connect it to.SOUND:  Granted, louder and bigger sound is expected given its size relative to other portable speakers. However, the sound difference seems greater than the proportional size differences. Next to the overall loudness the Exos-9 puts out, the largest improvement over its competitors in the $300.00 range is the bass. Even after experiencing it, I still find it unbelievable a battery operated speaker is able to vibrate the floor on the main level of my home while playing in the basement.  The sound level remains steady whether on battery or AC mode.  Im not audiophile by any means, but can describe the bass as tight or clean not spilling over into the mid frequency range leaving clear mids and highs while simultaneously thumping out lows you can feel.  Even with the EQ setting turned off, the bass output is remarkable. The minority out there who dont care for, or are sensitive to, bass will likely have to dial it back on the EQ, but the rest will be thrilled with it right out of the box. The speaker does not incorporate the digital signal processing as so heavily relied upon by all others (excluding Turbo X), therefore you can encounter distortion if you crank the bass setting all the way up.BONUS:Despite the AIWA name and some styling characteristics true to the original brand, this is made by a startup company that bought the naming rights. Being a startup company, customer service appears to be a priority. Included in my speaker package was a personally signed letter from the CEO thanking for its purchase and offering a full refund or return to include prepaid postage if unsatisfied with the purchase. Very few retailers (Amazon being an exemption) even fewer manufacturers pay postage for the return of a non-defective product.OVERALL:There is no louder or better sounding portable speaker within its price range.  Honestly, I have not personally heard a portable speaker in any price range that can come close to matching the performance of the Exos-9. I must admit this is not the ideal speaker for everyone. If you only can afford or desire to limit yourself to one all around Bluetooth speaker to listen around the house and serve as a frequent travel companion or beach buddy take a look at the RIVA Turbo X, Soundlink 3, Megaboom, or the recently released JBL Xtreme and Fugoo XL pending your feature and sound preference. All are far easier travel companions being much smaller, more durable, and have better battery life. If you are just looking for a speaker to sit in one place in your home, then buy a surround system or add a Bluetooth connector to your existing one. If you want the uncontested best performing speaker that can easily be moved room to room, outside and to occasional events then the Exos-9 is the obvious choice. Having a Soundlink Mini, or one of the bigger but still excellent travel companion speaker mentioned above, is ideal to optimally meet all your portable speaker needs. Personally, out of all my Bluetooth speakers, this is the one I would absolutely not part ways with.  For the record, I am not affiliated with AIWA in anyway. Feel free to take a look at my other reviews, but keep in mind my overall impression will likely be knocked down a notch after the new standard the AIWA Exos-9 just set.VIDEO NOTES:The RIVA Turbo X was the only speaker I've owned that could even come close to holding together at top volume during the bass notes of this song. The audio recording quality of my iPod Touch does neither justice, particularly the bass of the Aiwa is much cleaner in person, but still gives you an idea of how fuller the sound of the Exos-9 is and how its louder at 3/5th the volume level as the Turbo X maxed out. You will need to play through a decent speaker or ideally headphones to distinguish the differences","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2L206INLUOKVH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WF78GS4#wasThisHelpful","R2L206INLUOKVH","A1PGUHJ9ZN499P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1PGUHJ9ZN499P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought this because it was the cheapest 100% down pillow I could find with a reasonable fill. The pillow is phenomenal. The fill quantity is perfect for a side or back sleeper, would be a bit much for a stomach sleeper. Unlike most feathered pillows, this holds its shape well. There is no effort fluffing the pillow to get it just right, it is odorless and I've not noticed any down escaping after several months of use. If your looking for a down pillow that matches or is superior to any other regardless of price then you will be happy with this purchase.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R38EPJ2TS8UJ30/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RSH8CAI#wasThisHelpful","R38EPJ2TS8UJ30","A1PGUHJ9ZN499P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1PGUHJ9ZN499P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Initial impression were positive. The craftsmanship is excellent leaving no concerns of a short lifespan. My P938 easily fits inside while avoiding any play and the outside surface offers ample friction to keep the holster in place in your pocket. While my initial impressions still hold true, spending time with the holster carrying the P938 revealed its shortcomings. The hole in the bottom at the end of the guns barrel is almost like funnel for any debris in your pocket to end up inside the barrel. Of course things like lint are not going to cause a firing malfunction, but anyone experienced with firearms makes sure the barrels stay squeaky clean. The problem is accentuated by the barrel extending a couple millimeters outside the end of the holster. If you you leave something like change in your pocket you'll likely end up with some small scratches on the finish of your gun. The other major flaw is; despite the seemingly good initial fit, the gun easily slides out of the holster. The tacky outside keeps the holster in your pocket, but I've experienced a couple times of seeing my gun on the chair after standing up. So my initial impressions would of had me rating this product as a 5/5, but after experiencing a couple major design flaws during use, I have ended up purchasing the cheaper Unkle Mikes pocket holster in size 2. In contrast to the Nemesis, initial impressions are only ok with only single stitch seems and far less of friction surface to keep the hoster fastened in your pocket, but it just works. The P938 does not slide out when you sit and the there is no hole on the bottom exposing your barrel to any debris or object you forgot in your pocket. Additionally, it has extra padding providing further protection and enhancing concealment by avoiding the pocket imprint you will notice with the Nemesis.","2.0 out of 5 stars","August 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1LSCS61TYA6A7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0048KIVE0#wasThisHelpful","R1LSCS61TYA6A7","A1PGUHJ9ZN499P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1PGUHJ9ZN499P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am a self confessed gadget junkie, but the Voyage is my first experience with an e-reader. After owning countless Android and iOS tablets and utilizing the Kindle app for sporadic reading, I decided to purchase this e-reader as my time devoted to reading digital books greatly increased when studying for a certification. The tablets did a decent job for light reading, but I noticed my reading duration tolerance was less when using a tablet in comparison to the tradition paper based platform. With e-readers striving to offer the closest ""book like"" experience, I was hoping that the Voyage would increase the efficiency of my studies and for the most part it has met my expectations, but the Voyage has some shortcomings given its high price tag.PROS: Performing a literature review shows the Voyage as being the undisputed champion of e-readers. It has all the general features likely to be found desirable, rather than trivial, by most people. Such features include: front lit display; good battery life (phenomenal compared to tablets); easy navigation; crisp, clear and relatively glare free display; lightweight and ultra portable design. Where this version particularly stands out over the competition is its build quality and ambient light sensor. The ambient light sensor is my favorite feature working well enough for me to avoid having to frequently change the light settings manually with each change in environment. The pressure based page turn option with haptic feedback in addition to the familiar page swipe is a welcomed feature, but certainly not one that would sway me to this device as it may help with one handed operation for people with small hands but I find page swiping to continue to be superior form of navigation. The final feature allowing this e-reader to hold the thrown is its class leading legibility. Comparing the Voyage to a friends Paperweight does reveal a settle but noticeable diffience in clarity, however both are superior to normal book print.CONS: The biggest drawback of this device is the lack of features to justify the dramatic increase in cost over its sibling. Although the ambient light sensor is a valuable feature the Voyage has over other e-readers, it is a standard feature for tablets and smartphones. Features that are unexcusably absent are an accelerometer for automatic screen orientation and an audio jack. Again, standard features the most basic tablet or smartphone possess. The orientation feature would be very valuable when reading text books that have tables included. Rather than simply turning the device to read the entire table from left to right, I have to either manual change the orientation or click on the table to scroll left and right which really impairs your efficiency when reading.  With Amazon beginning to push audio playback option for books via their Android and iOS apps, it is a shame that their dedicated Kindle hardware is unable to take advantage of the feature making better use of time such as being stuck in traffic. The final con worth mentioning is the processor power being inept to eliminate lag time when navigating through pages or menus. Yes, it is more power than offered by others, but does not meet expectations set by its price and falls pathetically short of tablets.OVERALL:The Voyage offers a superior reading experience over tablets, but only a neglibly better one over the much cheaper Paperwhite. Amazon has turned into the Apple of the e-reader market with the Voyage, offering a well designed and built product that meets its intended role but skimps on features necessary to justify its price. The fact it is unable to do much more than offer a reading experience is a bonus for me as it eliminates distractions. The problem is the basic omissions that prevent it from maximizes use for its intended purpose.The reading experience compared to tablets definately justifies the purchase of an extra gadget, but the Voyage fails to justify its signifcant price bump over the Paperwhite. If you don't think you really have the need the ambient light sensor, I recommend the Paperwhite as it really appears to be the best value for the money..","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R10H21BAT2FTOA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IOY8XWQ#wasThisHelpful","R10H21BAT2FTOA","A1PGUHJ9ZN499P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1PGUHJ9ZN499P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Chad Lindberg is such a poor actor he makes me a believer in the authenticity of Ghost Adventures. His reaction of an acute onset of chest pain was laughable and his monotone narrations are so bad he actually makes Zak Bagans sound worthy of an Emmy. If your going to start off with people questioning the credibility of a show by casting an actor as an investigator, then at least hire one who is believable with a smidgen of charisma. The show does have good production value with a lot brought over from GA (although not replicated as well) and a decent enough plot attempt to seperate it from others, but terrible casting provides no chance to be a success. Ghost Adventures has its fair share of cheesy  moments, but at least it is entertaining. Hopefully for Nick they accept him back when this show gets the ax.","2.0 out of 5 stars","February 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQBYJF7W1VSOT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OO82UDE#wasThisHelpful","RQBYJF7W1VSOT","A1PGUHJ9ZN499P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1PGUHJ9ZN499P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Everytime I purchase a new bluetooth speaker I think it will be my last time as my inventory is already excessive, but then one is released with a new feature or design I just can't resist. Well, it happened again despite being satified with the performance of my current keepers being the Soundlink Mini, Soundlink III and UE Boombox. With the Turbo X, the prospect of a portable speaker incorporating a new engineering approach to offer stereo separation was too tempting to pass up and I am glad I didn't.DESIGN: Just about everyone is familar with size and dimensions of the Big Jambox. Well then you now know what to expect when seeing the Turbo X in person.  The craftsmenship looks and feels stellar, on par with offerings from the likes of Bose and UE. The look is best described as 'classy' with a high gloss plastic top and bottom and a 360 deg metal grill wrapping around the unit sitting on rubber pads to protect the bottom surface. The plastic used is best described by compairing to the look and feel of top tier LG phones. On top are recessed touch capacitive controls that illuminate in a soft blue glow triggered via proximetry sensor with the wave of a hand over the top really adding to the sophisticated look.  The one ding I have on it's visual design is the somewhat tacky ""RIVA TURBO"" branding on the fromt of the unit. I also always prefer to listen with the surround mode on during music in addition to video and the unit does not recall the previous setting after powering off, requiring you to activate surround mode each time. Overall, the Bose Mini continues to offer my favorite build in it aluminum unibody, but the Riva Turbo will certainly be found  aesthetically pleasing by nearly all and some may prefer it over others pending personal preference.FEATURES:Especially compared to Bose, this thing is feature packed. The top controls are your basic power, bluetooth, mute, volume controls along with a Turbo button to maximize volume and surround button to enter surround mode. The touch capacitive buttons work excpetionally well being responsive without being oversensitive and the recessessed design prevents accidental contact. The proximetry sensor is actually quite usefull when using in a dark environment illuminating the buttons before touching to ensure you hit the button you intended to. Countless times have I unpaired the bluetooth device on both Bose models when pushing the wrong button trying to adjust volume. The Turbo mode is awesome and useless at the same time. The volume this thing reaches is great, but having to hit an additional button to reach the top volume is a little gimmicky to me. The surround (Trillium Surround) button unleashes the true feature that sets this speaker above the others. Designed to enchance video surround function, I have found it to be equally effective advancing music as well. The application available for iOS and Android is a nice bonus providing a means to turn on/off the surround and turbo setting, shows precise battery life and allows increased volume control but unable to replace you go-to audio player app. The speaker also takes some of the best features of others such as the JBL Charge with its charge out feature to give your phone a boost of juice when needed and is splash resistance. Like may other bluetooth speakers other than Bose, the speaker does include a speakerphone function with a built in microphone although I have yet to trial it.  The feature that I actually miss not included with this speaker are a wireless charging platform and particularly a case for travel.SOUND:The size and price of this speaker places it in the same category as the Soundlink III, Big Jambox, Pill XL and my sorta oldie but goodie UE Boombox (not the UE Boom). The performance exceeds anything I have owned or sampled. I thought I would never be amazed by the sound of a bluetooth speaker again following the thump put out by the Mini Soundlink given its dimunitive size. The Turbo X does not provide the same degree of low end oomph of the Soundlink III or especially the UE Boombox, but is certainly not lacking in producing substantial bass for its size that is what audiophiles would likely praise as being a cleaner bass. Lacking dedicated tweeters was an initial concern of mine that was eliminated as soon as I played the first song, easily on par with or exceeding the competition. Being a fan of bass, my choices of previous bluetooth speakers tended to sacrifice the mids in order to obtain my craving for the low end. The mids delivered from the Riva while maintianing satisfactory bass have revealed what I have been missing, allowing me to enjoy songs again that I had been burned out on. Listening to songs from Imagine Dragons that I have found most protable speakers to really struggle really demonstrated the Turbo X's balance throughout the frequency range. Something I can Never Have by NIN is another song I like to use to compare speakers due to its complex melody range and the Riva again came out on top in overall quality. The Soundlink III certainly sounds great and similar to its smaller sibling offers the best bass to size ratio of any other product I have listened to, but as with all portable speakers I've experienced up to now stereo seperation is minimal at best even when ideally positioned. The stereo seperation delivered from the Turbo X is what gives me the same WOW factor I had when first hearing the low end generated from the Soundlink Mini. The notable stereo seperation defies logic given the limited physical seperation of the drivers within the speaker. The addition of the ""Trillium Surround"" technology and phenomenal mid range make this speaker far superior than the competition when using the speaker for audio watching media on my phone and tablet.  The overall volume appears to reach a higher level than most with its ""Turbo"" mode on, but what is most impressive is its ability to maintain a consistent sound signature throughout the volume range unlike others kicking in the digital processor limiting the low end to avoid distortion. Keep in mind that since digital processing is kept to a minimum in this unit you will be able create disortion if you tinker too much with a custom equalizer. The claimed battery life far supasses any other speaker I have owned. I can't say it reaches it's acclaimed 24 hrs battery life, but have used it on battery power for 4 hrs straight with 83% power remaining so the 24 hrs claim seems reasonable.CONCLUSION:Is this speaker worth the $50 premium over the Soundlink III....YES. I was hesitant purchasing a $350 speaker made in China by a start up company despite being designed by experienced audio engineers in the USA. Thanks to the ease of returning products through Amazon I decided to take a chance and am glad I did as this product not only beat but surpassed my expectations. The performance and features easily lead this speaker to the top a crowded bluetooth market. Riva states they are setting a new standard in portable audio and have backed up that claim.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3JVYAU4P441D3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IPSC6F6#wasThisHelpful","R3JVYAU4P441D3","A1PGUHJ9ZN499P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1PGUHJ9ZN499P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Having spent a decade of performing strength training at gym, I turned in my gym membership in for home equipment over the past 2 years. With a squat rack, utility bench, 400# olympic barbell set, Bowflex 5-90# adjustable dumbells/stand and door mount pull up bar, I am able to nearly replicate my gym routine. The one aspect I miss is a cable machine to interchange with dumbell exercises. Not being able to afford the price of a decent cable machine w/ sufficient weight, I decided to give the resistance bands a shot at complimenting my barbell core exercises alternating dumbell exercises with bands.  The results have been mostly satisfying.PROS:Most obvious-cost efficiencyGreat for toning/scuplting musclesWorks stabilizer muscles similar to free weightsDoes a fair job replicating cable exercisesFantastic build quality with fail safe design (woven inner core)Caribiner clips make for easy and quick band exchangeComfortable hand grips on pivot platformResistance ratings appear on par with free weightsMost versatile workout productExtra set of handles for circuit trainingNo need for a spotterCONS:Mounting options when using heavy resistanceDoor anchor not sufficient for top/bottom door mounting on standard doors when using heavy resistance (I have the welt to prove it)Door mount slides up and down when mounted to side of doorsEccentric contraction does not compare to other forms of resistance trainingNeed to add weekly protectant to maximize life of bandsOVERALL:The build quality and design of the Bodylastic bands is great and likley meets or exceeds any other bands out there. Being a therapist, I have seen many theraband strips made of similar material snap over time and the snap gaurd tech is a welcome safety advantage these have over  competitors. For the average individual, these bands offer the versatilty necessary to be utilized as the sole means to increase strength and maintain overall good conditioning. For bodybuilders, or anyone looking to bulk up, these bands are a good adjunct to your core barbell exercises (bench press, squat, deadlift, shoulder press) and offer a means to prevent loss of strength during prolonged stretches away from the gym like vacations. The primary drawback with this mode of strengthening is finding a suitable mounting option when using heavy resistance. For example, to perform tricep pull downs I have to use mount to the top of my solid garage door nearly flush with the door frame and deadbolted. Bodyelastics does offer a heavy duty door frame anchor, but I would be hesistant to utilize it on anything other than a solid door when using the amount of resistance I typically need to tire my muscles within 6-10 reps.  Simply stated, elastic bands are difficult to safely use when needing heavy resistance. I plan to buy some eyebolts and install them into a stud in the house for the ideal mount which will adequately replicate a cable machine for me. Due to the reasons stated above I really cant think of a need to purchase a larger resistance package than this one regardless of your strength with the possible exception of circuit trainers wanting several stations ready to go. If you are an experienced weightlifter and your idea is to replace core strengthening exercises with these bands you will be disappointed. However, If you go in wanting to change up your adjunct excercises, focus on isolated lacking areas, or maintain strength for extended durations between gym visits then these will meet your expectations. The build quality, design and veratility features of the product itself warrants 5 stars. Elastic bands as a form of strengthening exercise equipment as a whole 3.5/5 stars.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1DWQOUNMUMLWA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006O0GDMO#wasThisHelpful","R1DWQOUNMUMLWA","A1PGUHJ9ZN499P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1PGUHJ9ZN499P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Being able to purchase a thermal camera at such an affordable price ($200 directly from Seek website) was quite exciting and as a whole the camera has lived up to my expectations. Flir was the first to bring a somewhat affordable ($350) thermal cam to a phone, but it was stuck to one phone model and a rather poor heat sensor resolution masked by overlaying onto a standard camera image. The seek is the current best value of all thermal cameras, but not without its flaws and with Flir's announced 2nd generation of the Flir One to likely be surpassing it when released later this year.DESIGN: The minimalistic design with a magnesium alloy body no bigger than your thumb is quite impressive. Despite it's small size the unit appears and feels sturdy with the only vulnerable area possibly being the micro USB adapter leaving a slight gap between the camera and phone when connected. A nice suprise is the excellent case included with the camera to ensure you can drop it in a bag or pocket and be worry free.FUNCTION: The camera performs essential functions most buyers would be using it for well. Temperature readings appear relatively accurate with the camera centered on the object. I do not have a high end thermal camera to compare it, but readings from human foreheads consistently read 96 to 97 degrees.  Viewing a half filled hot beverage thermos clearly shows how much fluid remains in the thermos. For the 1 functional task I used it in the camera served its purpose well allowing me to track down the area in my attic water was seeping through. Clarity of the image greatly dimishes beyond 8-10 ft but my dog in the back yard at night is easy to see and tell he is a dog from 50 ft away, of course items with less heat differential from surrounding are difficult to see as image. Although your not going to get the same image quality as multi thousand dollar thermal cameras, it is important to keep in mind even those will have worst clarity than your basic cell phone camera. There is a faint but audible continuous shutter sound the camera uses to recalibrate, but I did not find it aknowingly noticeable.SOFTWARE:  Setting up the camera is as simple as can be. Download the app, plug the camera in, it automatically opens the app and your ready to go. The software provides several setting to adjust color, although I found black and white contrast setting to provide the most detail and keep it on set on that option. There is a basic setting that simply provides the thermal image with no information, a setting with a centered crosshair marker indicating the temp, another setting to apply hi and low temp thresholds to only see images (in color) of items beyond or below a set temp and a hi-low temp setting providing two crosshairs that indicate the highest and lowest temperatures within the image. The high-low setting is useless at this point because of the tempurature gradient issue the camera presently has where there is always a 5-7 deg temperature diferrence from one side of the image to the other making temperature readings outside of the center of the field inaccurate. After contacting Seek, I received an email 4-5 days later stating a future application update would correct the gradient issue. That was over a month ago and no further app update has been released. I am doubtful how software can fix a problem that I perceive to be caused from the thermal sensors picking up some heat dissapated by the camera itself, but I confess to not be a technological expert and will have to continue to wait and see. The software does provide ability to record video and snap photos.OVERALL: Despite the temperature gradient issue, I can still recommend this product as a whole. It is still able to perform just about any useful purepose of a $1000+ thermal camera and is a breakthrough in bringing expensive tech to a mainstream price. However, if you can wait a few months I would wait for the release of the 2nd gen Flir One. It will provide all the same feature as the original Flir One with a thermal resolution in line with the Seek overlapped onto a higher resolution standard camera image in a similar form factor as the Seek (lightning and micro USB) and most likely without the gradient issue for a competitive price around $250.Note: Review based on use with a Samsung Note 3UPDATESeek exposed me as not being a technical guru as they released an app update correcting the gradient issue, thus eliminating the primary shortcoming. I am still interested in seeing the next gen Seek One with its overlapping image feature and a higher resolution thermal sensor, but would not hesitate in purchasing the Seek camera again rather than wait for Flir's upcoming release. There probably is not a better tech bargain out there.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1DNV3O4TPIP32/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NYWAHHM#wasThisHelpful","R1DNV3O4TPIP32","A1PGUHJ9ZN499P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1PGUHJ9ZN499P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My wireless IP camera days began about 2 years ago with Foscam 8918 followed by an upgrade to their 720p HD 8921 model. Although overall satisfied with the Foscam cameras, they both would frequently lose connection needing to be restarted before reestablishing a video stream. In January I purchased the Dropcam Pro HD which was quickly returned after finding no workaround from the need to add another monthly bill to provide any real utility. The Dropcam Pro HD may be ideal for a few, but most will find the Samsung to be a much better value. I'll try to provide a comparison hopefully helping prerspective buyers make the right decision.DESIGN: From a utility perspective both cameras offer virtually the same design with a similar mounting option and having a wide angle lens providing a great field of view without the need of pan/tilt feature as found of the Foscams. The Dropcam offers a minimalistic and sleek design. Using a combination of high grade plastic and aluminum makes for a well built camera that blends in with nicer environments well. The Samsung is a little bulkier and in typical Samsung fashion, rely solely on plastic for its construction. Despite the plastic the body is solid with good heft suggestion a good, albeit less attractive build in comparison to the Dropcam. The best comparison would be of a galaxy phone compared to an iPhone or HTC One. WINNER-DropcamSETUP: Setting up wireless IP cameras such as those offered by Foscam can be quite the challenge due to the need to create security loopholes in your wireless router necessary for viewing the cameras when away from home. Both the Dropcam and Samsung cameras make the setup so easy that you could have either up and running within seconds regardless of how technologically illiterate you may consider yourself. Both cameras even allow you to have the camera up and running without using a computer. However, at the time I hooked up the Dropcam, only the iOS app was able to be used for initial setup. The Smartcam allows you to setup the camera using either an iOS or Android device.  WINNER-SamsungIMAGE QUALITY: The Dropcam and Samsung both provide great day and night images relative to Wi-Fi/IP cameras. If hard pressed to choose which offers the best clarity I would have to say Dropcam edges out the Samsung. On paper the Dropcam has a slightly larger field of view. In reality I found no difference in the area shown through the video streams, but the Samsung somehow manages to do so with notably less of a 'fisheye' effect. Overall, I give the Dropcam a slight edge to the Samsung but definitely not enough to alone impact a purchase decision. WINNER-DropcamPERFORMANCE: Keep in mind that camera load time and stream delay will be greatly impacted by your internet speed and wireless router. For the purpose of my comparison both cameras were connected to the same internet connection on the 5Ghz band of the same router. The duration it takes to retrieve the video stream from the moment of launching each cameras respective applications is roughly the same. The video and audio stream of the Dropcam experienced about a 5 second delay. The delay of Samsungs streaming was notable shorter at about 3 seconds. Two seconds may not seem like much, but those are valuable seconds if using as a baby monitor and responding to a child in need. The Samsung camera has only lost connection once during the few months I've had it. WiFi cameras remaining connected has a lot to do with the stability of your internet service, but the Smartcam has been much better at keeping its video stream than my Foscam cameras. I did not own the Dropcam long enough to compare. If you notice your internet frequently dropping off or have to reset your router then you will experience problems with any Wi-Fi camera. WINNER-SamsungFEATURES: Both cameras have a built in speaker and mic with the Samsung offering a selection of 3 lullabies. The lullaby feature certainly is not much of a selling point for me as I assume it wont be for most others, but the speaker of the Samsung is louder and the microphone records louder when utilizing as an intercom. The Samsung audio stream plays loud enough for me to utilize the camera as a baby monitor without the need to hook my phone up to an external speaker, whereas, I needed the external speaker for the Dropcam to feel confident enough I could hear everything when in an environment with background noise such the TV. Recording capability is another essential feature of these cameras. If you don't need recording ability I would recommend sticking to traditional baby monitors to avoid the streaming delay altogether. This is the Dropcam's Achilles heel as it requires you to pay a $10 monthly charge as their minimum cloud recording package. There is NO way to record video without use of their cloud storage. The recorded image are accessable for a 10 day revolving window without any means to delete video that you prefer not to have other people possibly viewing. Samsung records video triggered manually or through motion detection to an on board SD card. Some people may fear if the camera is stolen, the evidence is stolen along with it, but images taken once motion detection is activated are automatically sent to your email.  WINNER-SamsungOVERALL:The cost of the Samsung Smartcam Pro HD after one year at $220 ($190 for camera, $30 for SD card), vs the minimal total cost of the Dropcam $300 ($200 for camers, $100 for annual cloud plan). At two years of ownership the Smartcam comes in at $180 cheaper. Each camera offers great hardware and have their strengths and weakness when directly compared but once taken in the total cost of ownership the Smartcam is a far better choice unless for whatever reason you have a need for 24/7 recording rather than relying on motion activate recording.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RFR1GAD3IQX7U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00J38NVHE#wasThisHelpful","RFR1GAD3IQX7U","A1PGUHJ9ZN499P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1PGUHJ9ZN499P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The soft cover offers the following key features making its purchase a smart decision for anyone who owns or are looking at buying a Soundlink Mini:1.  It offers protection in all the right places while creating a bumper around the edges to protect the exposed grill.  This is vastly superior to the folding cover on the Soundlink II.  The Soundlink II leaves the prone to dings edges exposed.  As feared,  my Soundlink II shows signs of contact on its corners despite never realizing it had knocked into something.  I'm glad to be worry free about the same thing happening to my Mini with this cover in place.2. As expected it is easy to install and fits perfectly.  It retains the overall physical appeal of the speaker with the color choices adding a little fun to the classy look of the speaker.3. The price may seem a little high,  but if you consider the price of some phone covers it seems more reasonable.  I had initially planned on buying the relatively expensive travel case,  but after seeing how well this adds protection it has eliminated the need for that extra purchase.Sure I would have loved it if this came with the speaker to begin with,  but would rather it came with the included charging platform that would have likely been a much more expensive accessory if purchased separately.  The cover is designed well,  looks good and well worth the price.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 20, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RDT7M3UNZ4RFW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00D42AB50#wasThisHelpful","RDT7M3UNZ4RFW","A1PGUHJ9ZN499P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1PGUHJ9ZN499P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is my latest edition to my rediculous collection of Bluetooth speakers and truly stands out in the palm sized category. While I found Logitech's UE Boombox to edge out the Soundlink II in the larger category, the Mini Soundlink takes the thrown against the UE Boom in the battle agmonst the little guys. It isn't even fair to compare the Jambox to Soundlink Mini as the performance of the Mini is in a differen't league despite technically being in the same category of speakers.BUILD: The aluminum body of this speaker exudes premium craftsmanship as expected for its price and is notably superior to all but perhaps the UE Boom. The UE Boom is the only speaker I can give credit to as being equal in looks and feel, but edging out the Mini due to it's splash resistant design. I was somewhat surprised that Bose created a scaled down version of the Soundlink given its rather small size to begin with, but they were certainly successful producing a product that meets the portability standards set by the Jambox, altthough ever so slightly larger in dimensions.FEATURES: As with all Bose products, emphasis is focused on sound rather than features on the unit itself. There is no microphone for speakerphone ability or track controls as found on many of its pint sized competitors. It does include all the necessary basics like a button to easily pairing and storing up to 6 devices and of course an auxillary button for when you connect a player diectly to the unit as well as volume controls. Athough the battery life is rated less than the competition at 7 hours, Bose suprised me by including a unique docking station for easy charging. You just place the speaker on the station and it slides right into place with a little charm sound to let you know it's juicing up. I can say that the speaker was still playing after listening overnight surpassing the 7 hour mark at low volume. Although I was pleasantly surprised that Bose included (instead of charging extra) the docking station, it is worth noting no case was included and I have yet spent the extra money for one, although I did get the soft cover. The soft cover protects the prone to dings edges offering more protection than the folding cover of the Soundlink that leaves the edges exposed while protecting the grill.SOUND: Many palm sized speakers out there offer good mid and high range sounds similar to the quality of the Mini, but none have found a way to engineer decent bass out of such dimunative dimensions. At least not until now. In small to medium sized rooms Bose somehow managed to engineer this thing to produce bass that will satisfy nearly anyone regardless of speaker size. This is where it truly surpasses competition such as the JBL Flip and even more notably the evenly priced UE Boom. Granted the bass is toned down drastically when cranked up due to the sound processor protecting from distortion, so for large rooms or outdoors the Soundlink II or UE Boombox remain better options. The UE Boom does have the unique 360 deg output, but placing this next to the wall will still fill the room with the same volume of sound despite its unidirectional waves. If you plan on primarily listening to this thing in your bedroom, bathroom, office, kitchen...etc, you will not be left disappointed.OVERALL: This speaker is now my go to speaker for the bedside, get me going while getting ready in the bathroom each morning and serves as my primary travel companion. I'm satisfied enough to part ways selling my Soundlink II, while I'll still use the UE Boombox for Outdoors and driving my workouts in the basement.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 17, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3VL6JHIX26IPQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00D5Q75RC#wasThisHelpful","R3VL6JHIX26IPQ","A1PGUHJ9ZN499P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1PGUHJ9ZN499P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This multi-tool proudly caters to a specific market and comes packed with just the right features to take care of an M4/AR-15 while still retaining enough all around utility to meet the needs of most without having to buy another tool to tackle the day to day stuff.  All the components of the knife are well put together without any play whatsoever to include it's hefty blade. There are a couple issues keeping this thing from being truly great. Closing the plyers takes too much oomph setting you up to have a finger pinched and the one star I knock off is for the cheaper grade of steel used for the blade.  For the sticker price of this knife there is no reason not to include a superior steel such as CPM 154 as found in the Charge lineup.

The animation is well done and the programming itself executes smoothly without error.

"Bringing back the stylus of old resitive touchscreen technology has come with ridicule, but critics could not be more wrong. Combining technology of old with todays technological advancements offers a new valuable feature set that sets this tablet apart from the mainstream. With so many tablets offering virtually the same real world performace and feature set, when one comes out with a unique feature set it makes the decision of which to purchase much easier. As long as you know what that feature set has to offer you.PROS:The processor and memory allows you to breeze through menus and execute any operation to include any app currently available on the market without a hiccup. The screen is bright and clear with no notable differences side by side with my daughter's iPad Mini. Battery life is on par of all the others easily getting through a heavy days work without charge. However, these are not the features that should draw you toward this tablet as many have these same bragging rights at a smaller price. The precise control of the Wacom's 'S' pen technology is its defining feature. You can truly use this to replace pen and paper when taking notes during a lecture or meeting. Try the same thing with your finger or fat tipped touch capacitive stylus and you will quickly be back to a pen and paper after your notes end up looking worst than a 5 year old writing with a crayon. Refining pictures on photoshop is quicker than on a computer with a mouse and again offers the precision unmatched by any other (non-penabled) tablets. The same thing obviously holds true for artists or doodlers when using applications like Sketchbook plus adding the utility of pressure sensitivity for accurate shading without having to contstantly adjust through the menu. In addition to the 'S' pen, the IR sensor is more useful than I had imagined. I easily added all my TVs,  Bluray players, projector, receivers organized by room even my 15 year old Aiwa system. Granted the app could be a little better by adding easier access to more controls for each device but does well enough to bypass buying a $100+ Logitech remote.CONS:Samsung fanatics ardently back the use of plastic to encase their premium devices, but the look and feel simply does not match the quality exuded by Apple products or Asus's infinity tablets. Although I would love for Samsung to take note and offer a premium casing to match the rest of the device, adding a quality case easily remedies this minor complaint.OVERALL:Anyone who wants to use a tablet for everything from an powerful productivity tool at work or school to taking full advantage of art and photo apps should look no further than this or possibly a Note 10.1. Personally, I have found the 8.0 tablet as easily useful as 10 inchers with better form factor to use on the go, but those who plan on using it for more for graphical design might want the extra real estate at the cost of resolution. If you have no interest in jotting notes, utilizing photo or art apps then save money and get a Nexus 7 or one of the other countless counterparts with similar features, otherwise look no further as the price of Note 8.0 is easily justified","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 14, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ITV03WDOTEG3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BQH8UEY#wasThisHelpful","R2ITV03WDOTEG3","A1PGUHJ9ZN499P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1PGUHJ9ZN499P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have somewhat of a wireless speaker addiction.  Always finding a way to irrationally justify the purchase of yet another speaker. I justified the purchase of this one for its ability to extend its battery life when listening outside on sunny days. The bluetooth speakers I have found to be my favorites are the Bose Soundlink II and the UE Boombox.DESIGN:The look and feel of this speaker definitely coincides with its price range offering great quality.  The size is a bit bigger than the UE Boombox and significantly larger than Soundlink II and Big Jambox,  but it certainly remains small enough to be easily portable.  Aesthetically this falls short of the other 3. Whereas the Soundlink II,  UE Boombox and Big Jambox all are equally impressive looking in their own right,  the Ruckus XL just doesn't really stand out. However,  if your like me you could care less on how it looks as long as its build quality is there and place a much stronger emphasis on sound.SOUND:On paper this thing stacks up with UE Boombox offering 2 tweeters,  2 woofers and 4 passive radiators which is 2 more than what the Soundlink offers.  Sound output from this is good,  but is not able to match that of the competition,  particularly that of the similarly priced UE Boombox.  At the lower half of the volume range with the bass boost on it holds its own offering a good range comparable to the other 2. The Rukus reaches a loud enough volume for large room but as you crank it up with the bass boost on distortion becomes notably apparent.  The max volume output from the significantly smaller Soundlink matches the Rukus without the distortion,  although the sound processor tones down the bass to keep it distortion free.  The Big Jambox reaches a similar volume ceiling with brighter highs without distortion,  but lacks the lows of the Rukus throughout its volume range. The UE Boombox again reaches the same volume output but keeps the bass without distortion. The most frequently commented negative feedback of the Boombox is it being too bass heavy. This might be true when listening right next to it,  but in open rooms and outdoors the bass is simply adequate,  far from overpowering.  Other speakers will leave most listeners wanting more oomph in larger spaces.FEATURES:This is wherenthe Rukus shines,  but how much of an impact they have is completely dependent on each person.  The most obvious advantage is the solar charging.  As far as solar panels go it works great but still has its limits.  Even on a sunny day capable of ramping up the battery's juice not too many people will leave this outside,  especially unattended for the 5+ hours necessary to charge and elect to use the adapter instead.  However providing some power to the unit while playing to extend its battery life is very useful when the weather conditions allow.  Another advantage is like Jawbone's Big Jambox the Rukus also has track control buttons lacking on both the Bose and UE. Personally,  I could care less about the playback controls since I control it on my media device,  but others might find them handy. I have never had any problems establishing a bluetooth connection for and of my speakers with my Android phone and iPod Touch with a similar range and the Rukus is no excpetion. One feature the Rukus XL is missing from its smaller sibling is the splash resistant protection,  which is odd due to it being designed and marketed as a rugged outdoor speaker.CONCLUSION:If you plan on using your bluetooth speaker primarily outside in a sunny climate and don't mind sacrificing sound quality at higher volumes, then this speaker is for you and you will likely be quite satisfied with its performance.  If you don't think you will take advantage of the solar charging capabilities or simply want the best sounding speaker,  particularly in large spaces like outdoors,  then the UE Boombox is a far better choice for nearly the same price.  If ease of portability is important to you with exceeding sound quality then the Soundlink II will be a better choice although quite a bit more expensive.  If your looking for a bluetooth speaker with sound and build quality equivalent to the Rukus XL without the solar panels,  then I suggest taking a look at the original Supertooth Disco and save $100.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 23, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R158JGC6DUADFU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BUHXQWQ#wasThisHelpful","R158JGC6DUADFU","A1PGUHJ9ZN499P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1PGUHJ9ZN499P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"DESIGN:This is the most well designed outlet arrangement I've seen on a surge protector. Thanks to the number of outlets and the pivoting heads,  I can fit at least double the number of electronics with large adapters when compared to any other surge protector I've use.  The unique looking popular round surge protector with rotating heads caught my eye,  but it only contains 6 outlets yet takes up more floor space and costs more.  The Belkin may not look as cool as some of the colorful Monster brand protectors, but the functionality and price of it cannot be topped.SURGE PROTECTION:I tested this out on an outlet that has had problems with surges every time the washing machine kicks in.  I had a cheap surge protector plugged into the outlet loaded with a couple phone chargers and a touch lamp plug.  Everytime the washer changes cycles the lamp turns on or off.  With the Belkin plugged in the light no longer turned on/off during washer cycle changes.  Sure this is a simple test,  but at least it indicates the surge protection is funtional. I would recommend this surge protector for any area requiring the use of numerous electronics such as a computer desk or entertainment center.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 18, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3RNN20X1BZ2UH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000JE9LD4#wasThisHelpful","R3RNN20X1BZ2UH","A1PGUHJ9ZN499P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1PGUHJ9ZN499P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These straps are great for the general purpose of organizing entertainment center cords,  computer system cords... Etc.  My intended use for these straps was to manage cords for medical equipment during travel.  The worn straps these were to replace looped onto a cord before wrapping allowing it to stay in place when the cords are released.  Unfortunately,  these are missing that same basic design feature making them more likely to get lost as you need to secure it everytime you release the cord,  whereas other velcro straps remain secure at all times.

"Paying. 99 cents for this app is a fair price for what you get,  but at full price I would find this game seriously lacking.  The strong point of this game is that it is simple enough where a 3y/o can grasp the concept and play it.  The weak point is the lack of depth it has offering little replay value.  Most of the five games are the exact same with the exception of animation.

"With The Hometown Hoax, Ms. Thurmeier composed a story that is somewhat idealistic but cute none the lest. This read reminded me of the saying "" one person's junk may be another's treasure."" Tessa saw Cutter's Creek for everything it lacked and was not. Maybe because it was her hometown and she wanted more than to be cut off from new experiences, new people and a different environment.

"The past few weeks I have spent becoming acquainted with quite a few new authors. One of the stand outs has been Victoria James. I was introduced to her work by a friend and had to catch up on what I had been missing. The central theme in her works is the power love has to influence so many areas in life. She writes about characters that are easy to relate to and that is what makes her stories such precious finds. I received an ARC of The Billionaire's Christmas Proposal. I love how she creates family bonds through enduring friendships and helping hands. With her stories you become so invested in the stories that it is hard to leave when they end.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3UJ0HVQ7WJOGL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0166PXFFO#wasThisHelpful","R3UJ0HVQ7WJOGL","A244C0ORREA3N5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A244C0ORREA3N5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Beauty and Boss is a modern twist on an age old fairytale. I have read a number of of stories and seen many movies with Beauty and the Beast as the basis for them.

"When I was presented with the opportunity to read the first book in the Sin City Seals series: To Tempt a Seal was the first time Natalie was introduced. To Tempt a Seal was her sister Lucia's and Natalie's best friend Cade's moving story. She was the protective older sister who unwittingly played matchmaker. In To Dare a Seal Natalie gets her own story. Natalie uses her touch girl persona as a shield. She feels deeply and struggles with guilt for not being able to protect her baby sister from the evil that she faced at an early age. Pain for how she lost her parents when she needed them most. Anger for the things in her life she has had no control over and irritation for the one person who will not let her wallow in self-pity. I liked Jack. Beneath the gruff and overtly sexual exterior he was a really sensitive guy. Natalie was his dream girl that he wanted for his reality. Sara Jane Stone has done a really good job with this series. I received an ARC of To Dare a Seal in exchange for an honest review. To Dare a Seal is heartbreaking, irresistible and sexy.

"There are so many aspects that I love about Melissa Foster's novels that it would be too hard listing them all. Of course the love story is a plus. Seized By Love introduces Lizzie and Blue. Lizzie is a woman who has lots of love to give but responsibilities throughout her life have caused her to turn inward and rely on herself to look after her loved ones. When Blue looks at Lizzie he sees a women who is in need of TLC. He wants to take care of her and show her she does not have to do everything alone. Melissa Foster got right to the heart of the story from the first page. Seized by Love is about learning that hardships don't have to be faced alone. It's okay to ask for help and to open up and let love in. As with all of her books Ms. Foster created a love story that was sweet and emotional. I like that she also created a character that put family first.

"I am a strong believer in strength of character. No individual knows how they will handle a situation until they have to face it head on. Jane is my hero. She dealt with a major JA for years and then was tossed aside like trash. This is a woman that had the rug pulled from under her yet she handled it with grace and strength. She learned from her past mistakes and with the help of an old friend may find a new chance at love. Hope Springs on Main Street is a story that is not always sunny but just like Jane leaves you feeling stronger for reading it.

"I have not had the pleasure of reading the previous book in this series. If I had maybe I would have learned more about the history of Ben and Paige's relationship. I enjoyed them as a couple. There was more going on underneath Paige's resistance. Paige is scared to open herself up to more hurt. Her relationships whether romantic or familial have consisted of her being labeled a disappointment and I believe she has taken those words to heart. In her mind she can't disappoint anyone else if she pushes them away. Ben would not have been my choice of her rescuer but he ended up surprising me. Something Like Love takes a look at the fragility of the heart and the power love has to mend it. I am going to read book one as soon as I can.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R22KBJG37O1UMV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00T3E76H4#wasThisHelpful","R22KBJG37O1UMV","A244C0ORREA3N5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A244C0ORREA3N5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

It's tough to rate either individually, because I used both together, but I can say that the products appeared to work as advertized - the water in our pond has become clearer (it was a bit murky to start with), and the muck that was starting to form lessened.  Moreover, we haven't had any fish deaths - we had a spate of them prior to using the Orb-3 products.This is a big bottle, so while it might appear expensive at first, keep in mind that it will provide you with many months of treatment.In all, a decent product at a fair price.

"This is a very nice light.  I have been switching over all of our lights in the past year - at first to CFLs, now beginning to slowly move to LEDs.  With that, our electricity bills have dropped a decent amount, despite an increase in electricity costs in our area.  So I'm clearly biased in favor of this light to start with, because it uses a comparatively miniscule amount of energy.As compared to CFLs, the light from this LED is brighter and more natural.  It also lights up immediately.  Also, for whatever reason, many of the CFLs I buy don't last as long as they should.  I have yet to have to replace an LED light, though.The only drawback I see to these lights is that, at slightly over $25.00 a pop, replacing a lot of lights in your house can be quite an expensive proposition.  Because of that, I'll be taking my time to switch over.  Nonetheless, the Ecospiral LED is definitely going to be on our list of preferred bulbs during the transition.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RA9VVKAODT1R2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HUZCY5W#wasThisHelpful","RA9VVKAODT1R2","A8DZKOEN0DNRA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A8DZKOEN0DNRA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

In my perspective, this isn't for someone who is looking for a ""deep dive"" into the war, but it's a great book to curl up with your kid, look at the pictures and read about the many, many aspects of the war, many of which aren't even covered in school any more.

"Let my start off by saying that there is ample scientific evidence of the benefits of probiotics.  Simply google gut-brain-skin axis, for example.It's also clear that many people don't get enough probiotics.  Although yogurt and kefir are great, most of the bacteria they contain die in the stomach due to acid.  Pro-15 has patented a delivery system that (allegedly) ensures that more of the bacteria make it through to the intestines than other methods - 15X more than capsules.Pro-15 carries more types of probiotics than other sources.  For example, Lifeway Kefir has 12 probiotics, NutriGold Probiotics Gold has 6, and Schiff digestive advantage has 1.  Moreover, the strains in Pro-15 are not only those that allegedly help digestion, but others such as L. reuteri and L. rhamnosus that have shown promise in helping with allergies and skin conditions such as rosacea, eczema, acne, athlete's foot, etc.It's early yet for me to draw any firm conclusions, but I can say that my skin is doing better than it has in a long time - no more eczema outbreak, rosacea under control, etc., and I do _feel_ like I have more energy.  I made it through the most recent allergy season with nary a sniffle, let alone some of the bronchites I've had in the past.  So while I can't say for sure that Pro-15 works, there are positive signs.  I will definitely keep using it.UPDATE August 7, 2014I've been taking these for a few months, and I definitely feel different.  Unlike many posters here, I don't have a history of digestive issues.  That said, I am sleeping much better, I feel as if I have more energy and less desire to snack.  No sign of any sort of illness, and some nagging issues, such as some joint pain, have vanished.  I can't say that's all attributable to the Pro-15 pills, but I'm not going to take any chances and stop taking them!","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1EQ01829I3E4U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JEKYNZA#wasThisHelpful","R1EQ01829I3E4U","A8DZKOEN0DNRA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A8DZKOEN0DNRA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a great product at an attractive price - a lot of stores sell these stickers for $1.00+/package.Keep in mind that you'll need to get the Panini sticker book as well (it should cost all of $2.00).  In all, if you want even a remote chance to fill the sticker book you'll probably need to buy 2 boxes of these stickers, and that assumes that there are almost no duplicates.  In reality, you'll get lots of duplicates, and there will be some stickers you just won't find, try as you will.  That sounds like a complaint, but it's that way with baseball cards, etc.The stickers themselves are fairly small headshots of the players.  It can be a bit tough removing them from the backing, but they affix easily to the book's pages.  Each sticker has a number on the back, so you can quickly locate where it should go.The real delight about the stickers are how my 7 yo son and I spend time together.  He loves to open a pack - spread out the 7 cards.  He often recognizes the stickers he's already got.  He quickly turns the pages to the one where the sticker should go (so this has led us to discuss counting large numbers).  We also have discussed the geographic locations of the various teams (there are maps for each FIFA region), how they got into the World Cup, and other background.  So this is also educational.At the end of the day, filling a book will be fairly expensive, but I can't put a price tag on the time my son and I have spent together because of the Panini stickers.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RAGV7WRIQCMN5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IT2WQ6W#wasThisHelpful","RAGV7WRIQCMN5","A8DZKOEN0DNRA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A8DZKOEN0DNRA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This book presents a great roadmap to help players develop long-term.  To explain that, I need to take a step back.When I played as a kid, long-ago, most ""American"" teams played a poor version of English ""kick and chase"" soccer.  There were fast forwards and every time a team got the ball you'd hear cries of ""kick it.""  Long, aimless kicks to nowhere were greeted with cheers, despite the fact that they accomplished nothing.More recently, many teams have begun to emphasize footskills (a/k/a the ""Coerver method"").  So now some teams that aren't playing ""kick and chase"" are churning out kids who dribble with their heads down and use fancy moves all the time, sometimes at the wrong time.  The idea is once the kids learn the footskills you can begin teaching them about the larger game.  There is some merit to that position; however, when a kid's mechanics are such that he/she has his/her head down all the time, and she's not taught other aspects of the game until older, he/she might not make the leap to becoming a more complete player.Harrison's book represent, to me, the next step in American soccer.  Rather than teaching simple footskills and repetitive drills, he emphasizes awareness of the game in the context of both on the ball and off the ball movements.  His theory (one that I agree with) is that without understanding the bigger picture, players won't reach their peak development.  As such, the book represents the next step from kick and chase and Coerver-type play.I still believe that footskills are important to teach, and there's room in any program for Coerver type exercises, particularly when kids are trying to master a new skill.  The merit to Harrison's book is that, after the initial skill is learned, he layers on awareness exercises.This is not a program for coaches looking to win immediately.  In fact, it's probably the worst of the 3 programs mentioned above if a team wants to win NOW (you'd be better of sticking with kick and chase).  However, if you're looking to target complete 14 or 15 year old players, starting at U-10 or earlier, this book merits a long look.If you are looking at this book, I would also recommend Horst Wein's ""Game Intelligence"" and ""Developing Youth Soccer Players"" and Schreiner's ""Perfect Ball Control.""  The ""Perfect Ball Control"" exercises complement many of the exercises in this book quite well, and Horst Wein is known as the ""Coach of Coaches"" for a very good reason.In all, if you are concerned about long-term player development, this is a GREAT book.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 31, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3PCP2ECODP6WY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1591641098#wasThisHelpful","R3PCP2ECODP6WY","A8DZKOEN0DNRA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A8DZKOEN0DNRA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I just got this game this as I really enjoyed the first Lifeline. I have not gotten too far into the game but already I've come across a few minor irritations. First off, this is not like the first where you're assisting someone, like, Taylor, out in space which is fine.The part that irritates me is that this is a story of a mage trying to avenge her parents and reunite with her brother. They talk about spells and magic and the like which is very interesting because it's introducing you to her world but it in the midst of all this we Arika makes mention of some mainstream stars and movies like John Cusak and Kevin Costner as well as the Jedi Knights and Professor X. This really takes away from the feel of the fantasy we are supposed to be believing. Okay, her world exists in ours but that, I find, is another detraction. Why mention Oregon, Washington and the Atlantic when you could have just as easily created your own world. To me, it would have worked better in a world of its own. And if you did want to make this take place in our world at least leave mainstream out of it due to the nature of the story itself.Overall, I am enjoying it but not nearly as much as the first. The soundtrack is good though and the story is at least interesting enough to keep me going for now.

These fakes are getting more advance by using the developer's name, same price, and list of achievements making it look like the real deal.

This is a great collection for all fans of the strip and I, for one, am proud to own them. Beautifully done as always.Now for the good part.

"One of the very best games ever! I paid for this game and its expansions as they originally came out and worth every penny. I'm reviewing this version simply to try and help those having trouble installing the game. Originally there were no issues downloading the app on my phone but later proved to be impossible until being advised to remove the memory card out of my phone while the app installs. If you do that you will have no issues installing the app to your phone. Once installed you can reinstall your memory card and still be able to play the game just fine. I hope this works for those having issues because this is a great game!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1I064D5LSCVG2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015OQVN8C#wasThisHelpful","R1I064D5LSCVG2","A2T7Q9SZ4ZSU8X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2T7Q9SZ4ZSU8X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There are many tower defense games but few are as good as this one. I'm sure the sequels are even better but this was alone far exceeded my expectations. It is challenging enough to give you a real sense of achievement but not difficult to the point where you feel like just giving up.  My only issue is that at times it does kick me out of the game. Luckily that only happens from the home screen never in battle. I'm looking forward to more.

"I just found this app and it quickly drew my attention seeing that I own physical blocks like these that I enjoy even though it has been a while since I've tried them.Anyway, the app itself is very good and unique to app world. At least I've never seen it done before. There are four rooms with nine puzzles each (hopefully more on the way) in which it's our goal to separate the pieces. Using logic and a lot of thought we have to do this before unlocking the next puzzle. This will work until the third level in the second room after which point you will have to pay a small price of 99 for the remaining puzzles should you choose to.You are being timed and depending on your speed and amount of moves to solve each puzzle you are rated one, two or three stars. The music is perfect for the app and graphics are good as well and easy on the eyes. If, like me, you enjoy brain testing games this is definitely one to get.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2HJORER68YMP5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JK0078G#wasThisHelpful","R2HJORER68YMP5","A2T7Q9SZ4ZSU8X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2T7Q9SZ4ZSU8X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The idea being the game is a good one but the execution is flawed. First, there is no easy way to gain pick axes and they are needed for many things.Second, each chore keeps the person handling it stuck there until it is completed. Normally that is not necessarily a bad thing since there are two others you can work with but when you plant crops it becomes an issue. You would think that each harvest process will be counted as a chore as a whole but that is not the case. Each plot is a chore itself. So if you plant twelve potatoes, for instance, which take two hours to grow you will have to wait two hours in between plots before you can move on to the next. The maximum amount of plots that can be done at once it's three before being asked to purchase more help which cost gold which is hard to come by.Third, there are constant pop ups asking you to purchase gold, pick axes and other resources. All in all I do not recommend it. It started okay so I have it a chance but definitely not a game I would recommend.","2.0 out of 5 stars","April 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2D60ZUOF3N4QX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00H78D67M#wasThisHelpful","R2D60ZUOF3N4QX","A2T7Q9SZ4ZSU8X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2T7Q9SZ4ZSU8X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"What separates this one from Candy Crush, Jelly Splash, Juice Fruit and most of these type of games is that this one appeals more to boys. Instead of candy, jelly or fruits we have monsters!Unless I'm much mistaken this is the only one that considers the male gender a bit more. While I've played them all I'll be more inclined to play this one for that reason. Each monster has its own unique ability to destroy when using the power ups abilities. Stones, electricity, water, fire, wind and poison. The different abilities make it more fun and versatile. It seems to contain many levels and some you have special challenges.

"This one starts out easy enough but quickly starts getting more difficult to make you think ahead.If you're one enjoys games that require stimulating the brain this is for you. Similar to sudoku, crossme and the like this game does require thinking things carefully because while you're giving one set of colors you can very well be messing another set.On the left hand side you have a picture of colored circles and on the right you have your posting field. You have to make that match the picture. You either slide the entire row or column at once. You can't select individual circles which makes it all the more challenging.It's a nice clean looking app and the music is not bad either. Overall it seems like a great game to have on your device.

"If you enjoy Flappy Wings and similar games you will be sure to enjoy this one as well. Like the other reviewer said it is a very similar concept except instead of going between the pipes without touching them out falling we are going from cloud to cloud without falling into the water and avoiding the shark or electric eels.The very cloud will drop so you need to get off them asap and if the clouds are far from each other just continue tapping while in the air and a parachute opens to allow to reach the next cloud.I like the retro feel to it between graphics and music.

"This has been one of the best free apps available in a long time!You guide the planes to land, unload, fuel, load and take off... There may be more to do in some airplanes. The challenge comes in that you want to keep them happy in your airport and they will prove hard than it seems.You want to create as many color combos as possible to boost your earnings so you may have to paint since along the way. The Harper they are and the faster you get them back out the better your score.The levels are scored in two ways: goal level, master, perfect and others I cannot remember right now. This in turn takes you to the second format which is in the star feature. Four stars is the best you can do and it won't be easy to achieve that. That is where it becomes addicting. If like me you need the perfect scores you will find yourself playing the same level repeatedly until you achieve it.

"As the dog days of summer wind down, Wendy Francis' The Summer of Good Intentions is the perfect book to read at the beach or on the porch.A family reunites to spend their annual July vacation at their summer home on Cape Cod. Maggie is mom to three, married to a great guy, and the organizer of the family. Jess is a high school principal, struggling to balance her demanding job, her children and a husband who is more interested in his job than his family. Virgie is the single one, a career-driven reporter trying to get a job as a TV news anchor and just staring a promising relationship.Their parents have recently divorced, and their mother Gloria is bringing her new boyfriend to the house. This makes their dad, Arthur, a mystery book writer, very sad as he doesn't understand why their marriage fell apart.Maggie fears that her life will become empty as her children get older and need her less. She wants to bring a foster child into the family but must first convince her husband. Jess' marriage woes have led her to place that could destroy her marriage and Virgie's work stresses have made her physically ill.I just fell into this story, reading it in two sittings. The sibling relationships felt so real, and the story of the three marriages facing different challenges was so engrossing. I felt like I was in the family vacation home, watching these people interact around me.We are privy to the secrets and feelings that each character has, and just like in life, things happen that can bring people together or tear them apart. Wendy Francis brings to life this interesting family, one just like our own, and she does so with heart and compassion that we can't help but want them to be happy even as the sad things that life inevitably brings each us do their best to bring us down.This is the second book I have read that features a character who is a hoarder (the other being Mary Pflum Peterson's upcoming memoir White Dresses), and it has given me more compassion for people who suffer from this disorder and for the family members who try to deal with them and the physical and emotional mess they leave behind.I loved The Summer of Good Intentions, and give it my highest recommendation. If you've ever sat on the beach talking with your sisters, this is the book for you.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1T9R7DVJ03ZOX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00P434G9E#wasThisHelpful","R1T9R7DVJ03ZOX","ACGQBAGOS2G6O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACGQBAGOS2G6O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The one blurb that publishers want on their novel is ""Better than Gone Girl!"", which is getting a little ubiquitous lately. I'm not a big suspense fan, and Gone Girl wasn't my favorite book, but I have read other books compared to it, like The Girl On The Train.Jessica Knoll's suspenseful novel Luckiest Girl Alive even has 'girl' in the title. It begins with Ani FaNelli shopping for items to put on her bridal registry. She picks up a Wustof knife and wonders how it would feel if she slid into her fiance's stomach.Something is off about Ani. She has a fabulous job at a woman's magazine (think Cosmo), and is engaged to a great catch, a man with a great job and who is socially connected. But there is something in Ani's past, something that happened when she was in high school.Ani grew up on the wrong side of the tracks outside Philadelphia. Her mother wanted Ani to meet the right people and so sent her daughter to Bradley, a private high school for blue bloods. Ani didn't fit in at first, she sat at the misfits' table at lunch.Until one day, she caught the eye of one of the popular guys at school. Soon she was eating lunch with the cool kids and even attending their parties where, of course, everyone was drinking.Something bad happened at Bradley, and the reader is not told what. A documentary crew wants to interview Ani about the incident, but Ani's fiance doesn't want her to do the interview. What exactly happened?The reader is given clues, but when we finally find out what happened, about halfway through the book, the story really takes off. I have to admit that up until that revelation, I was not really taken with the story. But once we get to the incident, Knoll's writing is so tight and tense, I felt like I didn't take a breath for the entire chapter.I have to admit, I guessed wrong as to what really happened, and so the surprise was shocking, even though as we got closer to the reveal, there are clues given if you want to pick them up.Knoll's characters are well developed, and anyone who went to high school (which is most of us) felt many of the things Ani did- isolated, fearful of not fitting in, and hoping to make friends. Knoll taps into those feelings so well.Ani has problems, and in the early chapters when she talks about her sexual desires, I admit to thinking that maybe this book just isn't for me. But I'm glad I continued on, because I was rewarded with a nail-biting story. Ani has to look inside herself to discover who she really wants to be, and her journey to get there is fascinating.I liked Luckiest Girl Alive better than Gone Girl and better than The Girl On The Train, because Jessica Knoll does a great job of creating suspense and empathy for a troubled character. And even after reading it awhile ago, just thinking about now it is giving me heart palpitations and a dry mouth.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3H8JHXBOEMIRU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1476789630#wasThisHelpful","R3H8JHXBOEMIRU","ACGQBAGOS2G6O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACGQBAGOS2G6O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Jenny is a hardworking doctor, married to a successful surgeon and mother to three teenagers. Her fifteen-year-old daughter Naomi has been acting distant lately, which bothers Jenny since they have always been close. She attributes it to all the pressures of school, working hard on the school play and just normal teenage angst.Then one night Jenny doesn't come home from play rehearsal. Jenny and Ted call her friends, drive around the town, and still no Naomi. Shemilt captures the raw fear and panic of realizing that your child is missing. Any parent reading it will have a visceral reaction to this story.The story is told in alternating time lines, from the day she disappears and then one year later, with Naomi still gone and no answers from the police. Writing it this way made the story stronger for me, knowing that Naomi hasn't been found allows the reader to concentrate on the emotions of the family, rather than the actual search for Naomi.Naomi's disappearance reveals many secrets about Jenny's family. She discovers that the things she believes to be true about her marriage and her children aren't necessarily so. Naomi hid many things from her mother, and one thing you find from reading The Daughter is that you may think you know everything about your children, but they may have an entirely different life than the one you think they do.Watching Jenny suffer through her daughter's disappearance is tough. She tries to get through each day, wondering where her daughter is and what happened to her. Then there are the reactions of her two sons; as time goes on, she discovers things about them she never thought possible.I'm not sure how I feel about the resolution to the story. It is definitely one that will engender conversation and controversy. One of our members said she felt it fell flat at the end, and she wasn't crazy about the characters.The Daughter is a suspense thriller that does make a good book club pick because it will have people, especially mothers of teenagers, talking. It provokes strong reactions, and as a mother to sons, I wonder if I have a different reaction than mothers of daughters.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2RKJKBKD9ODZH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KFG15KS#wasThisHelpful","R2RKJKBKD9ODZH","ACGQBAGOS2G6O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACGQBAGOS2G6O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Some books just grab you right away, and I can add Matthew Quick's Love May Fail to that list. It begins with a card that reads:Portia Kane, Official Member of the Human Race! This card entitles you to the ugliness and beauty, heartache and joy- the great highs and lows of existence- and everything in between. It also guarantees you the right to strive, to reach, to dream, and to become the person you know (deep down) you are meant to be. So make daring choices, work hard, enjoy the ride, and remember- you  become exactly whomever you choose to be.Then we jump into the first chapter where Portia Kane is hiding in her bedroom closet with a gun, ready to catch her pornographer husband red-handed in the act of cheating on her. Portia ponders how she got there. She used to be a feminist, but as she says,""Being a feminist is so easy when you're a college freshman with enough scholarship money and financial aid to cover tuition, room and board. A woman with a clean slate. Compromises come with age.""The scene between Portia and her husband, (with a very young naked woman also in the mix) is just funny and crazy and brilliantly written. My favorite line happens when Portia tells the young woman exactly what she is in for sexually with Ken, and as she is throwing her clothes into a weekend bag, she thinks, ""Naked Ken watches me with his mouth hanging open, like I just invented fire."" That one just had me laughing out loud.Portia gets on a plane to go home to her hoarder mother. She sits next to a nun, who offers her an ear and some vodka, even though Portia has already got a good start on getting drunk. Portia spills her guts to Sister Maeve, who is a real pistol herself. Quick creates characters with whom I connected right away.Portia's mother is clearly mentally ill, as most hoaders are, and Quick handles the character with empathy, creating a woman we care about and ache for, just as we ache for Portia having to deal with this alone her entire life as there was no father in the picture.While she is home, she wants to find the high school teacher, Mr. Nate Vernon, who gave all of his students the Human Race card, and showed Portia particular kindness in her life when she needed it. She discovers that Mr. Vernon left teaching after an incident, and she becomes determined to help him.As the story advances, Portia reconnects with a high school friend, now a single mom of a five-year-old boy. We also see what has become of Mr. Vernon, as he narrates the second part of the story. His story is moving.Fate plays a big part in the story, and as does Portia's quest to prove that Mr. Vernon was right: there is human decency and goodness in the world, and people can become whomever they choose to be.There are some plot points that may seem obvious, and then there are some that, when they come together, made me smile. Quick has put a lot into his story- faith, mental illness, family, love, friendship, a belief in yourself, and how handling things when life doesn't go your way builds your character.I absolutely adored Chuck, a man who works hard to maintain his sobriety and wants to be a teacher. He is Quick's alter ego in this novel,  (Quick was a teacher) and I felt he was the most believable character.I sincerely hope that Love May Fail is turned into a movie like Quick's previous book The Silver Linings Playbook was. There is so much to love here and the characters are so strongly developed, they leapt off the page and into my heart. I give Love May Fail my highest recommendation. It's funny, sad, messy and complicated, just like life.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2VBLGBJGJIR3R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NEP2P42#wasThisHelpful","R2VBLGBJGJIR3R","ACGQBAGOS2G6O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACGQBAGOS2G6O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Victoria Hislop's fascinating new novel, The Sunrise, is set in 1972 in the tourist city of Famagusta on the island of Cyprus in the Mediterranean. Aphroditi and Savvas Papacostas are preparing for the opening of their new hotel, The Sunrise, the most extravagant hotel on the island.They are the golden couple of Famagusta, and the Sunrise will be their crowning achievement. Things are going wonderfully and Savvas has his eyes on remodeling their other hotel, making it even greater than the Sunrise. He comes to rely heavily on Markos, trusting him to run the Sunrise nightclub, which Markos makes into the place to be seen.Aphroditi does not like Markos, treating him more as a servant than a valued employee, which rankles Markos. When Savvas becomes totally consumed with the new construction, Markos and Aphroditi are thrown together hosting the evening cocktail party at the Sunrise and feelings between them change.There is change on Cyprus too. Clashes between the Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots come to a head when in 1974, a Greek coup d'etat results in Turkey invading Cyprus, and Famagusta becomes a war zone.As refugees  (including the Papacostas) flee Famagusta,  Markos's Greek Georgious family and the Ozkans family, (Turkish  Cypriots) end up in hiding together in Famagusta. The fathers of both families are wary of each other, but eventually see that they must help each other in order to survive.The Sunrise is a timely novel that, while set in the 1970's, could be about many places across the world today. Innocent people are caught up in the terrors of war that they never wanted to participate in. Old regional grudges and greed conspire to destroy a culture, and the ideals of young men are corrupted to achieve political goals.Hislop does a wonderful job creating character and a story that feels authentic. The life that the Georgious' and Ozkans build together in hiding, how they work together to protect their families while trying to escape detection is captivating to the reader.The sudden, horrific violence of war is on full display here, and there is one instance late in the story that changes many things for many people, revealing the true character of one person.I was totally riveted by The Sunrise, reading it in two sittings. There are many times when I found myself holding my breath, and others when I read through tears. I give The Sunrise my highest recommendation, and fans of Chris Bohjalian's The Sandcastle Girls will want to read this one.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RTI9KP956EPRR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062396099#wasThisHelpful","RTI9KP956EPRR","ACGQBAGOS2G6O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACGQBAGOS2G6O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I read Ali Wentworth's first memoir Ali in Wonderland that hilariously dealt with her years trying to make it as an actress in Hollywood. Her very funny voice shone through each page. In her new book, Happily Ali After, Wentworth shares her adventures as a wife (to ABC newsman George Stephanopoulis) and mom to two young daughters.I loved this Happily Ever After even more than Ali in Wonderland, probably because I can relate more to Ali the wife and mom than Ali the struggling actress. She tells great stories about trying to stay young-looking, her husband's poor driving, and her daughter's sex-education questions.One of the stories that I most loved involved a trip the family had planned to Spain. Ali was in charge of making all the preparations, and when they got to the airport to take a late-night flight, they were told that the girls' passports had expired and they were going nowhere that night.George was furious at Ali, and the girls went back and forth from one parent to the other asking if they were going to get a divorce. The car ride home was uncomfortable, and when they got home, Ali told George how so very sorry she was. As they lay in bed, he kissed her and told her he knew she she was sorry and that it was OK. Every couple has had that potentially huge fight, and could relate to this big oopsy that Ali committed.Ali's story of a girl's weekend at a friend's California home with a psychic as entertainment was hilarious too. We all have our girlfriends, and her description of that party had me guffawing.Reading Happily Ali After is like sitting in your funniest girlfriend's kitchen and listening to her crazy stories about her husband, her family, her job, her life. If I ever see her on the streets of NYC,  I will invite her over for a glass of wine just to hear her stories.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RTLFK9OO68TGZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062238493#wasThisHelpful","RTLFK9OO68TGZ","ACGQBAGOS2G6O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACGQBAGOS2G6O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As Marisa de los Santos' The Precious One opens, Taisy Cleary receives a phone out of the blue from her estranged father Wilson, the man who left her mother, twin brother Marcus and her to marry a young sculptor. After not hearing from the man in ages, he calls her to inform her that he had a heart attack two weeks ago and summons her to his home to discuss an important matter.Marcus tells Taisy she is crazy to go see the man, but Taisy cannot say no. When she arrives, she finds that her father- a brilliant professor, inventor and self-made millionaire- wants her to help him write his memoir. Or rather, he will dictate it to Taisy and she can interview the many people who think he is brilliant too.Taisy says yes, even though she has to stay in the poolhouse. (You wouldn't expect her to be allowed to stay in her father's house with his wife and brilliant and beautiful golden child Willow, would you?)The only thing Willow knows about her half sister is that Taisy committed some horrible act when she was a teenager that made Wilson infuriated and lose all respect for her. Now Taisy is in their lives and Willow feels she must protect her father from her.The story is told from the alternating perspectives of Taisy and Willow. Taisy is curious about her father and his other family and slowly comes to care for Willow and her mother. Willow has been isolated from most other people, being homeschooled and smothered by her father's attention.As Taisy and Willow get to know each other, they come to understand and even like each other. Taisy helps Willow join the outside world, teaching her the things she needs to know.As I read this book, I felt like Taisy could be a character in an Adriana Trigiani novel. She is a hardworking woman with a good sense of humor, and an even more developed sense of right and wrong.  There's even a crazy family dinner scene that reminded me of the Roncalli family ones from Trigiani's Valentine series.The ladies in the book club all agreed that we liked Taisy, she might even make a great addition to our book club. Her growing affection for Willow and Willow's mother was touching and sweet. One of our members has twins, so she especially enjoyed the relationship between Taisy and Marcus.We did not like Wilson, he was pompous and self-righteous, although Taisy's discovery of his past helped to mitigate that feeling somewhat (OK, just a little bit).This was the first book I have read of de los Santos, and I would like to read more of them. I like her style of writing, and the way she was able to write in the voices of two distinct characters.If you're looking for a good family story, The Precious One is an excellent choice.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RTXZM3XF6CMOZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JOG4U3O#wasThisHelpful","RTXZM3XF6CMOZ","ACGQBAGOS2G6O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACGQBAGOS2G6O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A Dangerous Place is the 11th book in the series, and we pick up the story in 1937, four years after the last book ended. Maisie and her husband James are living in Canada, where James is working on planes for the government.After a tragedy, Maisie decides to return to India to heal. When her stepmother wires Maisie asking her to return home to England, Maisie decides to go, but ends up in Gibraltar, a British garrison town off the coast of Spain.Maisie discovers the dead body of a photographer, a Sephardic Jew, and feeling that the police aren't interested in finding the killer, Maisie uses her skills to solve the murder, and gets involved in a dangerous political situation.Winspear always does a great deal of research for her books, and in this one, we learn a great deal about the Spanish Civil War, including the bombing of a marketplace in Guernica, where many women and children were killed by fascist forces. For someone who doesn't know much about the politics in Spain at this time, it is enlightening.Since Maisie is alone in Gibraltar, we don't see many of our favorite characters from previous books- no Billy, no Priscilla, no Lady Rowan. I have to admit I miss Maisie's interactions with the characters I have grown to like. The only one who makes an appearance is Inspector MacFarlane, Maisie's sometimes nemesis, sometimes reluctant police partner.At the end of the story, Maisie assists some nurses who are traveling to care for the men fighting the civil war. This part was most interesting for me, as Maisie seemed to come out of her funk, and was at her best organizing the makeshift hospital and helping the nurses care for the men under difficult conditions. It was a welcome callback to Maisie and her nursing days in France.We'll have to wait until next year's book to find out if Maisie returns home and resumes her life as a private investigator. I can't say that this one was my favorite in the Maisie Dobbs series, but as always, I learned something about a time and place I knew little about, and that is always a good thing.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RWFGXLTNE38Z9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LSRBY9A#wasThisHelpful","RWFGXLTNE38Z9","ACGQBAGOS2G6O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACGQBAGOS2G6O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Stanley Tucci is an actor, known for his roles in The Devil Wears Prada and Julie & Julia. In 1996,  Tucci co-wrote and starred in a movie called Big Night, about two brothers who have one night to save their Italian restaurant. The movie has achieved cult status, earning many fans for Tucci and his costar Anthony Shaloub.Tucci has always loved to cook, and follows his successful 2012  The Tucci Cookbook with a new cookbook, The Tucci Table, filled with recipes from himself, his family and even some famous friends, written with his wife Felicity Blunt, sister of actress Emily Blunt.From his late friend actress Natasha Richardson, whom he said was ""an extraordinary cook who threw some of the best dinner parties I have ever attended', he shares her Pissaladiere, topped with anchovies, onions and olives.His son Nico's Pasta with Proscuitto, Onions, Peas and Pancetta looks like a winning dish to me, and I appreciated the detailed instructions on the carbonara finish to the dish.He also tells some funny stories, like the time he asked Felicity what she wanted to cook for a dinner party the following weekend. She decided on a suckling pig, which was problematic since neither had ever cooked one before. They got a whole pig from the butcher, but it was too long to fit on their barbeque spit. So they got out the hacksaw and tried to cut off the pig's head, when their children came home from school to see the carnage.The book is heavy on Italian food, naturally, and I am tempted to try his Polenta Fries, which Tucci calls a great alternative to French fries. They look delicious.Tucci formatted the book so that the directions come first, then the ingredients, which may confuse some people. This is a book for confident cooks, more casual cooks who like to go more by instinct than exact measurements. (See glug of olive oil, above)Reading The Tucci Table is like sitting in Tucci's kitchen, and you can hear his voice as you read his stories about how his mother-in-law makes it this way, and he got this recipe on location in Atlanta for The Hunger Games.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQ50VMHENBW58/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IWTWR7A#wasThisHelpful","RQ50VMHENBW58","ACGQBAGOS2G6O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACGQBAGOS2G6O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"One of the great things about summer is that I get to spend some time in South Carolina's Lowcountry when Dorothea Benton Frank's latest novel publishes. This year's terrific novel All The Single Ladies shows Frank in fine form with wonderful characters in a great story, topped off with Frank's signature one-liners that crack me up.Lisa St. Clair is a divorced nurse, struggling to make do with a part-time job working at an adult home, sad that her 18-year-old daughter has moved to Colorado, where her estranged father has help set her up in her own legal marijuana tourist company.Lisa has become close to Kathy, fifty-year-old patient who is dying of cancer, as well as the woman's two best friends, Carrie and Suzanne, who hold a constant vigil at her bedside. When Kathy passes away, Lisa, Carrie and Suzanne join forces to clean out Kathy's apartment, and they become closer.What I liked about this book was that these are women of a certain age, who haven't been lucky in love up to this point, but they don't close themselves off to the possibilities in front of them. They support each other, and when Lisa loses her apartment, Suzanne offers her a room in her grandmother's home near the beach.Suzanne grandmother Miss Trudie is an unforgettable character, the kind of grandma we'd all wish to have. She's 99 years-old, sassy, and full of life and advice. I fell in love with Miss Trudie.Carrie is a thrice-widowed woman, and she is always on the lookout for husband number four. Suzanne owns her floral shop, but she doesn't have time or the inclination to look for a husband. Taking care of Miss Trudie and trying to keep her shop open takes all of her time.Lisa not only has to deal with her strained relationship with her daughter, but her phone conversations with her parents are hilarious. I can almost see her banging her head against the wall as she tries to get through a call with them.The friendship these women develop is heartwarming, they support and encourage each other in their individual endeavors. And the men that come into their lives are not stereotypical clueless guys, they feel like real men, trying to do their best for the women they care about.One of the men even gives a great piece of advice; he tells Lisa that children don't do things to hurt their parents, they don't even consider that their actions have anything to do with their parents. Smart man.One of the best things about reading Frank's novels is that I can add so many great restaurants to my Charleston Pinterest board. Frank helped me add close to a dozen more, and the Chamber of Commerce of Charleston should send her a big bouquet of flowers because no one encourages more people to visit (and maybe even retire) to that beautiful area.Grab a beach chair, your best girlfriends, a couple of bottles of Pinot Grigio, and a few copies of All The Single Ladies and make a day of it. Then go to dinner and plan your girls' vacation to Charleston.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2XNXN5ZA4NR9C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NEOM5FM#wasThisHelpful","R2XNXN5ZA4NR9C","ACGQBAGOS2G6O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACGQBAGOS2G6O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"If anyone had recommended to me a novel about Australian POWs in a WWII Japanese prison camp in Thailand, I would probably say ""no thanks."" But then I saw the book, The Narrow Road to the Deep North, on the bookshelf at the villa where we vacation and it kept beckoning to me. Every time I passed that bookshelf, the pull to read it felt stronger.I finally gave in and picked up last year's Man Booker Prize winner and dove in. From the very beginning, I was in the thrall of this incredible story with writing that was beyond beautiful. Early on, the main character Dr. Dorrigo Evans has to write a forward for a book of drawings by a fellow POW.""He looked at his forward, written, as ever, in his customary green ink, with the simple, if guilty, hope that in the abyss that lay between his dream and his failure there might be something worth reading in which the truth could be felt.""That sentence from page 21 is a stunning example of the gorgeous language in this emotionally powerful novel. Another is this one:""Dorrigo Evans hated virtue, hated virtue being admired, hated people who pretended he had virtue or pretended to virtue themselves. And the more he was accused of virtue as he grew older, the more he hated it. He did not believe in virtue. Virtue was vanity dressed up and waiting for applause.""Dr. Evans becomes a celebrity in Australia because of his POW experience, and we see him as an older man looking back on his life experience. He is a famous doctor, long married to a woman whom he consistently cheats on.As a young man waiting to go to war, he falls in love and has a passionate affair with his uncle's wife, a woman who becomes the love of his life, the woman he cannot forget. Although he loves Amy, he marries Ella, but it is Amy he keeps in his heart during his captivity and beyond.The bulk of the story takes place in a Japanese POW prison camp. As an officer and a doctor, Dorry's rank gave him a little authority. The men in the camp were used as slave labor to build a railroad. The Japanese wanted to show the world their superiority by building a railroad from Thailand to Burma.The camp conditions were brutal, and the Japanese soldiers running it were savage. Dorry did his best to shield the sickest prisoners from inhuman work, but he couldn't always win. We meet the men in the camp and see how strong the will to survive truly is.The men are beaten and starved and forced to work at slave labor. They are pushed beyond human limits, and injury, disease and death are constant companions. The Japanese officers believe that the prisoners' work will glorify the Japanese empire, and their complaints about the brutal conditions confound them. They were treated similarly by their superiors, and feel the prisoners are weak-willed.The scenes in the camp are horrific and hard to read. The men must work together to survive, yet each man is ultimately on his own as we see in the most harrowing and powerful scene. The one thing that shines through this astonishing novel is the power of human resilience, the strength of the will to survive. At the end of the novel, we see what happened to many of the men, including the Japanese officers, which I found enlightening.My review cannot possibly do justice to this phenomenal literary achievement, I'm not sure any review can. The only thing I can say is that to miss out on reading The Narrow Road to the Deep North would be a huge loss. This is a book that will live on in my mind for a very long time.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2S5LJ906D2N73/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IHMEAYA#wasThisHelpful","R2S5LJ906D2N73","ACGQBAGOS2G6O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACGQBAGOS2G6O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you have been following the news lately, you have no doubt heard about the suspension of NBC News' Brian Williams. If you are fascinated by this saga, you may wish to pick up a copy of Sheila Weller's book, The News Sorority- Diane Sawyer, Katie Couric, Christiane Amanpour and the (Ongoing, Imperfect, Complicated) Triumph of Women in TV News.Weller takes us on a tour of the interesting lives of these three successful women. Diane Sawyer was the daughter of a successful judge and a ""1950's version of a Tiger Mom"" in Kentucky. She idealized her father and his death when she was a young woman devastated her.Sawyer wanted a job in news, and with her steely reserve and driving ambition, she started at the bottom and worked harder than everyone else to work her way up the ladder from reporter to the press office for President Nixon to morning anchor at the CBS morning show to her latest home at ABC, where she became the face of ABC News, anchoring at various times Primetime, Good Morning America and finally ABC World News Tonight before recently retiring.Katie Couric was raised in an upper middle class family in Virginia, and she was the youngest of three daughters, all of whom were intelligent and successful. Couric was a cheerleader in high school, and she used everything in her arsenal from her smiling, chipper personality to tenacity and strong work ethic to move up the ladder from reporter at a Miami TV station to a mostly forgettable CNN reporter stint to Pentagon correspondent at NBC News to her breakout at The Today Show, and her short-lived stint as anchor of The CBS Evening News.Less is known about Christiane Amanpour, who has been at CNN for many years. Her wealthy Iranian family fled their homeland when the Shah of Iran was overthrown and Amanpour was sent to a boarding school in England. Amanpour was star-struck and kept scrapbooks of Hollywood stars. She loved fashion and didn't seem to be the serious minded woman we know her as today.The book takes us through the well-known aspects of these women's lives- Sawyer working with President Nixon on his memoirs after his resignation, her marriage to Mike Nichols, Couric's famous ""ambush"" interview with President George H.W. Bush and the terrible loss of her young husband and sister to cancer, Amanpour's war reporting and on-air confrontation of President Clinton over his policy in Bosnia.Less is known about Amanpour, and perhaps that is why her story seemed more interesting. Her reporting from war zones, as in Bosnia, are harrowing and heart-pounding. Weller spoke with reporters and producers and tech people who accompanied Amanpour and these sections of the book are the most compelling.Amanpour's zeal to bring an important, horrific story about the genocide in Bosnia drives her to nearly single-handedly bring this story to the attention of the American people and politicians and demand action.We get a lot of behind-the-scenes information, with the story of the early days of CNN being most intriguing (they had no bathroom in their building and had to use a nearby motel and gas station). The egos involved in the news business (Peter Jennings and Charles Gibson do not fare well here), the jockeying for position, and the politics of it all are enlightening.The one thing that bothered me was the ""unnamed sources"" who were willing to say not-so-flattering things about the women without putting their name to it. The highschool gossip-y feel of that detracted from the book for me. I found the things said by people willing to put their name to it more credible.What shines through is that these successful women all had faced adversity and loss, and were driven to succeed in their field. They felt a calling to bring important information- Saywer's reports on childhood poverty, Couric's drive to inform people about colon cancer, and Amanpour's reports on war and religion- to the American people.Fans of TV news will appreciate this book most, and I would love to read a book about the early pioneers of women in TV news, women most of us have never heard of who paved the way for today's well known successful women.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3V1TOHV94TE4M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00INIYFAC#wasThisHelpful","R3V1TOHV94TE4M","ACGQBAGOS2G6O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACGQBAGOS2G6O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am a sucker for a good book based on a true story. Writers who can take an incident and spin off an imaginative story from it always impress me. The Book Club Beach Club recently read The Girl Who Came Home, based on a story of fourteen people from a small Irish village who were on the Titanic, and I just finished Elizabeth Hall's Miramont's Ghost, about a reported haunted castle in Manitou Springs, Colorado.Young Adrienne lives in her grand-pere's castle in countryside of France, with her mother Genevieve. Her father is a diplomat who works in Paris and they rarely see him. Her aunt Marie is a malevolent presence, striking terror in the hearts of the servants, and her family as well.Adrienne has the gift (or curse) of second sight. She can clearly see visions of things that will happen, but at the age of seven is too young to know not to speak of them in public. Her grandmother had the same gift, and the entire village shunned her. Adrienne's grand-pere fears the same will happen to Adrienne.Lucie, Adrienne's governess, began writing Adrienne's visions in a journal, and the discovery of this journal has repercussions. Marie convinces Genevieve that it would be in Adrienne's best interests for her to accompany Marie to America to stay with Marie's son Julien, a parish priest who built a big castle for himself in Manitou Springs, Colorado. Marie's evil intentions become clear when she imprisons Adrienne in the castle.Hall weaves an intriguing story, likened by many to the classic Rebecca, about a family with dangerous secrets, and a young woman who must use her wits and gift of visions to survive. I flew through this book, reading it in one day because I had to find out what happens to Adrienne.The setting of late 19th century France was fascinating, and Hall's descriptive writing added greatly to the story. She set one scene at the Paris Opera House that was so beautiful, if I closed my eyes, I would swear I was there.I loved how Hall took this true story of a priest's haunted castle and created this world. Giving Adrienne the gift of visions, the plucky governess, the evil aunt- all of these are combined to create an atmospheric suspenseful novel that is perfect for curling up with a cup of tea on a snowy day by the fire.I also appreciated her Bibliography at the end, enabling the reader to find out more of the true story of Miramont.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RE3R3QXNOXXHR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LTBWMJ6#wasThisHelpful","RE3R3QXNOXXHR","ACGQBAGOS2G6O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACGQBAGOS2G6O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Suspense novels about disappearing spouses, from Gone Girl to the recent blockbuster The Girl On The Train, are all the rage, and Tina Seskis' novel, One Step Too Far, is a worthy addition to this genre.Like The Girl On The Train, One Step Too Far is also set in London. As we meet Emily, she is on a train running away from her husband and young son, but we don't know why. We learn that she is a twin, and her sister Caroline has led a troubled life, in comparison to Emily, who was always the good girl.Caroline always felt that her mother didn't love her as much as she loved Emily, a feeling that is based in fact. Their father Andrew is a womanizer, and had a distant relationship with his daughters.When Emily met Ben, they fell in love and began a wonderful life together. Their wedding was beautiful, until a drunken Caroline ruined the day, and Andrew slept with Caroline's friend. But Ben and Emily did their best to not let family bring them down.Something bad happens, we don't exactly what it is, but it causes Emily to run away to London, change her name to Cat and move into a disgusting flat with several other strangers. Angel, a flatmate, can see that Cat is fragile, and takes her under her wing.Cat gets a job in marketing, and works her way up the ladder. She also drinks too much and uses drugs to mask her pain. What happened to Emily to drive her to abandon her old, happy life?My initial thoughts had something to do with her twin sister, and I kept looking for clues along the way to confirm my suspicions. But Seskis does a marvelous job getting the reader turning the pages to find the answer, and the tag line on the book's cover- ""No one has ever guessed Emily's secret. Will you?"" is pure genius, keeping that uppermost in the reader's mind. Kudos to whomever came up with that one.We are drawn into Cat's new world, feeling her pain as she tries to start over and forget whatever it is she is running from, while Ben searches frantically for her. Although we are constantly wondering what caused Emily to run, she is such an interesting character, and I found her journey, particularly her determination to decorate her new room, completely engrossing.When we do find out what happened to Emily, I confess to being totally shocked and gasping audibly. I was reading on a beach, and I could see heads around me turning when I found out, wondering what I was reading.One Step Too Far is a perfect beach or airplane book. It's a propulsive page-turner that is best read when you have uninterrupted time because you will become obsessed wondering what caused Emily to run. But it is not only the plot that will move you; Emily/Cat is an unforgettable character and you will pull for her to find peace.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2CT13D6HUB56J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00K53D3JC#wasThisHelpful","R2CT13D6HUB56J","ACGQBAGOS2G6O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACGQBAGOS2G6O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Using a real lawsuit from 1996 between wealthy vacation home owners and sea farmers who cultivated oysters and scallops on the outer banks of Cape Cod as a stepping off point, author Lynne Hugo weaves an intriguing story in her terrific novel, A Matter of Mercy.Caroline, known as CiCi to her high school friends, moves back home to Wellfleet, a small fishing community in Cape Cod to care for her dying mother Eleanor. Slowly, we find that something bad happened to Cici, something for which she served time in jail.Eleanor would like to see CiCi settle down, marry and start a family. She reminds CiCi that Rid, an guy whom CiCi knew in high school, is working as an aquafarmer and looking very good. I love that Eleanor describes him as ""built like a brick s@#thouse. Eleanor had abandoned prim language with no explanation after she was widowed.""  That is a fabulous line, such a great way to establish Eleanor's character in one sentence.During a bad storm, CiCi runs out to help Rid, and they end up at her home where they have sex. Rid spent some time in prison for a drug charge, so he and CiCi have something in common. The next morning, Rid races out, leaving a confused CiCi.The aquafarmers, who have owned and worked oyster beds in the water behind the now-ubiquitous McMansions forever, are being sued by the new homeowners, claiming that the farmers are trespassing on their property to harvest their oyster beds.Some of the farmers believe that CiCi may be involved in the lawsuit, even though the home she inherited is modest in size and scope, and her family has been in Wellfleet forever too. When someone starts stalking CiCi, trying to scare her and throwing rocks through her window, she becomes afraid.CiCi accidentally runs into someone she hurt in the past, and she desperately wants to find out how the person is doing, almost to the point of obsession. Does CiCi hope to be forgiven or is this person the stalker?The characters in the story- CiCi, Rid, Terri the librarian, Elsie (Eleanor's hospice nurse), Billy the bartender- are fascinating and completely realistic. If I ever visited Wellfleet, I believe I would run into them somewhere in the village.The relationships between the characters are well-drawn too, between Rid and CiCi, Rid and his fellow aquafarmers, with the one between Rid and his faithful dog Lizzie being my favorite.Hugo's language is beautiful too, with these sentences really moving me:""And suddenly, she was crying at the too-largeness, the mystery of things, needing to make them small enough to think about, to get her arms around.""""The mercy I can show you is in not asking for your forgiveness.""Hugo manages to beautifully blend a love story with a mystery, with a story about forgiveness, all set in a fascinating place that becomes an important character in the book. My family has vacationed several times in Cape Cod, and so I was particularly interested in reading A Matter of Mercy.She manages to put us in CiCi's shoes, and had me wondering if I would make the same decisions the characters did. I became completely invested in this amazing story, my heart aching for the characters and what they went through. (Bonus: I learned a lot about aquafarming, something I knew nothing about.) I read A Matter of Mercy in just two sittings, unable to break away from this emotional, moving story.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3VCDR88E3HIJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LOB5F6I#wasThisHelpful","R3VCDR88E3HIJ","ACGQBAGOS2G6O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACGQBAGOS2G6O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Last week, I found a copy of The Smitten Kitchen Cookbook by Deb Perelman and I promptly purchased it. It's a gorgeous cookbook, written by a popular blogger who cooks in her tiny New York City apartment kitchen, which is no bigger than mine. (So there goes my excuse that the reason I can't cook anything in my kitchen because it's too small.)I love that for each recipe Perelman gives the reader a little story about how she came up with the recipe. The ingredients are listed to the side, along with directions, and sometimes a 'cooking note' or 'do ahead' suggestion.The photos in the book are simply stunning. I drooled just looking at them (the potato frittata with feta and scallions, butternut squash and caramelized onion galette, and peach dumplings with bourbon hard sauce in particular caught my eye), and there are 452 full color illustrations in the book for those of you who like your cookbooks with photos. (Which I do)The book is divided into the typical sections- Breakfast, Salad, Main Dishes- and close to one-third of the book is devoted to Sweets. At the end, she has a chapter, How To Throw a Dinner Party, that gives you a entire party's worth of appetizers and a few drink recipes that you could follow in its entirety to host a smashing get-together that will impress your friends.The Smitten Kitchen Cookbook is not for beginning cooks. I'd put this in the category for fans of Martha Stewart or maybe The Barefoot Contessa (if you know what grissini and gougeres are, this book is for you). It is a gorgeous book, and would make a lovely gift for someone you know who is an accomplished and enthusiastic cook.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R23BM6805FTSCP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007WKEM8C#wasThisHelpful","R23BM6805FTSCP","ACGQBAGOS2G6O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACGQBAGOS2G6O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Jim Gaffigan is a well known stand-up comedian and actor whose biggest claim to fame is his ""Hot Pockets"" routine about the frozen food item eaten mostly by drunk college students and/or lazy people with a microwave.He has written two books, Dad Is Fat, about living with his wife and five young children in a one-bedroom New York City fifth-floor walkup, and his second is Food: A Love Story, about his love affair with food.As a stand-up comic who has traveled all over the world, Gaffigan has eaten in many restaurants. When he travels on tour, he tweets to his fans, asking them where and what he should eat. This section of the book is terrific, and in addition to being very funny, it includes wonderful tips for traveling ""foodies"" (a term Gaffigan disdains).Gaffigan divides the United States into five major food areas-Seabugland (Northeast Coast)Eating BBQland (Southeast/Parts of Midwest)Super Bowl Sunday Foodland (Midwest/Parts of East)Steakland (Texas to Upper West)Mexican Foodland (Southwest to Texas)He is not a big fan of seafood, especially shellfish, saving particular distaste for oysters. His discussion of barbeque, which is used as ""a verb, noun, and adjective and even a potato chip"" is funny and informative.Gaffigan recounts how each city is proud of its own unique recipe for barbeque, and that in every Southern city he meets the same guy who says the same thing ""Obama ate there, and you can get it shipped anywhere you want."" He also mentions places that you can get great BBQ not in the South, with Syracuse, NY (Dinosaur BBQ) on that short list.He tells a funny story about dragging his family to a gas station in Kansas City, MO to eat at Oklahoma's Joe's, where Gaffigan joined a very long line at 11am. The line was filled with ""predominantly, pudgy, balding, exhausted men in their thirties and forties,"" all happy to be there, though if these same men were confronted with such a long line at a grocery store to get milk or diapers, they would leave the store rather than wait for such unimportant items for their family.Another hilarious story had him following a man in Kmart, who was drinking gravy from a styrofoam cup he got in the KFC located in Kmart.  His description of the ambience of Kmart as a store that always looks like ""it was just attacked by a flash mob"" brought a chuckle of recognition.Food: A Love Story, had me laughing all the way through it, and as I was reading in on the treadmill (Gaffigan would disapprove of this- exercise, I mean), my fellow exercisers would look at me as if I was a little crazy. (Note: laughing while reading on a treadmill can be dangerous. If you get doubled up with laughter, you can potentially fall. Not that that almost happened to me.)Serious foodies may take offense, but Gaffigan is a comedian who has found his niche in poking fun of his eating habits, and most of us can find something to relate to in this humorous book. He also loves his family (I adored his section about taking each child individually to his favorite deli, Katz's), and I got some great ideas on where to eat. (And anyone who believes that Shake Shack has the best burgers in world is my kinda guy.)If you need a good laugh, and like to eat, (which is, like, everybody) Food: A Love Story, is for you.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2XX5SCQ3OLTJN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00K4C4I2U#wasThisHelpful","R2XX5SCQ3OLTJN","ACGQBAGOS2G6O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACGQBAGOS2G6O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"From the time she was a young girl, Portia Cuthcart loved cooking with her grandmother. Her grandmother had a special touch, knowing exactly what to cook to make someone feel good before they even know that they needed it. Portia inherited that unique talent.Portia was happy living in Texas with her husband, a politician, until the day she discovered her was sleeping with her best friend. Distraught, divorced and with no money, she headed to New York City to the garden apartment her aunt left her.Her sisters Cordelia and Olivia lived in New York as well, so Portia had a support system there. She discovered that the man who bought out Cordelia's and Olivia's apartments in her aunt's building also wanted to buy hers, but she did not want to sell.Gabriel is a Wall Street big money man, a widower with a two daughters. He is brooding and pushy and sexy, and he wants Portia to sell him her apartment, which Portia refuses to do. You can probably guess where this is heading.Running low on funds, Portia decides to open a restaurant with her sisters called The Glass Kitchen. Portia works her food magic, cooking dishes that come to her. She begins by selling them out of her garden apartment home, until the health department shuts her down.Gabriel hires Portia to cook for his family, and she becomes close to his younger daughter Ariel, who misses her mother terribly and was in the car when her mother had the fatal car accident. Ariel is looking for answers to questions about her mother.The descriptions of food in The Glass Kitchen will drive you into your own kitchen to recreate the recipes that Lee has helpfully put in the end of the book. You can create an entire six course meal with the recipes for Crab and Sweet Corn Chowder and Fried Chicken with Sweet Jalapeno Mustard, making this a good book for a book club meal.The Glass Kitchen has some very hot sex scenes, great descriptions of food, a terrific sister relationship and some memorable characters (the elderly neighbor couple were my favorite). It's a wonderful book to while away a Sunday afternoon and then create a delicious Sunday dinner. (And the cover art is absolutely irresistible.)","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1BNSWR4WMEN2X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0312382278#wasThisHelpful","R1BNSWR4WMEN2X","ACGQBAGOS2G6O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACGQBAGOS2G6O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A great historical novel can transport you to a completely different time and place, a place you are unfamiliar with. Jessie Burton's The Miniaturist does just that. Set in 1686 Amsterdam, we meet young Petronella Oortman, who has just arrived at the home of her new husband, wealthy, influential merchant Johannes Brandt.Brandt is not there to greet his bride, but his sister, cold and imperious Marin is, along with the young maid/cook Cornelia, and Otto, the dark-skinned manservant to Johannes. Petronella is unhappy to find that her husband is gone and his return is unknown.When Johannes does show up, he shows no interest in his new bride. Nella is confused, but to appease his young wife, he gifts her with an exact replica miniature of her new home. He tells Petronella that she may order furnishings from the miniaturist to fill her new replica home.Johannes and Marin argue about Johannes' business. He has agreed to sell a large quantity of sugar for Frans and Agnes Meerman, a married couple with whom Marin and Johannes have a complicated relationship. The book is told through Nella's eyes, so we find out the history of this relationship as she does.When a package arrives from the miniaturist, it contains the items Nella ordered, along with a note that reads EVERY WOMAN IS THE ARCHITECT OF HER OWN FORTUNE. Nella is puzzled by this, and by the fact that there are more items than she ordered in the package. Exact replicas of two chairs, with the same carvings on them as the ones in the salon, along with a cradle, and replicas of Johannes two beloved dogs are also inside.Nella is shocked by how the miniaturist would know what the chair and dogs look like, having never been to her home, and what the cradle means. She sets out to find the miniaturist for an explanation, but is unsuccessful. And then more packages with cryptic notes continue to arrive.A scandal befalls Johannes and he is imprisoned. When Otto disappears after an altercation with a man who works for Johannes, that leaves only the women to carry on. Marin and Nella must pull together and find a way to sell the Meerman's sugar to get money to save Johannes.I loved watching Nella grow in strength. She began the story a young, naive woman, who knew little of the ways of life in Amsterdam, yet like the famous Eleanor Roosevelt saying- ""Women are like teabags- you never know their strength until they are in hot water""- she rises to the occasion when it becomes necessary.We learn so much about the trading business, life in Amsterdam, the food they ate, how the people lived, their prejudices and laws, I found it so fascinating, even though I would have said before I read this book that I wasn't particularly interested in this time period.The Miniaturist is a book that kept me reading on the treadmill just a little bit longer each time I read it, unwilling to put it down. There are strong female characters, a bit of the supernatural in regards to how the miniaturist knew what she did about the family, and a suspenseful plot that propelled the reader to continue on.Burton shares her research at the end of the book, which was extensive, and she includes a photo of the actual miniature house that belonged to the real Petronella Oortman that resides in the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam. You can bet I will be looking for information on the real Petronella Oortman.The Miniaturist will definitely be on my list of Most Compelling Reads of 2014- it's brilliant and breathtaking, and the fact that Jessie Burton is a debut author is astonishing.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R39JJNS34GV12P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062306812#wasThisHelpful","R39JJNS34GV12P","ACGQBAGOS2G6O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACGQBAGOS2G6O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Alan Cumming is an actor who can be unrecognizable from role to role. Today, for instance, he has a costarring role as tightly-wound political operative Eli Gold on the excellent TV drama The Good Wife. At the same time, he is starring as the let-it-all-hang-out Emcee in Broadway's Cabaret.He is incredibly talented, and a very funny presence on TV talk shows. His dressing room at Cabaret is a nightly dance party, one of the hottest invitations in New York City. He is happily married to his husband Grant, and they split their time between New York City and Edinburgh in Scotland, his home country.In his memoir, Not My Father's Son, Cumming divides his story into then and now. Then describes his difficult relationship with his sadistic father, a man who terrorized his entire family, saving particular wrath for his younger son Alan. The family lived on pins and needles, waiting every night to see what would set the father off on a violent rampage.Cumming describes one particularly horrific scene where his father dragged Alan into the barn and chopped his hair off with clippers used on sheep. You can feel the terror on the page as Cumming shares this incident.Now tells the story of Cumming's 2010 participation on a BBC TV show Who Do You Think You Are?, which explores the genealogy of a famous person. Cumming wanted to know what happened to his maternal grandfather, who had fought in WWII in Singapore. His grandfather stayed in Singapore after the war, leaving his wife and children behind in Scotland. In 1951, he died from a gunshot wound under mysterious circumstances.The juxtaposition of the two stories form the basis for the beautifully written, emotionally moving memoir. Cumming writes very openly about the horrors of his childhood, and how that affected him and his older brother Tom, as well as his mother.As Cumming grew older, he had no relationship with his father, and had no contact with him until the week when he was scheduled to film Who Do You Think You Are?. His father contacted Tom and told Tom that he had something to tell Alan, something that would perhaps explain his behavior towards Alan.I have always admired Cumming as an actor, and now I admire him as a writer. His book shows how through pure dint of will, hard work and love, one can overcome a horrible childhood. If memoir is a genre you enjoy reading, put Not My Father's Son on your to-be-read list today. I hope Cumming shares more of his story in a future book.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R35G42HE6Y6OQ9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HU5F3UU#wasThisHelpful","R35G42HE6Y6OQ9","ACGQBAGOS2G6O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACGQBAGOS2G6O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Memoirs are only as interesting as the people who are writing them. At first glance, a memoir about a 37-year-old woman who works part-time as a bartender but wants to be a writer may sound like, oh, no, not another story about someone who can't find her way, but in Weber's hands, Memory Card Full is an honest, fascinating read.Liz is the youngest child in her family. Her older brother and sister have successful careers, and her parents are very supportive and loving, but at the age of 37, Liz is frustrated that she doesn't have a career or even a full-time job.Her dog Rufus is the one mainstay in Liz's life. Coming home to him every night after work keeps her grounded, and as any dog owner knows, a dog's love is unconditional. Liz is never completely alone as long as Rufus is waiting for her at home.The book begins with Liz in Mexico in 2009 on vacation, and we know that Rufus has died. She wants to take a photo, and her camera tells her that the memory card is full, and she has to decide whether to erase some of the pictures of Rufus on her camera.Then we flashback to 2007. Liz breaks up with her boyfriend, and she realizes that she has a bad habit of staying in relationships long after she should have ended them. She works as a bartender at a South Street Seaport restaurant, and her boss is a truly crazy, evil woman whose behavior is appalling.Crazy boss fires Liz, and Liz has to scramble to find another bartending job. Liz also models lingerie, working four weeks a year modeling for manufacturers trying to sell to distributors. Between that and bartending, she manages to cobble together enough money to pay rent, buy groceries, but not much more.She wants to be a writer, but isn't making enough progress there. She has to take a job working days in a law office, which she hates, and between that job and bartending, she has no time or energy to write. She is stuck and her life is in a rut. How can she move forward?Liz's description of working as a bartender is fascinating. Her descriptions of coworkers and customers made me feel like I was right there at the bar, drinking a white chocolate martini. Likewise, her claustrophobic job at the law office had me anguished watching the clock along with her.Rufus is 12 years-old and has a difficult time walking due to his arthritis. Her parents help Liz by taking them to the vet, and paying for it, but it is obvious that Rufus is probably only going to get worse. Liz must face facts that a decision must be made soon.The section on Rufus's dying really moved me. We had to put our beloved dog to sleep a few years back, and I was taken right back there as Liz movingly describes watching Rufus fail, and knowing what she must do.Her grief is palpable, and anyone who has lost a dog will cry along with Liz. She is brutally honest about how painful her grief is, and how it takes her a long time to get through it. I totally related to her.While I didn't totally understand all of Liz's life choices, she writes so honestly and openly about her life that I always found her interesting, and you can't ask for more than that in a good memoir.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R27BSDF8QSFFVD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0988696878#wasThisHelpful","R27BSDF8QSFFVD","ACGQBAGOS2G6O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACGQBAGOS2G6O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Becca Munchmore is 27 years old and the oldest student in her graduate level marketing class. She's worried about fitting in, and wearing her mother's old discarded denim skirt that she found in the Goodwill bag doesn't help.She comes to the realization that school is not the answer. Her boyfriend left her to work in Africa to help the poor, she quit the job she had, and now she has a idea. She loves to bake; why not sell her baked goods to offices? Though her mother hates the idea, she loans Becca the money to buy supplies.Now she just needs an office to start. Her best friend Dez lives across the country, but Dez' husband has a contact in a San Francisco law office and gets Becca an interview. Becca's delicious baked treats win over the friend, and she has her first client.Sal, her downstairs neighbor, drives a taxi and works as a bouncer, but he wants to help Becca with her business. Since Sal has a car and she doesn't, she takes him up on his offer and along with Mom's occasional baking and freezer storage, Becca can make this work.People in the law office love Becca's Best's muffins, cinnamon rolls and breads. She and Sal make twice daily rounds, and they even make friends with a few of the office staff. Except for Jennifer.Jennifer is a lawyer with a bad reputation; people actually run and cower when she shows up. Jennifer also looks just like Becca, so much so that Jennifer's boyfriend Jeff, also a lawyer, begins to show an interest in Becca.Becca thinks Jeff is way too nice to be in love with the horrible Jennifer, and when he kisses Becca, she falls for Jeff. Then she discovers that Jennifer is cheating on Jeff with a married lawyer. Should she tell Jeff?This story could be a typical chick-lit novel, where the kind-hearted heroine gets the rich, handsome guy after he realizes the woman he is dating is no good, and that would have been okay. The story is interesting enough, and I liked the food angle. (The descriptions of Becca's baked goods made me drool.)But the story takes a turn I wasn't completely expecting, and that elevates this novel to a good story. As I was reading How To Bake A Man, all I could think of was that this would make such a cute romantic comedy movie. The characters are interesting, the story has some twists-and-turns, and I could see Emma Stone or Rachel McAdams playing Becca in the movie.How To Bake A Man is the perfect book to pick up on a Friday night after a hard week's work, it's a fun, light read. And it will inspire you to run out to the grocery store to stock up on baking supplies as Inclan includes her delightful recipes for the reader to recreate and enjoy.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1K8VFNBBZ86KW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0957627157#wasThisHelpful","R1K8VFNBBZ86KW","ACGQBAGOS2G6O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACGQBAGOS2G6O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Readers first met Ellie Hogan in Kate Kerrigan's novel Ellis Island. We followed Ellie as she married the love of her life John, came to America to make money for an operation John needed, and was emotionally torn as she built a life in New York while missing her husband back home.The second book in the trilogy, City of Hope, covered Ellie's life back home in Ireland with her husband. It was a difficult adjustment, moving back to a farm in rural Ireland after living in an exciting, vibrant city. After John's death, a grieving Ellie comes back to New York and opens a home for people who lost their homes during the Depression, eventually building an entire community.The third book in the trilogy, set in 1942, is Land of Dreams, which finds a middle-aged Ellie living on Fire Island working on her art. Ellie is a painter, and she has a bit of a following. She has two sons, Leo, the sixteen-year-old son of her second husband Charles, and seven-year-old Tommy, who was left as a baby by his mother in Ellie's care.When Leo runs away from his boarding school, Ellie tracks him down in Hollywood, where he hopes to find a career as an actor in the movies. She intends to take him back home, but after finding him, she decides to give him a chance at the screen test his young agent Freddie has set up for him.Leo gets a small role in a war movie, and Ellie doesn't have the heart to make Leo give up his dream. As an artist, she understands Leo's desire to express himself. She brings Tommy and Bridie, the elderly woman whom she first met when they both worked as household staff years ago in New York, to Hollywood.The family sets up in Hollywood where they seem to enjoy the sunshine lifestyle. This is a different Ellie than we have seen before. In the first two books, she was working and struggling to build a life for herself and her community. Now Ellie is middle-aged, and responsible for her two sons.Ellie had miscarriages during her marriage to John, which brought her great sadness. She never thought she would have children, and now her life revolves around her children. Many women who have children will understand Ellie's feelings about her children growing older and needing her less.This Ellie is more contemplative, more reflective about her life. She doesn't have to work so hard, she has more time to think. She met an older man, a music composer, on the train to Hollywood, and they continued their relationship in Hollywood.Kerrigan's characters are so multi-dimensional, even the minor ones. Stan, the composer, loves Ellie, but he is not willing to pine for her if she will give him no chance. Freddie, the agent, is not some sleazy Hollywood type, but a young man with a goal and he becomes a part of Ellie's family. Even Freddie's actress-girlfriend, who could be a golddigger, is interesting.Many times in trilogies, the main character remains stagnant from book to book. In Kate Kerrigan's Ellis Island series, we experience the growth and depth of Ellie from young girl desperately in love with  her husband and willing to move to America to save his life, to grieving young widow who channels her grief by building a community for those in need to middle-aged mother who loves her children enough to give them their dreams and in turn find her own.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RE7FKXBYTIZT8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HU5NFHI#wasThisHelpful","RE7FKXBYTIZT8","ACGQBAGOS2G6O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACGQBAGOS2G6O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Victoria Fish's debut collection of eleven short stories feature people in moments of crisis. They have troubled relationships with the people in their lives and have to face difficult decisions in her slim collection A Brief Moment of Weightlessness.Fish takes us along a continuum of life, starting with 4th grader Maddie whose father is in prison in the first story Where Do You Find a Turtle with No Legs? to elderly Martha having to face the challenges of aging in the last story Between the Dream and Here. In between we have characters such as a young woman on a semester abroad in India after losing her mother, a stay-at-home mom whose new neighbor is shaking up her world, and a woman whose husband lost his leg in an accident.Each story features unique characters, and Fish is able to draw us into each character's world in just a few pages. She creates an distinct atmosphere for each story, and even though some stories are quite short, she manages to convey a sense of completeness for each one.The most emotional story, and they were all so very moving, is The Last and Kindest Thing, which features the character Adam, an Iraq war veteran who is also in the story Green Line, where we learn he has a young daughter whose mother won't allow him to see because of some undisclosed, most likely post traumatic stress related, incident.In The Last and Kindest Thing, Adam has to take his 95-pound dog Banjo to the vet to be put down. Adam and Marianne are like many people, struggling to stay ahead of the bills while working at low-paying jobs. Adam suffers a bad hand injury and because he has no health insurance, and he ignores the injury until it is almost too late. It's a story familiar to too many people.Anyone who has had to put down a dog will have a tough time not crying at Fish's description of the scene. She manages to bring up all the emotions and we see them come to life through Adam's experience. Adam's story is truly unforgettable.A Brief Act of Weightlessness is filled with characters with whom the reader can empathize. I find myself thinking about them, and I know that this will be a book I return to again and again, confident I will continue to discover something profound about the humanity that exists in us all. I look forward to reading Victoria Fish's next creation.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ZJZGTJE1EILU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1936419408#wasThisHelpful","R2ZJZGTJE1EILU","ACGQBAGOS2G6O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACGQBAGOS2G6O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book has so much that ticked all my boxes- Angela is a strong woman, Flynn is adorable, there are  lots of delicious descriptions of food (recipes included), a group of interesting new friends (with secrets) and a setting that is new to me (I must visit Acadia National Park).As someone who has planned events, I found that part of the story fascinating. And any book that has food at its core, if it is well done like this is, will always appeal to me. I also liked that the characters are not one-dimensional (except the wicked stepmother). Angela's boyfriend Richard could have been the stock guy-who-is-really-a-jerk, but Kline gives him shades of color that made him more interesting.The relationships- Angela and Nonna, Angela and Flynn, Angela and Lindsay- are so believable, you wish you were Angela. I will warn you that The Way Life Should Be will inspire you to dig out all of your food utensils and give Angela's recipes, like Pasta e Fagioli, Chicken Marsala and Basil Marinara, a try.When Tom asks Angela who she really is, she thinks ""the stories we tell about ourselves are filled with half-truths, distorted recollections, and blind spots as well as occasional moments of insight. It's all in the spin, isn't it?"" And, I for one, liked the spin of Angela's story.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2Y3KZ61HHPAH5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0018ND87U#wasThisHelpful","R2Y3KZ61HHPAH5","ACGQBAGOS2G6O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACGQBAGOS2G6O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Baseball fans across the country have been watching with interest and sadness as New York Yankees captain and baseball icon Derek Jeter is playing out his last year in baseball. Many people wonder what he will do next, and his answer is : become a publisher.Jeter has his own publishing imprint with Simon & Schuster, where he will publish books by authors he finds have an something interesting to say. The first book under the Jeter Publishing imprint is for children ages 8-12 titled The Contract. Jeter wrote it with Paul Mantell, and it is based on his own life as a Little Leaguer.Young Derek Jeter, called 'old man' by his mom because he went to school in a suit and carrying a briefcase, is a talented baseball player and a serious student. When his classroom teacher assigns the students an essay describing their realistic future dreams, Derek really wants to write that his future plans include playing shortstop for the New York Yankees.He discusses this with his parents, who encourage him to realize how difficult it will be, but with his excellent work ethic and determination and practice, he can do just that.Derek signs up for Little League and ends up playing on a team with his best friend Vijay. He wants to play shortstop, but the coach's son is the star shortstop with a bad attitude.Much of the book describes in detail many of the Little League games, and children who love baseball will so enjoy the thrilling play-by-play. But this book is also one parents should read to or with their children.Derek would not be the great player he is today were it not for his parents. They created a contract for Derek, detailing what he needs to do to set himself on a path to achieving his dream. The items include respecting himself and others, doing his chores, being a good role model for his younger sister, maintaining good grades and the number one rule is family comes first.The Contract not only teaches children how to be responsible, it can help parents with their own parenting skills. The Jeters are good role models for their two children, and hold them both to high standards, knowing that it is the key to raising good citizens.I liked how important school is to Derek, how he works as hard at school as he does at baseball. And Derek is not a perfect child here; he gets frustrated and angry, but when he makes a mistake, he tries to be better.The final scene is a sweet one, with Derek playing catch with his grandma, with whom he and his sister spend their summers. They clearly have a loving relationship, as many young children do.I highly recommend The Contract for both children who like baseball, as well as their parents. It would make a wonderful gift for the young baseball fan in your life, and it would be a terrific addition to your child's school library.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1LEIC833K8PZW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1481423126#wasThisHelpful","R1LEIC833K8PZW","ACGQBAGOS2G6O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACGQBAGOS2G6O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Katherine Hall Page writes a mysteries series starring Faith Fairchild, a New York City caterer who marries a minister from from Massachusetts and moves there with him to start a family. Like Jessica Fletcher of TV's Murder, She Wrote, Faith frequently finds herself in the middle of a murder investigation that only she can solve.Page's newest book is a short story collection Small Plates, most featuring Faith and her adventures. They are like little tapas, and like tapas, some are more tasty than others. There are nine non-linked stories here, and the last one, The Two Marys, is the longest and in my opinion, the best one.Mary Bethany is a unmarried middle aged women who cared for her parents until their death. Now she only has her beloved nanny goats for company in the winter, and the guests who stay at her B&B home in the warmer months.She finds a baby in her barn on Christmas morning, along with a note asking Mary to care for Christopher, and $50,000 in cash. Mary calls her neighbor Faith and asks her to help her find the mother, whom she believes is in big trouble.I liked the character of Mary, and when Page has the time in the story to draw us into the characters and story, I found it more satisfying.Some of other stories, which are much shorter, are interesting as well, such as Death In The Dunes and Across The Pond, where the moral of the stories is beware of your sister. The Hiding Place has a clever twist to the story of a woman who yearns to start a family with her loving husband, and when she finds that her husband hides things in odd places, she finds it charming- at first.The Would-Be Widower tells the story of Mr. Carter, who wants to be a widower, ""and, since he already had a wife, he figured he was halfway there."" The writing crackles in this one, and like a good Alfred Hitchcock story, there is some humor here as Mr. Carter schemes to kill his wife to accomplish his goal.Sliced is a fun story for fans of culinary reality shows. Faith is a contestant in a cooking competition evening for a local charity. We see some characters we have met in other Faith Fairchild books, like Chef Billy Gold, a man with a huge ego and a bad temper (think Gordon Ramsay) who treated Faith terribly when he gave her a job she started her culinary career.Claudia Westell is a famous TV cook, who uses shortcuts to make easy dishes (like Sandra Lee). Claudia was once Faith's assistant, and Faith fired her when she was caught her scanning Faith's recipes to steal them as her own.The last chef was Jake Barlow, who had a disastrous experience as a chef at a restaurant in Sanpere where Faith and her husband have a summer home. Faith was at the restaurant when Barlow tried to create an over-the-top experience menu that fell flat, and he blames Faith for the fallout.This story is fun because we see Faith create delicious dishes, such a savory bread pudding, using anchovies, baguettes, rainbow and smoked Ghost Pepper flakes and a picnic meal from chicken livers, frozen lemonade, Cheez Doodles and peppermint hard candies.The end of book features recipes from the stories, like Cardamom Raisin Bread, Mussels with Pasta and St. Germain Cocktail.Some of the stories end rather abruptly, like perhaps they were the beginnings of books that were abandoned, but this is a fun little book, perfect for picking up and reading one story at a time when you have a few stolen moments. And it's always fun to catch up with Faith.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1OELIQ0D8JT6Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FJ3AC0G#wasThisHelpful","R1OELIQ0D8JT6Z","ACGQBAGOS2G6O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACGQBAGOS2G6O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The issue of domestic violence is at the forefront of many conversations today, in part due to the horrific video of Baltimore Ravens player Ray Rice knocking his fiancee out with a punch. Randy Susan Myers' timely novel Accidents of Marriage investigates what happens when a man who loses his temper too frequently finally loses control and it costs those he loves a great deal.Maddie is a social worker married to Ben, a public defender celebrated for his passion and intelligence in his work. He is looked up to by his colleagues and worshipped by his female intern. But Ben has a terrible temper, one that only his wife and three children- 14 year-old Emma, 9 year-old Gracie and 7 year-old Caleb- have seen up close.Ben verbally abuses his family and they live in fear of his outbursts, where he occasionally throws plates crashing into the wall. The slightest thing out of the ordinary- dirty dishes in the sink, clothes on the floor- send him into an uncontrollable rage.Funny thing about people who say they can't control their rage; they seem to be able to control it just fine at the office. They never scream at colleagues or clients; they save that for their family.Maddie has to call Ben to pick her up when her car gets towed for having an expired registration. Ben is late for a meeting, furious at Maddie for not taking care of the registration, and on a rain soaked road, he gets into a road rage incident and while speeding has an accident that leaves Maddie fighting for her life.Ben is injured, but Maddie is in a coma. Her family, her parents and sister Vanessa, who doesn't like Ben, are all there. The children are there too, but they are not allowed in the ICU area, so the three young children are in a separate waiting area- all alone.That really bugged me. There are several adults waiting, any one of whom could have gone and sat with these frightened children, who had no idea what was going on with their mother. The judgement of the adults in this situation left me dumbfounded. How could no one comfort those children?The story is told from three perspectives; Maddie, Ben and Emma all get to tell their stories. It is heartbreaking to see this family torn apart, and difficult to see Maddie try and put her life together after a serious traumatic brain injury. She has to start from the beginning and learn how to do everything from walking to talking to cooking, and her frustration comes through clearly on the page.Much of the day-to-day care of the house and the other children is left to Emma. Poor Emma gets overlooked, and so much is dumped into her lap, again without the adults thinking about how she is doing. I felt most deeply for Emma.Meyers does a wonderful job making us feel what this family is going through. Ben still has his anger issues, Maddie is trying to pick up the pieces of her life and figure out just what happened, and the children are struggling too. There is no miracle cure for Maddie, she must fight everyday and it exhausts her.The characters are realistic, and some even unlikable (and not just Ben, I didn't like Vanessa either). The Wednesday Blues Club, made up of women who live with domestic violence in their lives, is a support group that Maddie started in her job and when she returns after her injury, she has a new understanding and it causes her to rethink her own life choices.Accidents of Marriage is a terrific book club pick; there are so many meaty things to discuss in this book.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R262RTSNON8SE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HB62MTI#wasThisHelpful","R262RTSNON8SE","ACGQBAGOS2G6O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACGQBAGOS2G6O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We Are Not Ourselves tells not only Eileen's story, but it is ours too. We want what Eileen wants: love, family, satisfying work, a home of our own, our part of the American dream. We are willing to work hard for it, but along the way things happen that can derail our lives. How we deal with the bumps along the road, big and small, will define us.I loved this beautiful, sad, heartbreaking novel. Eileen is not a perfect woman; her inability to show affection for her son caused both of them much pain. But when the chips were down, Eileen showed her true colors. She did what most us do: step up, soldier on, and do the best we can, even if that sometimes wasn't enough.There were so many things that made my heart hurt here. When Eileen's mother is on her deathbed after years of sobriety, she tells Eileen that she wishes she hadn't stopped drinking. She would have given everything she had a way for another drink. That just killed me.Eileen's relationship with her son was a heartbreaker too. Connell couldn't step up when she needed him to, and he was willing to throw away everything Eileen and Ed had worked for and hoped for him.  Eileen's rage and disappointment is palpable on the page.We Are Not Ourselves is the kind of book that you savor as you're reading, devouring it all and occasionally closing the book to contemplate the beautiful language and story. And when I finished it, I wanted to open it again and start re-reading it, wanting to experience it again and yet regretting that I will never read this stunning book for the first time again. But I know this will be a book I turn to again and again.Frequently books that have such hype can't possibly live up to the expectations. Do not fear, We Are Not Ourselves not only does that, but exceeds it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3LLV4UKJYDTNR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GEEB2WG#wasThisHelpful","R3LLV4UKJYDTNR","ACGQBAGOS2G6O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACGQBAGOS2G6O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Author Chris Bohjalian writes novels about serious subjects. Midwife, chosen as an Oprahs book selection, was about a midwife accused of killing a mother during childbirth. The Double Bind told the story of a young woman attacked while riding her bike, and The Sandcastle Girls brought us into the Armenian genocide in the early 20th century as seen through the eyes of a female American aide worker.Bohjalian is particularly adept at writing strong female characters, usually facing some crisis. His latest book, Close Your Eyes Hold Hands, continues in that tradition, and is considered by many to be his finest book yet.Close Your Eyes, Hold Hands is a heartbreaking novel, beautifully written by Mr. Bohjalian. He creates an unforgettable character in Emily Shepherd  perhaps his best yet. He said that his own teenage daughter helped him find Emilys voice, and he brings her to vivid life on the pages. Weeks after finishing this book, I find myself still thinking and worrying about Emily and Cameron.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R275VH3M2I3JYF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HTMBEN4#wasThisHelpful","R275VH3M2I3JYF","ACGQBAGOS2G6O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACGQBAGOS2G6O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The only down side I had to this product at all was that the spray seemed a bit too direct and should have been a bit wider softer coverage.

"I liked this product, the shampoo and conditioner seemed to work well and thought this might be an added boost. However the directions on this are to avoid using it on your roots.  It is probably just me, but in the morning I don't want to have to worry about avoiding my roots.  I want to just work a product in and comb through and move on to styling, but if I have to avoid roots then I feel I have to be careful of combing and not getting to close to my scalp.

"I was pleasantly surprised with this jacket. Must confess I was skeptical at buying it, due to the paid shipping and the risk of having to pay for return in case it looked awful. I hesitated a while regarding the size as well after reading some reviews in other G by guess products. I ordered a black jacket. Of course it is not leather, but it looks decent. It is comfortable, and has a good fitting. I use size size medium usually, and purchased my own size, which fits really good. Shipping was fast and I got the item within 3 days. I just don't give 5 stars because the zippers were a little weird and faded, but would not return the item and waste 16 bucks(1/3 price of the jacket) for that.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R19RQ58GXGCB38/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MWMT32K#wasThisHelpful","R19RQ58GXGCB38","A22J6UG9Y5F3HC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A22J6UG9Y5F3HC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Great buy for acne/oily skin!First of all, let me say that the packaging of the OZ products are great and the size is just right. I have been using this cleanser for a while, and as someone with oily and acne prone skin, I always have a difficult time buying a cleanser because either they leave my skin too oily due to the oils added in the formula, or they make my skin so dry that within 3 days I am peeling  off, and when I apply foundation my face looks a mess. Thankfully, this cleanser has been great. It smells amazing, keeps my skin clean, fresh, and yet dry and soft for many hours. I use it twice a day because my schedule is crazy, but used combined with my oil free make up, prevents my skin from shinning towards the end of the day, which is something my other cleansers could not provide me. Nevertheless, this is not an exclusive acne treatment product, so it works great for other skin types as well.

"I do hope this collection of ""short stories"" will not be a prequel to the actual story but that all these bits will be incorporated in the work to come.As they are, they are well written and intriguing, but they are also dissatisfying: they read like pages fallen out from the loose binding of a much larger book; they feel incomplete and they raise a narrative tension that goes nowhere.Furthermore it is my opinion that a fairytale such as ""Beauty and the Beast"" can very well span over a long arc full of events and details, but that these events will need to build up a single crescendo and that a HFN ending will simply not do, a HEA being imperatively required.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1MN3GX9HKHUO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00R55WVD2#wasThisHelpful","R1MN3GX9HKHUO","A1DA6E4FNRSAWN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DA6E4FNRSAWN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Should the author happen to read this review, he will be dismayed to learn that a number of typos and grammar mistakes have escaped his and his friends' attention, an exhausting search he writes about in his afterword.That said, they are too few to be disrupting and this is one of the best fantasy I have read in a while together withThe Boy Who Couldn't Fly Straight (The Broom Closet Stories Book 1)While the author seems young (at least young-at-pen), nothing in this M/M urban fantasy is short of professional and well thought of.The Potter series looms in the background and the trio of leads bears similarities to the more famous one but their psychologies are different enough not to spoil the fun and plot is certainly not derivative. Despite some naive turns of events, not too many, the story is original and compelling and the magic lore feels fresh.The book is the first in a series and that is apparent in the several loose threads Mr Early starts to weave into the second half. The complexity of references is not comparable to that of the Potter series, where essentially every page has implications that tie it to future events, but it is more than enough to hint at a rather complex and exciting intrigue.Narrative tension is always there and characters, who appear stereotypical at the beginning, grow up into multi-faceted personalities later on.Descriptions are long and good, even the ever difficult combat/action scenes. Curiosly enough, this work, though far from short, could easily bear many more pages.The M/M element is emotionally explicit but never graphic.While I am writing this review, this title is unavailable on Am. where I got it in the first place. I hope the author is simply revising and adding more pages to it; to retire it from the market would be a real loss.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R226CFBQ56F9YW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MMQYKFG#wasThisHelpful","R226CFBQ56F9YW","A1DA6E4FNRSAWN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DA6E4FNRSAWN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"On paper this M/M werewolf short novel -a self-contained standalone- could be considered unsuccessful for several reasons:- It is essentially devoid of plot -what little there is is extremely simple-;- it is essentially made up of a chain of climactic situations where most things are told and very few shown;- it casts all-powerful and bidimentional leads who get rid of their problems with a wink of their eye; when they face a difficult problem, a new character appears to solve it for them;- sex scenes are explicit but repetitive in premise and vocabulary;- its underlying ethics are questionable: everybody, and the leads especially, is very ready to take offence and decidedly trigger happy; the basic idea is that common people are unable to determine their own life and a superior, benevolent being is needed to guide them;- writing is fairly fluid but it is also peppered by many grammar mistakes and hindered by missing words.- I may not be an accomplished latinist but ""Regem Lupus"" is an eyesore. It should be ""Rex Luporum"" or at least ""Rex Lupus/Regem Lupum"".That said, the reading experience is still fairly entertaining and it is not difficult to read this work to its last page.

"What this novella really lacks is rhythm. And narrative tension which is usually the same.What we get is many dialogues/musings about little or nothing, starting with the lead having lost her parents when she was too young to remember  and making a wordy fuss about it despite having been raised by a uncle with her older brother.Series need to indulge in details to manage world building and length but a modicum of interest should be achieved.","1.0 out of 5 stars","March 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2LIZK2IFM07IG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004X6UHDM#wasThisHelpful","R2LIZK2IFM07IG","A1DA6E4FNRSAWN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DA6E4FNRSAWN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This M/M novella is the first instalment in a fantasy series.Basic plot and world building are interesting and the author has the raw talent of a born storyteller.While the lead develops amorous feelings for his male best friend, bigoted readers need not worry about it. The most they do is kiss and those kisses are only mentioned and not described. Therefore I see no reason why the author should have tagged his work as gay-themed.Unfortunately there are several problems and they must be mentioned because they stand in the way of enjoyment:- editing is quite sloppy. There are typos, word-switches ('cease' instead of 'seize' was recurrent), grammar mistakes and consistency issues far exceeding what may be tolerated in an indie work;- writing is good here and there but more often clumsy and clunky. The author should make the effort of revising his technique to achieve a better fluidity.- the fantasy genre is known for its descriptiveness. In every work, many pages are dedicated to characters' training, travel experiences, military tactics, battle scenes, meaningful dialogues. In mediocre books they are usually very boring but they are the warp of successful ones.Mr Burgess seems to have nor time nor patience to put down these moments and it detracts from the story: things happen too fast. There is a reason why a fantasy volume usually exceeds 400 pages often topping 600; the feeling of reading a draft is thus difficult to avoid.I think the author should enlist the help of a competent editor and try and rewrite this series giving it more breath and scope. It would be worth it.","2.0 out of 5 stars","March 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R64TSZ44S265A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MCZZ3U8#wasThisHelpful","R64TSZ44S265A","A1DA6E4FNRSAWN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DA6E4FNRSAWN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Read the blurb of this collection of three M/M BDSM short stories carefully and raise it to a power before purchasing it, because what you will get is extreme.It is not extreme because of the sexual practices described -which are quite tame and unimaginative- but because the author is perfectly content with his fictional world where only masters and slaves exists and slaves are lesser humans who have no say in their lives because of ferociously enforced laws and, even more than that, because of their ingrained, biological instincts (a dystopian hybris if ever there was one).Readers who think that BDSM can very well trespass the door of the bedchamber even in healthy relationships may find such a narrating device more than titillating but in my opinion it ends by being a double edged sword. In such a predetermined context a writer of genius is required: here writing is fluid, typos are annoying and there is no genius to be found.As a consequence the scope of the psychologies involved is disagreeably limited: the characters of every story are essentially identical to each other; the dynamics are always the same, predictable and boring. The slaves always try to put up a fight but they are soon tamed by their lovers' superior strength and masculinity.Reading this collection -several other stories set in the same world are available- was a bit like reading history books about the condition of women/slaves in our past: disheartening.","1.0 out of 5 stars","March 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1JEXLGSZ1RO4A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00K1O4F74#wasThisHelpful","R1JEXLGSZ1RO4A","A1DA6E4FNRSAWN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DA6E4FNRSAWN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"All in all this is an enjoyable if very short M/M vampire erotic novella, the first part in a series.Writing is generally fluid, the leads are likeable, side characters interesting and the take on the vampire lore rather new.Yet there are problems:- The story is very, very light in that the mystery is no more than a pale excuse; psychologies are bi-dimentional and the growing attraction between the leads is hurried and quite a bit over the top.- The end comes and there is luckily no cliffhanger, but it really feels like the original story was chopped into parts to be sold separately for no real reason.- Editing is an issue as there are typos and rather crude grammar mistakes.- A final problem may be a personal one but is no less annoying: I happen to be a native speaker of Italian with an excellent grasp of French and I have found EVERY SINGLE Italian or French phrase/expletive used in the book to be wrong as only google-translated idioms can be.Just to make a -blatant- point, ""Vincent Kamateros"" is NOT an Italian name, Vincent being English (the Italian is ""Vincenzo"") and Kamateros being a Greek surname.Second, there would be no reason for Vincent, his sister and Angelo to speak English instead of Italian between each other.While it would be unpractical to write long dialogues in a foreign language and translate them in a footnote, the fact could be implied by the simple use of italics.Third, it would perhaps make sense for Vincent to adopt an anglicised version of his name to use in the US, but his Italian family and friends would never use ""Vince"" and ""Cent"" as pet names.Most readers will hardly notice or care, but to me it betrays a lack of research that I deem unprofessional.I am sorry, but stars had to go from the rating because ot this shabbiness.","2.0 out of 5 stars","February 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1XRAWWXNQBH1Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00J5S2KMO#wasThisHelpful","R1XRAWWXNQBH1Z","A1DA6E4FNRSAWN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DA6E4FNRSAWN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Erotica featuring a tentacled being is bound to be kinky.This specific work is even kinkier than expected and adds another element that I cannot spoil for you but that I feel is redundant.The psychological twists are too stretched to be believable but writing is really not bad.Unfortunately the author has taken the common but annoying decision of cutting a short story into three very short parts, offering the first as a freebie and the others at too high a price.

"This novella is possibly one of the structurally most bizarre works I have ever read.Her author wreaks havoc on every literary convention creating at the same time a story an a genre and I have no idea whether this novelty depends on her being an amateur or a refined stylist.After the first few pages, though, one adapts and her plot, basically a mystery set in a urban fantasy setting, flows forward pushed by the outrageous characterization of the leads more than by its simple chain of events.The novella ends with a moderate cliffhanger implying that a sequel is foreseen.

"This is one of the best parodies I have read in a while.Of course it is extremely over the top both in gory and in sexual details and will not be to everybody's taste but I have found it well thought of and decidedly entertaining.The main reason for this success is that its author is just as skilled a professional writer as the writers of the parodied zombie/apocalypse stories would be. So skilled in fact that the story here and there becomes convincingly horrifying: I missed a laughter or two, actually.Complaints:- this is just part one of a series. It is quite short and not self contained, ending with a rather steep cliffhanger. I got this as a freebie but part two is rather expensive and no longer than this one.- Am. lists this work as gay but, at least for this first part, that definition is quite far fetched.

"This is a little M/M short story detailing the unsensational events of a Winter evening and the meeting of two men who might decide to start a relationship; we think it will happen but we do not know for sure as the story ends before that.Everything in this work is understated (and there is no sex) but the end result is so much better because of it: often there is no need to shout what can be mentioned in passing.The past of the two men is only vaguely hinted at, but this stylistical choice does not make it any less painful and is consistent with the unsensational approach.What is clear, though, is how uncomfortable the life of non believers must be in predominantly judeo-christian and conservative US; I must also disagree with the blurb, as Kai does not appear to reconsider his dislike for the season.Writing is fluid but perhaps not as nuanced as the tone of the story required.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2952VUD4ZX2EY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00R6AXLYE#wasThisHelpful","R2952VUD4ZX2EY","A1DA6E4FNRSAWN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DA6E4FNRSAWN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This author has chosen to make some of his (her?) works available for free here on Am. and I gave them a try.This M/M short story -apparently the first in a yet to be published series- at first reminded me of Hollis Shiloh and her heart-wrenching habit of creating horrible, dystopian worlds where a romance manages to be born.There is that, of course, in this alternate reality setting similar to classist XIX century Britain plus the werewolves. The main character and POV bearer, though, is not innocent and naive as he would be with Ms Shiloh: he has been hurt before and he has grown a thick emotional armour. His meeting his partner is underwhelming in that, never for a moment, the author obliterates the harsh reality of their situation.This very adult approach is both rewarding and disappointing for lovers of romance. The work might require a sequel to untie all the emotional knots the author chooses to leave on his characters at the end of the story.Writing is generally good and professional even if sometimes not sharp and cutting enough for the crude approach chosen by the author.","3.0 out of 5 stars","February 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1CKW96Y89A93F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HFUGMFA#wasThisHelpful","R1CKW96Y89A93F","A1DA6E4FNRSAWN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DA6E4FNRSAWN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Where the story loses focus is in the supernatural moments: I understand the author is going for ambiguity and trying not to give background information which could slow the plot but the end result is confused and detracts from the story.The supernatural element assumes a fairly traditional judeo-christian worldview: even if I am always eager for author to relinquish that particuliar lore, I admit that here it is not obnoxious.Grammar could be better.","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1UOL8MMCN5V9W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IWEZ2EU#wasThisHelpful","R1UOL8MMCN5V9W","A1DA6E4FNRSAWN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DA6E4FNRSAWN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If one takes into account that this is a debut novel from and indie author, any criticism has to be toned down as this fairly long M/M fantasy novel, the first in a series, has really much to recommend itself.While Rowling's ""Potter"" series is a clear influence, Mr Jacobson manages to deliver an original, interesting plot with a rich cast of main characters.Side characters, which are many and relevant for the story, are not as well outlined and that betrays the author's lack of experience: if one fails to remember the actions of a side character at the end of the book, it usually means that that character lacks distinctive personality.One also may feel that Charlie's self hatred/homophobia is far too exaggerated and, most of all, unjustified as he does not appear to have grown up in such a bigoted context.Other sides of his development as a person betray some in depth research on the part of the author and do not fail to move the reader.Writing is always fluid and professional but rhythm falters here and there. The classical ""I couldn't put this book down"" does not apply here, as there are several slow moments: nothing too bad or embarassing but a competent editor might suggest some useful revisions.I hated the epilogue as it introduces an obnoxious cliffhanger: it was already more than clear that Charlie and Grace were not done yet and there was no need for such an epilogue whose content should have been moved to the beginning of the second instalment.There are typos and grammar mistakes: they are not disruptive but should be removed with next revision.","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2MM3M6NFHSFM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00F7ZCN1M#wasThisHelpful","R2MM3M6NFHSFM","A1DA6E4FNRSAWN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DA6E4FNRSAWN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"In this M/M short story the author tries to mix romance and BDSM and, while the romance part is satisfying, the BDSM remains a foreign body in the narrative.

"The author of this M/M werewolf novel, the first in a series, has talent: it is kind of rough and uncouth, but it is obviously there, in a story that manages to flow forward and even entertain despite serious issues.Everything here is simple, bordering on the simplistic. Plot is very straightforward, characters are likeable if bidimentional and development hardly there at all.There are grammar mistakes and writing is often plain.The main problem lies in content and ethics, though.In Mr Colton's world gay men are cleft in two groups: there are the pretty twinks, all girly and submissive, both in bed and outside of it and then there are the real men, all hairy muscles and raging testosterone. The only redeeming quality of this unsufferable partition -which exists but hardly represents the totality of the gay world- is that the alpha male is really in love with his submissive pup.Unfortunately all other stereotypes are there, including the most annoying of them all: according to Mr Colton, a man can either be submissive or assertive in bed and if he happens to be submissive in bed he must perforce be unable to fend for himself in his life; he must of course defer to his stronger partner for all relevant decisions and content himself with being pretty, faithful and a bit on the wanton side, but only with his legitimate partner.The villain is essentially a character who did not accept the way of Mr Colton's world and that is rather hard to stomach.Add to this explicit sexism the stereotyped hyerarchies of the most stale werewolf novels and you will have a work whose main fault lies in its predictability.","2.0 out of 5 stars","December 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R223BVQQVBIBPU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IPUMQ0O#wasThisHelpful","R223BVQQVBIBPU","A1DA6E4FNRSAWN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DA6E4FNRSAWN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The picture gives the impression the controller is a fob.  It isn't.  It's pretty large and thick, maybe about 3/4 the size of a deck of playing cards.  The controller plugs themselves are also quite large, about like a large lamp timer.  I don't like the bright red LED on the front when a controller is on.  That's fixable with a little electrical tape.  And others have pointed out the slightly unusual 12V battery.  They're sold at local stores and on-line.  But you probably wont find them at the corner gas station.  So that's the bad.  The good is that I got this to control a fan and light across the room in my home office.  Now when I get a call, I can turn off the fan noise without having to get up.  When dark in the AM, turn the bright pole light on across the room,  then shut it off as the sun comes up without disturbing my work at the computer.  There are other kits like this on Amazon.  But the plug on this one comes out the bottom, which is why I bought this one over the other kits.  If space is tight, there's a lot less sticking out  at the wall since the plug runs down the wall.

I then just let it dangle behind the computer desk.  Now I can get about 6-8 feet away and the connectivity issue appears solved.  So I'll knock off 1 star for that.  Alternate ANT+ sticks are also available on Amazon and auction sites.If I pair/sync via iPhone, it does work fine, from a normal distance, pretty far away.  It also minimally integrates with Apple Healthkit for 3 factors.  Step counting isn't totally accurate but I guess is close enough.I appreciate that this device is waterproof and doesn't need constant recharging thanks to running off button cell batteries.So if you get bit by the connectivity issue, try a USB extension cable.  I suspect a shorter one would work fine.  I just happened to only have a long one.Also - The latest firmware update, which Garmin Express will install if it needs it, will detect sleep automatically and attempt to auto-sync 5x a day if you're in range of your phone (and the app is running) or your computer.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R10YJV2J4TAV63/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RY1Z9NQ#wasThisHelpful","R10YJV2J4TAV63","A11YOTONCPRQ9S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A11YOTONCPRQ9S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I go the DBB version of this fan to reduce future maintenance and replacement of the fan.  On low, it's really quiet.  Medium produces a slight high pitch whir.  High is a very noticeable high pitch whir, even with the case closed up.  It does push some decent air, so I left it on high to see if I learn to ignore it.  The DBB model has no LED's which surprised me a bit.The switch to change the speed is nice if you're sound-sensitive and willing to live with less airflow.  I don't like the noise on high (-1 star).

"Rarely does a David Fincher film let me down. I'm not too fond of The Social Network, but I like what he did with The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo. Gone Girl in some ways reminds me of another dark thriller from last year called Prisoners. Both are great, but this one is perhaps the better of the two. Ben Affleck is a very good director and he proves here that his acting has only gotten better and better with each passing film. Rosamund Pike deserves an Oscar nomination. I remember her as a Bond girl in Pierce Brosnan's last turn as Bond and countless other mostly under the radar movies, but she finally gets a role to show her true acting talents.

"I don't have as much time as I did in the past to write movie reviews and it has been a long time since I have written one, but I just had to say something about this one to hopefully get more people to see it. Begin Again is a great film with wonderful performances, music and even some humor that never felt forced. I had a free pass to see it, but I will surely be buying the blu-ray when it comes out. Mark Ruffalo is dare I say Oscar worthy and Keira Knightly has a good voice to go along with a very nice performance here.

"I didn't plan on seeing this film until I bought both Hunger Games steelbooks that came with two free passes. I was not expecting much at all due to the reviews, but I'm happy to report that Divergent is way better than the critics are saying. It's not quite up to The Hunger Games, but it also strays far away from the awful Twilight franchise, which I was initially afraid it would end up being. The story is interesting and the cast is pretty good, especially Shailene Woodley as Jennifer Lawrence lite. I have a feeling the sequels will be even better since this is really just a long, yet engaging setup.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RF0WV0S6AKNAK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GQQ77IU#wasThisHelpful","RF0WV0S6AKNAK","A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Not nearly as memorable as 300 and if it were not for Eva Green, 300: Rise of an Empire would be a 3 star effort at best. She is comes off as both sexy and scary, being that she is an evil warrior woman you don't dare mess with. There is an empty void where Gerard Butler's presence is missed. He has done a bunch of awful movies since 300 I know, but he was pretty good in the role of Leonidas. Overall, it is much of the same in terms of visuals and bloody action.While far from spectacular, It's not boring in the least and I liked the fact that it is a prequel/companion piece/sequel all rolled into one.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3TZUEZ2ZY5VV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BEJL6Q8#wasThisHelpful","R3TZUEZ2ZY5VV","A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is an absorbing and dark crime drama on HBO that only lasts 8 episodes and will have a new cast and story next season. The writing is second to none and every supporting cast member, both small and large roles, fits just right. We all know by now that McConaughey can really act. After years and years of his talents being wasted, recent films like Mud, The Wolf of Wall Street and Dallas Buyers Club have put him on a career track that few actors ever experience. His work here on True Detective is in my mind the best thing he has ever done. Just hand him the awards and get it over with. Woody Harrelson plays a great foil to his very dark view of the world and the chemistry between the two is outstanding. The beyond beautiful Alexandra Daddario has a brief but ""revealing"" role. Sorry, just had to throw that in there. Game of Thrones is my favorite show, but now HBO has a real contender to fill that Breaking Bad void in my life.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2HKSBXQTWN1ZY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HUCF6KK#wasThisHelpful","R2HKSBXQTWN1ZY","A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I know that many people are split on the first Hobbit film, but I for one really enjoyed it. The Desolation of Smaug suffers from being the middle child and thus having no beginning or end, but it moves at a pretty good pace for being a little on the bloated side. All the acting, sets, music and action are top notch. Some of the FX are hit and miss, but the dragon Smaug is an absolute wonder in both look and sound (voiced by a deep and menacing Benedict Cumberbatch). Martin Freeman remains likeable as Bilbo and the addition of Orlando Bloom (back as Legolas) and Evangeline Lilly as a beautiful Elvish warrior makes for some entertaining fight scenes. It does end on a major cliffhanger as expected, but it felt like it was done to make sure people turn up this time next year for the third and final chapter. I could have easily ended a few minutes later after concluding this part of the story and using the next film to lead into The Lord of the Rings.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 15, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Q4O5FFRRUZ1R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BEJL75I#wasThisHelpful","R1Q4O5FFRRUZ1R","A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This version of Carrie is a modern take on the 1976 version, based on Stephen King's first novel. It adds a few new elements and the cast is quite good, but it is another remake that does not need to exist. We all know what is going to happen and it is nearly a copy in structure. Chloe Grace Moretz has the acting ability to almost make me forget that she is too pretty for the role.

"Gravity is a pretty easy movie to sum up. Beautiful visuals thanks to 100% convincing CGI, great acting and a musical score that adds so much to what you are seeing. There is not too much of a story other than survival in space, though some character development emerges as the movie goes along. Sandra Bullock delivers a performance that should get her another Oscar nomination. Her acting here is very natural and believable. George Clooney is likeable and a perfect contrast to Bullock's uptight and nervous character. I expect to see Gravity up for multiple awards (Picture, Director, Actress, Visuals Effects and numerous other technical ones). Sure it is more of a thrill ride than a structured movie, but it is unlike any movie I've ever seen, especially in IMAX 3-D.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 5, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R39GOSWCFOTWU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005LAIIGW#wasThisHelpful","R39GOSWCFOTWU","A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"If the first Kick-Ass movie was your kind of thing, Kick-Ass 2 more than delivers. The first film was more unique and original, but this one gives you even more laughs and great performances by Chloe Grace Moretz and Jim Carrey.Hit-Girl still rules and it was fun seeing a much larger cast of good and bad characters. Carrey is not in the movie for very long, but he sheds his goofy facial expressions for a realistic and believable tough guy role. He should do more stuff like this. McLovin is much better here this time around and goes from Red Mist to the supervillain with a name I can't repeat here. Aaron Taylor-Johnson is once again good as Kick-Ass, but he spends most of the time (like the first movie) just getting beat up.The violence is a little extreme, but I was expecting more given that Jim Carrey is now against the film due to this fact. Yes it has flaws, but it is a fun ride that had me smiling throughout. Oh, stay after the end credits for a short but important scene.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 24, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3Q3R730ZZ7LHB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BEIYH6U#wasThisHelpful","R3Q3R730ZZ7LHB","A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A family gets together after many years and everyone begins arguing at dinner when all hell breaks loose from some outside intruders. That is pretty much the simple setup.While You're Next is far from original, it does many things right. You care about some of the characters a little more than the average slasher film and the female lead is really smart for a change. Finally an intelligent and tough person to root for instead of yelling at them for doing every idiotic thing in the book. Plenty of gore, solid thrills and even a decent twist or two makes this horror film an enjoyable if somewhat familiar take on home invasion terror.It's also worth mentioning that this film was suppose to be released years ago after much buzz, but something happened with the studios and they shelved it until now.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 23, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1OT8RQO77X763/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BEIYNIW#wasThisHelpful","R1OT8RQO77X763","A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"James Wan is a horror director that might have finally peaked with this one. His first SAW film was the best of the bunch and while Insidious had flaws, it also had some great scare moments and visuals. The Conjuring is a near perfect ghost/demonic possession movie. The scares are not cheap and they are 90% effective. A couple felt a little forced, but overall this is one the creepiest movies I have seen in theaters.Based on a ""true story"" that takes place in 1971, a family becomes the victim of some evil forces in their new house. Two paranormal investigators are brought in to gather evidence. They are based on the famous couple that also investigated The Amityville Horror years later.The acting is great all around from the kids and adults. I like how they didn't use any big name actors. Vera Farmiga, Patrick Wilson and Ron Livingston are relatively well known, but thankfully no huge star power here to completely take you out of the film.Very little gore, no foul language or nudity in a horror movie? Believe it or not, this thing earned the R rating for pure scares alone. Now don't get too overhyped or anything. I personally didn't jump in my seat or want to cover my eyes (though many scenes are quite chilling), but plenty of people around me did.This is the first movie that has made me want to review it in a month. The Lone Ranger (2 and 1/2 out of 5 stars) and Pacific Rim (3 and 1/2 out of 5 stars) didn't surprise me enough to warrant my time reviewing them.The Conjuring is my favorite film so far this year.

"Now I enjoy X-Men, Spider-Man, Iron Man and all of the Avengers, but for me they don't compare to Batman and Superman. In fact, after Nolan's Dark Knight Trilogy, I would rank Man of Steel as the second best of all the recent comic book turned movies. I knew going in that the critics were nearly 50/50 on the good and bad side of the fence, so my expectations might have been lowered enough to prepare for the worst and surprised when it didn't happen.The story begins with the same old origin of Superman, but there are enough little changes in the script and nice visual touches to make it seem fresh. As expected, the CGI FX and Hans Zimmer's score are stunning throughout.Henry Cavill makes for a good and believable Superman and Michael Shannon plays a memorable villain in General Zod. Russell Crowe really surprised me with a strong emotional turn as Jor-El. He is a good actor, but his work of late has been rather weak. I normally can't stand the character of Lois Lane, but I like her here, so that is saying something about Amy Adams.It's not perfect of course. The narrative did not always gel, jumping around too often, and it ran for maybe 15 minutes too long.I saw it in digital 2-D due to all the bad IMAX and 3-D reviews. It cut my ticket price in half and I didn't feel like I missed out. Also, my full theater clapped and cheered loudly when it was over. I had not heard a reaction like that in a long time.With the 129 million dollar opening weekend, I feel this is but the first film of a trilogy that will probably get even better now that the foundation has been laid down.4 and 1/2 out of 5 stars","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 17, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R5QPIVXKZO5CQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008JFUPK8#wasThisHelpful","R5QPIVXKZO5CQ","A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Into Darkness is better than the last cartoony yet enjoyable relaunch from 2009, but it seems to be trying to hard to feel like a Star Trek film. It doesn't help that the story this time around is far from original. Still, it is a lot of fun with great CGI, good acting and a nice dose of humor. Benedict Cumberbatch makes for a strong villain due to his still gaze and deep voice, though he fails to measure up to the charisma that Ricard Montalban brought to the role of Khan.I would still take The Wrath of Khan, The Undiscovered Country or First Contact any day over these last two entries, but they do have a wide appeal and in my opinion are more enjoyable than the last two Iron Man movies.After watching Into Darkness it's no wonder that J.J. Abrams is taking over the other epic Sci-Fi saga, which is his true love anyways.

"Iron Man 3 is an improvement over the last installment, so it is a bummer that it ultimately lacks a clear and memorable villain. Ben Kingsley is a great actor of course and his acting is fine here, but without giving too much away, I feel cheated by the advertisements. I will leave it at that. Robert Downey Jr. turns in his best Tony Stark performance yet. I don't like his ego in reality, but he sure was made to play this character.The CGI is of the highest quality as expected and while most of the movie lacks action, the final act easily makes up for it. In Iron Man 3 you get more Tony Stark the man than you get Tony Stark in the Iron Man suit.The writing is pretty good and there are some very funny lines, but it can almost get too silly at times. They also felt the need to throw out references to what happened in The Avengers film every so often. We get it.IMAX 3-D was not really worth it. The 3-D was done after the fact and it only added so minor depth.For the first BIG movie of 2013 it is a good start.

"This film was way better than I expected going in. It features some of the best visual effects I have seen in a long time, but it doesn't sacrifice character development or a good story in the process. Oblivion feels like a much more complete movie than the director's last effort, Tron: Legacy, which was pretty much just eye candy. The musical score is also a thing of beauty. I need this soundtrack!I may not like Tom Cruise the person, but he can more than hold his own on screen. Morgan Freeman is always good, even in a tiny role like this. The two female leads are easy on the eyes with Andrea Riseborough turning in a memorable performance as Jack's (Tom Cruise) mission partner/lover and Olga is well...easy on the eyes.The story does get a little confusing from time to time and some of the twists were a bit obvious (at least to me), but by the end I pretty much had it all figured out.

"I've been a fan since I bought Horror Show back in 2001. I include myself in the majority group that think Matt Barlow will always be the voice of Iced Earth, but newcomer Stu Block is nothing short of spectacular here. He has the low and high range of Barlow, plus he can scream as high as the bands previous vocalist, Tim ""Ripper"" Owens. If you weren't totally sold on him after Dystopia (I think most were), this 2 1/2 hour live performance will make you a believer. The band is tight and the energy from the crowd is unlike any concert DVD/Blu-ray that I own.This is a great buy for the price. You get 2 CDs and 1 DVD that capture the entire show, along with a few extras that show the making of this one of a kind concert that was filmed on some ancient stone ruins. The picture is near Blu-ray quality and the sound is loud and broken up nicely.With founder/guitarist Jon Schaffer leading the way and Stu delivering the lyrics, Iced Earth should be cranking out nothing but classics in the near future. It's also refreshing to know that an American band is representing ""Iron Maiden"" style metal, when most of the better bands right now are from Europe.

"I think it is safe to say that Evil Dead is one of the best horror remakes ever. It is similar enough to the original (although much more serious, with little humor), but feels like more of a sequel instead of a copy. It does start off a little slow with some less than realistic dialogue, but it picks up as soon as they find that twisted brown book. From then to the end it is non-stop gore, gore and more gore. I don't know how they got away with some of this stuff. I've seen much worse, but it doesn't hold anything back. For a lower budget film, the make-up and thankfully non-CGI effects are some of the best in recent memory. There are a few creepy moments, but I wouldn't call this movie scary. The cast is good for this genre, but the only real standout is Jane Levy as the main girl who gets possessed. She goes through every emotion and is very believable.They showed the new trailer for the remake of Carrie and it looks to be another good stab at a classic.Evil Dead is worthy of my Blu-ray horror collection.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 5, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZU3GSWY8L3GR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008JFUO0Y#wasThisHelpful","RZU3GSWY8L3GR","A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Four stars might be a stretch, but there were enough memorable characters and magical moments to just barely save the day. Then again it's pretty sad when the two best characters are a CGI china doll and a talking monkey in a suit. I loved both of them.James Franco as Oz shines and fails from scene to scene. Mila Kunis as one of the three witches can't seem to shake her That 70's Show/Family Guy voice and it get really annoying, especially towards the end. The other two witches played by Michelle Williams and Rachel Weisz thankfully fare much better.The IMAX 3-D is done really well and is worth the extra money, though the film is way too CGI heavy. Beautiful, but hollow. I did like how the first 20 minutes was in 1:33:1 screen ratio and black and white. It gave the opening the right feel.Danny Elfman usually works his musical magic with Tim Burton and often sounds like a broken record, but his Oz score fits the tone and visuals.

"If you liked the remake or the prequel, this ""direct"" sequel to the original 1974 film will probably entertain you enough. You have your iconic villain, heavy gore, two gorgeous babes and a typical paper thin script. I mean the main girl in this is in her early 20's and was born right after the 73' massacre, so the movie would take place in the mid to late 90's right? Not unless someone traveled back in time and brought an iPhone with them. Also there is a grave that marks a person's death in 2012.

"The Last of the Mohicans is one of my favorite movies, filled with great acting, music and scenery. This film transports you back to 1757 and into the wilderness where the Indians thrived. Daniel Day-Lewis showed even back in 1992 that he had an acting range like no other, going from his Oscar win in My Left Foot to this colonial ""white Indian"" action hero. Madeline Stowe made the love story aspect believable and Wes Studi is easily one of the most memorable villains ever. The final sequence on the mountain, with almost no dialogue and the hypnotic music building as the action unfolds is something you will never forget.This is the best version out there.

"Wow! Rush is one of the few ""older"" bands that still manages to put out solid music every few years or so. I've been listening to Clockwork Angels since it came out in June of last year. Every song is very good to great, featuring some of their best melodies to date. Geddy's bass playing is at an all time high, while Lifeson creates some memorable riffs and Peart fills in all the rest like the legend he is. One of the most complete albums I have heard by any band. Leave it to Rush to put out one of their best albums 40 years into a career.

"Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters is like a bloody and F-Bomb filled version of Van Helsing. In this case, that is a good thing. Van Helsing was pretty bad, but they pushed this one far enough with the R rating to please the horror fan inside me. The witches look nice and creepy and most of the CGI is well done. Jeremy Renner (Hansel) is a fantastic actor, though he is mostly wasted here and Gemma Arterton (Gretel) is more of the focus based on her looks and her character's personality. Famke Janssen has fun with the lead evil witch role. This film barely runs 90 minutes and it is light on story and high on action, but I had a good time watching it. Worth a future rental if you don't mind turning your brain off and just enjoy the fact that it is not as bad as you feared it would be.Oh, the IMAX 3-D was better done than most non-blockbuster type action films.Edit (7/6/13): I had to knock it up a star after watching the Unrated Cut.

"Mama is a good semi-creepy horror movie about two young children who spend five years alone in the woods and are later found and adopted by their uncle (the Kingslayer actor from Game of Thrones) and his wife (the always great Jessica Chastain in full goth mode, trading in her trademark red hair for black and sporting tattoos). Of course, something the children call ""Mama"" comes home with them and thus the horror begins. Maybe a little too much CGI used, but most of it looked okay. All in all, this is a well made ghost story that packs a few scares and has good acting throughout.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 19, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RVI1JQXONDY7A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AIBZM40#wasThisHelpful","RVI1JQXONDY7A","A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I caught this over the weekend since it is no longer just in limited release and I'm glad I did. The story (based on a true one) follows five family members on vacation when one of the worst natural disasters of all time hits. The Impossible works because of very good performances from Naomi Watts, Ewan McGregor, the three child actors (especially the oldest) and the sheer realism of the 2004 tsunami brought to life on screen and portrayed in true horrific fashion. There are a few too many tear inducing scenes with swelling music to accompany them, but this film will leave you emotionally drained by the time the credits role.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 6, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R25S69QBQ3X6V2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AIBZK1U#wasThisHelpful","R25S69QBQ3X6V2","A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm not a fan of musicals, but I did catch Les Miserables and The Phantom of the Opera when I visited New York City back in 2001. I was surprised to find that I enjoyed this one the most. The music was great and the story, while quite depressing, was well done.The big screen version did not let me down. Anne Hathaway is only in the movie maybe 15 minutes, but she steals the show. Her singing of ""I Dreamed a Dream"" in one take is almost too powerful. Her acting in this scene alone adds layers that the stage production could never achieve. Hugh Jackman makes a wonderful Jean Valjean and Russel Crowe has the presence of a good Javert, but he is the weakest singer in the cast. Not as bad as I had heard, so he was really better than I expected. All of the singing was done live while filming, so it's brave, but maybe the wrong choice for Mr. Crowe. Great visuals round out a film that no theater lover should miss.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 31, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R23N091GZ0V3QQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005S9EKCW#wasThisHelpful","R23N091GZ0V3QQ","A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have a feeling the next two films in The Hobbit trilogy will be even better, but An Unexpected Journey is still a beautiful and engaging piece of movie magic. The acting by Martin Freeman as Bilbo Baggins, Ian McKellan as Gandalf and all the dwarves were great. The man and voice behind Gollum also has a memorable 10 minutes of screen time. The CGI is of the highest calibur, but I did miss the real make-up effects used for the Orcs in LOTR (almost all the faces and bodies of the Orcs are pure CGI here). I think many critics are being far to harsh, though the majority still liked it. This is much smaller in scale than the LOTR, but its is still filled with wonderful characters, action, music and another amazing quest we will have to wait another two years to complete.IMAX 3-D is the way to go if possible, which includes a 9 minute scene from the new Star Trek: Into Darkness film.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 15, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R35R9JRBRPNXDH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0059XTU22#wasThisHelpful","R35R9JRBRPNXDH","A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a horror sequel where you don't have to see the first to follow along, but it does bring back the main  hero and villain from the previous movie. The cult following of the original made this film possible, so give it a look. A thief breaks in a house and ends up trying to save the family being tortured by another unwanted vistor that beat him to scene. But wait, this killer has set up believable traps all over the house. The sequel expands the scope to an old hotel and has 10 times the body count. The first is dark and isolated, much like Alien. And like Aliens, the sequel is more in your face and action oriented. There are still a few really good scares and plenty of gore, with a villain that is truly chilling in appearance and the way he kills. Think Jigsaw and his traps, but he also does some of his killings himself with his arsenal of knives.

"After a very long wait in my rental queue, I finally got a chance to see this much hyped film, but now I wish I had bought it. 20 or so cops enter a building full of the worst scum and have to fight there way through hundreds of bad guys to reach the boss on the top floor. Simple, yet executed to perfection. Basically the same concept as Dredd 3-D which came out this year. There is an insane amount of carnage on display. Gun fights, knife fights, machete fights and some of the best hand to hand fights ever. To top it all off the acting was very good and the subtitles don't get in the way because there is very little talking to begin with.

"Make no mistake about it, Lincoln is a movie full of talking, talking and more talking. There is very little action, but the script and acting are second to none. It also somehow found room for some really good humor. Sure the history is off here and there and it does have a few moments where it seems to drag, but Steven Spielberg has crafted a fine telling of the last months of Lincoln's life and the passing of the 13th Amendment to abolish slavery.Daniel Day-Lewis spent a year preparing for this role and not only does he look like Lincoln (you don't even have to squint your eyes) he pours every ounce of facial and vocal expression to the point where you can't take your eyes off him when he's on screen. He speaks both softly and wisely, with a good story always ready to share with others. I think come February he will be the first man to win 3 lead acting Oscars (he should have won for Gangs of New York too). Sally Field, Hal Holbrook, James Spader and countless other familiar faces are all excellent, but Tommy Lee Jones stands out the most of the supporting cast. You can't help but love his character and he supplies many of the laughs.I'll admit that without the fine performances the movie would likely be a tad on the boring side since it's all word play and no explosions, but due to the dedication put forth you will feel like you've been transported to back to 1865.4 and 1/2 out of 5 stars","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 18, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1NZ9WDQ8O8SEN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009AMANBA#wasThisHelpful","R1NZ9WDQ8O8SEN","A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Is Skyfall better than Casino Royale? Too close to call, but after the below average Quantum of Solace, I can say that Bond is back in top form. Great action (best opening sequence ever...you know the one involving the train bit shown in all the trailers), story and acting. Daniel Craig turns in his best performance yet and truly has become a first rate James Bond. Javier Bardem plays a very weird and creepy villain here. Almost polar opposite in style (other than the bad hair) of his turn in No Country for Old Men. Judi Dench plays M brilliantly for the seventh time and gets more screen time in Skyfall than all the others combined. The two Bond girls are good. One plays a major role as Bond's ""partner"" and has a famous last name revealed at the end. The other is pure eye candy. 007 fans are sure to appreciate all the little gags from previous films in the series. We even get a young Q.So any flaws?

"Thankfully this prequel to the Shrek franchise, Puss in Boots, is better than the last couple of movies featuring that green ogre. It avoids all the pop culture references and introduces a brand new story with some interesting characters. The voice work from Antonio Banderas as Puss is outstanding and Zack Galifianakis fits in nicely as the voice of Humpy Dumpty. The movie is beautiful to look at and some of the jokes are really funny, but the story did lack in content.

"Immortals is plain and simply a fun take on Greek mythology. After the Gods fail to answer his prayers, King Hyperion searches for the Epirus Bow in order to release the Titans and destroy the human race. It is up to young Theseus to become the leader he was meant to be and stop this mad King. Sure, the story is thin and the dialogue isn't groundbreaking, but man did those fight scenes deliver the goods. It basically combines elements from Clash of the Titans and 300, only with more blood and extended combat scenes where you can actually see the damage being inflicted. Due to popular demand in the comments section, the next sentence is a SPOILER. I absolutely loved the scene where the Gods came down and fought the Titans at the end. What a beautiful display of visually gory bliss. The CGI was mostly used to great effect, which was a shocker. The way Mount Olympus was portrayed was the best version I have seen, with very little cloud coverage.The acting from Henry Cavill (aka the new Superman) was more solid than expected, but I thought Mickey Rourke stole the show as the evil King Hyperion. He is the most ruthless and intimidating villain I've seen in recent memory. Darth Vader looks like a nice leader in comparison, because if you fail this guy, you will die in a very unpleasant manner guaranteed. At least Vader gave that dude more than one chance. Luke Evans made a very good Zeus as well.If you want some excellent and violent action scenes, coupled with some good performances, this is worth seeing. 2-D was good enough for me.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 14, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3KGG9LKPGLD3H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004LWZW8S#wasThisHelpful","R3KGG9LKPGLD3H","A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Thing (2011) should have a different title because it is a prequel, not a remake. It shows what went down at the Norwegian's camp that Macready (Kurt Russell) and his crew investigated in John Carpenter's 1982 classic. You know, an alien is found frozen in ice that has the ability to copy other organisms and often twist itself into grotesque forms before killing someone. Unfortunately it is almost an exact copy of the last movie, but with weaker characters and hit and miss CGI. The nearly 30 year old practical effects blow away the SFX here, but they are not so horrendous that it ruins the whole experience. The best parts of this prequel are when the paranoia sets in and nobody trusts anyone. The cast is better than your average horror movie nowadays. Mary Elizabeth Winestead does a good job as the lead character, but nobody is developed enough to care about. I did like how the scenes during the end credits directly leads into Carpenter's The Thing. We even get a few of those eerie bass lines that brought so much tension all those years ago.Some will like it for being a companion piece to the 1982 film and others will hate it just because it doesn't achieve any level of greatness, or try to be anything other than a copy (ha, fits the theme of the movie) of what came before.On a side note, I always wondered what the true form of The Thing creature actually looked like. The alien that is frozen in the block of ice has claws and doesn't resemble something that could build such a huge and complex spaceship. My theory is that the ""Thing"" infected the alien crew of the ship on some planet and caused them to crash on Earth. Uh oh, I can see it now. The Thing vs. Aliens vs. Predators!

"First off, the trailers didn't quite sell the movie to me, so I went in the theater today with low expectations. I left pleasantly surprised...It's set in the near future where boxing and even mixed martial arts doesn't display enough carnage for audiences. They turn to 8 foot robots controlled by human ""trainers"" to get their fix. Hugh Jackman turns in one of his best non-Wolverine performances as a no good father and former boxer who now uses fighting robots to make (or in his case lose) money. He chooses to sell his son, left alone after his mother died, for $100,000 to the boy's Aunt and Uncle. But first he has to spend a couple of months with him while the boy's future guardians are in Europe. It turns out that his 11-year-old knows even more than he does about robotic fighting. They end up stumbling upon an older model bot (named Atom) in a junk yard and from there they begin to train it and almost in Rocky like fashion Atom becomes a crowd favorite and gets a shot at the title. I thought the boy actor was excellent as well. He had a lot of attitude, but he never got annoying. Evangeline Lilly of Lost fame is here to showcase her beautiful face, but doesn't get much more to do than be a love interest for Jackman's character.The CGI is great. Unlike most scenes in the Transformers movies, you can actually tell the robots apart and the action is easy to follow.Sure it has the usual corny moments and the giant robots fighting in a ring sometimes comes off silly, but I really enjoyed Real Steel. It sometimes feels like an emotional family film about the relationship between a boy and his father, but it doesn't get too sappy and there is plenty of action to balance out all of the feel good stuff.

"I have been playing Dead Island for a few weeks now and it is still really fun, especially the RPG upgrade system combined with 1st person combat. This is a long game. Basically, you are trying to find a way off a beautiful tropical island infested with zombies. There are four different characters to play as and each has their own speciality. You mosty use melee weapons to slice or bash the brains out of the undead. Later in the game you get access to some firearms and the always enjoyable method of running them over in a vehicle. The main story and sidequests are at least 25 hours of solid zombie killing goodness.The graphics are okay, but not in the league of the top PS3 games. At times there are pop ups and slight glitches in the graphic department, but it doesn't ruin the experience. The voice acting and story are average, but most of the quests are pretty fun.

"Well...I can't remember seeing a good John Carpenter film released after the 80's until I watched The Ward last night. I'm a huge fan of Halloween, The Fog and The Thing, so obviously Carpenter is my favorite horror director of all time. The script and music are not of his doing here, but his direction is as solid as ever. It's about a girl who gets put into a mental hospital in 1966. She meets some other girls her age there and then she begins to realize that some dark force is keeping them from ever getting a chance to leave alive. The acting from all the girls is good, with Amber Heard turning in her best performance. The script does borrow from a number of movies and the twist is satisfying, but it seems almost a copy of two other films I won't mention (it would give it away). Not a masterpiece by any means, but this is still a solid thriller that doesn't outstay it's welcome at just over 80 minutes long.3 and 1/2 out of 5 stars","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 24, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R19V6CQR8QGKMS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0052DP1TA#wasThisHelpful","R19V6CQR8QGKMS","A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I decided to watch the original Straw Dogs about a month ago since I knew I would be seeing this remake in theaters. I didn't love the 1971 version starring Dustin Hoffman, but for the time it was released it was very brutal and I got the point the director was trying to make. This telling of Straw Dogs is basically a copy, other than the fact that it's a town full of stereo typical rednecks. You know, a screenwriter and his hot actress wife move into her dad's house after his death. She grew up in this isolated town and her old boyfriend and his buddies spend more time drooling over her than working on the barn roof they were hired for. Things get pushed too far and wimpy screenwriter unleashes Home Alone trap style hell on them.The acting is one of the better aspects of the movie. James Marsden and Kate Bosworth (beautiful, but it wouldn't hurt for her to gain 15 pounds) do the best work of their careers here. Both are very believable, as is the leader of the bad guy gang, Alexander Skarsgard, of True Blood fame. James Woods even shows up to play the town drunk and unofficial town leader with a mean streak.The first 3/4 of the movie is just a slow build up to the final 1/4 bloodbath. The rape scene isn't graphic as say The Last House on the Left, I Spit on Your Grave or even the original Straw Dogs, but that doesn't make it any easier to watch. The violence at the end is gory, though it smartly doesn't stray from realism.I would compare this to The Last House on the Left remake. At least both didn't try to water things down in order to get a PG-13 rating, but there is really no need to rush out and see something that is an 85% copy of 40-year-old film.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 17, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3TWTB9U4UW2TI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0034G4P44#wasThisHelpful","R3TWTB9U4UW2TI","A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Think of Contagion as a more realistic version of Outbreak. A deadly virus is spreading around the world at an alarming rate and the CDC works to find out where it originated from and of course, a cure. The cast is packed full of stars, minus the heavy make-up and great lighting in order to resemble us normal people I guess. This is truly an ensemble piece with Matt Damon, Jude Law, Kate Winslet and Laurence Fishburne having the most screen time. There is no real lead performance, which can be a bit jarring for some. There is a whole lot more talk than action, which may bore some, but I found it intriguing.The movie hits hardly any wrong notes and it might make you think twice before touching anything in public or leaving the house for that matter.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 14, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/RYFY77XWUXPMT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004EPZ0A2#wasThisHelpful","RYFY77XWUXPMT","A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Our Efco brushcutter sometimes needs many pulls to get started in cold weather. Replacing the little T handle with this allows you to make multiple pulls in quick succession without much strain on your fingers and allows you to pull it wearing mittens. After I cut off the old knot I melted the ends with a match (don't do this just after you add gasoline) so the cord would go through the handle more easily and added a small flat washer to reduce the chances of the new knot slipping through the handle. It shouldn't slip through if you make a good knot but the washer is extra insurance.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2CQERDX63VXDO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0015MLQ00#wasThisHelpful","R2CQERDX63VXDO","A32GW1R9MW0XOH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A32GW1R9MW0XOH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The switch on my Water Pic broke. I soldered the connections together inside the assembly and then installed this switch in the line. Separate the two wires of the cord with a razor knife and cut just the hot wire (the one that goes to the small prong on the plug) not the neutral (ribbed) wire.

"The old valve was leaking and this one fixed the leak. Here are the installation steps for those wondering if they can do this. Turn off the electricity to the ignitor. If you have a pilot light model, turn off the gas. Turn off the water supply to the house and the cold water inlet to the water heater. Open a downstairs cold water faucet and a downstairs hot water faucet and make sure the water is off. Unscrew the old valve overflow tube. Drain out water from the water heater to below the level of the valve. It took me about 10 gallons, drained out of the faucet at the bottom of the water heater a cup at a time. Open the old valve and make sure no water comes out before removing it. There are threads on this faucet but my standard hose didn't fit them. Use a pipe wrench to unscrew the old valve. The new valve already has Teflon tape on it. Screw it hand tight, then more than one turn but less than two with the pipe wrench to make sure it is tight. Reverse the other removal steps. My overflow tube is pretty loose but it probably doesn't matter because it just needs to deflect water a little. It was longer than it needed to be so I cut a few inches off it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZG5FGGRPWQIN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000BQSINO#wasThisHelpful","RZG5FGGRPWQIN","A32GW1R9MW0XOH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A32GW1R9MW0XOH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
