"This is a nice design.But if you're trying to match Crate and Barrel Gourmet, it isn't quite a match, at least not for the flatware marked 18/8 Stainless Japan.The biggest difference is the color.  Compared to the C&B version, it has grayish cast that some might describe as more like nickel.  It's subtle but easily noticeable, though maybe not in dim dinner lighting.  I prefer the silver stainless color. Even if I were buying an entire new set and matching color weren't an issue, I'm not sure I'd buy these.This also has the Boda Nova Vietnam marking, in black or dark gray, most noticeably on the knife blade.  For too prominent, even if one weren't trying to match the C&B set.The size of some pieces are also slightly different.  In addition, the shape of the pieces is slightly different - the C&B have a shape that varies in all three dimensions more.  Although you'd likely only notice either issue if you put them side by side and looked carefully.Obviously, these are issues that won't matter to lots of people.  Whether this set works for you depends on your needs and tastes, and the price.  Just FYI.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R21OJT4D2B9YRO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CD24RFW#wasThisHelpful","R21OJT4D2B9YRO","A2EF8N7ZE7ONWX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2EF8N7ZE7ONWX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"THE QUICK TAKE:  The Bose 251 Environmental speakers are a well built, well designed set of outdoor speakers, with some distinctive and effective features.FULL REVIEW:TWO TWIDDLERS FOR A WIDE SOUND FIELD:  High frequency sound, typically delivered by the ""tweeter"" in a speaker, is much more directional than low frequency sound (that's the bass and mid-bass, generated by the ""woofer"" in a speaker).  In an outdoor area, the listening positions are fluid and often located over a wide area.  With a conventional speaker design - with a single, front firing tweeter - only some areas will hear full-frequency sound; other areas will lose the high end.The design of the Bose 251 addresses that issue by including two 2.5"" ""twiddlers"" (a Bose trademark) in each speaker.  These are larger than typical 1"" to 1.25"" tweeters, and cover a broader frequency range.The two speakers ""fire"" or face in two directions, to the front right and front left of the speaker (about 4 o'clock and 8 o'clock if you were looking at the speaker from above - so a little more than 90 degrees rotation).  (There's a good picture at the Crutchfield site, which isn't shown here at Amazon, that illustrates the tweeter configuration much more easily than I can describe it.)The result of the design of the Bose 251 is that the mid and higher frequency sound is dispersed over a much wider area than in a conventional speaker design.  That's more than a theoretical benefit  - it's a meaningful advantage in most real-life, outdoor areas where speakers are used.EFFECTIVE CABINET DESIGN:  Speaker design is a matter of physics and acoustics.  The cabinets are large enough (13.5"" high x 6"" wide x 8.5"" deep) to deliver meaningful bass for music, providing well-rounded tone.  Just note that no speaker this size can deliver home-theater, chest-compressing bass, or anything close to that - the laws of physics don't allow it.  Also, it's much harder for a system to deliver bass outside than indoors.FLEXIBLE MOUNTING OPTIONS:  The shape of the speaker and the design of the bracket make mounting fairly easy, and give you options.  These can be mounted on a wall or rail, right side up or upside down.  However, they should be mounted vertically, not horizontally.SOLID BUILD QUALITY:  The cabinets are durable and designed to last.  Bose's tests suggest they are an option for a boat or a dock, not just outdoors.  They include a 5 year warranty.In a mid to higher end installation, or for anyone seeking a speaker that will hold its value, the Bose 251 is a good option.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 18, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2XTI2N1N38O9J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00006I53D#wasThisHelpful","R2XTI2N1N38O9J","A2EF8N7ZE7ONWX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2EF8N7ZE7ONWX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"QUICK TAKE:  The Energizer LED Pop Up lantern is a good compact option among small LED lanterns.  It collapses to 4"" tall and is bright for its size.  Depending on your needs, also consider the lighter but not as bright Coleman High Tech LED Mini Lantern.FULL REVIEW:Well done, compact LED lanterns are relatively new products.  The latest models use more efficient LEDs that last longer, and have more useful designs.More importantly, the best LED lanterns and flashlights offer a choice of a number of light levels.  That allows you to adjust for the amount of light you need, or the amount of battery life you require.  That can provide critical flexibility in make the most of every ounce you're carrying. Being able to use a lower light level can dramatically extend your runtime.In addition, human eyes will adjust pretty remarkably if you allow them - the light levels you need are far less than you may think.  Lower light levels also allow your eyes to adjust so you see better outside the immediate area illuminated by the lantern.The natural comparison in this class of lantern is between this Energizer Pop Up Lantern and the Coleman High Tech LED Mini Lantern: - The Energizer's key distinguishing features are its ability to collapse to just 4"" tall, and its brightness.  It uses 4AA batteries, and weighs about 11 ounces with the batteries.Light levels are adjusted by holding down the on/off button; this has the significant drawback of requiring you to re-set the level each time you turn it on or off.  If your eyes have adjusted to the darkness, this isn't entirely pleasant.  The lantern also seems to make a high pitched noise when set to dimmer levels.The collapsible portion of the lantern is a diffraction grating - the LED lights remain inside the base.  The LED doesn't cast light directly, which means you don't see the bright LEDs but makes for a less even diffusion of light.Unfortunately Energizer feels the need to hide the true performance of their lanterns.  The specs say up to 150 lumens and up to 100 hours.  But that misleads more than it informs - you get one or the other, not both. - The Coleman lantern uses 3AA batteries, and weighs about 7.5 ounces with batteries, lighter than the Energizer.  It's about 6"" high and about 2.2"" in diameter.  The frosted glass gives a slightly smoother dispersion pattern than the diffusion pattern on the Energizer.The Coleman lantern produces 85 bright lumens on high and 5 lumens on low, with up to 200 hours runtime on low setting.  While 85 lumens is enough for most uses, 5 lumens is barely usable.  Still, it's good to have that option - the six light levels give you a lot of options.  It's also nice that there's a dial to adjust the intensity as well as an on-off switch - you don't want to have to cycle through the light levels in the dark to turn the light on.For my needs, I prefer the Coleman High Tech Mini Lantern.  I'd rather have the lighter weight.  I much prefer the way the light levels can be set to a level that is maintained even when the lantern is turned off and on.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 18, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2397BA57U6ZQW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00B0EZWJ4#wasThisHelpful","R2397BA57U6ZQW","A2EF8N7ZE7ONWX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2EF8N7ZE7ONWX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"QUICK TAKE:  While this Toyota Tsusho LED bulb has good build quality and is dimmable, the evolution of LED bulbs means better options are available.FULL REVIEW:There are a few key factors to keep in mind when shopping for LED bulbs.  Since you're going to be living with the bulb you choose for several years, it's important to choose carefully.DIRECTIONALITY / LIGHT DISPERSION:  Until recently, most LED bulbs would tend to direct the light primarily in one direction, rather than omni-directionally like a traditional incandescent.  Many fixtures and lamps function poorly and look strange with a directional LED bulb.  Bulbs are now becoming available that are less directional than this bulb, and work better for many lamps and fixtures.LIGHT COLOR:  While the 2700K (sometimes called ""soft white"") of this bulb is much better than early 5000K (""daylight"") LED bulbs, because it's close to incandescent, I've come to prefer 3000K (""bright white"") bulbs that are a little less yellow than incandescent.  That is, I don't think the goal is to replicate the color of incandescents - slightly whiter than that is a better option.  Again, more LED bulb options are becoming available as the technology evolves.QUALITY:  Obviously one of the main selling points of an LED bulb - that it will pay for itself over time - only works if the bulb functions well for long enough to make it worthwhile.  Not all bulbs are instant on, maintain their light color, and last.EFFICIENCY:  While the differences aren't substantial, or as important as the first three factors for most uses - new bulbs use slightly more efficient LEDs than this bulb.","3.0 out of 5 stars","December 18, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1K5CP7IR3XV0V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00APB0IX8#wasThisHelpful","R1K5CP7IR3XV0V","A2EF8N7ZE7ONWX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2EF8N7ZE7ONWX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"QUICK TAKE:  If you want the ability to do large format photo printing and cost or value is a consideration, it's hard to beat the Canon Pixma Pro-100 Photo Printer.FULL REVIEW:VERY GOOD PRINT QUALITY:  The Pixma Pro-100 uses eight ink tanks to deliver very good - though not always perfect - print quality.MODEST UP FRONT COST:  The up-front cost of the Pixma Pro-100 is modest for a printer this size and capability.  That's especially true if you're able to take advantage of one of the frequent rebate promotions Canon runs on this printer (sometimes along with a camera).ABOVE AVERAGE OPERATING COSTS:  Ink costs for this printer are higher than average, and higher than Canon's other pro printers.  However, if you're not printing large volumes, the overall value is still there.  (For those who need higher volumes or perfect quality, there are probably better options, at a higher up-front cost.)A FULL RANGE OF PAPER SIZES AND MEDIA:  The Pro-100 can handle prints from 4"" x 6"" to 13"" x19"", also including 5"" x 7"", 8"" x 10"", Letter, Legal, and 11"" x 17"".  It seems to handle every type of paper within reason, as well as printable CD/DVDs.  Most sizes and papers need to be fed manually, rather than using the auto-feed tray.LARGE SIZE: With the breadth of capabilities comes the breadth of size - 27.2"" wide x 15.2"" deep x 8.5"" high, and 43.2 lbs.MODEST POWER CONSUMPTION:  Power consumption is modest at 19 watts, and just 2.3 watts on standby.WIRED CAN BEAT WIRELESS FOR PRINTING PHOTOS:  While wireless printers can be a great idea, for graphics intensive uses it's very dependent on the wireless connection and interference.  If you live in the city, next to lots of neighbors with wireless, try to use a wired connection for the printer - you don't want the printer to stall out halfway through a 13"" x 19"" print.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 18, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R14ATT1LQF1MHF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0095F5BCS#wasThisHelpful","R14ATT1LQF1MHF","A2EF8N7ZE7ONWX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2EF8N7ZE7ONWX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Panasonic EW-DS32-P Kids' Electric Toothbrush has a mild action that may make it suitable as a young child's first electric toothbrush.  The ""sonic vibration"" effect is very gentle.However, many parents would find it a better choice to get the Oral-B Pro-Health Dual Clean Electric Toothbrush, especially for children that are 4-5 or older.  That is not a rechargeable version, but that reduces the cost if you're not sure it will work for you, and the batteries last a fairly long time.  (The Oral-B Vitality Toothbrush is a modestly priced rechargeable version.)  Use the Oral-B Sensitive Brush Heads to get more gentle action.Electric toothbrushes are incredibly effective at keeping your teeth clean.  Just remember there's no need to apply a lot of pressure.

"QUICK TAKE:  The Mohu Sky HDTV Antenna is a fairly small and stylish antenna, and includes most of what you need to install it.  The amplifier improves the signal somewhat in most locations.  But the key to HDTV satisfaction is to figure out how to install a big enough antenna, if that's possible.  If this works in your location, and the style and features appeal to you, it's a solid and somewhat unique option.FIRST, DO YOUR RESEARCH: It's essential to do some research before buying.  Enter your address in at antennaweb dot org for information on (1) the strength and direction of TV signals in your areas and (2) suggestions of the right antenna for your location.  Needs vary widely, depending on the channels in your area and your location.  Find out what you need before buying.BE SKEPTICAL OF REVIEWS OF HDTV ANTENNAS:  For many people, the simplest antenna - or even a coat hanger - will bring in spectacular HDTV for some stations.  They rave about the antenna, when really what they should be impressed with is HDTV broadcasting technology.  So pay more attention to those who seem to have some experience with other antennas.  Ignore reviews from people who just got their first HDTV antenna.AN ATTRACTIVE ANTENNA THAT'S EASY TO INSTALL:  The antenna is the most important part of the system.  This antenna is large enough to pick up a good signal for many locations, and includes the hardware needed for most installs.THE AMPLIFIER ADDS A LITTLE OOMPH:  The Jolt Amplifier is attractive and well designed.  It's convenient for me that it includes an option to power the amplifier using a USB port, as I have a port on my TV.  It does improve the signal somewhat, and reduces the number of disruptions in the signal.However, it doesn't make a dramatic difference for us.  We get good reception most of the time.  We're about 10-12 miles from the antennas, with a direct line of sight, so pretty well located.  We still lose signal at times during snow or rain storms.SIGNAL IS BETTER THAN AMPLIFICATION:  While Mohu says the amplifier has some special tweaks, in general you're better off getting a decent signal in the first place, rather than trying to amplify a signal that's too weak.  That means a suitable antenna and a location that allows it to work.FIRMLY INSTALL YOUR ANTENNA:  Vibration, rocking or other movement is the enemy of a good HDTV signal, so try to install your antenna as firmly as possible.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 12, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R20LKMPWJZXKYQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AVWKUXE#wasThisHelpful","R20LKMPWJZXKYQ","A2EF8N7ZE7ONWX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2EF8N7ZE7ONWX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

You're better off figuring out how to have a big enough antenna, if that's possible.

"I've been using adapters in the UK for years, and these are by far my favorites. The Tmvel adapters seem well made and solid, are as compact as they can be, and often work to plug two devices into one adapter.TWO PLUGS IN ONE:  These are ""2 in 1"" adapters because the front universal input accepts plugs from most countries, while the second input on the top accepts two-prong plugs from a number of countries. There is a something of a space limitation on the two-prong adapter - the charger or cord has to fit in the space between the openings and the wall -  but it worked well for us with iPhone chargers and many phone chargers.The top, two prong plug also holds short-ish two prong adapters well.  I've had a problem with some UK adapters that the short US prongs didn't go deep enough into the adapter to hold well, or even connect.THREE PRONG PLUGS:  The front universal plug accepts three-prong grounded US plugs, which many adapters don't.  I've been caught by surprise with laptop chargers, some of which are three-prong.  So these adapters are a good option for laptops.CHECK THE VOLTAGE:  Just remember to check the charger or device before you plug it in, to make sure that it can handle 220 or 240 volts, as well as US voltages.  While many phone and device chargers are dual-voltage, not all are.  If they are not, you'll need a voltage converter as well as an adapter.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 4, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Z2N9I2BW8J78/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009GQ1X82#wasThisHelpful","R1Z2N9I2BW8J78","A2EF8N7ZE7ONWX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2EF8N7ZE7ONWX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"So much of how people experience a movie has to do with their expectations before seeing the movie.  That explains many of the reviews here.  This isn't an action movie, though there is some action during the ""Flight"" that gives the movie its name.  This isn't really a movie about flight, though, or at some level even about a pilot - while that element gives the movie its dramatic tension, it could be about anyone.  Almost all of the movie happens while the lead character is grounded, after the crash.Flight is a good movie with a very good performance by Denzel Washington.  If you go in expecting a realistic movie about alcoholism and addiction, with an often wrenching story, you'll be better able to appreciate the movie for what it is - rather than being surprised at what it is not.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 11, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2Q1C7RS7EZ0UR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AFEXRME#wasThisHelpful","R2Q1C7RS7EZ0UR","A2EF8N7ZE7ONWX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2EF8N7ZE7ONWX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you're looking for an entry-level digital piano - the point you likely shouldn't go below - the Casio CDP-120 is probably your choice.  The key action is sufficiently realistic, and from time to time it can be found at a significant discount from the list price.  (But note that at close to list price, there are probably better options for the money - such as the Casio Privia PX150.)WEIGHTED KEY ACTION:  Anyone interested in playing a digital piano that feels like an acoustic piano - and most people should be - will want to get a digital piano that uses weighted keys and responds well to how hard or soft you strike the key.  The Casio CDP-120 and the Yamaha P35 are currently the least expensive digital pianos that provide a reasonably realistic feel.Note that you won't find a 76-key or 61-key keyboard with an effective weighted action, so you'll have to buy an 88-key piano. Even if you think that's more than you need or can fit in your space, it's worth finding a way.ENOUGH TONES:  While the CDP-120 has a limited range of instrument tones (5), that won't matter much.  Most people will use just the primary grand piano tone.  In addition, there is always the option to connect out through the USB port to use a computer to achieve any tone you'd like to use.LOOKING GOOD:  In addition, the Casio CDP-120 is attractively designed - sleek and simple, not a lot of switches and displays on the top.  The controls are simple and clear.A few people have commented that they are not impressed with the built-in speakers.  Attaching an external amp/speaker is relatively easy and not expensive, so that's always an option if you wish.It's well worth reading the AZ Piano News blog for a useful review of this piano, as well as a comparison to other alternatives such as the Yamaha P35 Digital Piano and many more expensive pianos, including the Casio Privia PX150, a good option if you're considering spending a little more.ACCESSORIES:STANDS:  You'll probably want a stand.  The Casio stand designed for this piano, the Casio CS44 Stand, works well and is fairly attractive.  If portability, storage or height adjustment are a factor, consider a Z-stand such as the Roland KS-18Z Keyboard Stand or On Stage KS7350 Keyboard Stand.DUST COVER:  One inexpensive, non-shedding option is the Gator Cases Stretchy Cover - GKC-1648USB CONNECTION:  The CDP-120 has a USB B port, standard size, so a cable such as the Belkin 3FT USB A to B Cable will work.IPAD CONNECTION:  To connect to an iPad, you'll need the Apple iPad Camera Connection Kit (MC531ZM/A), but be sure not to pay Apple prices for one of the many counterfeit ones on sale.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 28, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RGHNABYRMIJMF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0064RTTEQ#wasThisHelpful","RGHNABYRMIJMF","A2EF8N7ZE7ONWX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2EF8N7ZE7ONWX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This stand is a good fit for the Casio CDP-120 Digital Piano, of course, as it's designed especially for it.  It's stable, compact, and fairly attractive with the piano attached.There are two things you really care about with a keyboard stand:  that it's the right height, and that it's designed for how you use it:THE RIGHT HEIGHT:  Since the height of this stand was designed to take into account the height of the Casio CDP-120, it's just the right height for seated use - it's the same height from the floor to the top of the keys as a grand piano.ROOM TO PLAY:  If you plan to play the piano in a seated position, a stand like this works well because there is room for your legs.  It's better not to get an X-stand if you plan to play in a seated position.Overall the design is compact and effective:COMPACT:  The stand is 51.3 inches wide (so slightly narrower than the piano) by 14.7 deep (at the feet) by 24.9 inches high (without the keyboard).  It's about as small as it could be and still work effectively.STABLE DESIGN:  The way the legs extend on either side of the vertical pieces makes it less likely to tip forward or back (some older Casio stands had no extension to the back of the stand).There are a few other factors you might want to consider:PORTABILITY:  This stand could be moved in the house, but isn't something you could easily take with you.  If being able to store or travel with the piano and stand is important, consider a Z-stand like the Roland KS-18Z Keyboard Stand or On Stage KS7350 Keyboard Stand.HEIGHT ADJUSTMENT:  The Casio CS44 stand is of course not adjustable in height, whereas some of Z-stands are.  If that's important to you, consider one of the Z-stands.But note that the Z-stands are quite a bit deeper than this Casio CS-44 stand - around 20 inches deep - perhaps for stability and to accomodate various size keyboards.The Casio CS44 is easy to assemble, using typical flat-pack techniques (as with Ikea furniture).  It uses four wing bolts to attach the stand to the piano, so it's reasonably easy to remove the piano if you wish.  The material of the main pieces is a black plastic veneer over a solid composite board.While the feet are probably strong enough, I was disappointed to see that they are made from plastic and without a lot of substance to them.  It might not be necessary, but for something we may have for many years they could splash out on a little more plastic.  Also, there are no rubber or felt pads on the feet - you'll have to add those yourself if you want them, but think carefully about how it affects the height and stability.The box is well-designed and protective, so don't hesitate to have it shipped to you. In fact, in some ways the box seems more nicely designed than the stand. ;)The instructions are on the internet if it would be helpful for you to see them before you buy.

"Overall, the Paula Deen Tatnall Street dinnerware set is a nice option for everyday use.WELL DESIGNED PIECES:  The pieces are nicely shaped and proportioned.  The coffee mugs are elegant.  The bases and the edges of the pieces are reasonably finished. The edges of the plates and the lip of the mugs are fairly thin rather than bulky.  The plates are about 1/2 inch deep, neither too thin nor too flat.NICELY DECORATED:  The design is interesting and attractive.  The bowls have a pattern inside, a nice touch.  The overall effect is very pretty.There are a couple potential issues.  The ceramic used is slightly less white than I expected or might have preferred, but some may actually like this shade better than a pure white.  And it is true that the edges of the pattern are somewhat abrupt.  I'd think they could have used the same manufacturing process to apply the design, but use something more irregular rather than a straight line.SHADES OF BLUE:  Finally, a note on the color.  The product photos are generally quite useful, but they don't quite give you the feel for the different shades of blue unless you look carefully.  Look at the image of the plate.  You'll see the various sections are done in two shades of blue - a fairly dark shade, and a medium blue.  Once you get the idea, have a look at the other pieces.  It's attractive, but it helps to know what to expect.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 19, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RGMEPJZM1Z428/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005ZOORF0#wasThisHelpful","RGMEPJZM1Z428","A2EF8N7ZE7ONWX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2EF8N7ZE7ONWX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Those looking for a bargain, or unwilling to make a commitment to care for expensive, quality knives, can get alternatives for less money.IT'S GOT THE EDGE:  The most attractive feature of The Chef's Toolbox knives is the blades: well designed, sturdy and made from high quality steel.  Though keep in mind that you'll need to care for the knives to get the benefit - wash them by hand, and keep them sharp.MAYBE NOT THE FEEL:  Like others, I'm not thrilled with the feel of the handle or the balance of the knives.THE RIGHT KNIVES?  The idea behind a knife set is that you get more knives for your money.  But that only works if they are the knives you want and will use.  Fewer, better knives would be an option some should consider.And really, they should be a pleasure to use.  The shears in this set don't make the cut in that respect.ALMOST GOT THE BLOCK RIGHT:  I actually like the idea of this block, as the traditional wood block is impossible to keep clean, and leaves a trail of wood dust (and more) wherever it goes.  But they just didn't get the design quite right.I like Magnetic Knife Bars, they keep knives clean and out of reach of little hands.GUARANTEE?  A guarantee is only as good as the company behind it, and their customer service policies.  If you're really interested in a long term commitment to high quality knives, going with a well established company seems a better bet.ARE YOU REALLY READY TO COMMIT? If you, and everyone who uses the knives, isn't ready to take care of knives properly, factor that into your choice of knives.  Though I'm careful with our Wusthof Classics, it's a constant battle to keep the others in the house, and the sitters, from putting them in the dishwasher.ALTERNATIVES:  Consumer Reports top choices all around were the Zwilling J.A. Henckels Twin Professional S and Wusthof Classic Knives (in general, not just those sets).Value options include the Ginsu Chikara Knives and Wusthof Silverpoint II Knives.  (Again, those product lines, more than those sets.)Be very careful when shopping, as knife brands have a lot of similar names with very different quality.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 19, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3QLUWTR88K4DY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004BR3SR0#wasThisHelpful","R3QLUWTR88K4DY","A2EF8N7ZE7ONWX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2EF8N7ZE7ONWX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There are a number of things the Home Design LED lamp does well: - Most importantly, it works well as a source of light.  The 3 watt LED (about the equivalent of a 40 watt bulb) is a good brightness for a desk lamp, neither too much nor too little.  (Luckily it's not ""super bright."")  The light is even, with no rings or artifacts. - The color of the light is a nice neutral color, not too white/blue and not too yellow. - Because it's an LED lamp, you don't get slowly roasted like you would with a halogen lamp. - The clamp holds well on the edge of a surface like a desk.  It will comfortably handle up to about 1-1/8"" thick.Unfortunately, unless you're specifically looking for a lamp like this, it's hard not to feel like the design leaves some things to be desired. - Somehow in real life, the head of the lamp looks larger than in the photo.  It's about 4-5/8"" across, and since it's usually close to my head (so it illuminates what I'm looking at), it looms a little large. - The neck is not very flexible.  The first 5-1/2"" are a solid tube, which is probably good for durability.  But that limits the range of flexibility for where the head is positioned.  That's especially true if you're trying to mount it on something vertical so the lamp extends horizontally. - The clamp is not very attractive, and again looks larger than the photo.  (I think the photo was taken from a distance.)  I don't think it really saves much space to have a clamp instead of a base. - It has a strong smell - rubber or something.I always wonder about the dimensions on Amazon, so often they are the dimensions of the box.  But 14"" is about right for the height, installed.  You could have as low as 12"", or somewhere in between.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 8, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ENECP47RO6EK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009GN31JY#wasThisHelpful","R2ENECP47RO6EK","A2EF8N7ZE7ONWX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2EF8N7ZE7ONWX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is an exceptionally efficient flashlight - 83 lumens for over 9.5 hours.  That's bright enough to provide good light, but not blindingly bright.  It's a flood design, meant to light up a wide, nearby area (rather than a distant object such as a sign, or an animal).  So it's a great, practical choice for indoor and nearby use.The 2 x AA design is perhaps the most useful general purpose design.  It's much smaller and lighter than C or D cell flashlights, but still has enough capacity to last a long time.  (AA batteries have about three times the power capacity of AAA batteries.)The Coast G series of flashlights are well made, but don't include the features of the more expensive professional and technical flashlights.  If that matches your needs, this is a good option.Also, many of the better quality flashlights use twist-on and off switching, rather than push button, for the greater durability that offers.  But for convenience, push button is handy.  It's also easier for normal people to figure out.The beam is fairly smooth, a little irregular around the extreme edges but most people won't notice at all.One feature this lacks that can be useful is a low light mode, for when you want to extend battery life or use it to read a map, etc.  But most implementations of those introduce new issues - like having to click in a certain way to change modes.Be careful reading reviews of LED flashlights, to make sure the product is being evaluated against standards that match your needs.  Most reviews are written by hard core flashlight nuts, who measure a light by it's ""throw"" - that is, how far the beam will go.  That's a good test for outdoor use, but not what you want for a flashlight you plan to use around the house for short distances.If you're looking for the next level up, without spending a serious amount of money - consider the Fenix E25 Flashlight.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 9, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1T8JU3CD1H8I7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007ED3KD0#wasThisHelpful","R1T8JU3CD1H8I7","A2EF8N7ZE7ONWX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2EF8N7ZE7ONWX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Gerber makes good flashlights that offer better value for use around the house than some of the high end producers, but better quality than the mass market sellers.  So at less than $10, this is a good price on a quality light.2 x AA lights are also one of the most useful designs.  They're smaller and lighter than C or D cell designs, but have lot more power capacity than AAA or single AA designs.The catch is that the technology is less efficient than what's available in newer lights.  A 2 x AA light should put out more than 20 lumens for longer than 5.5 hours.So this is a good value if you need a light for light use, where battery life isn't such an issue.  Others may want to invest in a more efficient light that will get more light and life out of a pair of batteries.For example, the Coast G25 Flashlight will deliver 83 lumens for 9.5 hours.  (In a floodlight design, best for indoor use.)  Or, the Fenix E25 Flashlight will deliver 27 lumens for 26 hours, 90 lumens for 6 hours, or 180 lumens for 2 hours.  It's much more expensive, but it does show what the latest technology can do.Or, if you're OK with twist-on/off, consider the amazing Fenix E01, a 1 x AAA flashlight - a tiny, handy flashlight with lower light levels (13 lumens) but extraordinary life (20 hours).","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 9, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RFZOY3JOBQ44V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001P3OCFA#wasThisHelpful","RFZOY3JOBQ44V","A2EF8N7ZE7ONWX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2EF8N7ZE7ONWX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"THE QUICK TAKE:  The Joby GorillaPod Micro Tripod is a well-designed, well-built and reasonably priced accessory that will add significant flexibility to your photography.  While you might not always have it ""Always On"", it's well worth owning and carrying.GIVE YOURSELF MORE OPTIONS:  A good micro tripod gives you some very useful options with smaller to medium sized cameras, of all types:- YOU CAN BE IN THE PICTURES:  Don't leave everyone wondering whether you were actually on the trip.  A good, small tripod lets you use the self timer to include yourself in photos, and actually get good pictures.  (That is, not pictures like the ones where you put the camera on the table at lunch and set the timer, and cut off half the heads in the group.)- GET SHARP EXPOSURES:  In low light situations, you can use the tripod and the self timer to take excellent photos with long exposures without flash.  With careful handling, the camera will be still while the shutter is open.  Even the simplest camera will usually give remarkably good pictures if you can keep the camera still while it's shooting the photo.Similarly, even on bright days, you may want to use a tripod and the self timer to take photos of landscapes, to hold the camera perfectly still and get a really sharp photo of a detailed landscape.- LESS INTRUSIVE VIDEO:  I've used a mini tripod for a small video camera while talking to relatives about family history.  It's much a more natural conversation than holding the camera myself - cameras can be so distracting, for both the subject and the photographer.  If the camera has a remote that makes it a little more manageable, but with careful setup you can film without a remote.WELL DESIGNED AND WELL BUILT:  They've clearly put a lot of thought into designing the Micro 250 tripod to be compact without sacrificing usability.  I like the way the three legs fold together into one.  And, they've built it so it works.  For example, the ball joint on the head that lets you tilt the camera holds it well, so it stays where you set it.You can buy a mini tripod for a couple bucks, and it may be better than none at all.  But the Joby is much nicer to use, and won't let you down the way cheaper ones will.USE IT CREATIVELY:  With a little thought you can cope with a lot of situations and cameras.  For example, one of my Sony cameras is a heavier point and shoot, with the tripod mount at one end of the camera.  (What were they thinking?)  The Joby tripod has no trouble holding it up, as long as I'm careful to run one of the legs of the tripod under the camera to keep the weight of the camera from tipping the tripod.ALWAYS ON?  I'm a minimalist about what I carry, so there are a lot of times when I won't bring the tripod.  I don't really need it for kid's birthday parties and so on.  But it's useful to have the ""Always On"" design when traveling, because the truth is I won't remember to take it out of my bag and carry it or use it.  So for sight-seeing, when I'm willing to carry a little more, the GorillaPod Micro 250 is a great accessory.TRIPLE TRIPODS?  I own a full size tripod and a mini tripod, besides this micro tripod.  You may also want another tripod for more complex uses or heavier cameras.  Some of the GorillaPod options are described above.  Also consider the popular Pedco UltraPod II Lightweight Camera Tripod.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 17, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RGVO4P0OMFRMK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005HY4U5A#wasThisHelpful","RGVO4P0OMFRMK","A2EF8N7ZE7ONWX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2EF8N7ZE7ONWX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"THE QUICK TAKE:  The Interior Design Business Handbook is a useful survey and overview of the business side of interior design.But this is probably a tough type of book to write.  It's meant to be all things to all people - residential, commercial, big firm, small firm, etc. It has to be encyclopedic in scope, but in just one volume, so it can't always go deeply into any one topic.  Within the limits of that format, it does a reasonably good job of covering a lot of ground.FIVE EDITIONS OF REFINEMENT:  This book has been recently revised, and has now been through five editions.  That revision and refinement shows in the current edition.  Generally, the selection and discussion of topics is well done.MORE USEFUL AS AN INTRODUCTION:  The book will will be probably most useful to those learning about the industry, whether in school or in the initial years in the business, or for those who split their time with another functional or industry role.  It may also be useful as a reference for more experienced designers, but I suspect it would tend to be out of sight and out of mind most of the time.  Though experienced designers who are still learning the business side may find it especially useful.MORE EMPHASIS AND GUIDANCE WOULD HELP:  The book is designed and written in a way that somewhat equally emphasizes and covers all of the topics.  That's a missed opportunity.  It would be much more helpful to emphasize and focus on certain topics - both with the design of the book and the discussion - to guide the thinking of those using the handbook.For example, there's some fairly flat discussion of the issues around your firm's strengths and what type of clients to seek.  But client targeting and client selection are critical to your success, your sanity, and your profitability.  It helps a lot to know when to say no to a potential new client.To put it another way, there are 5-10 aspects that are critically important to an interior design business.  But the presentation style of the book won't do much to help you quickly learn what they are.At times it seems this book was written more as a textbook, for that lucrative publishing market, than as a practical business guide.NOT STRONG ON TECHNOLOGY OR ITS MEANING:  Some of the the discussion of technology aspects seems a little outdated.  This book really ought to have been updated to reflect how people work now, and edit out some things.More importantly, I was hoping to see (and didn't find) useful information about how to use technology to support the business, especially marketing.  For example, there's too much discussion of marketing brochures, and too little discussion of websites and email.Now in fairness, that may be really be another book that needs to be written.  But I do think it's the job of this type of book to get you oriented and point you in the right direction, and in some areas it falls short.MOVE THE APPENDICES TO A BOOK COMPANION WEBSITE:  Much of what's in the appendices of the book - such as the list of schools offering design programs - would be better placed on a companion website to the book.BUSINESS HANDBOOK:  Note that this is the business handbook, not a more general handbook to interior design.  Look elsewhere for how to calculate how much fabric you need!Some other Amazon books you may want to consider adding to your bookshelf:Interior Design in Practice: Case Studies of Successful Business ModelsInterior Design Clients: The Designer's Guide to Building and Keeping a Great ClienteleMarketing Interior DesignThe Interior Designer's Guide to Pricing, Estimating, and Budgeting (Second Edition)Interior Designer's Portable Handbook: First-Step Rules of Thumb for the Design of Interiors","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 16, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2779QBRVBFDH2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1118139879#wasThisHelpful","R2779QBRVBFDH2","A2EF8N7ZE7ONWX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2EF8N7ZE7ONWX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A PRETTY FACE:  The face of the watch is pretty, with nice colors and an attractive butterfly theme.  I actually like how the second hand is a curved antenna, even if it's a little hard to read that way.Though the hour hand is hard to see, as the dial is white and the hand is as well.  That's a real mistake in a watch meant to help teach time - the hands should be very easy to see.A CLUNKY, LARGE BAND:  There's one big plus to the band - it uses velcro to make it easy to attach and adjust.But the band is so thick and clunky that it's not that comfortable for our six year old.Just as importantly, the band doesn't size down small enough to fit her.  Even at the maximum tightness, it's still too loose.  While this is a common problem with watches, I'd think that a teaching watch for girls would do a better job of comfortably fitting younger girls.The cardboard time telling kit that is included is a nice idea, but they should have spent a few more pennies to make something more durable and usable.So some good ideas, but not well executed in some ways.  On balance, I can't really recommend this watch for small children.

"Our girls find this to be a fun toy, and it does a little to help ease the ""Santa please bring us a dog"" problem.  (The problem being, he won't be.  Not happening.)The noise and jumping are active enough to be fun.  The videos (at the top of the product listing, in with the photos) give you a good idea of what to expect, be sure to watch them.The puppy's big head spins around, and I think the big head moving helps her jump around.  (Though the big head creates an imbalance so it sometimes tips over when it's on a carpet, rather than a hard floor.  Not ideal, but a reasonable tradeoff to get more motion from the toy - better than last year, see below.)The fact that the toy can be activated by someone walking by, or a light coming on, helps add to the fun.Personally, I'd prefer a more realistic face to the cartoon-ish face of this puppy, but it is cute (and not scary, like some toy pets can be!), and our little girl seems to like it.It's easy to figure out how to use it.  And they've marked the box well to remind you that it arrives set in store display mode (""Try Me""), rather than fully On.BETTER THAN LAST YEAR'S MODELS:  We bought two of last year's less expensive Fur Real Friends, Furreal Friends Walkin Puppies - King Charles Spaniel and a white cat.  They were OK, especially given the low price we paid.  But this Bouncy Pup is much more fun - more movement, more sound.  In a way, it's what we'd hoped last year's model would be.DON'T PAY A MARKUP:  Last year, there was a time last year when it seemed resellers were the only source for these toys, but there were lots of Fur Real Friends on Amazon and in stores in the weeks before the holidays last year.  So if the Grinches try to corner the market again this year, don't waste your money paying a marked-up price.  Just buy early, or wait for new stock to arrive.My only real complaint is that it's beastly getting this thing out of the package.  The box is open so it can be on display, so as an anti-theft measure the feet are tightly tied to the bottom of the box.  Which wouldn't be that big a deal, except that the toy is on while you're trying to figure out how it's attached and how to get it loose.  So the toy is jumping and yapping, and so is your child, all during the long process of trying to get it out of the box.

"The Epson WorkForce 840 is an excellent product if it meeds your needs.  It offers a full suite of multi-function capability.I buy only Epson and Canon printers and scanners.  Both are committed to developing excellent products that are an excellent value (given their capability).  Epson tends to have slightly better hardware and deliver technically better results, so when I'm seeking top performance I find I usually choose Epson.  But Canon seems to have a much better understanding of user experience and usability in the software, so if it's something used by other people, I often choose Canon.WIRELESS:  If you haven't used a wireless printer, you may be surprised at how useful it is.  Wireless networks have gotten much easier to use, and more reliable.  Not having to tie your decision about where to place the printer to where you can reach it with a cable can be very useful, especially for larger equipment.Note that newer printers allow you to print directly from iPhones, iPads and tablets.  While that may sound frivolous, it can be handy not to have to transfer files to your computer to get a print.  The newer Epson WorkForce 845 has this feature.TAKE CARE:  While this is a well designed printer, at this price level you won't get as heavy duty as you will for more expensive models. Also, ink jet printers tend to have somewhat light weight construction, as that is adequate for the printing mechanism.  So take care in how you handle the printer if paper jams, etc.IT'S BIG:  This is a somewhat large printer for many home office environments, have a look at the dimensions - 17.6"" x 22.3"" x 12.0"" - and think about how it will fit in your space.SMALLER OPTIONS:  In the last year or so, some good options for multi-function in a smaller size have become available.  If something more compact would work better for you, consider the Epson Expression Home XP-400 Wireless All-in-One Color Inkjet Printer, Copier, Scanner.

"There are a number of pros and cons to the X-Acto School-Pro Pencil Sharpener.  It offers a good set of features for the price.But the biggest issue is that it's simply not realistic for X-Acto to promise a heavy duty electric sharpener at this price level.  There are too many compromises.  If price is critical, I'd suggest going with a manual sharpener.Note that this sharpener only has a single cutter.  If you're after quality, look for a twin cutter model.

"I'm a recent convert to power toothbrushes, so I'm still in that evangelical phase where I feel like I have to tell everyone I know about how great they are ... here goes:At the suggestion of my periodontist, I got the Oral B Vitality Floss Action Rechargeable Power Toothbrush [Amazon item B003UKM90Q or B008CYFJX4, though oddly unavailable right now].  It makes my teeth feel much, much cleaner than even a careful brushing with a regular toothbrush, and is a big help in maintaining my gums.The Floss Action heads work well for me, as they help clean food and plaque.  Of course, they may not suit everyone, and won't actually get food and plaque from between two teeth - you still need to floss.These heads hold up well for me.  They actually last much longer than a regular Oral-B toothbrush for me - I was replacing those every month.  So the cost of heads hasn't been that much more than the cost of toothbrushes for me, and it's certainly well worth it for the results in terms of dental health.A few points from my periodontist (who practices in a large, downtown practice and is a heckuva a nice guy besides):- The affordable Oral-B Vitality line cleans as well as the more expensive toothbrushes.  (So price isn't a reason to wait to get one.)- It's OK to use these toothbrushes along the gum-line or on the gums, but ...- Don't use them with a regular toothpaste, those are too abrasive.  It's the toothpaste that causes gums to recede, not the toothbrush.  Use Sensodyne Toothpaste or something similar.As others have noted, you may need to experiment with the amount of pressure you use - you really don't need much, let the head do the work - and the type of head you use.

"THE QUICK TAKE:  Family Tree Maker 2012 is useful as a tool to organize and collect your information and related media (photos, documents, stories) about your family history.  However, the really powerful tool is Ancestry.com.  Ancestry should help you greatly expand what you know, not just organize what you know.  FTM 2012 Deluxe includes a three month membership to Ancestry.com, so if you use it well you can get a lot of value from this package.Before I get into the details of the review, some general advice: - Talk to your older living relatives now, while they are still around.  Try to get the stories, copies of photos, find out who is in the photos, and so on.  You won't be able to do that later. - Keep backup copies of all your files, and backup your files before you make any substantial changes or sync your tree.  Work on the assumption that you will have computer problems or a hard drive failure, because at some point you will.  You're going to put a lot of work into your family history, you want to make sure you always have a copy.GET PREPARED BEFORE YOU START:  To protect the privacy of living people, government records aren't made available for decades.  So before you start using Ancestry and FTM, try to find out some details about your parents and your grandparents - birth, marriage, death, places they lived.  Then you'll be able to start to link to the publicly available information online.  Without information on your recent ancestors, it will be hard to get very far.FAMILY TREE MAKER IS USEFUL:  FTM is a useful tool.  It seems reasonably easy to use even for those less expert at using the web and computers.  For example, there are tools to allow you to capture text and photos from the web.The tutorials are worth reviewing.  They are well done, brief, and will help get you started on key tasks.The software can also do some tasks that you can't currently do on the website, such as split and join trees.For me, the software installed easily on an older XP machine.  It needs .net 4.0 to run, so will install that if it's not already installed.  FTM Deluxe 2012 comes on 2 CDs, one with the software and the other with the PDF books in the Family History Took Kit (see below for a list).REGISTER LATER?  When you first run Family Tree Maker, it asks if you want to register the software.  You may want to wait to register, as that seems to start your three months subscription to Ancestry.  You may want to organize yourself a little, and get the basic facts about your family, before you go online.ANCESTRY.COM IS POWERFUL:  I was able to find a lot of additional information about the ancestors I knew I had, and turn up some new ancestors and new connections.  I found Ancestry's hints and matching to be useful, but then I guess I don't mind searching through dozens of possible matches to see which ones are a fit.CHECK ALTERNATE SPELLINGS:  Census records are surprisingly uneven in terms of the accuracy of names.  If you can't find what you're looking for, try searching on alternate spellings of a name.INCLUDE THE WHOLE FAMILY:  Even if your interest is primarily in your ancestors, it's very useful to add the data about all their siblings to your tree, for two reasons.  First, it's incredibly helpful to match the data when you have more than just one person.  Knowing the names and ages of siblings can make it clear whether another record is your family, or not.  It helps confirm a link when a name is common, or when there are mis-spellings.  Second, it makes the story much more interesting to see who was in your ancestor's family and what was happening in their lives.BE SKEPTICAL:  There are a lot of mistakes in the family trees already online, so don't assume that someone else has done their homework unless there is backup.KEEP TRACK OF YOUR SOURCES:  Don't rely on your memory.  Make notes and add documents to support the info in your tree.CENSUS DATA IS INTERESTING, REALLY!:  I found myself surprised at the amount of data in the census.  It collects several interesting facts if you review it carefully.  It's also interesting to see what happens over time to families - the joy of births, tragedy of deaths and mysteries of life. (For example, why was great grandma living apart from great grandpa, and telling the census she was a widow?)DON'T UNDERESTIMATE GOOGLE:  I chuckled a little that FTM includes Google as a link.  But it's probably not obvious to everyone, and so it's worth saying.  I've turned up a lot of useful information searching on Google, though it really helps to use a targeted search and to try a few alternatives.CHECK ROOTSWEB:  There are a number of family trees on RootsWeb as well.  It's worth searching for your family.  It can be a useful starting point in your research, but be sure to verify the information, and also make sure it's really your family.PLAN ON A LONG PROCESS:  Most people spend a little time over years or decades collecting information about their family.  While you can make a lot of progress in a short time, filling out more details or finding new ancestors can take a long time.CANCELING IS EASY:  Note that if you don't want your subcription to auto-renew, you need to cancel it.  You can do that anytime, and still use the balance of your subscription.  It takes several clicks online, but it's not hard to cancel.PRINTED MANUAL INCLUDED:  I appreciate that they have included a printed manual for the software.  That's a corner that many other companies cut to save costs, a false saving in my opinion.FAMILY HISTORY TOOL KIT:  The following PDFs are included as part of the Family History Tool Kit.  They look like useful information, but don't feel that you need to read them to get started. - Abbreviations and Acronyms: A Guide for Family Historians - List and explanation of abbreviations and acronyms found in census schedules, soundex indexes, mortality schedules, court records, etc. - Ancestry's Concise Genealogical Dictionary - Definitions of unusual terms, especially in cemetery, probate, court, medical, etc. - Hidden Sources: Family History in Unlikely Places - Overview of sources that are often overlooked, where and how they can be found, etc. - Printed Sources: A Guide to Published Genealogical Records - Guide to printed sources such as vital records, definitions and explanations of how to use them. - The Official Guide to Ancestry.com - Become more proficient with searching the site. Explore obscure databases you didn't know existed. Create and develop your own family tree. - The Official Guide to RootsWeb - How to use RootsWeb, and success stories of the RootsWeb Community.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 8, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R33293GUJ9EZNB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005N2CS8M#wasThisHelpful","R33293GUJ9EZNB","A2EF8N7ZE7ONWX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2EF8N7ZE7ONWX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Atlantic Technology SB-900 front-firing subwoofer is a well-designed and well-built compact subwoofer, from a reliable company.  It's a good option for those looking for full-range sound for music or to add some impact to home theater in a small- to medium-sized room.YOU NEED A SUB:  While you can certainly get much-better-than-TV-quality sound with small speakers and soundbars, you can't get a true home theater experience without a subwoofer.  You may also find music is a little lacking in the low end, unless you use large stand-mounted or floorstanding speakers.BUT YOU DON'T WANT TO DEDICATE SPACE:  While many people would like to have a full home theater, the reality for most is that the space is shared for other uses.  So size and looks become more important - sound quality alone isn't the only factor. The SB-900 is compact and attractive.  While it won't deliver the sound output and home theater impact that a dorm-fridge-sized sub will, it fills the need for bass and low frequency effects without the compromises and costs of tiny subs.THIS IS THE SWEET SPOT IN SIZE AND POWER TRADEOFFS: The physics of speakers, and especially subwoofers, mean that there is a tradeoff between the size of the driver (the speaker) and the enclosure (the box), and the amplification applied, and the output of the sub.The size and output tradeoffs can be somewhat offset with a lot of power and equalization of the sound, so subwoofers like the Velodyne MiniVee can be even more compact - but you're paying a lot more for the small size, and the extra amp power needed to make up for the small size, not for more performance.  That is, you can buy a smaller subwoofer, but you'll pay more or get less performance, or both.The Atlantic Technology SB-900's size is at the sweet spot for those looking for compact size, reasonable price, and reasonable performance.I ran a set of low frequency tones through the SB-900, and their claim to reach 32 hz at -3db seems about right.  Atlantic Technology's specs say that it will reach 103 db in a 1500-2000 cubic foot room.  That's good performance for this type of sub.DIMENSIONS:  With the feet and the grille and the controls, the sub is 11"" wide, 13.75"" high, and 14.5"" deep.  (The website gives the dimensions of the box only.)POWER:  The SB-900 is rated at 125 watts RMS of amplification, a respectable level for this design.  If you're making comparisions, be sure to use the RMS ratings, not the much higher peak output ratings that often appear in marketing materials.FEATURES AND FLEXIBILITY FOR MANY SYSTEMS AND SITUATIONS:  The SB-900 includes a full set of features and controls, allowing it to be used in a variety of situations:- It has a bypass-able, continuously variable crossover (40-220 hz), so you can use the sub or a receiver to manage the bass.- Speaker level (amplified) inputs and outputs let you use this with amplifiers that don't have a subwoofer output.  The sub passes along only the sound above the crossover to the speakers.It also includes the usual auto-sensing on; and phase setting.While this sub can be used with a variety of systems, it's helpful to realize it was specifically designed to work with the Atlantic Technology soundbar.  The Atlantic Technology FS-7.1 Surround Sound Soundbar is a high end solution to the need for a convenient and compact multi-channel sound system, and gives you an idea of the quality of the product line.ATLANTIC TECHNOLOGY: Atlantic Technology has established a solid reputation with hi-fi fans, though they probably aren't as widely known among those unfamiliar with home theater. AT is also highly regarded by custom installers of sound systems.SETUP:  Setting up a sub can be a little complicated.  Search the Internet for a guide.  Two things to pay particular attention to:- Crossover frequency:  To get your sub to ""integrate"" well with your speakers, you need to properly set the crossover - the frequency at which the sound transitions from being handled by the sub to being handled by the speakers.  Most speakers, especially satellite speakers, don't reach as low as their manufacturers would like you to think.  Experiment with a higher crossover point than the speakers are rated for.  Also, be sure to use the bypass setting on the sub crossover if your receiver is handling the crossover.- Placement:  The location of the sub in the room, and relative to the other speakers and the listeners, can have a big effect.  If you're not happy with the sound, experiment with the location of the sub.One final note, don't assume your sub will arrive with the ""default"" settings.  My sub arrived with the level (volume) turned all the way down, and the phase switch set to inverse.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 31, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1DOFBCF2EUEHY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005CUC8BW#wasThisHelpful","R1DOFBCF2EUEHY","A2EF8N7ZE7ONWX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2EF8N7ZE7ONWX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"THE QUICK TAKE: The Belkin Galaxy Tablet Charger Kit is well built, and has sufficient power for a tablet.  You can use the USB connection with any tablet or phone, though you will need to provide the right cable.GOOD BUILD QUALITY: I've been happy with the Belkin chargers and cables I've owned, the build quality is solid. I've found that the cheaper cables come apart, often leaving parts stuck into the plug on the device.And I've never thought that the cheap knockoff chargers made sense - it's going to be plugged in almost all the time, in my house, where my family sleeps. And powering an expensive piece of electronics. For that use, I'm not going to give up quality just to save a few bucks.2.1 AMPS WILL CHARGE YOUR TABLET: The wall charger is rated at 2.1 amps, which is enough to charge a Galaxy, iPad or other tablet.  (Phone chargers are typically only 1 amp, and won't charge tablets well, if at all.) The car charger is also rated at 2.1 amps.FOUR FOOT CABLE:  The cable is a useful 4 foot length - not too short or too long.TYPICAL, LARGER SIZE CHARGER FOR TABLETS: Both the car and wall chargers are around the size of many higher-power (2 amp) chargers. - The car charger isn't really micro (I have smaller ones for my phone), but it's about as small as 2-amp tablet chargers get, and certainly small enough. - With the prongs folded, the wall charger is a reasonably compact 2.2"" H x 1.1"" wide x 1.8"" deep.INTERNATIONAL VOLTAGE: The wall charger can accept 100 - 240 V, so it offers flexibility.FOLDING, SWIVELING PRONGS: The outlet prongs fold into a recess in the back of the charger, which is a nice feature if you pack it in a briefcase or your luggage.  They also swivel 90 degrees, so you can fit it into an outlet or power strip the way you choose.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 18, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2CNDGWPKVVHYH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006W3ZV5S#wasThisHelpful","R2CNDGWPKVVHYH","A2EF8N7ZE7ONWX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2EF8N7ZE7ONWX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"THE QUICK TAKE:  The Seagate Expansion 2TB USB 3.0 External Hard Drive STBV2000100 is a good option as a backup drive, or as an expansion drive that isn't used intensively.  It may also serve well as a working drive that's used more intensively but for temporary or replaceable files - such as a scratch drive or a media server.This drive is large enough and priced low enough that you can backup multiple computers for not a lot of money.However, if you're looking for an expansion drive - a second drive to augment a laptop or desktop - that you will use intensively, consider options with cooling and perhaps backup, especially if you will use the drive for your only copy of files.A DESKTOP DRIVE:  This is a desktop drive, not a truly portable drive.  You could use it to backup multiple computers around a home or office, but you're not going to enjoy carrying the drive and the power supply.A FAST CONNECTION:  USB 3.0 really is fun to use, if you have the right port on your computer to use it.  No more sitting around watching file transfers - the speeds are similar to those of a built in drive.KEEP A BACKUP: One of the keys to happiness in modern life is to keep at least two copies of every computer file you need.  If you have anything you would rather not have vanish tomorrow, get a hard drive - any hard drive - and make a copy. Right now.  Err on the side of caution.ALL HARD DRIVES FAIL - SO REPLACE THEM BEFORE THEY DO:  Hard drives are complex mechanical devices. They will absolutely, inevitably fail.  So manage them accordingly.I replace all my drives after about three to four years (if they survive that long).  It's much easier to replace a drive before it fails - it's very easy to copy a readable drive.  It's much harder to recreate a drive, especially a boot drive, after it fails - you need to reinstall all the software and settings, and maybe reconstruct the folder structure.And hard drives are cheap enough to make it not worth the risk to keep drives around longer than that.  I can usually get a bigger, faster drive for much less money than the original drive.Once you start to accept the reality that hard drives will fail, and manage your drives and data appropriately, you can drastically reduce the disruption that hard drive failures cause.BUY A GOOD MODEL OF DRIVE, THEN KEEP A CURRENT BACKUP:  As much as people like to claim that particular brands are better or worse, statistics don't really seem to back that up.  Buy a good model from one of the top brands - Seagate, Western Digital, Hitachi, Samsung - and then manage them as described above.That being said - some drives (or the firmware they are shipped with) have turned out to be real lemons.  Most of the big manufacturers make good drive models, and they have made bad drive models.  So much like your uncle, who never bought a new model car until they'd worked the bugs out of it - let someone else be at the bleeding edge of hard drives.  Buy models that have been tested by other users.It's a little soon to tell for the drive installed in this particular model, and some of the early feedback is mixed.COOLING QUESTIONS:  I can't really figure out why the cooling is so unconvincing on almost all external drives (like this one).  A tight-fitting plastic case, with no effective ventilation?  Really?  While drive temperature isn't perhaps quite as big an issue as some would make it out to be - that level of cooling just doesn't seem adequate for a drive that's running more than a fraction of the time.  If your needs fit that description - that is, if you need a back up drive, or an intermittently used expansion drive - then this Seagate external drive may be a good matchFOR AN INTENSIVELY USED EXPANSION DRIVE, CONSIDER OTHER OPTIONS:  If you need more space in an expansion drive, and plan to use the drive intensively, consider other options.  Perhaps a NAS (network attached storage) or a drive enclosure with more effective cooling, and possibly something with multiple drives and built in backup.WATCH HOW YOUR DRIVES ARE SHIPPED:  One of the key factors in whether a drive will last is how it's handled and shipped.  External drives such as this one are usually packaged somewhat well, although online vendors still don't seem to really get the concept of filling the shipping box so the product inside doesn't bounce around on its way to you.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 17, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RFNMUU4PACQSA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00834SJS0#wasThisHelpful","RFNMUU4PACQSA","A2EF8N7ZE7ONWX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2EF8N7ZE7ONWX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"THE QUICK TAKE:  Ben MacIntyre has found a subject well-suited to his talents - the spies who helped confound German intelligence in the run-up to and early days after the D-Day invasion.  I found it a compelling read - a ""Friday book"" as described in one of the comments, as I started it on Friday and finished it by Sunday - because it is both incredible and true.IT'S ALL ABOUT THE PEOPLE:  As it should be, the book focuses on the people and personalities on all sides - the double-agents themselves, as well as British and German intelligence.  That's the interesting part, that hasn't been covered before - there are plenty of books about the rest of D-Day already.QUITE A STORY:  The story is a fascinating one, based on careful research and told with just the right amount of detail.  It's easy to feel what the people involved might have been going through as the process unfolded.  MacIntyre calls the operation a ""an undisputed, unalloyed, world-changing triumph,"" (p. 331) and as I was reading the book it certainly felt that way.  It's a fine tale.A BIT DRAMATIC:  Of course, even while enjoying the writing and the research, one might view the whole operation with a bit less histrionics as to the importance of this operation to the success of the Allied war effort.  The German side was Colonel Klink-esque - filled with clumsiness, indifference, and quiet sabotage.  The Allies had military superiority (especially air superiority) and the benefit of being able to read all of the German transmissions thanks to the code-breakers.  Still, the story is a fascinating one. And of course we have the benefit of hindsight from our comfortable armchairs - those who lived through this faced enormously serious consequences.The Soviets seem the true masters of espionage here, with the ""Cambridge Five"" deeply penetrating British intelligence - but ironically, the Soviets were unwilling to believe in their success.  (They believed their spies were double agents trying to deceive them, when in fact they received many of the most important secrets.)  It's unfortunate that MacIntyre is unlikely ever to have access to the Soviet records, as that would even top this tale.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 20, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3OG447O3OS26I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0307888754#wasThisHelpful","R3OG447O3OS26I","A2EF8N7ZE7ONWX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2EF8N7ZE7ONWX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"THE QUICK TAKE:  The Peugeout Saint Malo Pepper Mill is attractive, nicely compact, and easy to grind.  You can get good results, if you're a little careful, once you know how.ATTRACTIVE AND COMFORTABLE DESIGN:  The pepper mill is attractive, and the size makes it less obtrusive and unwieldy than the classic, somewhat absurdly large mills that are more common.  It's nice to use.GOOD RESULTS ONCE YOU LEARN HOW:  One of the key features of this grinder is the ability to get pepper ground the way you want it - fairly fine, or more coarse.  (If that seems a little obsessive to you, think about why phrase ""the spice of life"" means something that gives meaning to life - it's because spice and flavoring can make all the difference in food.  Pepper is important!)  You can have a consistently fairly small grind; or something more mixed and coarse.Unfortunately, the mechanism for adjusting the grind isn't quite as easy to use as I'd like.  You adjust the grind by turning the knob counterclockwise, but that also loosens the knob to the point where it's easily moved.  If, for example, you accidentally move the crank counter-clockwise, it moves the knob with it, and changes the setting.So the way to get dependable results is to tighten the knob all the way down before you use the pepper mill, then (if desired) back off a turn or two to get a coarser grind.GOOD BUILD QUALITY:  The crank and grinding mechanism seems solid.  But call me old fashioned - given the half-a-Benjamin price I was expecting better build quality.  It looks fine, but doesn't have the heavy-metal, over-engineered look - like the inside of an old clock - that I would have expected.  And I'm a little surprised the sleeve inside (between the pepper storage compartment and the wood) is plastic.  Plastic, to me, is the sign of something that isn't designed to last a lifetime (or two or three - for those of use that have some of granny's kitchen gear!).  Even though it's not a stress-bearing piece, plastic doesn't age well - it becomes brittle.WOULD YOU LIKE PEPPER?  The mill arrives with just a small amount of peppercorns to get you started.  In one way that makes sense - if you care enough about food to enjoy this pepper mill, you don't necessarily want peppercorns that have been stored who-knows-where for who-knows-how-long.  On the other hand, it seems a missed opportunity to make this more special - they could have included a little packet or jar of a special pepper.PACKAGING ISN'T ALWAYS A BAD THING:  While overall it's great that Amazon is trying to reduce packaging, it's worth remembering that packaging can be a good thing.  I would have expected this pepper mill to be packaged in a small box, both for protection and to make it more attractive as a gift.  Perhaps those who don't receive this through the Amazon Vine, as I did, will get a mill packed in something other than a plastic bag.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 20, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1VY3H3Q3L08ZA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00683IDJI#wasThisHelpful","R1VY3H3Q3L08ZA","A2EF8N7ZE7ONWX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2EF8N7ZE7ONWX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As noted, this is an exceptionally fast drive.  The write speed is where it really shines, writes are when you find yourself wishing it would finish already - though read speeds are excellent too.I'm a big fan of Mushkin drives for the build quality and speed.  But I was a little surprised by the size of the Ventura Pro - for some reason I was expecting it to be the same size as the (ultra compact) Ventura non-pro drive I have.  But it's a bigged-up version of that - almost 3 inches long (73.36 x 19.88 x 9.07mm) vs. just over two inches long (56.7 x 19.8 x 6.8mm) for the regular Ventura.I'd still recommend it highly, of course - but just an FYI in case it would matter for your particular use.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 13, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RHHWCPW2CFTE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005BGK9JA#wasThisHelpful","RHHWCPW2CFTE","A2EF8N7ZE7ONWX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2EF8N7ZE7ONWX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Overall, the pros of the Duracell Mini Charger (CEF-20) are balanced by the cons.  It's OK, so if you're looking for an inexpensive but smart charger with good build quality, and don't mind that it's slow and bulky, then it may be a fit for your needs.  But for those willing to spend more, there may be better options out there.  (Check NLee's most recent recommendations, that's the go-to source for battery and charger reviews.)PROS:""SMART"" CHARGING:  Each battery is charged separately, so you get the right amount of charge to recharge each battery.INTERNATIONAL VOLTAGES:  It can handle 110 - 240V, so all you need is an adapter for the prongs or access to a US-style ""shaver"" outlet.FOLDING PRONGS:  It will play nice with the other things in your luggage.CONS:SLOW:  As NLee notes, the current this outputs to charge is low (280 mA AA, 110 mA AAA).  Duracell estimates 8 hours to charge.NOT SMALL:  To me, this seems about 30%-40% larger than it needs to be.  It's 4.5"" long, 2.25"" wide, and  1.6"" thick.  (You can get a sense for it's not-mini size by looking at the photo - those are AA batteries in the pictures, and the charger is much larger.  I have a 4-battery charger that's not much bigger than this.  That picture of someone putting it in their jeans pocket is do-able but ridiculous.)This ""mini"" charger is longer, wider and thicker than it needs to be.  Someone should have told the designer what ""mini"" means.Also, the color of the cover is a lovely metallic color (green in my case), but the cover seems pointless or worse - charging batteries get hot.  The cover is pretty but superfluous.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 4, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1V7HG9PYG9R9X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001BCFMGI#wasThisHelpful","R1V7HG9PYG9R9X","A2EF8N7ZE7ONWX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2EF8N7ZE7ONWX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"THE QUICK TAKE:  This is a very good arm blood pressure monitor.  It's essentially identical to the Omron 10 Series BP785, which was the top-rated arm model in the June 2012 issue of Consumer Reports.  If it fits your needs, the Omron BP791IT is an excellent choice.GET A WELL DESIGNED MONITOR:  There are many monitors available now that will give an accurate reading.  Most have a data-averaging function and a risk category indicator.  However, they vary quite a bit in ease of use and comfort.  Also, not all have multiple-user memory; irregular heartbeat detection; or multiple cuffs for best fit.  This monitor does well on all those counts.CONSIDER THE FEATURES YOU NEED:  The table above in the Amazon product description does a nice job of comparing the Omron models.  The key difference between this model, the BP791IT, and the Omron BP785 Arm Monitor, is that this model allows you to use the Microsoft Health Vault.  If that's important to you, go with this model.  If not, consider the BP785.WRIST MODELS:  Also, now that some wrist models provide accurate results (a recent development), you have another alternative.  The Omron BP652 Wrist Monitor is the top rated wrist model in Consumer Reports, with high marks for both accuracy and convenience, and good marks for comfort.  (In fact, the overall score was higher than the arm models.)GET A GOOD READING:  Remember that these monitors are only as accurate as you allow them to be.  Sit for several minutes before taking a reading; sit up with your feet on the floor; avoid moving; and try to take your measurements at the same time each day, if possible.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 16, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RD0SR02UKPZE9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004H44GB4#wasThisHelpful","RD0SR02UKPZE9","A2EF8N7ZE7ONWX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2EF8N7ZE7ONWX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"THE QUICK TAKE:  The Canon ELPH 300 is a very good point-and-shoot camera.  The size makes it easy to carry, which means you're more likely to have it when you need it.  The 5x, almost-wide-angle optical lens provides flexibility while maintaining quality.  And while small cameras like this involve a number of compromises, Canon has made the right compromises.CARRY A REAL CAMERA:  Some people would argue that the camera on their phone means they don't need a point and shoot camera.  Ummmmm .... sort of.  It is great to always have a ""camera"" with you, so a phone does let you catch some photos you might miss.  But if you know you're traveling or going to an event - give yourself a chance to get some good pictures, carry a real camera (such as this one).  The photo quality is so much better than any phone, and it provides much more flexibility - to zoom, use flash, etc.THIS IS A VERY GOOD SMALL CAMERA:  The Canon ELPH 300 is a very small camera, about as small as a camera needs to be.  It's reasonably quick (except when you're taking a series of flash photos - but it's not unusual to need some time for the flash to recharge).  The photos generally have good exposure, focus and color balance.  The Auto selections are generally well made, though it doesn't seem to pick up on backlit subjects and force the flash on or otherwise adjust.  The flash works well enough for something this size.  HDMI output is nice to have.THE USUAL COMPROMISES, WELL BALANCED:  Small cameras have small lenses and small sensors.  Small lenses and small sensors capture less light, so perform best in bright light.  The processing and shooting modes help somewhat to address that.  (If you learn to use the Scene shooting modes in Program mode, that should help as well.)  Small lenses also don't have the sharpness of large lenses.  The extra megapixels of this sensor help a little with the sharpness - you're probably not printing 16x20 photos from these.  Overall, Canon has done a good job of balancing the inevitable compromises that come with a point and shoot camera.THINK ABOUT THE VIDEO SIZE:  While it's really cool to shoot 1080-line video, I'm not sure what I'd be able to do with that.  To reduce the file size and processing complexity, I've mostly been shooting 720-line.  That's still better than DVD-quality (480-line).By the way, the microphones seem to work well given the limitations of this type of camera.SOME ROOM FOR IMPROVEMENT:  There are a couple areas that Canon could improve:- The biggest problem, and it is significant, is that sometimes highlights are washed out or lost altogether.  The dynamic range of the camera seems surprisingly limited.  So the face of a child laying in dark grass will lose a lot of detail.  So I'll be taking a more capable camera some of the time, to get better picture quality.- Mostly an annoyance, but an unnecessary one - you can choose to set the Review feature (how long a photo stays on the screen) for 2, 3, 4, etc seconds.  All are too long in real life shooting situations with any action.  How about half a second, or one second?- It seems you can't force the flash to fire, or force the camera into Macro mode (for close ups), unless you switch to Program mode.  That's an unnecessary extra step for very commonly used features.As far as the other reviewers disappointed by this camera, I can only think of three reasons:(1) They paid full list price.  It wasn't worth that, but at current prices (not much more than half that, look for a deal), it's a very good value.(2) They got a defective camera.  It does happen.(3) They're just not realistic about what to expect from a small camera.This is a very good, and in some ways remarkable camera, given what's possible with current technology.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 15, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2MN4I1Q6U6VFD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004J3ZXGU#wasThisHelpful","R2MN4I1Q6U6VFD","A2EF8N7ZE7ONWX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2EF8N7ZE7ONWX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"THE QUICK TAKE:  The E900 is an easy to use, well-made router suitable for basic routing and wireless needs. It's recently released (2012), so it's the latest evolution of Linksys routers.  If you get a good deal on one, and your needs are limited, it may be a good match.  Many people, though, can get a lot more router for not too much more than the regular price of this router.FULL REVIEW:Apparently making a wireless router that does what it's supposed to do is very difficult, as demonstrated by thousands of reviews of routers on Amazon full of anger, frustration and disappointment.So the recent Linksys E series of routers are welcome on that count.  They're fairly simple to install and use, and work reliably.  If your needs are simple - you want a wireless connection, over not too far of a distance - the Linksys E900 may work just fine.But the bar for speed, features and range is also getting raised all the time.  Many people will do better by looking for a router with a few more features and capabilities than the E900 offers.GOOD SPEED:  With 2 transmit and 2 receive antennas (2T2R, in the lingo), this router can achieve N speeds if you have the right adapter on your computer.  In theory each antenna can handle 150 Mbps of traffic, thus the spec shows 300 Mbps.  In practice, it's much lower speeds - so you're doing very well if you get 50-80 Mbps on a 2.4 Ghz band router.MODEST RANGE:  Router range varies, depending on the transmit power; the antennas; and other factors.  This router does best with shorter range applications.A LITTLE SHORT ON FEATURES:  There are some features that are not available on the E900 that, even in a simple setup, you might find will be useful: - One of those is guest access - now that everyone who visits you is carrying around a wifi device or two, it's nice not to have to give them your network password and access to your shared files.  A guest setup lets someone get access to the internet, without having access to everything on your network. - The other feature is parental controls, which the E900 also lacks.ATTRACTIVE BUT INFLEXIBLE DESIGN:  A lot of people will like the sleek design, and the fact that the lights are in the back (not on the front).  Personally, I'd rather have the ability to configure the router in various ways - standing, turned, on its side - and this design limits that.  I also like the option of hanging the router, something the design of the E900 doesn't allow.IT TAKES TWO:  Your connection will only be as good as both ends of the connection.  Some laptops don't come with the speediest wireless network adapters built in.  So to make the most of this or any router, remember that you need a good wireless adapter on the computer the router is connected to.  It's usually fairly easy to change the little wireless card in a laptop if you want to upgrade the internal adapter.In particular, look at the antenna configuration of an adapter or laptop - often you'll see something like 1T2R,  or 1x2, which means there's 1 transmit and 2 receive antennas.  That will give good download speeds, but slower upload speeds (which may be fine for many people).LOOK AT THE CHANNEL AND NETWORK SETUP:  Some reliable websites suggest that you may actually get more throughput using single-width (20 Mhz wide) channels for wireless N.  It may be worth experimenting with.  Similarly, it's conventional wisdom that mixing G and N adapters will slow all the devices.  That's worth testing with your setup as well.Some router manufacturers have taken to putting a sticker on the router with the default IP address and username / password, I've found that useful.Bottom line, it's a nice, simple router that should work well over short distances.  You could do a lot worse.  But, you could do better, too.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 11, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R11QH6DM4SD4NX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007IL764W#wasThisHelpful","R11QH6DM4SD4NX","A2EF8N7ZE7ONWX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2EF8N7ZE7ONWX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you're using a regular toothbrush, you have no idea of how really effective a toothbrush can be.  The Oral-B Vitality does a much better job of cleaning your teeth, and will easily get to areas at the gum line that you would really have to work to clean effectively with a regular brush - so you won't.The 5 star rating is not because this is perfect, but because the results you get are well worth the price.

"Panasonic shavers are among the best, from my experience, and the ES-LT41-K is right at the sweet spot.  It offers a high level of performance and useful features - good blades, 13,000 cycle per minute cutter - without unnecessary frills.  To match the shaver to your needs, see the charts in the product listing for a great summary of the differences in the models.GIVE IT TIME:  If you're making the change to electric shavers, or switching brands, don't be hasty in reaching a decision about the shaver.  Electric shavers are very different from a razor, and vary quite a lot among different brands.  It will take a little time to figure out how to best use a given electric shaver.That said, you really can't get the same shave with a shaver that you can with a razor.  But then again, a shaver can be a lot more comfortable to use, especially on your lip and chin (where it can feel like your beard is being pulled out, rather than cut, with a razor).  To me it's worth the tradeoff, though I do usually clean up with a razor to catch hairs and stubble I've missed.GIVE IT TIME, PART 2:  You may find you need to shave a little longer than you'd like to, or go over the same spot more than you think you ought to.  But with a little bit of patience, you can get a remarkably close shave with this shaver.WET OR DRY:  If you only use this shaver dry, you may be missing something.  It's a different shave wet, and it's great that this shaver is built to let you shave wet or dry.EASY TO CLEAN:  The wet or dry construction also makes it easy to clean - just run it under the faucet (with the cleaning mode on, if you like).GREAT BATTERY LIFE:  I can go weeks between charges.  If possible, it's best to let the battery run all the way down and then recharge it fully to get the best charge capacity.  Also, while the charge indicator is useful, it seems it can stay at 10% for a long time.  Don't put the shaver on the charger when it reaches 10% - use it for more shaves.THREE BLADES OR FOUR?  Those with especially tough beards seem to swear by four blades, but to me the four blade shavers are just too large. Personal preference will vary - neither one is right for everybody.PRICES FLUCTUATE:  There are certain items on Amazon which seem to have wide price fluctuations, and Panasonic shavers are among them.  So it may be worth tracking the price a little, or searching the web, to catch it on sale.SKIP THE CLEANING STATION:  Some may find it useful, but to me the cleaning station seems like a holdover from the days of harder-to-clean models.  I had one on my last Panasonic shaver and never used it.I used Braun shavers for many years, but after being disappointed with the declining performance of their more expensive shavers, I switched to Panasonic and haven't looked back.  The Panasonic ES-LT41-K is an excellent choice among electric shavers.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 25, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R157WUACRVWBN1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005DKKBRY#wasThisHelpful","R157WUACRVWBN1","A2EF8N7ZE7ONWX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2EF8N7ZE7ONWX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Lonely Planet Spanish Phrasebook & Dictionary is a handy, compact guide for travelers to Spain.  At 5-1/2"" by 3-3/4"" by 1/2"", it's the portable size you'd expect from a phrasebook (or slightly larger).  The book does seem to reflect the Lonely Planet approach to travel - it seems to assume you're going to spend some time in one country, so it goes into more detail than the casual traveler may need.  (So something even more abbreviated may be better for a quick trip.)For the most part, they did a good job with the selection of what's in the book and how it's organized.  The colored page edges help find things, once you're a little bit familiar with them.  The main body of the book has a well-organized series of sections for various needs.  The last 75 pages of the book have a menu decoder; an English to Spanish dictionary; and a Spanish to English dictionary.Putting grammar at the beginning seems a waste, though.  I'm all for learning some grammar, but I don't think that's where you start.  (In fact, I think the best way to start learning a language is with no book at all - see below.)  But again, they seem to be going for a little more depth than usual in this book, on the assumption you'll be in the country for a while.  Still, a selection of more of the most useful phrases (there are a few there) would be a better use of the first section of the book.OPEN IT BEFORE YOU NEED IT:  You can't really expect to carry a phrase book and open it to find the right phrase just as your taxi is hurtling past your destination.  You'll have a lot better luck if you spend a little time on the plane or before you leave with the book.  Practice a little, so you don't stumble so badly with pronunciation.  Figure out where the phrases that seem most useful to you are located in the book.SPANISH AS IN SPAIN:  Many people know, but many people don't - Spanish, especially everyday spoken Spanish, varies quite a bit in different countries.  The dialect spoken in much of Spain is called Castilian or European, and varies somewhat from that spoken in the Americas.  So look for another book if you're headed to Latin America, such as the Lonely Planet Latin American Spanish Phrasebook or the Lonely Planet Mexican Spanish Phrasebook.There are a few basics for the other dialects spoken in Spain - Basque, Catalan and Galician - at page 115.START WITH THE SPOKEN WORD:  If you've studied a foreign language, you probably started with a book, and followed by listening.  But consider spending a little time with an audio-based language program before you go.  It's something you can do around the house or in the car.  I like the Pimsleur language series - though they seem to have a lot more product options for Latin American Spanish.  I've also found the Living Language programs to be useful. Finally, there are a number of language websites available if you want to hear spoken Spanish.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 18, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2XKO9NUO06XE8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1742208096#wasThisHelpful","R2XKO9NUO06XE8","A2EF8N7ZE7ONWX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2EF8N7ZE7ONWX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The illy issimo Cappucino coffee drink is a well-made, medium-body and moderate calorie drink.  It's produced in Denmark and imported.  It has 100 calories and 1.5 grams of fat in an 8.45 ounce drink.A bottled Starbucks Coffee Frappucino has 200 calories and 3 grams of fat (and it's slightly larger at 9.5 ounces), so the illy drink offers a lighter alternative if that's what you're seeking.Personally, I prefer a stronger coffee flavor, and am not as concerned about the calories.  For a pick-me-up, I often want some calories as well as caffeine.  I found the illy drink pleasant, and it's probably right for some, but most of the time I'd probably buy something else.The label mentions that it has cocoa, so I was looking for the flavor, but it didn't seem to me to have much if any cocoa flavor.  Since I don't really want that in a cappucino drink anyway, that's actually a plus.

"Congratulations to Penny Reid who is quite the Ninja herself - jugging the responsibilities of being an author, a mom of three (including a 4 month old baby) and the seemingly disparate world of biomedical research.  Perhaps not so disparate given that all Penny's books show smart, funny characters, with the assumption that the reader will be able to keep up.  Having recently read a novel where the author thought it necessary to explain what a penthouse is, I appreciate the assumption that I, too, have a brain.Every time Penny writes a new book, I reread all the others.  If you are new to Ms. Reid, start with Neanderthal Seeks Human.  Yada, yada, stand alone... You will have a much richer understanding of the characters by starting at the beginning.  Like most of Penny's fans, these are books that I happily reread a number of times.

"The premise of the story had potential, but the continual stretch of the disbelief  cord and disjointed plot elements made this a tough slog.What are the chances that you would randomly catch the eye if some guy in a bar, that he would be in the parking lot  at exactly the moment you were going to get attacked and that the next morning at the courthouse, you would literally run into him when you snuck into an employee's lounge area?  Oh yes, and he just happens to be your soon to be ex-husband's  attorney.If you are still willing to go along with this, then add in that he also just happens to be on the scene when she is carjacked AND that when you inherit a farm two  hours away, it turns out that the hero had purchased the adjacent property a couple of months ago AND guess who is the district attorney  in the county where you have moved to?I liked the yummy description of how cute the Hero was, but the poor guy was no brain surgeon.  Putting a dead bolt on the front door but not the back was one of several things that caused eye-rolling. The worst one was later in the story.Not sure about all the time spent on the wind technology element which turned out to have nothing to do with advancing the plot or involving relevant characters.  The scene with the heroine been lauded for her fifth grade analysis of wind technology was laughable.  I'm not sure whether it was an insult to the heroine or perhaps to the IQ of the readers.When I saw the ratings for this, I ordered the book, only to realize it was already on my ereader.  I had started it and stopped many months ago.

"There weren't any screams or anything coming from the inside.  Good sign or bad?  Hard to tell-this was my first felony and I didn't know the proper procedure.""Like Marie, in Book 1 of this series, Sophie has grown up outside the MC world and has done her best to stay removed from it, despite the fact that her son's uncle is a Reaper.  ""I might not have my life entirely together, but I was pretty sure about one thing -- parties that ended with stabbings weren't part of the long-term plan.""Ruger's tough guy image takes a beating when he steps in to be a presence in his nephew's life.  One of my favorite scenes involves a one-sided conversation between Noah and Ruger.""Yup.  Still talkin' about Skylanders,"" Ruger said, his voice strained and his expression dark.  ""Been talkin' about Skylanders non-stop.  I think we ran out of new material a while ago....  We got almost three and a half more hours.  This might kill me.""Sophie and Ruger have an extremely complicated relationship that dates back years.  I like that this wasn't one of those ""we wasted time because of a misunderstanding"" stories.  Both Sophie and Ruger have good reasons for having kept their mutual distance in the past, but sparks start flying.

"If you liked Motorcycle Man by Kirsten Ashley, then I am sure you will love Book 1 of the Reapers Motorcycle Club series.  Every time Ms. Wylde adds to the series, I go back and start from the beginning. It's one of the few books that is as fun to read the third time as the first.You have to be willing to suspend your disbelief as these are romance novels.  Ms. Wylde has done a good job of showing an MC, warts and all.  These are not choir boys. They are hot, bossy alpha males.  Readers who don't like the fact that Horse is too controlling miss the fact that 99% of readers would not like this lifestyle in real life, but it is certainly enjoyable as a steamy escape.  I love that Marie is feisty.  Both Horse and Marie are interesting, three-dimensional characters who evolve throughout the novel.  There is just the right amount of humor as well.  Best surprise of all... there's a great plot!""It's a .38,"" he said proudly.

"To those readers new to Kristen Ashley, start with the book that inspired the whole Chaos series -- Motorcycle Man.  This will be a richer read for having the background knowledge even if it is possible to read it as a stand-alone.DON'T let any spoilers ruin the plot in Walk Through Fire.  While I am not a huge fan of the 20 year love reunion, Ashley does a great job of building the tension about what split up the couple two decades apart.  This novel is full of interesting characters; some who have already had their share of the limelight, but are still relevant (Tack and Cherry) and characters who NEED to have their own novel (Elvira and Malik).Elvira just about steals the show in this one.  She is a slightly tone-downed version of her crazy self with a mission to get her hunk of delicious man down the aisle.  ""Malik'll be the one with the bad luck if that man don't put a ring on it AND SOON.  He don't, I got two choices.  Kick his black butt out or kill him.  And just sayin' I'm leanin' toward door number two.  As far as I'm concerned, my girl Beyonc made a call to arms and I listened.""  Malik is only in a couple of scenes, but his yumminess is definitely preseent.Logan (High) is a really good guy who acts like a jerk at the start of the novel.  He has plenty of reason to be bitter.  This is a biker full of romance who has stiletto prints all over his heart.  ""Millie, you give me your number, do you think I'm gonna forget a single digit?""  ""Safe with me.  Never won't be, babe.""Millie has been living in a state of suspended animation for the past twenty years.  She has the perfect shell, but is hollow.  Ashley does a great job of having her come back to life.  There are some very interesting moments when both the characters and reader get to wonder if these two would have still been together if they hadn't broken up in the first place.  I really like that they were both evolved adults of their original selves as opposed to to a Sleeping Beauty type scenario.  Life has had its impact on both Millie and High.This book has much less of the convaluted double-negative speak of previous Ashley books and was a much more enjoyable read as a result.  High's kids are both realistic and I liked that his ex-wife wasn't the stereotypical, revengeful witch.  An interesting surprise is Alan, Millie's brother-in-law who pulls out all the stops to protect Millie.  Although not a biker, he definitely has an edge and puts High through his paces.  I'd love to see what Ashley could do with his character.Quibbles?  I could have lived without the bar scene with Hop singing and the guys getting revenge.  Seemed a little high school-ish.I had pre-ordered this book, so was surprised when it showed up on my e-reader.  Needless to say, my plans for the evening changed and I got to work with only three hours of sleep.  I would definitely read this again starting all the way back with the Unfinished Hero series.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1PJD6K5774XLE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1455533254#wasThisHelpful","R1PJD6K5774XLE","ALYI8YM90TPD1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ALYI8YM90TPD1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Oophhh. ...  I need to get a neck brace from the emotional whiplash caused by reading this book.  Is there such a thing as love at first sight?  Yes, but it is often confused with lust at first sight.Having most of the characters in a book suffer from the same condition ""I've just seen her/him and know she/he is THE ONE"" is trite.  In a way ii is a lazy form of writing because the author never has to create a plausible romantic build up.  We are told the characters are in love and it's a done deal.  Some of the characters don't even have to hear the other person speak before being hit with an arrow from the fast food version of Cupid.This is two minutes after Ted meets Caroline:""He wanted to talk to her forever. With a clarity he couldnt begin to fathom just then, he knew hed never run out of things to say to her.""The whole drama in the book results from a ridiculous amount of immature behavior by adults who should know better.  Smitty needs some big boy panties.  The demise of a six week relationship, especially when you went into it light-heartedly should not make you leave the hemisphere.  Ted and Caroline could have handled the initial situation so much better. We have a bunch of successful males in their thirties acting like Grade 8 girls.Even if you are okay with the Jello pudding quickie romance, what is the huge rush to want to have babies with someone you've just met?Ted's mother morphs back and force between wonderful and harpy.  Her verbal scud missile near the end followed by another 180 made me scream ""Pick a persona already!""Ted shows his wishy washy nature not only in his personal life,  but at work.  Imagine a pediatric oncologist leaving his job with 12 hours notice and his boss saying come back any time.  Hmmm... If you are working 90 hour weeks doesn't that mean you are dumping a lot of work without notice on your colleagues?There are at least three more quickie romances, but ultimately it is Caroline's weakness that causes the book to fail.  We are told that she has survived and learned a lot from a previous bad relationship, but all we get is a Tammy Wynette version of Stand By Your Man. Having the magic poof back in was a huge disappointment.  I feel like we need a Dr. Phil intervention.  Caroline does make a great point when she says, ""It was right out of a bad soap opera, for heavens sakes.""  Yep.  Couldn't agree more.The ironic thing is that I really like how Marie Force writes, which is why this gets two stars instead of one.

"After reading this book, I am wondering if it is possible for an author to plagiarize her own work.  The Kathleen Turner series was so good I've read it at least three times.  So, was I up for another of Ms. Snow's love triangles?  You bet!The main issue is that Sage isn't nearly as likable a heroine as Kathleen. Kathleen was spunky, brave, and enterprising.  Sage feels a little like she is faking being middle - class (wanting to know what kind of boat they've been invited on and noticing the restaurant was more Bar than Grill).  Add in the disappointment at being offered beer,  and it just seems as if she is slumming a little when she is with Ryker.Parker is not particularly well - rounded as a leading man. We have basic facts about him, but that's it.  Ryker ' s character seems as if he is a consolation prize for Sage because she can't have Parker.

"Book 1 in the Titan series flirted with believability issues a couple of times,  but was still an enjoyable,  steamy read.Garrison's Creed goes well beyond the bounds of believability into eye-rolling terrain.  Imagine a witness protection program where you are allowed to live NEAR your friends and family.  Imagine being able to take the last name of someone very close to you as your new identity AND that you get to keep your first name.  The whole witness protection and testifying storyline was totally glossed over.There are too many villains in this novel with plot twists that are WAY over the top.  Some of the bad guys are so dumb that they give you back your purse because you need lip gloss and untie you when you are captured.There really is no adequate justification for Nicole's decision to avoid her family once she was no longer in the program and it makes her a less likable heroine.  Cash had delicious moments, but was often pouty.  There was a fair bit if time spent on advancing future plots -- Jared and Sugar,  Roman and Beth.If this had been Book 1, I wouldn't continue reading the series.  Because of my fondness for Winter's Heat,  I am willing to try one more book.","2.0 out of 5 stars","August 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3B8DBL0NORXMR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FCZC4YI#wasThisHelpful","R3B8DBL0NORXMR","ALYI8YM90TPD1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ALYI8YM90TPD1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I understood this was a prequel when I downloaded it, but having just finished Winter's Heat (Book 1 in the Titan series), I felt like I was reading something by a totally different author.  The action and intensity from Book 1 had morphed into teen angst with a ridiculous plot twist.  Frankly, it was all rather off-putting.I think it might be better for readers to go straight from Winter's Heat to Garrison's Creed and then double back to this if they are curious. After being so happy with the first novel, this has actually damped my interest in reading further.2.5 stars rounded up for freebie","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1CUZY3M98X4VN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KFMFWWE#wasThisHelpful","R1CUZY3M98X4VN","ALYI8YM90TPD1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ALYI8YM90TPD1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you are willing to approach this book like you would an action movie and you enjoy a sexy alpha male, then this book is definitely worth a read.  Just be prepared to suspend your disbelief along the way.

"Humphrey Bogart and Audrey Hepburn starred in a black and white movie called Sabrina.  This would appear to be the Harlequin adaptation.I am not sure if I have ever read anything quite so ironic.  Characters who refer to something as being clich while spouting clichs is a new device.  Two of the characters even play a clich game. Think of every overused romantic phrase from the past fifty years.... which made her breath catch...... made her tremble ...... made her skin flush and her heart race... and butterflies would mass and throng in her tummy...  (okay thronging butterflies is a new twist)... every fibre in his being...... the sky was a blue as Barrett English's eyes...... his eyes were dark as a stormy sea...... growing awareness than spread through her gut like molten lava...... she was an angel, a vision...... we might just be a match made in heaven...... his heart literally stopped working for a moment...  Holy clich overuse, Batman!  Don't even get me started the ""making this so hard/that's my line/that's what he said"" references.Heroine:  ""This is such a clich.""Hero:  ""You're a clich.""Truer words were never spoken.  Part of me wondered if the book was the result of a nefarious bet whereby money exchanged hands each time the word clich was used or when a clich was included.  Is there such a thing as a clich of a clich?  A derivative clich?Sadly, the novel lacks a couple of romantic tropes.  There is no amnesia or foundling baby, but since this is the first in a series, perhaps these will appear in future books.  Virgin. Check.  Multi-millionaire/billionaire. Check.  Older hero who held her the day she was born and who has been apparently waiting for her ever since.  (Creepy, but check.)  Repeated female lip biting that sends the hero into a sexual frenzy.  Check.  Fake fiance. Check.""... for as long as Emily Edwards had drawn breath, Barrett English had wanted her.""A number of other reviewers have mentioned the creepiness of an older male watching a young female teen in a rather inappropriate fashion.  My understanding is that some changes were made from the original version to help deal with this.  The eight year age difference would never have been a big deal if the characters had MET when they were 24 and 32 years old.  Holding her as a baby would not have been creepy if they actually spent a lot of time together as friends and their close relationship developed over the years.  Instead, we have two people who only know each other based on limited interactions a few times a year at most. There is still a stalkerish element when a man of 22 is watching a girl of 14 or even 24 and 16.Not everything in the novel is a rehash of former romances. In a Shakespearean twist, the novel stops and the author speaks directly to the reader.  ""Here's what Barrett learned ...  You are giddily happy that you're actually together for real with no more artifice.  You are aroused to the point of discomfort...""  Who talks like this??  Why the need to stop the story to tell us this?Speaking of aroused to the point of discomfort, there is one scene I have ABSOLUTELY NEVER read before.  Barrett's mother enters his bedroom at the family mansion and sits on his bed.  She wants to know what he is doing with Emily.  While his mother is sitting on his bed, this 32 year man GETS AN ERECTION!  Does the ick meter go higher than this??""His body reacted to his thoughts, and he shifted under the covers.""Oh, Barrett!"" she(mom) exclaimed, springing up from his bed.  She scrunched up her lips in disapproval and shook her head.....SHE FLICKED HER GLANCE AT THE SHEETS DISDAINFULLY before returning to his face.""What???  Seriously???  What kind of man gets a hard on while he is talking to his mother about his girlfriend???  This really does push the whole sexually inappropriate male a little far and lends credibility to the creep factor.Although Barrett is fabulously rich and not opposed to spending $30,000 on a ring for his fake fiance, he is oddly cheap in the wardrobe department.  Emily is only given two outfits to go on business dates with him.  One is a black dress and the other is a blue tweed suit.  Tweed?  Suit? She also receives an oddly sensible pair of black heels.Emily and Barrett have apparently learned something called the overview approach at university.  At different times in the story, the characters stop to use this approach to analyze what is going on.  This is apparently a useful device when you are in the middle of a romantic quandry.Don't hang around for the witty dialogue.""You and me.""  ""You and me?""  ""You and  me?""""Are you okay?""  ""I'm perfect.""""You're definitely okay?""  ""Way better than okay.""""What about you?  I was ... okay?""Barrett does a 180 by the end of the book and goes from having a golf club up his nether regions to being more malleable than Gumby.  Mr. English Learns to Grovel might have been a better title.My best advice is to download before you buy.  Two stars instead of one since this was a freebie.","2.0 out of 5 stars","August 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3V3E74YA4XFV0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00M0DQIEC#wasThisHelpful","R3V3E74YA4XFV0","ALYI8YM90TPD1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ALYI8YM90TPD1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Are you kidding me?? Here is a quote from the book's leading male character, a police detective:""What was it with women and the careers they picked these days?""Apparently our Romeo is shocked to find out that today's Juliet might be employed as a medical examiner or an FBI computer specialist. I was STUNNED to see this was written in 2010 and not 1960.  I'm not sure how making a modern day male cop think like a Neanderthal is romantic.Equally outdated are the computer references.  They simply don't match real life.  It's as if the author in 2010 was many years behind in computer knowledge and teen use of computers.  Before the trolls descend, let me explain that I have worked in high schools for three decades and am in direct contact with hundreds of teens per year.  Teens don't download chat records.  Teens in 2010 would have chat messages on their phone, on Facebook (6 years old when this book was written) or in their email.  They could delete the messages, but even that would be highly unusual behavior. PARENTS of misbehaving teens and SPOUSES who worry about a partner cheating are the ones who download conversations.I felt like the author wanted to lecture readers who were parents not to let them have computers in their bedrooms. This was already old news in 2010.  Having the location of the computers be an element of the plot was forced given that ALL the girls had been lured away from their homes, regardless of where the computer was.In another very odd example,  one of the teen victims saves an email to a special file on her computer after hiding all the references to who the email was from.  This was very contrived.  You would either keep the whole message, delete it all, or download it to your secret spot.  The ONLY reason to download a doctored version is to not give away the plot info even earlier in the book.There are more editing errors than I would expect for a book of this cost, but the biggest issue is that if this is really supposed to be a mystery, the author shouldn't be lobbing clues like hand grenades in the first 10% of the book.It seemed extremely ironic that our police detective was aware of his failings as a dad and felt that he needed to catch the predator so his daughter didn't become a victim.  Wouldn't addressing the relationship issues promptly have been a smart move???Could you do serious praying for Jenna, Connors daughter?Shes in trouble? Ill start now.I'm glad the description of this book has been updated to include a Christian category.  I was surprised to have two different characters talking about church in the first 7% of the book and that in the middle of a crime scene a discussion about the need to be religious became an issue.  Fair enough.  There are many of people who complain about sexual content when there isn't enough warning in the book summaries.I'm pleased for the author that there is a market for this novel.  It certainly wasn't me, and I would suggest that anyone who isn't sure, should download a sample prior to purchasing.","2.0 out of 5 stars","August 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3FDMC36UZL78N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00B5J4PP6#wasThisHelpful","R3FDMC36UZL78N","ALYI8YM90TPD1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ALYI8YM90TPD1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This novel is a safe bet for readers who like romance,  but not steam.  The plot is interesting which helps to balance out the insta-love nature of the story.  The heroine is a woman of many talents.  Given the closeness she has had with her brothers, it is surprising that none of them clued into her despair over the years.There are a few editing glitches (waste/waist), but not enough to impede your enjoyment.  There are some awkward computer moments (password vs code), but my biggest complaint centers on the fact that when someone is in grave danger, you should phone to let them know there is a problem, BEFORE driving to help them.3.5 stars, bonus .5 for being free","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2YPC4LNXZANUV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007OYYIE4#wasThisHelpful","R2YPC4LNXZANUV","ALYI8YM90TPD1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ALYI8YM90TPD1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The title of this review is a statement made by a character in this novel.  For some readers, this might be enough of a red flag.  If this appeals to you, click the buy now button and skip the rest of this review.A number of reviewers have made comments related to editing issues.  Although the author indicates the novel was re-edited, there are still a number of errors. The editing, though, was the least of my concerns.A major issue is that this reads like a poorly written young adult novel.  There is a juvenile quality to both the writing and plot. As a result, there is nothing that appeals to me as a 40 year old female and my teenager was snorting when I read her some passages.Well written characters have strengths and weaknesses.  It was very clear that the characters in this book all fall into the good or bad category.  Aimee  is good.  Her sister is bad.  Shane is a good guy.  Blake was a very good guy who suddenly morphs into to a bad guy.Aleks is a good guy.  His brother is evil.  Don't be looking for nuance in this novel.There is a revolving door of emotions running throughout the book.  Aimee has always loved Shane until she meets Aleks.  Shane has always loved Aimee even though he dated her evil sister.  We get many chapters of Aimee playing emotional ping pong.  There are great examples of love triangles, but this isn't one of them.Much of the behavior of the main characters makes little sense.  Aimee ridicules Shane for mentioning that his property once belonged to an ancient shaman.  She starts referring to it as a pet cemetery for some bizarre reason.  Later in the book she is screaming at him in ALL CAPS because he doesn't believe her when she tells him something undead related.This is the type of novel where the reader is supposed to believe that a rapist would bring the same recognizable drinking glasses to different parties to put the date rape drug in!!!  This is how Aimee recognizes the poisoned drink.  What kind of clown school criminal is this?Aimee accuses Aleks of not being honest with her from the start.  The fact that he meets her AFTER the death of her mother and has nothing to do with the date rape scenario goes over her head, even when he spells it out for her.  Sadly, she is the smart twin.If you have ever met identical twins, you know the whole point is that you can't tell them apart -- hence the word identical.  In Cursed, the twins are identical EXCEPT:""Where she had JET-BLACK hair and SILVER eyes like our mom, I had BLONDE and BLUE.""  Shoot me now.....  So what is the point of calling them identical?Aimee has no respect for her sister or her friends until she becomes instantly smitten with one of them.  Smitten enough to wear Giselle's dress to a party, but not enough to keep tabs on how the old liver transplant situation is going.The author makes a couple of references to Nancy Drew in the book and I did have a few Hardy Boy moments.  When Giselles's mom visits her in the hospital,  the mom's boyfriend pats Giselle's leg and says he always wished he had a daughter.  This morphs into:""Giselles mom is dating an Internet pervert. Hes an actual ped. Do you think were cursed, Dad?""I'm not sure what the health care is like where you live.  In Cursed, patients can swap hospital rooms at will.Okay, but I was wondering if we could share a room. The nurse nodded at us. Ill have your stuff moved over right away.""  HA!  This isless believable than the notion of demons and vampires.The attempt at world - building is very basic and even one of the characters says something about not understanding how it works.  Oooph. ..Still not sure?  How about a cliffhanger alert?  On the off chance that you enjoy the story, you need to be aware that there is no resolution.","1.0 out of 5 stars","August 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ECWZNNFLI2EE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ATVXSM2#wasThisHelpful","R1ECWZNNFLI2EE","ALYI8YM90TPD1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ALYI8YM90TPD1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Anne Calhoun is one of the most talented authors of smart, steamy romance you will come across.  That being said, if you haven't read any of her novels, don't start with this one.  Breath on Embers,  The List, Uncommon Passion, Uncommon Pleasure, Liberating Lacey are all books I have reread several times and love.This was just a quick read.  I am usually willing to go on whatever literary adventure Calhoun offers, but this story fell flat.  Simon has appeared as a secondary character in previous novels and deserved a much more interesting romance than she got in Evening Storm.  Ryan remained two-dimensional and the  HEA wrapped up too easily.  Without giving any spoiler details, I'd have to say the helicopter episode killed it for me.So, Calhoun auto - buy fans should not be deterred.  I just don't want any potential fans to miss her best work by reading this one and giving her other books a wide berth.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3OXDT0KK4J6BR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00L9AXZA2#wasThisHelpful","R3OXDT0KK4J6BR","ALYI8YM90TPD1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ALYI8YM90TPD1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am going to go look for a neck brace due to the hours of head-shaking while reading this book.  I thought Book 1 was fun in an over the top way (4 stars), but this went straight into ludicrous.  I use an orange highlight on my ereader when there is an issue -- editing, plot points that don't make sense, behavior that is ridiculous....  I stopped counting at 100 examples for this novel.If you had some concerns about the believability factor in book 1, I suggest you keep reading this review.Evie wins the Nudie Award for the suspense heroine most likely to rush from a building naked or in her underwear.  There are at least three examples of this.  I've never read a book where this behavior became the norm.  Remember when your kids were three and wanted to run around naked in the back yard.  That's Evie.The biggest issue, of course, is why, at the end of Book 1, Evie has been made a Key Master.  If you are dealing with the potential destruction of the world, MAYBE you want someone a LITTLE less impulsive and more experienced.  That really is a huge deal in Book 2.  If Evie had morphed from soccer mom to super spy with good decision making abilities, that would be one thing.  Instead, we have romantically confused Evie who is a killing machine.  Not so great on the planning or listening to Cooper who is supposed to be in charge of the assignment.One of the reviewers said that the sex components were the best part and I agree.  The love triangle between Servario, Evie, and Cooper is interesting, which is why I gave this two stars instead of one.  What is NOT appealing, though, is the frenetic whiplash in Servario's change of behavior.  Grabbing the heroine's hair and shoving her head into your crotch doesn't rank high of the romantic meter.  The ""I'll always be in the shadows to keep you safe"", doesn't balance out how he treats her for most of the book.  Neither does being a drug and gun dealer who participates in sexual trafficking.  Wow, he's so good because he doesn't traffic children. When Servario wants her, Evie doesn't want him.  Lather rinse, repeat.If you would like to see a love triangle that works, try Tiffany Snow's Kathleen Turner books.While the world order is in danger, Evie is on a three week time out at boot camp.  Little progress is evident by the rest of the team and Cooper is hanging around watching Evie.  There is time for Evie and Coop to spend the morning in playground equipment spying on her kids' first day at school, but then we are told that they are short on time to hunt down bad guys.If Servario is like Jekyll and Hyde in his behavior toward Evie, Coop is like a junior version of this.  He only wants sex, not a relationship.  Then he doesn't want her to be conflicted about her feelings for him.  Then he loves her kids and treats them like a father.  Then he tells her they can't have a relationship while on the job.Evie:  ""What is so wrong about falling in love?""Coop:  ""Everything.""  His eyes hardened.  ""It gets you killed, Evie.  If I loved you I would always save you.  You.  Not me.  This job is about keeping ME alive, not you.""  A paragraph later his words are ""cutting and venomous"", but don't worry, it will be totally different in a page or two.  Seriously exhausting.The men go from snarling over her and wanting to mark their territory to joking about her references to giving birth and her hemorrhoid stories.  Stick a pin in my eye!Evie is no better than the men.  Servario treats her like a ho and she loves him ten minutes later when he buys her Jimmy Choo shoes.  She goes pantiless DURING a mission to drive both guys crazy.  ""Call it petty, but seeing him and Servario go berserk over some underwear was awesome.""Sex trafficking?  End of the world anyone?  Quit focusing on your vagina.At one point in the plot, we have a character who is so busy trying to lose a tail that he spends THREE WEEKS hitchhiking, walking, and riding a motorcycle in circles before delivering a message.  What???  Why put crazy stuff like this in the story?  The same goes for Servario's reaction every time Evie swears.  The gun/drug/human trafficker doesn't like his women to have a potty mouth and blows up every time it happens.  This of course, makes Evie with the emotional maturity of an eight year old really let loose.  Again -- focus people!  End of the world potential!  One of the most ridiculous scenes is where a character from the first book comes to find Evie.  She is in the bedroom sleeping of the apartment he comes to.  He goes to the living room, but is apparently unable to figure out that the other doors in the apartment could open.  What??Evie's mother could be the conductor of the bipolar train flipping between water boarding granny and a cooking baking Mary Poppins.There are many nudge, nudge, wink, wink moments in the book as if the author is actually admitting how ludicrous it is all getting.* ""The spy  and arms dealer is a story for the romance novels, not real life.  Stop being so melodramatic and naive.""  You nailed it, Servario!* ""It was like Kill Bill.  It was like Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas.  It was like a James Bond movie.""* ""I didn't know why I had agreed to even do the stupid mission.  It made made no sense.""  YES!  I agree!* ""My mom shook her head.  ""It's not as cheesy as it sounds.""  Sorry mom, there is more cheese in this plot than in all of Wisconsin.* ""Wow, this sounds like a really bad plan.""  Yup!  Of course, two paragraphs later, she says ""whatever"" and walks away, because world order and all that...Add in the dildo lady and that's when I cracked open the Advil.If this had been a rom com about who wasn't putting the right items in their recycling bin, it could have been a hoot.  You can't combine end of the world scenarios with a hero who makes Dumb and Dumber look like like a treatise on rocket science.","2.0 out of 5 stars","August 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R17BMFEIFIWC6H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00F0XCR80#wasThisHelpful","R17BMFEIFIWC6H","ALYI8YM90TPD1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ALYI8YM90TPD1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love the idea of the heroine being a retired government agent who is now a soccer mom.  What if you gave up the life you loved to create a family and found out that your marriage was a sham?  That is the starting point of this book.  Evie is a delight -- feisty, witty and about to get her sexual groove back on.""I readjusted by boobs, 'cause they were not nineteen anymore either.  At thirty-six, sometimes they got a little excited about what we were doing and ended up out of my shirt.  I was pretty sure they had tried to jump in Coop's face.""""He was a bad man.  A bad man my vagina crazy loved.""I pointed at his face.  ""You've got a bit of arrogance, just there in your teeth.""  Love this!The plot is a little (okay, more than a little) over the top, but still fun. Approach it like you would an action film and you probably won't roll your eyes until the end.  Romance fans will love that there are some steamy scenes and swoon-worthy lines in the mix.  As well, you get two hunky leading males -- Cooper and Servario.  As yummy as the 28 year old Cooper is, calling Evie (36) a cougar  puts him at a distinct disadvantage!""You deserve someone who would cherish you and respect you, and make you more important than everything in the world.""A number of editing errors involving sentence structure, word usage, spelling (Roxy called Rozy, defiantly/definitely) and too many muttering characters (27 times).If you are looking for serious suspense or are not interested in romance, give this one a miss.  Romance fans who want a fresh plot with lots of twists will likely enjoy it a lot.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R30QF7RTXM5P5P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00COVWOI4#wasThisHelpful","R30QF7RTXM5P5P","ALYI8YM90TPD1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ALYI8YM90TPD1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"It is believable that two people could have a loving sibling type relationship when young and have these feelings morph into romance as they aged. I would have been on board for that.This novel starts with a highly unlikely situation where the heroine just happens to have taken a burlesque course and the hero just happens to be in the audience as she is doing her graduation routine.  Sigh....I think I could have handled this if we're not for Finn calling Veronica ""little one"" all the time.  She tells him she doesn't like it.  There is something slightly creepy about the phrase as if he us still seeing her as pre-adolescent.It's a fairly crowded romance with too many secondary characters.

"If you're looking for a great novel about a female with untapped powers who becomes entangled with a mysterious otherworldly stranger, I have two strong recommendations:a) The Fever Series by Karen Marie Moningb) The Night Huntress Series by Jeaniene FrostWhat is fabulous about these series is that they are rich in plot and character development. I've read through both series at least three times.King's was difficult to get through once.King's seems to be a diluted version of the Fever Series in particular. Both heroines have a missing sibling and are unable to resolve the situation on their own. Enter the tall, dark, rich, handsome mysterious stranger. The Fever Series hero (Jerricho Barrons) is also a collector of mysterious items and uses the power of the heroine to locate what he's after. He even brings her to parties filled with unscrupulous people. At that point, it felt like King's was much too similar to Ms. Moning's work.The winner of the most annoying fictional heroine goes to Mia Turner. I thought I would stick a pin in my eye if she asked another ridiculous question.They go to a party hosted by Vaughn. Mia asks if this is Vaughn's party.Vaughn greets Mack as Mr. Taylor.""Mr. Taylor? Is Mack's last name Taylor?""By Chapter 5, Mia is still asking herself melodramatically why she made the deal with King.  Given that all of us know why the deal was made in the first chapter, having this repeated melodramatically throughout the book is frustrating.Whats with King and deals? Is he Monty Hall? Did he brand you, too?"" It just never ends!!At one point she does a machine gun question rant:WHO are you really, King? HOW can you vanish into thin air? HOW can you hurt someone with just a touch? HOW did you track me to Edinburgh?Here's where I was in complete agreement with Mia:Im such an idiot. Yup!and with King:I was getting to that. Perhaps, if youd cease with the QUESTIONS, I might be able to explain myself.I am still amazed that my assistant isnt able to speak, answer phones, or, he paused briefly, follow a simple set of instructions."" Ha!Slightly less annoying, is that Mia refers to King as a devil 16 times in the book, not including the multiple times she asks if he is a demon. This is in between hating him and wanting to rip his clothes off. In terms of romance, there is none.Minor quibbles:assuring vs ensuringThat meant ensuring (oops) me hed switched over to autopilot.bawling vs ballingMia was balling (ha!) her eyes out.Two stars because it was free. Check out Moning and Frost.","2.0 out of 5 stars","July 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R37QISGNS4FRQ1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1497587557#wasThisHelpful","R37QISGNS4FRQ1","ALYI8YM90TPD1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ALYI8YM90TPD1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love J.R. Ward and have reread the Black Dagger Brotherhood series several times.  There is no quibbling with Ms. Ward's ability to tell a story.  The surprise to me was that the paranormal vampires featured in her previous series are more believable than the characters The Bourbon Kings.Part of the problem is the sheer number of characters. We get a sense of each of them, but not the type of character development that sucks you into a novel.  Lane and Lizzie, the leading characters, are two-dimensional and have a Harlequin-type romance. There certainly isn't the strong, passionate vibe so evident in other of Ward's novels.  The old ""a lie broke us up for two years"" trope is used.  Lane has been laying on a couch for two years in between poker games while Lizzie puts her horticultural degree to use on the family estate.  Finally back together, neither one of them has learned a lesson.  He doesn't give her crucial information which she needs and she doesn't trust him when the chips are down.  Without giving any spoiler details, her behavior at the end of the book is enough to give you literary whiplash.My other issue is the melodramatic nature of the characters and their actions.  Lane's father isn't just flawed, he's EVIL.  Any one of his at least four major transgressions would have been enough.  Chantal is not just a bad wife, she's also EVIL with multiple transgressions.  Gin, Lane's sister, comes with more baggage than Louis Vuitton.  As if her almost two decade relationship with Samuel already worthy of a Jerry Springer episode, Ward pairs Gin up with a new man who is EVIL.  The whole true confessions, a day too late, was a bit corny.The oldest brother, Edward, takes the prize for the most emotionally and physically damaged of the family.  He is probably the most well-developed of the main characters.  Unfortunately,  the scene featuring Edward and Sutton (think Romeo and Juliet with a twist of Pretty Woman) had me rolling my eyes for the first time ever in a Ward novel.  Luckily, Edward is provided with a female who is plucky and GOOD.  She's so good that she gets upset when he swears.The most interesting character is the one least likely to make it into future novels.  We know up front that Miss Aurora's health is in jeopardy.  I like the relationship she has with Lane and Edward during the course of the novel.  It's somewhat ironic, given the importance that she is supposed to have in both their lives, that neither one of them has had any connection with her for two years.  Interesting, also, that she seems to have no connection to Gin, who lives in the same house.  I was on Team Aurora until the ""win one for the Gipper"" speech.The cast is rounded out by a virtually catatonic mother and a mysterious,  missing brother.If you are looking for a book boyfriend, your best bet is Deputy Sheriff Mitchell Ramsey.  This hunky guy is not only a hero, he's the one who has to clean up all the Bourbon messes.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R22QXF86QJ955/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0451475267#wasThisHelpful","R22QXF86QJ955","ALYI8YM90TPD1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ALYI8YM90TPD1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Violet sums up my sentiments exactly at 77% into the book when she says, ""Yada, yada, yada.""After the humor and interesting character portrayals in Books 1 - 4, I was stunned to see how much of Book 5 was extraneous filler.So where are you? I asked her.Sitting on my back deck.When did you get home?About an hour ago.How was Arizona?Fun, lots of laughs, kind of crazy. My cousins are nuts.You sure didnt fall far from that family tree.Take a train, peanut brain, she said, throwing one of our childhood insults back at me. So what have I missed here?""The dialogue has morphed from sparkling to deadly dull.""Lose the ax, though. Try leveling the playing field for once.The ax? The albino looked down at the blade in his hands and then back at me. You speak of this?Yes, that weird battle ax thing youre holding. I must have conjured that up thanks to the old Conan the Barbarian movie Id watched the other night with Natalie.It is a scythe, he clarified.I rolled my eyes. Are you seriously going to stand here and argue with me about the name of that stupid thing?

"What I Like:1.  The humor.  Good thing I REALLY like Ann Charles' sense of humor which I will mind meld and spew out at appropriate moments.Mastersons daddy had to be a few clowns short of a rodeo.""Violet:  Im not obsessed with Doc.Harvey snorted. Right, and Mount Rushmore is chiseled out of marshmallows.""Doc:  ""The next time I have you naked, I want to take my time and explore every inch of your soft skin.Hmmm. There were a couple of inches here and there on my body that Id rather he never found. After having the twins, Id roped off a couple of areas and labeled them as no mans land.""""... she was always falling for the guys who promised her the moon and then delivered stinky cheese with a side of infidelity.""2.  New story line for Aunt Zoe.  Charles lays a series of hints throughout the novel about what to expect in future books.What I Don't Like:1.  Cliffhangers.  I think there could be a better way to finish each book without the OMG moment.2.  No income.  I'm starting to believe in demons and zombies more than I am in Violet's ability to pay for the weekly groceries.  Let this woman sell a house or start poke dancing so she can earn some money!3.  Lack of Communication:  Violet's mistrust of Cooper made sense in the earlier books.  Now it is just getting old.4.  Cornelius.  I think he's the first character in the series that doesn't hold any appeal.What I'm ambivalent about:1.  The illustrations.  In earlier books when you had oat and pig heads melding together, having an illustration made sense.  In this book, we have illustrations of a urinal,  two vehicles, and a hand holding teeth.2.  Given the slow moving nature of the plot and the romance, I think the four books could have been reduced to two or three great books.  That would get rid of much of the irksome, repetitive behaviors.Still a fan and will buy Book 5.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RGK0NKR21C2G2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BEXVHW2#wasThisHelpful","RGK0NKR21C2G2","ALYI8YM90TPD1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ALYI8YM90TPD1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Make sure you read these books in order.  I find it strange that some people start at the third book of a series that is clearly numbered and then complain they don't understand some of the references.If you adored the first two books you will likely feel the same way about this one.  If you had concerns about Violet's propensity for rushing headlong  into danger in Book 2, you might have issues with TSTL behavior in this book.

"Having enjoyed the literary casserole of paranormal mystery,  humor, and romance that is Nearly Departed (Deadwood Book ), I immediately downloaded Book 2.I've discovered that I actually don't care about the plot as much as I enjoy Ann Charles' ability to create engaging characters.  Doc makes a great book boyfriend.  Violet is surrounded by an amazing cast of secondary characters;  her 10 year old twins, Aunt Zoe, and best of all, Will Harvey.Charles' other talent is her ability to make the reader laugh out loud.""One trip to the moon had apparently been enough for Doc, whereas I was all suited up and ready to rocket out of my boots again.""""But Im telling you, youre going to like this one.  You said that the last two times.Yeah, well, he has no visible rashes and isnt trying to become a famous ventriloquist.Is that as far as youre going to bend?On this subject, yes.

"This was definitely a quirky read for me.  I'm sure that a number of readers will be frustrated because it doesn't fit neatly into one category.When in the mood for escapist reading, I am a fan of humorous romance (Penny Reid and Ruthie Knox) and of paranormal romance (J.R. Ward, Jeaniene Frost,  Karen Marie Moning).  Most of all I am a fan of good writing.Dearly Departed is a well - written book.  You might be somewhat frustrated with certain elements in the story or because it is more of a literary casserole than a straightforward meat and potatoes read,  but Ann Charles deserves kudos for creating a very funny, well - written novel.Here's the opening paragraph:""The first time I came to Deadwood, I got shot in the a&&.  Now, twenty-five years later, as I stared into the double barrels of Old Man Harveys shotgun, irony was having a fiesta and I was the piata.""Some of my other favorites:""Whats a Broker Associate?  Its someone who is going to lose her job if she doesnt sell a house in the next three weeks.""Men had a history of fouling up my life, from burning down my house to leaving me knocked up with twins. These days, I liked my relationships how I liked my eggs: over-easy.""""I picked up my stapler with every intention of imprinting Swingline on Rays forehead via blunt force trauma.""Violet is the single mom of young twins who is struggling financially.  The kids make for great secondary characters and there are many funny scenes as Violet tries to juggle her personal life with her other responsibilities.Im going on this date, even if it means carrying a barf bag in my purse and slipping off to the restroom every ten minutes.""Turns out being single in Deadwood made me as popular as free pancakes at IHOP.""""I may not have dated since acid-wash jeans were in style , but I knew a brushoff when I heard one.""I thought the dialogue was great and had a number of chuckles.

"The problem with most series, especially in the romance genre, is that by the time you've read three books in a row by the same author you want to throw your ereader at the wall.  Usually it's the same plot with the names of the characters changed.  Sometimes it's a literary quirk that starts to grate on your nerves.That's why THIS series is such a treat.  Katie Reus is a very good writer.  Her plots are interesting,  well - paced and the alpha males are matched with strong females.  One of them, Grant, even says one of the reasons he likes Belle is because of her temper.At no time during this trio did I feel like there was too much rehash from one novel to another.

"The idea behind this novel had a lot of potential.  The reality not so much.  I am willing to suspend my disbelief to go on a paranormal literary adventure, but this was more like stroll to the mall.

"When over 60% of the people who read this book think it is worth five stars, I begin to despair. Since I have not bashed them for opinions I cannot relate to, I hope to be afforded the same courtesy.The plot is nothing short of formulaic - billionaire dom wants control over ""helpless'"" female. There are mant books like this. Think of a toned down version of 50 Shades or  Aleatha Romig's Consequences.Kyrie comes with more baggage than the Kardashians -- a mentally ill mother, grandparents who need financial help, and a brother she is putting through university for some reason. Big surprise is that she ends up in the clutches of a man who after a year of giving her $10,000 per month sends a minion to get her and whips out the blindfold. The climax is only slightly less obvious than Caitlyn Jenner getting a reality show.If the steam was hot enough, the reader could forgive the lack of original plot or believability. Sadly, there is nothing new or appealing here either. Corny phrases wreck whatever potential mood might have been created and repeated references to Valentine's Godzilla-like body part are yawn-inspiring.The author clearly assumes readers have the IQ of a turnip. Get a load of this:""My sexual partners have always been carefully chosen for their willingness to engage in sex with me upon my terms. By contract, actually. Not a financial contract, as I have never paid for sex, but a CONTRACT OF SILENCE. MEANING, THEY CAN NEVER SPEAK OF THEIR TIME WITH ME.""Thank goodness that that tricky contract of silence phrase was explained. PHEW! Had to have a little laugh when someone who has forked over $120,000 before picking up a girl thinking that he's never paid for sex. Especially since that she is told if she leaves she owes him the money he PAID her. Hmmmm... Maybe if you don't leave it on the beside table, the money doesn't count.Then, because we are all apparently country bumpkins, the author does this:""What is usually referred to as the 'penthouse' meaning the uppermost floor of the building...."" Gosh, golly gee! Let me get the hay out of my hair and see if I can imagine something taller than a barn. Honest to goodness, people!About 25% into the book, Kyrie goes into a rant over two pages long about why she doesn't like body builders. It felt like the author had realized she hadn't met the minimum word count.The inanities don't stop coming:* ""I worked directly for Mr. Roth for almost a year before he even gave me that much of his name.""* ""Can I try a sip of yours? I've never had tea before. Not the way you're drinking it, at least."" Yeah, because Earl Grey tea with a little milk is as unusual as unicorn juice.Here's what qualifies as sexy reparte:""Expect to be woken up bright and early, then."" ""Oh, goody. Cock-a-doodle-doo."" I was extremely surprised there wasn't an explanation or diagram for this witty word play.""You don't need coffee, babe. You just need to take this vibrator up your ... for me."" Man, he's a smooth-talker.You know the old saying, 'What has been seen, can not be unseen'? I'm hoping that isn't true with books. If the memory of this book is hanging around my skull for another day, I'm going to need an intervention.","1.0 out of 5 stars","June 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3BI4SD8VSLJFK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IRGU5OU#wasThisHelpful","R3BI4SD8VSLJFK","ALYI8YM90TPD1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ALYI8YM90TPD1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Having read all of Ms. James' N.Z. series more than once, I was curious to read her newest novel set in Idaho.From the first chapter, there is a definite sense of being on edge that runs through the novel.  You know something bad is going to happen and it does.  It makes it hard to put down the book.  (The proof is that we are have pizza delivered for dinner tonight.)Cal is an interesting character -- the small town jock who makes it big in the NFL and has to learn how to rebuild his life after a career - ending injury.  Something that bugged me about the story was the mysterious farm (not ranch) he owned.  It is so financially successful that he is able to pull out $200 000 from farm profits per year to pay his brother and sister, not including his share of the profits It was made very clear that this wasn't football money he had earned... Having lived in the west for most of my life, I have never come across any family farm this profitable that wasn't heavily involved with raising horses or cattle.  Given that we know that Cal spends a good part of his time driving up and down the highway, it would be nice to know what kind of magical farm this is.  Maybe Idaho is introducing the same cash crop that Colorado legalized.I liked the back-story about Cal which help balance his Mr. Perfect person.  There is a lot of great banter between Cal and Zoe.  One of my favorite scenes is where Cal ends up choking by how turned on he is by Zoe who tells him that everything she is wearing, including her underwear,  belongs to his mom.  Cognitive dissonance!I wanted to like Zoe more than I did.  Although she has a feisty attitude,  she was overly reserved and lacked confidence.  I wasn't a big fan of the relationship with her father where she seemed overly dependent for someone in her late 20's.So, this was an enjoyable read, but I can't imagine wanting to reread it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1NA85ACUS9FBG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SZ35DGU#wasThisHelpful","R1NA85ACUS9FBG","ALYI8YM90TPD1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ALYI8YM90TPD1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love stories about quirky characters. Penny Reid 's Neanderthal Seeks Human comes to mind.  The idea of having a hunky leading male with ADD and perhaps a learning disability was incredibly appealing.  Atticus Spenser, an FBI special agent, is a great hero.  Okay, I could have lived without the ""My bad"" and True that"" hackneyed slang.Dr. Caitlyn Cassidy comes with more baggage than Louis Button.  She was definitely intriguing, but I found the more I read, the less I liked her.Somehow I got the idea that this was a romantic suspense.  For those readers who only want banter, mostly one - sided,  this will be to your liking.  There is no inappropriate exchange of bodily fluids here.  If I just wanted suspense or crime, I would turn to someone like Lee Child or Michael Connelly.

"Since I am a huge fan of Rachel Grant's writing, I was more than willing to suspend my disbelief in order to go on a culturally inspired paranormal journey.A mask as the central character in the book was no problem.  My source of angst was that Sienna is much more the standard, insecure romance heroine than one of Ms. Grant's normal female leads.  Given that this was a short story to begin with, too much time was spent with Sienna worried about her body and why Rhys was with her.  I began to wonder that, too.Given what we know about the power of the mask, it makes Sienna even more bland.  In looking back over the events, we actually know very little about Sienna since she is not in charge for 98% of the book.Sad to say, but if  this was the first book I'd read by Rachel Grant, I wouldn't read another.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1G3G530WVOW2T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00U5E0V1O#wasThisHelpful","R1G3G530WVOW2T","ALYI8YM90TPD1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ALYI8YM90TPD1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Rachel Grant writes the literary equivalent of the best action movies you've ever watched.  Even better is the fact that her characters are all strong, intelligent people with suspense and romance that is off the charts.It is such a great treat to find an author who knows that romance readers actually have a brain.  I loved the idea that Lawrence of Arabia, the Syrian conflict and an innocuous filing cabinet could converge to create such a great read.I am always thrilled to go on whatever literary ride Ms. Grant is offering.

"Rachel Grant cooks up another winner with a hunky ex - SEAL and a sexy historian.""I think I just got harder with your use of the word whom in a sexual context.  Wait until you find out how else I can use my tongue in a sexual context.In addition to Grant's ability to write great steamy scenes, she always has a great story - line taken from real life.  Book 3 in the Evidence 3 features a gripping combo of Wiki-Leaks and Somalia.  The plot is great until the end.  Without going into spoiler territory, I would just that the weak link involving a secret that could ignite international hostilities would not be allowed to rest on the hope that things will be okay.This is still a great read.  I just wish that a better effort had been made to tie up all the loose ends.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RFMTN6R7FOX63/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IOC6FIW#wasThisHelpful","RFMTN6R7FOX63","ALYI8YM90TPD1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ALYI8YM90TPD1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Rachel Grant is one of those rare romance authors who can weave three dimensional characters and a lot of a steam into a fabulous, suspenseful plot.  To top it off, you don't have to surrender your IQ when reading her books.  Ms. Grant is clearly a smart cookie and treats the reader with intellectual respect.What a treat to have fresh story lines and strong female leads.  The men are alpha, but respectful and the woman have interesting jobs.  No TSTL heroines are allowed in a Grant novel.Imagine a great series where every book becomes your new favorite.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2D5NSEXD78JGW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TQ6BKMG#wasThisHelpful","R2D5NSEXD78JGW","ALYI8YM90TPD1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ALYI8YM90TPD1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""I underestimated the amount of pure stubborn pigheadedness running through her veins.  She passed out rather than admit she might actually be in the wrong.""  And there you have Josephine Maxwell to a T!  Josephine is not always an easy heroine to like and she certainly gives Marshall Hayes a run for his money.  Both characters were introduced in Book 1 of this series, HER SANCTUARY, and although this works as a stand-alone, I would advise you read them in order.There is a lot going on in this story.  Toni Anderson is one of the few romance authors who is able to deliver both steamy scenes and a fast moving plot.  This one involves a serial killer and art theft.There are two secondary characters, Vincent Brandt, the yummy former SEAL who is Josie's bodyguard and Steve Dancer, a brilliant, young FBI agent.  Both of these characters deserve their own novel.Advice to Vince:  ""Don't let her out of your sight until I get back tonight.""

"Serenity Woods has written a number of books that I enjoyed, but this wasn't one of them.  There are thousands of books that qualify as a quick, summer read.  They are not all worth five stars.  I haven't bashed the reviewers who left high ratings, and hope to be able to voice my opinion without getting a bunch of negative comments or non-helpful votes for voicing my opinion.  I wonder if the fact that the book was initially offered for free had an impact on reviewers rating it more easily.  The insta-love, insta-forgiveness doesn't merit 5 stars in my opinion.Garth and Chloe meet in a novel way, jumping out of an airplane.  Garth immediately falls in love while plummeting to the earth.  The potential for Garth to be a complex character was there -- war veteran held hostage for over a year and betrayed widower.  Come to think of it maybe he was a bit over the top in terms of his emotional baggage.  Toss in the whole billionaire aspect and he becomes even less believable.  Garth's behavior at the end of the book toward Nick is equally cringe-worthy.There was nothing to ""grab onto"" with Chloe.  I understand her concern about not wants to be like her bi-polar mother, but other than she smells like chocolate, I don't get what Garth sees in her.  The fact that Chloe blasts her mother with 25 years of verbal angst and then asks for a favor a few days later is also less than admirable.  Over a two week period, Chloe will have your head spinning at her back and forth romantic decisions -- or more accurately indecision.  ""This time, I was determined to go slow, and yet, after only days, I knew I loved him.""  Honestly, this was more exhausting than a two hour tennis match.Here's a sample of their typical dialogue:""Garth.  I'm serious.  You don't love me.  You can't.""  ""Are you telling me how to feel?""  ""I'm telling you your're mistaken.""  ""I'm not.  I love you, and I want to spend the rest of my life with you.""  ""Stop it.  That's ridiculous.""Chloe betrays Garth's confidence with two different people, including his mortal enemy.  Not sure this makes her a candidate for future bride of the year.  No wonder Garth says at one point, ""I can't believe I'm doing this.""  I'm with you Garth.  I couldn't believe you were doing it either.Serenity Woods has written much better books, so if you are new to her, don't start with this one. For all others, I would recommend you start by downloading a sample, with the understanding the first chapter is the most interesting and most believable.If you are still on the fence, maybe this will do it for you:""Love doesn't appear overnight, like... like mould on bread.  It develops and matures, like whisky or cheese.""  Enough said.  Literally.","2.0 out of 5 stars","May 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1R1AAOU89JWIK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AK3GTR0#wasThisHelpful","R1R1AAOU89JWIK","ALYI8YM90TPD1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ALYI8YM90TPD1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Although you could read this as a stand - alone, meeting Jake and Ellie first will help with the backstory.Josh is a yummy fireman who moves to Bluelick.  Melody has just spent 10 years engaged to a man only to discover that he wants to bat for the other team.This was a cute story, but almost too similar to the late 20's heroine needing to up her sexual game from Private Practice.

There is no TSTL heroine, billionaire, or 50 Shades wannabes to make you roll your eyes.Tyler and Ellie are both trying to come to terms with how their pasts impact their present lives.

"My big issue with this book is that it is trying to do too many things at the same time -- unfortunately none of them successfully.You can't label this a mystery since the author lobs clues the size of boulders about who is the bad guy.  There is a teeny attempt to muddy the waters early in the book, but with a villain the size of a great white shark, there is little suspense.For some reason, our hero Jake, is paired with another woman a couple of times early in the book with another woman.  This character serves to pique the heroine's curiosity and is instantly banished like the wannabe suspects.  The love between the two leading characters is of the insta/rapid cooking oats variety without the steam.There is just enough sex to annoy people who don't want any, but it is too stilted and quick for those who do.""Now, now!""  I want you in me, now."" is a frequent refrain from our heroine throughout the novel. Emily switches it up once with, ""Be in me now!  Ho hum..The dialogue is stilted.""Don't get puckish with me.  I just declared my love to you.""  PUCKISH??  Who talks like that anymore?""I feel something malevolent when I'm around him and I'm not a woo-woo woman!""  WOO-WOO??""Your fear is our greatest enemy.  We will defeat it.""  I felt a Winston Churchill vibe with this one.""Watch us become one.""  GAK!""Sometimes in a relationship, I've felt like a bird whose wings have been cut.  And all I can do is hop morosely on the bottom of the cage.""  Aaahhh, Now I get why Jake was instantly smitten.  The old morose bird analogy...I didn't mind the back story about the battle between cattle and buffalo ranchers.  It might have been more interesting if this became the focus of the story and the book morphed into a non-fiction analysis of the ranching problem (vaccination programs, bloodlines, western American history,  impact of wolf culls....)Definitely not a book I would reread.  I would suggest downloading a sample before purchasing.","2.0 out of 5 stars","May 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2HBA48PO6F06B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JF7ZF90#wasThisHelpful","R2HBA48PO6F06B","ALYI8YM90TPD1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ALYI8YM90TPD1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you have't read a book by Julianna Keyes, don't start here.  I absolutely adored her other books, but JUST ONCE has none of the great qualities evident in her other stories.Kate is an extremely odd heroine, difficult to relate to and hard to like.  Even the situation she finds herself in seems contrived.  Apparently highly successful, jet-setting travel writers who have their own trust funds are dying to find meaningful work supervising inexperienced waitresses and cleaning crews at a dude ranch.  I get that she was at a time where she was looking for a new start, but this doesn't seem realistic.  Yes, I'd much rather scoop up condoms and sling hash than lie on the beach and visit exotics locations.Her relationship with Shane is stilted.  There is a ten page description of him massaging a knot in her shoulder.  I had a knot in my shoulder by the time I was done reading that part.  30% into the book I was totally aggravated by Kate and felt I knew little about Shane.  Shane is not a very likable hero, so in that way, they are well suited.  Shane seems to have the unrealistic impression that by working on the multi-million dollar ranch long enough, that he will be able to save enough to buy it.  Not sure what the rate of pay is for cowboy/jack of all trades, but don't think this is a feasible ambition.Kate has an incredibly immature relationship with her high school nemesis, Cassidy.  Given that this is a decade after high school, both women end up looking foolish.  The secondary characters aren't any more compelling.We learn that Shane is extremely fond of nipple pinching, even when Kate doesn't appreciate it. ""Why don't you like this?"" he asks, twisting my nipples again, making me whimper.  ""It hurts.""  ""Does it?  This is nothing.'""  Are you kidding me?  Kick this guy to the curb!The whole mechanics of the ranch is confusing.  Imagine having to fill out a REQUISITION SLIP to get a live bat removed from a cabin.  What?We hear a lot about Kate's book.  It turns out that she documented working for a month in Vietnam as an unskilled laborer to build a school for the needy.  Her unedited JOURNALS were submitted to a publisher and were of course not only published, but became such a hit that she earned a lot of money off the royalties.  Does the trust fund baby donate the money to the people involved with this humanitarian project?  NO!  Again, what's to like about this woman?No spoilers, but if you can get through the ending without rolling your eyes, you are a stronger person than I am.TIME SERVED and GOING THE DISTANCE are great reads and do a much better job of showcasing Ms. Keyes' talents.  I worry that if people read this book first, they won't bother with her other novels.","2.0 out of 5 stars","May 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RWHMZXGK8V4GT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NO1397I#wasThisHelpful","RWHMZXGK8V4GT","ALYI8YM90TPD1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ALYI8YM90TPD1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"SEALS are known for their intelligence and alpha qualities.  Here we have a SEAL who has been interested in a girl and didn't notice she had been flirting with him for a YEAR!!  A self-described Man-Ho, we find out that he hasn't had sex in more than a year. Gee, wouldn't that have made it easier to pick up on the vibes she was tossing his way?Overhearing a conversation about her that she doesn't like, our heroine decides to show her sexual prowess by asking for a threesome.  This of course instantly morphs into our hero and heroine realizing how much they love each other.  I guess there's nothing like seeing the woman you've idolized for a year giving lip service to your best friend to cement those romantic feelings....It would be hard to describe the characters as more than one-dimensional and equally difficult to see the romance in this.Within a few hours, our hero can't believe how things just getting better between them.  What???  Sadly, within an hour he is stomping off to war in a snit because she had the nerve to ask if he would be faithful to her while he was overseas.  Hmmm.... maybe a couple hours after a threesome isn't the best time to try to talk about the whole monogamy issue.  His over the top ""our friendship has taught you nothing about me (he didn't let her know anything about himself during the course of their friendship).... everything that happened last night didn't make an impact on you..."" is trite.Luckily, a chopper load of SEALS off to a mission waits around for the twelve hour girlfriend to make amends.  Oooph!  I guess not all SEAL missions are time sensitive or that important.  Maybe it was a donut run.Maybe the witty dialogue will capture your fancy:""No getting up.""  ""I have to.""  ""I forbid it.""""You should go.""  Yeah, I really should.""  ""Go.""  ""Fine.""

"I think Kaylea Cross does an excellent job portraying the men and women in the different branches of the military. Readers can learn a lot about how the different forces operate.  Lethal Pursuit is no exception.The three star rating reflects the romance side of this novel.  Jackson and Maya had one unpleasant encounter in a previous book.  She sees him singing and then crawls into bed with him while he was sleeping.  It was one of the most awkward sex scenes ever.  I get that she is damaged, but why would those brief encounters make Jackson instantly smitten?I'm glad that others readers enjoyed the novel.

"If you are just discovering the wildly talented Julianna Keyes,  you are in for a huge treat.  She's a literary unicorn:  a romance author with who can create a plot with enough tension that you have to reminder yourself to breathe.  The steamy scenes are off the charts and the dialogue rings true.Anyone who has traveled alone will be able to empathize with Olivia teaching kindergarten in rural China.  Anyone who has had to kick-start their life after a traumatic event will see themselves in her.  Keyes does an incredible job of creating suspense by referring to the trauma without explaining it for about a third of the book.  What did this golden girl do that made her flee her home town?Out of loneliness, Olivia starts spending time with Jarek.  Now a construction worker who takes jobs around the world, his military past was all about searching for the truth.  He has spent his adult life building emotional walls only to be challenged by this kindergarten teacher in the process of rebuilding her own life. These are interesting, complex characters that make it almost impossible to put your ereader down.There are a number of amusing scenes where Jarek is trying to figure out how he ends up trying to please Olivia when such behavior is the antithesis of his normal style.  Watching him gradually open himself to the possibility of caring for someone else has him reeling like a concussed boxer.Ms. Keyes does a GREAT job of describing Olivia's experiences at school.  Imagine being responsible for creating a play about Red Riding Hood starring thirty students where the wolf can't be bad and Spidermen rule.I ended the book without being able to understand the behavior of Olivia's parents, but was too enamored of Olivia and Jarek to care.At the time of this writing Julianna Keyes has only three novels.  I suspect I will be rereading these books as I continue my search to find another author in this genre with the same literary chops.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RIAAE80DGX5FL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SDPK9R8#wasThisHelpful","RIAAE80DGX5FL","ALYI8YM90TPD1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ALYI8YM90TPD1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Readers who love erotic romance know that it is highly unusual to find everything you want in one book.  Sadly, sex and good writing don't often go together.  It seems as if many readers are satisfied with mediocre storylines and two-dimensional characters.  Preserve me from billionaire boyfriends, anything to do with amnesia and the dreaded ""I need to marry you to get my inheritance"".After a series of disappointing recent purchases,  I began rereading Anne Calhoun novels where interesting characters and steamy scenes are written with intelligence.Luckily, a reviewer who  loves Calhoun,  had given an enthusiastic response to Julianna Keyes.TIME SERVED is the real deal -- a great plot with enough heat to singe your eyebrows.  Rachel is a strong heroine worth cheering for.  Dean is an incredibly complex hero with enough emotional baggage to fill a 747.  The dialogue is realistic and there are is a great cast of secondary characters -- not the usual ""here are five hunks who will appear in upcoming novels"".  Even more amazing is that this book has a very engaging plot.This is the kind of novel where everything on your to-do list gets put aside for the day.

There are no billionaire boss or amnesia plots to cause your eyes to roll which is an added bonus.While McKenna ' s books are always on my reread list, this one was difficult to connect with.  It's not the mfm plot or my ovaries are humming that individually cause my reluctance, but the combination of the two in a twist that was just out of the limits I am willing to stretch my believability.Without giving away the ending, Noah was no longer a believable character and the future is awkward at best.It's not a bad book,  but if you haven't read McKenna before, I wouldn't start here.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1YKA6Z388MT11/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0049B32BK#wasThisHelpful","R1YKA6Z388MT11","ALYI8YM90TPD1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ALYI8YM90TPD1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I love Lyn Murray's books. This one is indeed a rich tapestry and a compendium of research, stories, images and historical documents that all serve as a meditation on the perplexing nature of time disturbance. This is a hefty volume, and it's easy to read on an e-reader, but you might want the print version because some of the documents are elaborate.My favorite are the narrative stories. Murray writes with tension and a convincing authority that put you right in the scene with her. She illustrates the confusion and wonder that comes with examining rips in time beautifully and to great effect.Some of the research within is disturbing. Why have stories of time travelers disappeared from news media reports? My second favorite section, after Murray's own accounts, was the section devoted to people who may have been time travelers, because that's fascinating to explore. There is also in-depth look into reports from a confessed time traveler that ended up feeling very reassuring about the fabric of time.

I'm delighted the second book is even better than the first Lawdon does a great job of expanding the universe and offering great details and developments to the franchise.A huge appeal is that after the initial foray into flying star fighters in the first book, Ly goes to the Star Fighter Academy. This focus on learning to fly is vicariously rewarding to us as readers, and I was happy to be along for the ride, and to have attention paid to fantastic space ships. Add in constant action with lots of great space battles, and our trusty main character who just keeps getting himself deeper and deeper in trouble, and you have a great pageturner!I loved the amped up pace, the increasing problems and how they are resolved, and the persistent threat of the evil Vultarians.

Since I don't have excess income to save, I need to work a budget to find it. Enter Clark's book. He thoughtfully walks readers through goal setting and budgeting in this guide that also serves as a workbook.Clark doesn't waste time. He gives specific instructions on how to set up your accounts (and he interestingly recommends setting up multiple actual accounts) if you are single and how to approach it if you are in a couple.

"You will not read another book like The Frycook's Revenge!  Deliciously inventive, wacky and wild, this narrative takes readers into the unhinged mind of Billy Bob and sort of shakes you like a dog might shake a rope toy. Think Tom Robbins meets Shark Tank, wrapped in a un-PC wonton wrapper of Ocean's Eleven. Billy Bob is one of those guys who always in on the lookout for the windfall he hopes will come from his next big idea, but he settles for running a con against his former employer. The blow-by-blow and quirky aftermath make for a hilarious tale.The story is stuffed with bizarre characters and details skewering small towns, small businesses and small minds. McClain delights in word play, puns, twisting narratives and a teasing storytelling style. It adds up to a great skewering of everything from Internet culture to consumer obsessions, and it's all a lot of fun. I wish I were as funny as McClain--but you don't want to end up on his bad side!","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1826ZE0ZSSZ9E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BH51QM8#wasThisHelpful","R1826ZE0ZSSZ9E","A2Q6FM9ZHGZ0G9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2Q6FM9ZHGZ0G9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've read a few of Slater's novels, and this one has been my favorite so far. I haven't encountered a storyline like this one, so that is a delight. Virginia's story is one of awakening from the dead zone into a full sensory aliveness through her experiences as she's invited along with a bevy of models for a special gathering with Mason Dixon. After that, it's truly one long sensory explosion after another, with Virginia trying new experiences and couplings, and all of it thoroughly described.I dare you to top the blindfold scene midway through the book. It's best in class. I also liked the dialogue where the women were getting to befriend each other as well as discuss their own artistry. There's a line in a scene where the women are mentoring Virginia where it's mentioned that she is learning how to be herself and someone else at the same time, and that truly describes the fun of roleplaying and performance that is a dominant theme through out. All together, Model Behavior is a keeper.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZXI2THAG3AMG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JSI2LWU#wasThisHelpful","RZXI2THAG3AMG","A2Q6FM9ZHGZ0G9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2Q6FM9ZHGZ0G9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Slater is a master of inventive scenes that breathe hot life into this erotic story. The genius in Binding Contract is first we meet a smart, beautiful, talented woman and then we are shown how whereas Cassie thought she was freely expressing her power through alter egos before, only under what is essentially a series of contracts and agreements (and riding crops and blindfolds, and and and) does she truly find freedom and herself. Her ability to reflect on  this transition and the freedom from the conflict of her thoughts that she eventually gives up adds the kind of depth to this erotic novel that really raises readers' own emotions and involvement.The descriptions are first rate and perfectly handled to be hot, intense and exciting. The pacing is perfect, teasing here, going full throttle there. Many of the scenes are unforgettable. A great story and hot erotic scenes. Well done, indeed.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2KMDL0KUPRJHB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00M5KS42E#wasThisHelpful","R2KMDL0KUPRJHB","A2Q6FM9ZHGZ0G9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2Q6FM9ZHGZ0G9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Beautiful! I recommend this book to seekers of any kind. It is a powerful distillation, offering gentle wisdom to be considered, and it is bringing a sense of connection and synchronicity to my life.In a series of chapter, various threads of guidance are imparted, each featuring anecdotes, quotes or illustrative stories. Each is summed up with a a rule that can be brought into your self-inquiry or medication, or re-read at a later time as a meditation or affirmation.I really needed to read the guidance on creating thoughts for good health and how to trust connections to the positive good around me.

"Intrigue, romance, friendship, conflict, revenge and sadistic personal plus exploitive cultural abuse--it's all in here in this layered historical romance. From the fast-paced beginning to the solid ending, I found Shiri to be an enjoyable read and a memorable adventure. I happen to have an affinity to Egypt as a setting, so this was a major plus for me.Shiri's character was also terrific. Through her experiences we see the devastation of colonialism, slavery and control.  I liked how Shiri had personal motivations for revenge as well as a mission in a broader sense related to freeing people from slavery. The characters seem real--appealing, flawed, and it's easy to be empathetic to their pain. I think the history is fairly broadly painted, but that was okay with me because the point is the story--the love and longing, the brutality endured, the vows of retribution.This is a great debut that got stronger as the narrative progressed, so I'm looking forward to more from this author.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R23XI0GMJNGJF0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EBB4S6G#wasThisHelpful","R23XI0GMJNGJF0","A2Q6FM9ZHGZ0G9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2Q6FM9ZHGZ0G9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Dark Promise is an excellent end to this fantastic tale. Lara and Trevor are further pushed to the brink, and of course it finally sinks in that it doesn't really matter where they try to escape to. There is no real escape. I loved seeing Lara's powers continue to grow under test and pressure. The passages about her pregnancy were so very good, and then the impact on Lara was immense. We already have seen the couple prove they would do anything for love, and now their family escalates that impulse even deeper because now that they are even more special and vulnerable, the demonic forces are amped up too.It was wonderful to see Gimpel elaborate on the myths and fairytales surrounding new motherhood, as these themes are the perfect fit for the Soul Storm series. What would you do to protect your beloved, and what would you do to protect you baby, who may have even stronger powers than you and your partner combined? Gimbel goes there, in dark and twisted ways, and you won't be able to predict the twists and turns (or as Lara might say, how magic has costs) but they will resonate with you.The ending is rich and complex, with Lara have a sustained reason to keep developing her powers. There is a solid conclusion and also an in-depth Epilogue to complete the structure of the story into the future. A great series full of wonderful characters with real relationships and terrifically inventive paranormal action.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3KX7L1K670T8M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SIIHQXK#wasThisHelpful","R3KX7L1K670T8M","A2Q6FM9ZHGZ0G9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2Q6FM9ZHGZ0G9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a smart, targeted guide to help health care or personal care businesses quickly master marketing and client-base communication in the digital era. The information is specifically targeted for local businesses who perform care services for individuals, though the expertise could be applied to other businesses with similar needs to define their practice and communicate it via a website, social media, and direct communication with a client list. It's really not an option any longer to avoid these parts of running a business,and the benefits of doing it well are lucrative and unmatched in defining your brand.I really enjoyed reading the strategic thinking that guides this information about first building a web presence and then leveraging that presence to communicate and market. The author explains in easy-to-grasp language how to think through choices, and then shows precisely how to implement a plan, down to the nitty gritty of how various platforms, tools and resources work. I feel smarter and empowered to know what to do and when to do it going forward.The book itself is really well-organized with lots of sub-chapters to organize the steps and the information, and with a detailed, hyper-linked table of contents so that you can find info fast. This means that after you read it cover to cover it will serve as a reference book to keep handy, and I really appreciate that. In all, a great guide to an essential top for all local practitioners.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RGPC5LYHRISVG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N5JBY76#wasThisHelpful","RGPC5LYHRISVG","A2Q6FM9ZHGZ0G9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2Q6FM9ZHGZ0G9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Invest Like a Millionaire is a great, well-written guide that distills tons of investment information into easy-to-understand advice you can act upon. It's written in a very friendly, even-handed style. The content starts with basic concepts and then increases in complexity bit by bit in organized chapters. The author gave me the feeling that he was right there with me, anticipating my next question and guiding my decision-making about the right investment choices.I liked the emphasis on gaining a thorough awareness of risk, work and reward that is possible with various vehicles, and I really appreciated the many tricks and secrets that can be especially helpful to those of us who weren't raised with many moneyed advisers around us or who didn't study finance in school. I'm self-educated on these topics, so it's great to have an insider's guide on pitfalls and strategies I need for avoiding fees, hidden costs, tax implications of various choices, and other key topics covered.You have to be informed, even about set-it-and-forget-it funds, and this book is the right size: smart but boiled down so that it's actionable and approachable.

"This book is a wild ride fueled by psychological and sexual obsession, and it's several steps above the norm. Its larger than life, bold and daring, pushing the boundaries in the erotic thriller genre just as it pushes the boundaries of the lead characters.The narrative is told in alternating first person accounts, which means we truly get inside the heads and emotions of Alexander and Elena, both of whom know themselves very well and are detailed observers, so that builds connections for readers. The author does an incredible job of keeping the voices of the two characters distinct. Alexander is hard, discerning and commanding, while Elena knows that submission and the ability to forgive is a sign of strength. Their interactions are smart and it's easy to understand the hooks they place into each other. The sex scenes are intense and perfectly executed, as are the other highly eroticized, luxury experiences.It's the pacing that carries the whole novel well, building to a fever pitch place of no return. There's a lot to enjoy in this dense story of pain, replenishment, captivity, submission and the ultimate intrigue of obsession.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2YU3DGCEWGBII/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RNLA82O#wasThisHelpful","R2YU3DGCEWGBII","A2Q6FM9ZHGZ0G9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2Q6FM9ZHGZ0G9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Intern Training expertly teases and seduces as it puts you inside the mind of the beautiful lead character, Tara as she encounters increasing tasks that require naked submission. Confused, vulnerable and conflicted, she none-the-less is drawn to the sexual requirements demanded of her by powerful Jacob Henry, and is equally enticed by the inherently controlling world of advertising and the other model-beauties she encounters.Things escalate when Tara moves into his home and meets his wife. Together the couple seduce and train Tara in all sorts of sexual pleasures, including her first time touching another woman. The Cinderella aspects of the story, full of gifts and grand gestures, is fun and appealing, and the scenes with Tara and Genevieve as well as the trio are inventive, highly descriptive and pitch perfect. Jacob is up for the task of teasing, training and satisfying the secret desires of both women.Most importantly, the descriptions of everything from their bodies to sexual exchanges to pain practices was very well done, putting you right in the scene, and it's all paced incredibly well.

"Pleasure Bound achieves all of my objectives in an erotic novel. This book is centered on intriguing characters who are well defined, with a good story that advances with an engaging plot, and full of well paced erotic scenes. Erica is a young widow whose sexuality had been primarily most successful in fantasy's and self pleasure. She pledges to finally experience life and explore her fantasies, attraction to exhibitionism, and deepest desire, and the answer to her needs is found in Johnson James, the hot and intense brother of her late husband.Set against the backdrop of Key West, Johnson takes control with seduction and with an awareness of power and submission. Because the author has done such a good job of creating realistic characters we see all of Erica's emotions, from vulnerability to fear to discovery to pleasure, and we are right along with her as she lives out her fantasies of exhibitionism and submission, as well as seeing the impact of her allure and her training on Johnson.The themes and practices of sub/dom relationships and bondage are authentic, respectful and incredibly, unabashedly hot.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R205YQTS2PP16A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LWPCCYE#wasThisHelpful","R205YQTS2PP16A","A2Q6FM9ZHGZ0G9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2Q6FM9ZHGZ0G9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Sacha is a moving ending to this thoughtful and challenging series. It definitely went in an unexpected and intriguing direction, and I was glad to have a new generation to meet and learn from in this brilliant family. It's interesting to think about the evolution of understanding on this micro level, and to imagine how the developing conscious awareness and spirituality of a parent could lead to a child who could take that expansion further still, and how all generations would communicate with and guide each other. Sacha is prepared for limitlessness, and he is gifted beyond expectation.It feels as though Law's writing and this trilogy similarly prepares a curious reader to gain knowledge and awareness of world religions, spiritual journeys, matters of consciousness and metaphysical realms. Nothing could have prepared me for the rousing conclusion, though that's what made Sacha all the more rewarding. I highly recommend readers start from Book 1 and read in order. The stories work independently, but the layers of growth and understanding build one upon each other towards a memorable conclusion.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2IUAMWJOI4GX7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005HK2KY2#wasThisHelpful","R2IUAMWJOI4GX7","A2Q6FM9ZHGZ0G9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2Q6FM9ZHGZ0G9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I loved visiting the dark justice of Celestine's world in Redford's terrific, twisted novel. Celestine carries burdens and gifts with her through her days in 1940s New Orleans. She is rightfully angry about the murder of her mother in a race-related incident, and she vows revenge. She is gifted with unusual power rituals from her grandmother's lineage as a practitioner of the dark arts. She is also gorgeous and seductive. Oh, and she has a mean steel blade.  Put those qualities together and you have an undeniable serial killer.The plot is a page turner, mostly to see what Celestine will do next. Will she get caught? Will love safe her from herself? Will her head games when she in under investigate be her undoing? It's all in there and more. I loved the writing, which was full of juicy action and adventure, erotic descriptions of Celestine's seductions, and vivid presentations of her killings, as well as French phrases beautifully woven throughout. I also appreciated the sense of place imparted, because the bayou is a fascinating place.But most of all, I loved this unconventional character, with all too many reasons to develop this misandric hobby, and though she does horrible things, I still found myself somehow cheering her on, and that's a credit to the complexity of the narrative. What's more, I now want a Conjuring Room of my own.

"If you are ready to commit to paying down debt, this is a smart and thorough guide that will give you a systematic approach to getting free from the debt trap.I really appreciated the how the author comes with personal experience about being swallowed by debt and provides concrete examples of how she got there and what she changed to get out. That personal experience is then augmented with research and information to educate readers about the pitfalls and reality of debt economically and psychologically. Then the book moves into really useful strategies guided by an overall call-to-action that prompts you to commit and follow through on everything from new budgets to strategies for managing the old debt. At the end of each chapter there are homework questions to either prompt self examination or action--serious action. I have a lot of anxiety and denial about this stuff, and the homework helped me get all the details of my various debts onto paper which made it approachable.Clear and easy-to-understand, and very importantly for me, non-intimidating (I have enough bad feelings about my student-acquired debt and how that sets me up for more debt), Moore's book is a winner.

"This is a gem of book, a great story in the hands of a superior writer. Two intertwining mysteries snake through heart of this nuanced take of rural Gulf Coast life. A Sheriff investigates the death of a man held in jail overnight and also investigates, through memory and relationships, his own past -- including the life of his father, who also served in law enforcement. The result is literary fiction that relies on and transcends the mystery genre, replacing what we think we know about how things work with a true-to-life character and a study of how things really are.Carefully observed details illustrate a host of characters, a distinctive place and traditional Gulf Coast Florida life. Dietrich has an obvious affection for and facility with the language and stories of the windswept construction workers, fisherman, sheriff deputies, drunks et al -- good ol' boys who learn to fish, hunt and skin a squirrel as part and parcel of becoming a man. He captures a slice of life and conveys a sense of place with able, affecting prose that is in equal measure moving and engaging, with great country sayings and a dry wit in many of the conversations. So many bits stay with me, and most of them were small things carefully observed, like how a woman might woo a grief-stricken family with food but not get the rice right because she rinses hers, but the departed did not. Just fantastic, the meaning in that space between the rice and the way Dietrich weaves in such observations and motifs.The story is integral to this, showing how people are all known and not known to each other, and to themselves, and how they handle grief, duty, denial and disruption. There's a lot in this novel to recommend and I really enjoyed the time I spent in Dietrich's world.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2PVULG9GZ4CGA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SCE17YO#wasThisHelpful","R2PVULG9GZ4CGA","A2Q6FM9ZHGZ0G9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2Q6FM9ZHGZ0G9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Compelling layers of stories and reports weave a dark and mysterious narrative in The Tuck. Murray is a master of suspenseful storytelling and reportage, weaving together story, research, first-hand reports and data all on the topic of experiences with unknown large monsters/animals in the woods. When I lived outside Seattle these stories were not uncommon and always told with a bit of trepidation but a lot of conviction. What is behind the enduring nature of these legends?Murray explores the topic with an open-mind so that readers can drawn their own conclusions, or add this to their own piles of anecdotal research, or just enjoy this cultural fascination. Much of this content was new to me. i had no idea we had President with a Sasquatch-type sighting, so that part of the book was incredibly interesting. The first hand reports were fascinating to consider from a logical point of view, and from a paranormal one as well.This collection has fun material for Big Foot fanatics, too, including some puzzles and artwork. The best part, though, is the titled tale, wherein a narrator tells a campfire-like suspenseful tale of an encounter that offers a paranormal take on the Big Foot phenomenon. It's well told with just the right amount of tension, humor and lots of imagination. In all, a rewarding collection for anyone fascinated with reports of spooky monsters in the woods.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RC80RPPE4X5D8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EK57WF2#wasThisHelpful","RC80RPPE4X5D8","A2Q6FM9ZHGZ0G9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2Q6FM9ZHGZ0G9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Murray has a fine hand with complicated and disturbing paranormal content, and this collection is unsettling and chilling! I have never heard of the BEK phenomenon before, so the hair on the nape of my neck is suitably raised, and Murray is to blame because she's such a skillful writer, bringing the worst imaginings to life with her perfect prose and really clever way of pacing with both urgency and elaborate detail everything from first-hand stories to case studies and research. She's really in command with these tales, like a reporter from the dark side of the paranormal mind.This book is a collection of stories about BEK experiences and other related topics. I am very intrigued with the way the concept of alien hybrid babies was discussed, though it is deeply disturbing stuff. The collection also goes deeply into many aspects of the New World Order theories that might have relevance. Murray's elaborations are compelling and give insight into what these stories might mean to all of us, past, present and future, even if we can't discern what BEK's really are or what people's visions of them represent.This book has a lot of diverse content that is well presented and accompanied by haunting image renditions of BEKs.

"If you are in the mood for a sexy, lush romp with intriguing characters leading fabulous lives, this is a great contemporary adult romance that will deliver a hot, satisfying escape. Chemistry explodes between a Renaissance man just home and recreating his life after being a UN Peacekeeper  (JD) and a beautiful seductress (Melanie) who lives in the high fashion world. They have an obvious powerful attraction, but plenty is in the way. Their timing is off, and I liked it that the author has the empowered female character being the one who wants to move faster. There are betrayals and broken places to heal, and then there's the matter of JD's crazy parents who are stuck in a horrible marriage--making them a sort of reverse romance where you are rooting for them to break up and leave JD alone!What's terrific about this novel is the characters are absolutely realistic and then they are put in uber glamorous locations, surrounded by art and fine dining with all the world as a playground. We get insider peeks into high fashion life in NYC as well as into the goals of JD's admirable work. This takes all of the seduction up several notches as we are taken along this glamorous ride in a believable way. And even better, the hot scenes are super well written, steamy and satisfying.

The humor arises from the biting dialogue, which is really clever, believable, and adds depth to the characters. For example, one character called her ex 'Spot"" in reference to his complexion and his doggish behavior, and funny details like that are liberally sprinkled in to the scenes. Josephine is a great character, an aging wizard who just wants to retire. She's fantastic and if she were my aunt I'd be thrilled to visit her in Siesta Key, even though trouble follows her, or rather calls on her, as she is required by the government to assist in the solving of crimes based on her keen abilities to read energy in a room or off of a victim, much like a forensic scientist reads physical evidence. Really cool concept that is well executed throughout.Another strength in the story is the creation of the world of wizards, with all of their powers, limitations, strength and vulnerabilities. O'Riley has done a great job of invoking complex rules of how a world that somewhat accepted these powers would try to use and control them, and having Josephine up against all of that as she tries to solve a serial murder case is excellent. It's all very well done, unfolds visually like a rewarding movie, and readers will be satisfied with the way it crosses many genres.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3JI2RP46Y7W60/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00B84JEVS#wasThisHelpful","R3JI2RP46Y7W60","A2Q6FM9ZHGZ0G9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2Q6FM9ZHGZ0G9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This companion to Station Eleven offers a lot of smart analysis that added depth to my understand of St.John Mandel's novel. I read a lot of apocalyptic genre fiction, so I knew I'd love Station Eleven from that point of view. Since the book hit so many ""Best Of 2014"" lists I wanted to better understand why this book broke out of its genre to become respected in all literary corners. This summary and analysis provided those answers.The analysis helped me look deeper into things like character names (I did not pick up on the connections before reading this Book Sense companion reader) and the reason for the repeating motifs of airplanes. This companion reader turned out to be a really helpful way to add to your understanding, do research on the book or prepare to discuss the book after reading it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ZYR19BKA3LO0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RSMLQQK#wasThisHelpful","R1ZYR19BKA3LO0","A2Q6FM9ZHGZ0G9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2Q6FM9ZHGZ0G9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've spent the last few days putting the tips and practices outlined in this book to work, and it's a whole new me. The Cleanup Artist is full of really useful advice to help turn those of us who didn't get the cleaning and organizing gene into adults who can create and maintain a nice home. Best of all, the author's tone in a great combination of inspirational, expert and non-judgmental. This is reflected in the great organization of the book and the easy to understand (and then find again when you want to refer to it) presentation of how-to advice and guidance.The book gives specifics for tools, for how to prepare to clean, and for products to choose across budget lines and with family safety in mind. I really appreciated the safety angle, as an awareness of allergens and chemicals in important to my family. Similarly, as a parent I loved the discussion of age-appropriate chores! The room-to-room guides is the info I'm really putting to use, and I'm finding it smart and easy to remember because it is all so detailed and well-described.This guide is helping me meet my goal of a cleaner, more welcoming home that doesn't put me into a panic at the thought of a friend knocking on my door, so I can recommend it to anyone looking for strategies, tips, ideas and best practices in household happiness.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R23TUH4OSJ9CPX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QORIUVO#wasThisHelpful","R23TUH4OSJ9CPX","A2Q6FM9ZHGZ0G9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2Q6FM9ZHGZ0G9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Rightful Owner is an excellent whodunit worthy of Agatha Christie -- though I'm not sure I can picture Dame Agatha in a Cambridge area swingers club!  Martin skillfully unwinds a page-turning procedural for a murder that happens while couples are swapping partners at an exclusive gathering, and it turns out to be a brilliant backdrop for secrets, lies, and mayhem of all sorts. The crimes get worse before all is solved, and this makes for a riveting plot.What is exceptional about this novel is that Martin shows the story from all points of view. We have a detective team to follow, and they are great characters in a complicated relationships of their own. We got to know the thoughts, and reluctance to swing, of the murder victim from her point of view, and throughout the procedural part of the novel we saw various convos between the party goers from their points of view. Telling this story in this way made it all the more tantalizing, because we weren't only privy to what the detectives knew, and we often knew when suspects were lying to each other and in the investigation.It all came together fabulously at the end, well-paced and smartly done, and it's possible to solve the mystery with all of the facts present but not everyone will because it's juicy and layered with secret agendas. Nothing is more rewarding than that!","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RF4VVISQ6EOWI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Q2ZC8AM#wasThisHelpful","RF4VVISQ6EOWI","A2Q6FM9ZHGZ0G9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2Q6FM9ZHGZ0G9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a great story from a promising new writer on the scene. Mercenary gave me everything I look for in an epic fantasy. First, the characters were full portraits of dimensional beings speaking good dialogue, and this hooked me into the story. Secondly, the action has to be compelling and exciting, and Kiln delivers very well. The book is broken down into more than 50 chapters, each moving the story along brilliantly. The universe is tight and fully realized, so it wasn't long before I could turn myself over to the writing and just escape into the world. And third, I look for books that have a good story that is elevated somehow through themes or uniqueness. I really likes how Kiln has presented this hero's journey and showed the growth of his caring for Princess, and I liked how both sides of the loyalty coin were explored, because that is something we don't always think about in wars or power struggles--that each side has its own definition of what it means to be honorable.In all, a great book to jump into. I really admire his writing, which has an ease in everything from describing action to the foreboding feeling of evil to the little details, like an egg and crumpet breakfast, that really put you there in the book. Looking forward to more from this author!","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1BSPFFT5KN0MF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Q6USH58#wasThisHelpful","R1BSPFFT5KN0MF","A2Q6FM9ZHGZ0G9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2Q6FM9ZHGZ0G9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"With an exacting and poetic layering of concepts and observations, the author explores some of James Hillman's concepts as applied to her personal experiences with fencing in the farm and cattle land of the plains. This jogged so many entry points for me in integrating the necessary framework of psychologizing into the American journey and to understanding where we have faltered or been deluded, and this is particularly useful to my ongoing research as well as having applicability to many fields. ""Why does our ego feel defended by fences"" and how have we inherited both the yearnings and the pathologies of the nation's ""settlers"" psychologically AND formalized in land use policy are concepts and question raised in this essay that will stay with me for a long time.And as the author further guides by example, this externalization yields understanding when turned inward as well. Where have I drilled down fence posts? What deer and bison (as representative of fantasies, dreams, and true wild nature) am I keeping out and at what cost. Beautiful, smart writing like Paton's is a sure pathway into connections and discoveries, and Living on the Land: The Earth Itself rich and resonant inspiration.In both a gained understanding of what we've done to our land and national psyche with Manifest Destiny to an evocation of my own relationship with fencing internally and externally, I am ultimately comforted in the author's reminder that true progress is not a linear function, because remembering that allows space and hope that we can make corrections and change. The book itself is flawlessly presented with lovely photographs adding to the messages. In all, I highly recommend this book as specific research and as an important mind-opening letter in consideration of how our land's divisions reflect and affect us.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1I2F68WKPKMAZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PMIVA6S#wasThisHelpful","R1I2F68WKPKMAZ","A2Q6FM9ZHGZ0G9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2Q6FM9ZHGZ0G9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I read The Goldfinch last year, and needed to brush up on the themes to see if there are examples I can use in an essay I'm writing. This Sidekick publication was just what I needed. It offers a thorough chapter-by-chapter summary plus really thoughtful analyses of themes, symbols, characters and motifs. This made it easy to brush up on what I had read while also expanding my understanding and appreciation of Tartt's novel. I had missed, for example, the importance of ships as a motif entirely, and I had a lot of questions about the order of events in Amsterdam with Boris that this Sidekick was able to address.If you need an easy-to-comprehend resource to help you increase your understanding of The Goldfinch as a student, book groups or engaged readers, this guide is a great solution.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R5AKPLG4XKB1R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LT8D3HO#wasThisHelpful","R5AKPLG4XKB1R","A2Q6FM9ZHGZ0G9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2Q6FM9ZHGZ0G9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a smart, well-written and incredibly well-researched look at religion, at the questions, logic and fallacies surrounding various belief systems and at the role religious beliefs and organized religion play in shaping (and manipulating) society. I am personally committed to rigorous engagement on these topics, because I think we all need to be able to do three things: understand our own ethics, understand the choices/beliefs/actions of others even when they arise from a different framework from ours, and maybe most importantly, talk with others about these topics. This book helps with all three. It will challenge you with a rich array of thought leadership from the ancients to contemporary thought to help you shed misconceptions and to find your own truth, will help you understand the framework of the religious maybe even better than they understand it themselves, and will arm you with the info you need to have intellectual and useful conversations with religious believers, atheists, and those in between.The book is organized well to serve first as a cover-to-cover read and then to serve as a reference book where you can look up various thought leaders, logic arguments, and religions which are broken down in chapters to explain the history, tenets and impact, including the ""dark side"" of each.  I learned plenty of new information (for example I thought I knew Ghandi's story but it turns out I didn't) as well as finding lots of aha moments where the author very aptly described feelings or assessments I was having but didn't know how to express about some aspects of Christianity, Buddhism and Islam. There's much more.This book is a celebration of thinking, ethics and morality that is rooted in truth, not in blindly assuming religious thinking that is offered to you. I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a good way to understand the history of religious thought, the logic people try to use to defend it, and the many alternatives for ethical thinking that are possible.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2JW94128DWXJM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QMXL6ZW#wasThisHelpful","R2JW94128DWXJM","A2Q6FM9ZHGZ0G9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2Q6FM9ZHGZ0G9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book is a balm and a treasure. I find it necessary to have thoughtful guidance on my path toward individual growth and towards a more humane society, and The Rainbow Bridge offers just the kind of guidance I need: smart, deeply compassionate, embracing of all people and possibilities, open-hearted, centered on kindness (to ourselves and others). The author deftly is challenging and supportive in just the right measures. This is a volume to turn to again and again.In the first part of the book, Hunter defines the concept of Rainbow Bridges and the phenomenon and yearning for connection that carries it forward.  The second part delves into an exploration of the principles of the concept, making connections between various other religious and philosophical teachings to show the cross-cultural universality of the principles. I really loved how the ideas are presented so beautifully and easy to understand, making the material broadly accessible and making it a model of the very open, friendly connectedness it teaches. There are 60 sections that can easily serve as daily thought meditations individually after you have finished reading the entire book. The concepts at the end of Part II are necessary reading and felt truly supportive of seekers and had direct relevance to my individual path.  Part III focuses on cultivating inner peace and contains excellent meditation instruction along with other tools for mindfulness and an integration of the concept of The Rainbow Bridge, and then the book supports and challenges readers with an in-depth analysis of how we can share that inner peace outward by building a human-centered society and world politically, economically and culturally. It's rare to find an author who can first of all make all of these connections, and secondly share it all so eloquently with readers. I left the book feeling wiser, centered, purposeful and empowered.There's much more, including inspiring quotes, resources and specific examples. In all, I am struck by the way The Rainbow Bridge synthesizes important universal principles and puts handles on them so that are easy to grasp and integrate. This is an essential read and is most definitely one to share, creating bridges of wisdom with the recipients!","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1HMUBG0LG0YD2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JFO5JC6#wasThisHelpful","R1HMUBG0LG0YD2","A2Q6FM9ZHGZ0G9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2Q6FM9ZHGZ0G9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Wow. This is a book, a series actually, that you want to press into your friends' hands and compel them to read it. The Aquarius Trilogy uses storytelling to weave together a stunning inquiry and answer to what our society is experiencing, and imbues the story with the richness of eons of myths, religion and philosophy. On just a storytelling level it works as a novel with twists and turns, disaster, rebirth and triumph visited on our beloved characters. Beyond that it functions as a philosophical gift. Are we moving forward or backwards? Are we evolving, devolving, or circling to a realm we don't yet comprehend? These themes run through OLYMPUS along with so much more in a text so rich each reader is bound to have their own experiences with what stands out the most and with what is most resonant. In short, it's a love story between people and with all of humanity, with all the ups and downs inherent in that which is alive.I would love everyone to read this smart, fabulous series.

"If you are already addicted to grant Reed's super witty and clever cross-genre mysteries, you will not be disappointed in Something Stinks. If you ARE a newbie, dive in, you have found a good series and author! This book stands on its own and you can then move towards others by Reed. Fair warning: he brings his universe so brilliantly to life that you'll end up wanting a robot that cleans and a smart talking dragon of your own.I love both the big, overarching story, which is packed with twists and action, and the small moments that add fun, and dimension and are a hallmark of a great storyteller. For example, noting that Merle the dragon would need slits in his prison garb for his wings. Or describing in just a few sentences how a letter from a long-lost love interest who views herself as your sister because you had the same teachers in learning to protect this realm would feel. So many good choices and great dialogue make this series a great binge-reading choice with just the right blend of darkness and wackiness.

"After reading this beautiful exploration of the author's deep connections to the places around her, I feel inspired and moved to conduct my own examinations of the places I have lived and the connections they have formed internally and collectively. Paton's writing is lovely, at turns lyrical and also rigorously informed major thought leaders across many ecological, cultural, linguistic, rhetorical and psychological disciplines. I was enlightened by her specific attention to the archetypes and histories of the Great Plains, which have universal connections to our conception of the most compelling of American archetypes, so as I traveled along with her I was able to interrogate my relationship with (or selective memory of) what it means to be shaped by the mythos of pioneers and Manifest Destiny Her discussions about everything from land and space to weather to the archetypes spawned by our relationship with land were so provocative I was further inspired to apply the same questions to my homeland of Florida, which is rich with history, space, similar weather-related destruction, and now a particularly American imagination.This is great writing that educates, illuminates, provokes and inspires. I highly encourage you to engage with the text whether as research about the archetypal power and resonance of place, as a specific look at the soul of the plains of North America, and/or as a prompt to your own engagement with the land that shaped and continues to shape you.

"A NutriBullet is a commitment to a new way of preparing nutrition, so this guide is a really well done bridge to help people previously used to blenders truly know how to put the NutriBullet's extra abilities to pulverize to work. This book has great recipes that are drool-worthy and get you to start planning the next day's smoothie after you finish each one! The best part, as far as the organization of the book, is that the smoothies are ranked for beginning users to help kids and non-green-smoothie types get used to benefits of our new habit (like how to hide spinach in a berry smoothie) while scaling up towards less-sweet smoothies along the way. This is great for me as a parent, and also useful for me as smoothies are a new commitment to healthy eating for me as well. This added editor's guidance sets this book apart, and it's a huge bonus.The central success, though, is the recipes, and all are appealing and balanced, usually offer possible variations, and all contain detailed nutritional value information.

"Really useful guide to the best movies with lesbian characters and themes. Each listing includes a plot summary and some details, like date of release, stars, writers and director. It's a blast to thumb through remembering oldies (Go Fish) and finding new ones (like I've never heard of Mango Kiss, and now I need to see it because the synopsis pulled me in.) The rankings seem right on to me -- of course each person might want to shift some around based on personal preference, but that's half the fun of having rankings. I could argue with myself for a bit about whether to rank Aimee and Jaguar above or below Foxfire, for example. I can see this list settling plenty of debates!

"Wow, what a harrowing and hopeful tale. I'm a big fan of Samantha Johns' writing, having loved all 3 books in her ""Repentant Demon"" trilogy, so I trusted I would find similar high-level plotting, story and character development in Finding Jayda. I was richly rewarded! The writing soars, and the character of Jayda is a winning, well-defined woman we come to relate to, root for and suffer with throughout the novel. Along the way there are great scenes including romance, courtroom drama, and relationship and family drama.Her journey is a punishing one, and it wasn't long into it before I was wishing miracles upon poor Jayda. The author shows us is many small ways what it is like for a person to live with PTSD and to operate on the survival level while praying for more. I liked it that Jayda struggled because I really related to it, and it made her redemption so emotional. She fell into a shallow relationship without feeling truly connected to that man, but he had a profound impact on her life nonetheless.Her self awareness and attempt to take care of her self added even more danger to herself. I see her as a heroine, trying hard to rid her life of snakes while finding her spirit and her way to grace and miracles. That's the real ""finding"" in the title, and it had me cheering loudly, even if I had to gasp and worry here and there along the way.

"Witty paranormal detective work featuring two acid-tongued bickering vampires and a cool female protagonist as the Normal? Yes, I'm in! What's better than finding Vol 1 of a clever new series?  I'm really looking forward to exploring more of West's writing.I loved the humor, and the dialogue that really sings --and sometimes stings--between Frederik and Ebenezer. The story is strong, providing complete escape and a solid mystery as its base. The details are what elevated the story for me, too, like the funny, dry conversations in a morgue about how people all to often assign fangs to the wrong teeth. Very fun new writing to enjoy, I highly recommend.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R21R5X9SYK3O95/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00R1LA6D2#wasThisHelpful","R21R5X9SYK3O95","A2Q6FM9ZHGZ0G9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2Q6FM9ZHGZ0G9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"What brilliance this is. I'm a longtime fan of Stan's writing, and it's nearly impossible to find comparable smart, curious, insightful and imaginative writing on his level. In The Gate he turns his formidable mind and keen vocabulary on a heartfelt and sensitive subject that suits his philosophies very well. How do we construct a life with love? How do we teach ourselves how to die?I knew I'd find his typical brilliant wisdom on everything from how time unfolds to how faith, loyalty, love, distractions and our self concept affects the way we live. But I was delighted to find even more in The Gate, including interesting characters (my favorite was Father Mulligan) and the humor that was brought to bear by the many observations of human behavior in the chapters (like the absurdness of a physiotherapist screaming at a circle of dementia patients to return the ball.)Most importantly, the book does something I've never experienced before in moving from very self aware memoir towards an awareness of the dementia/dying processes, and then to a lack of awareness of them. Achingly beautiful and so very human in the best ways, I highly recommend The Gate.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R12Q6SR60XWM1Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004CRTDWS#wasThisHelpful","R12Q6SR60XWM1Y","A2Q6FM9ZHGZ0G9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2Q6FM9ZHGZ0G9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Brilliant! I love everything about this book, from the concept to the execution to the characters. Alex, a girl, is adrift in a new realm, putting her on a heroic journey, which is terrific on it's own given that good female leading roles in adventure and battle books are so preciously rare. She comes to learn that what will save her is harnessing her smart brain, and that unlike the common assumption that math, science and adventure are not girl things, she will be taught to focus on the magic of math.Modeling a great student-teacher relationship, the great Archimedes guides her, assuring her that math is not something she can cordon off or that one needs to be a STEM genius to master- ""Math is everywhere and everything involves it.""  Math and science equal magic, and this concept played out alongside myth, mystery -- plus tribal council and hierarchical politics -- creates a compelling read. Overall, n this new alternative world, themes of the role of destiny, power, emotions,  rebellion, dreams and self direction are presented in a rich, satisfying way.I loved the language in the book, too--war stories can be hard to write and this strikes a nice balance of strategy, procedure and vivid battle scenes. We have a real sense of the high stakes through the characters. In all a great read that will leave YA fans ready for more.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R131V0PTG1YEBR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00P2783FK#wasThisHelpful","R131V0PTG1YEBR","A2Q6FM9ZHGZ0G9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2Q6FM9ZHGZ0G9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book is full of love and positive Celestine light. It functions beautifully on more than one level. On the page-turner level, it is a well-described story told through Lazarus' eyes as he grapples with the events of his death, his awakening knowledge of an expansive, layered reality and his new 2,000 year mission which is necessary to provide stewardship to a world under disease, attack and decline.The writing is clear and vivid, both opening doors in readers' imaginations and making heady concepts accessible at the same time. The author definitely kept me intrigued and wanting to understand the realms, ideas and missions Lazarus was describing and that the Tazkuvel is tasked with delivering.If you are interested in a mind-blowing conceptual guide to the powerful destiny of Miriam and the power of Celestine Light, this is the book for you. I found many words to focus on, including: It is in times of greatest challenge that the true person of light and power can emerge from within the shell in which they are usually held by every day life.""

"This tale soars in every way. First and foremost the story is solid, with a lot of tension and high stakes as Max finds ways to understand the worlds he, as the previously hidden son of Merlin, is thrown into as he meets the heavy challenge of saving Earth and enduring peace for Camelot. The adventure unfolds chapter by chapter and can work for independent readers or as a nightly family or school read along introducing readers to this interpretation and elevation of the great myths, many heroes, legends and a host of mythical creatures. The alternative universe is complex, with readers holding onto various realms, portals, magical principles, heavens and realities, and the clear writing and dialogue makes it all accessible and delightful.The characters are affecting and believable, and I liked it than in addition to Max there is an additional strong female heroine in Trudesile who has a really satisfying mystery surrounding her mission/identity in the adventure that is ultimately revealed.Readers can select this book with confidence that they'll have a fun, engaging adventure based on the excitement of restoring peace and preventing worlds from being devoured along with some of literature's great heroes. and overall witness a thematic celebration of the force of imagination in our lives, so this tale is a true winner in every way.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RUR3TZ9ZAC1EQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NF3DKPG#wasThisHelpful","RUR3TZ9ZAC1EQ","A2Q6FM9ZHGZ0G9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2Q6FM9ZHGZ0G9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm finding this to be a solid, thorough resource to have on hand when trying to study or research the Greeks. Key schools of thought are distilled to basic thought leaders and tenets and presented very clearly in a few pages each. What's really helpful is that each thought is linked to the overall Hellenic framework and in comparison to the developments that led to its adoption as well as similar or differing philosophies in comparison, so you can seamlessly be reminded of the context and import of the ideas and of the rigorous debates each represents.

"I really enjoyed this story and would recommend it to YA readers and adults alike. Mara is both a skilled storyteller -- easily weaving between fantasy world and every day life -- and a keen wordsmith. She creates a lush and magical universe full of dramatic challenges and throws her character, the struggling Lucas, into it without the skills or knowledge he needs to survive.He is tested in every way (physically, mentally and spiritually) and as he finds his way we get a real hero's journey. His character grows against these challenges and through knowing his guides, including Amira, who is a fantastic female role model of a character. Her higher calling challenges him to move beyond base emotions, like fear and anger, and into holding a higher purpose, as represented by the Four Kingdoms. The overriding themes include seeing a world beyond yourself, rising to challenges in life even though you are ill-prepared, finding redemption through self-lessness and recognizing that the most powerful magic of all is, of course, love and care, all of which are inside of oneself all along.It all comes to life through clear writing, extra vivid descriptions and solid dialogue that makes Lucas a believable teen character who is surly on the outside and often a mess of tenderness inside. Without giving the cliffhanger away, this is a satisfying start where there are layers of reality at play and where Lucas is doled out information about his life as he is ready to act on it, and the stakes get huge at the end with a bomb of information from other the key women in his life. I look forward to where ever Mara takes these characters, since as Cecelia would, she knows ""magic is a part of your soul.""","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RAAYBDIRUCXCE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00P09O2PK#wasThisHelpful","RAAYBDIRUCXCE","A2Q6FM9ZHGZ0G9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2Q6FM9ZHGZ0G9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Clear and well written, this guide is a satisfying bit of geekery divided into two sections. The first looks at Munroe's work, which I felt was very even-handed and thought-provoking. Munroe gets a lot of internet attention for admirably contextualizing and packaging science and tech while also making them fun and entertaining subjects, though sometimes becoming gimmicky or too distilled in the process. Mullins makes a cogent point when comparing those gimmicks to the special effects in movies--it looks like science, but you can't really learn from them. So part II takes off where Munroe leaves off, by exploring real answers to the types of every day science questions that Munroe's readers mull around. In Mullins' able pen, the questions are explored and succinctly answered in a way that is memorable and can create a-ha learning moments. As a teacher, I know that this is not as easy as Mullins makes it, and that is vastly to her credit. The book is fun, clever and real science with handles on it anyone can pick up. Highly recommend!","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1P1ZYV3RDIK74/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PPTQOTW#wasThisHelpful","R1P1ZYV3RDIK74","A2Q6FM9ZHGZ0G9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2Q6FM9ZHGZ0G9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The absolute brilliance of this novel is that it somehow manages to push through the WALLS of form just as effortless-seeming as its characters move through the walls around them in every way. It's a love story at core--between two characters, between human experience and what lies beyond our perceived barriers. There is a heady mix of myth, religion, physics, history, espionage, adventure, romance and philosophy woven throughout a compelling story. What happens if you begin to apply practice dedication to learning how to free yourself from barriers, even though physical barrier of your body on this plane? What freedom could you find? Who would want to steal that from you?I loved the way the relationship is presented, because in breaking down the physical barrier between himself and another, the central character began a hero's journey that expanded to include all other realms.Together they physically travel to Greece, receive tutoring from the coolest mother-in-law in the world, and then expand their travels to other planes that neither could achieve alone. The relationship evolution, shown through solid dialogue and beautifully seductive prose, anchored the heady conceptual ideas but also brought them to life. It's easy to feel like a fly on the wall during some of the grand conversations, because walls are down. The author said the following about death, but it applies to the overall spirit of the book: ""We dissolve into an ocean of love."" Indeed.This is clear, smart writing, and it's also fun, sly and witty with lots of winks to mythology. I highly recommend it if you like compelling fiction that helps you break open your own barriers.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZXT6FZUSQ9TC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006O2G9OE#wasThisHelpful","RZXT6FZUSQ9TC","A2Q6FM9ZHGZ0G9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2Q6FM9ZHGZ0G9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"What an epic ending to a successful trilogy! This one is a page-turner rich with ideas and fully realizing Cal's purpose and mission. I finished the book late last night and can't stop thinking about it. The plot introduced in the second book unfolds into full-blown terrorism attacks on the nation, and that means we see our characters faced with building a new community of evacuees, grappling with standing up as leaders against a system that is suspect, and dealing with a modern war around them while beginning their own family.The writing is as honed and brisk as in the first two, with lots of fantastic action and adventure that is grounded in an interest in the moral questions of humanity, but also woven through with great dialogue that makes the story specific. I loved it that at the center of the action is the story of Cal and Abigail's marriage, including some family twists I didn't see coming. I really love a writer who can give us big political and war themes but also take the time to give scenes like seeing one character really thoughtfully selecting a Christmas gift for another or birth stories, symbolizing so much about the journeys of those characters and their intentions for the future of their own principled lives as well as the future of society.You don't find that kind of rich, layered storytelling every day but that's the kind of thing that stays with me. I'm asking myself lots of questions today, about what I would do in Abigail's situation, or Cal's, or as someone meeting Cal, so I'm really glad I found The Repentant Demon Trilogy!","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Z61QGHFAS4ZH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0093GL11Y#wasThisHelpful","R1Z61QGHFAS4ZH","A2Q6FM9ZHGZ0G9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2Q6FM9ZHGZ0G9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Like start-ups themselves, sometimes humor is the greatest disruptive force, helping you see things or solve problems in a new way. That's definitely the case with Secret to Startup Failure. Rich with insights and a-ha moments, I loved how this book defined the startup immersion experience brilliantly while offering the kind of immediately understandable advice that entrepreneurs needs from their trusted inner circle.The book is full of snippets you'll want to share with others, because it's just that dead-on. Should you get a co-founder...or a cat? The perils of measuring success by ""likes"" and the rollercoasters of launch? Holiday conference calls? It's all in here. Lots of idea prompts, with comics to illustrate the topic in fresh ways, and jewels of insight to help you hone in on where your startup is at and what might help.

"This is a great and accessible guide to understanding wills and trusts, and to empowering yourself to enact a trust that will ensure that your property transfers without delays and costs in case of your death. Way too many of us put these decisions and tasks off too long, creating needless nightmares for those we leave behind. The author has done a great job of presenting this information clearly for all readers, and for offering forms that are immediately actionable.  If you don't have a complicated estate you might not need a high-cost attorney and might be able to handle your own legal issues including a trust.

It includes various approaches to marriage, single and trusts for children, how to update an existing trust, and what not to do and who not to include in your trust.

"This is a genius app in a few ways. The phonics instruction is solid, with appealing graphics, fun animal connections and most importantly, excellent sound quality. Animals are an ideal way to illustrate phonics because we are used to talking about what animal barks or calls sound like with our kids, so it makes sense to then talk about the word for the animal and what that word's first sound sounds like. I really like the apps approach, and the graphics, color, and screen performance when loading or animating is superior.It's also deeply engaging, incorporating storytelling and rewards, including a train incentive that ups the ante while playing.

"I loved the first book in this series, and Book 2 was even better. The former-demon Cal has a tough time learning to use his human body and starting his human life, which made for fun reading and also makes you think about how complex we've made the modern world. Fortunately he has lots of help from Abigail, and some of the keen skills he had from a long life as a demon, including a proficiency with language and keen observation skills, now make him incredibly useful in a high-stakes situation. Seeing his character develop is a great exploration in faith as he confronts how to be of value, how to honor his chance at forgiveness and how to make his short time as a human matter. I liked seeing how he was inspired by others who he in turn inspired, and how he pushed himself and ultimately had human emotions bloom.I also loved the romance that developed between Abigail and Cal, and felt like it contributed to the strength of the book. It's like with Abigail recovering from grief and Cal essentially a newborn, the author created an incubator for their love that acknowledged their faith and allowed them to grow together. I like how the author explored the relationship of marriage in this context.The end of the story in Book 2 emphasized the action and intrigue and this part was really exciting, making me wonder what is in store for the next book.

"When we meet Clara, she tentatively seeing signs that she might be ready to date again. She's been through so much, including the loss of her mother to cancer and a shattering divorce rooted in betrayal, but she's muscled herself into a routine with work, her friends and her cats. The author sets the stage through great character development to have us invested in Clara's next steps. Things are stuck, and it makes sense why. Her friends aren't really helping her move forward in a way that works for Clara, though, and something needed to give.Enter a plot point that does several things: shakes up Clara from the way she's been sleepwalking through life in her post-grief stuckness, gives her guidance that reminds her of her mother, raisies her caretaking feelings which puts her in touch with how much of a caring person she is and how she has so much love to offer, takes away a comfort possession and her sense of control, and most importantly, leads her to a sexy and smart man who seems as interested in her as she is in him. The ensuing romance is fun but inevitably brings up important questions. He's younger, does that matter? Is he serious enough to risk the pain? Is she ready to be reawakened? Is he ready for a woman like her and for the romance to turn into a relationship?  Gage is hot and in lots of ways a perfect find, but in other ways a risky connection. There are plenty of twists and turns to keep you engaged, just like with a real relationship.I loved how the author takes us through Clare's emotions, desires and needs, including those affected by a history of loss that is a part of one's life by the time one is older than 40. Fully formed characters guide the plot, and we see how the romance helps both characters reach their next stages in personal development. I loved how the author showed that the 9-year age gap with the woman being older might be a positive, not a negative, and that Clara had a bank of confidence to tap, including knowing she could survive if she couldn't go farther with Gage because of his own limitations or differing needs, and how they both knew to talk about those issues early in their connection.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ZDJY1L0TXLML/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HQ5NAKO#wasThisHelpful","R1ZDJY1L0TXLML","A2Q6FM9ZHGZ0G9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2Q6FM9ZHGZ0G9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Getting clean and sober is only part of the battle. STAYING that way as life continues to throw it's twist and turns is a whole other ballgame, and deserves special support. This is a direct, unflinching look at how to stay mentally strong and healthy during a lifelong commitment to sobriety. It addresses a diversity of issues, including old thought patterns that might creep up, a need to learn how to be assertive, open and clear in relationships, and how to maintain overall stability to avoid relapse.I've enjoyed the articles in Bajeerao's blog tour, and the book exceeds my expectations. It's well organized. with each chapter centered on one theme or guidance. The narrative includes personal anecdotes, case study examples and advice that is useful, compassionate, and also no-nonsense. Then each chapter offers resources for further exploration and workbook questions to make sure that the reader understood the topic and can truly use it for personal development. This is the kind of work you can read cover to cover, and then open up from time to time for random inspiration of a chapter now and then or a complete re-read. Good work on an important topic for addicts and the people in their lives.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R25CUKYL7Q2TO5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00F2060XE#wasThisHelpful","R25CUKYL7Q2TO5","A2Q6FM9ZHGZ0G9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2Q6FM9ZHGZ0G9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"These poems reach out from the page to connect with the lonely, the misfits, the struggling and the lost. Grounded with a lyrically-articulated compassion, the author bares all and shares all to create a volume full of meaning and solace. Through varying techniques and styles, the author gracefully uses language, rhythm, repetition and rhyme to give form to feeling and shape to emotions. Individually the poems tell stories that feel both personal and universal. I often found the poems reminded me of someone who might relate and to whom I should send the poem because it sums up so eloquently those hard-to-define feelings of deep love, regret, longing for second chances, confusion, or particular life or emotional struggles.The title describes a self-acceptance credo and a call-to-action for understanding that threads throughout, as well as serving as the title of the last poem. The last two poems in the volume work as a powerful pair, with ""A Work in Progress"" answering the cries of ""Broken Girl."" These two are diamonds to be shared widely. Another poem that deeply connected with me is ""The Journey."" Several of the works in this volume explore duality and are a reminder that as with nature, people can contain many seasons. A Work in Progress is a tender and provocative work that would be a lovely gift for someone who needs affirmation and connection, and a lovely gift for yourself.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R27ZQL818U923O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1304406288#wasThisHelpful","R27ZQL818U923O","A2Q6FM9ZHGZ0G9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2Q6FM9ZHGZ0G9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Assassin's War ranks with the true spirit of science fiction in it's ability to do two things simultaneously: tell a fantastic tale that offers inventive ideas about the future, other species or similar topic, while at the same time giving us relevant themes to apply to contemporary life. I love how Vann is able to brilliantly excel in both veins in this novel.On the story level, Assassin's War is a winner. We're thrown right into it, as it the time of war, and there is a specific need for a murder to be avenged. The lethally-trained Tien, whom the Udek desperately need to deploy, first needs to be resurrected, though. And in his resurrection, of course he wants his wife to be reborn. Those who can do this transfer are the Bodhi, and neither they nor Tien know if they will be protected by the Udek after the war. All of this creates friction as power plays line up against in other and play out.The action and adventure is exciting and compelling, the battle maneuvers are fierce and strategically thrilling and the one-on-one work brutal. Then what's incredibly engaging is the levels below the story. What does it mean to be or have a soul? How would it change us to be in another body, or truly experience another way of life? Do we carry karma from past deeds? Are we all just one step removed from animals--are any of the species in the book any better than any others? Shared consciousness/mental connections is a theme that returns in several different ways, and you can't help but be captivated by the big questions raised by the Bodhi's neo-Buddhist rituals and transfer process.As experience wears holes into Tien's training and conditioned belief systems that justified his brutality for the Udek, he evolves and we as readers have to question where we have similar growth to do.  In all, this is a highly rewarding read that packs a galaxy-sized punch.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R911IFPRHLMZ9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ESERM1Y#wasThisHelpful","R911IFPRHLMZ9","A2Q6FM9ZHGZ0G9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2Q6FM9ZHGZ0G9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This recording has been around for more than 40 years now, so I'm going to skip reviewing the performance and focus on the 4.0 surround mix, which is the obvious selling point of this reissue.Unlike most 4.0 quad recordings from the 1970s (and surround sound recordings in general), this recording uses the rear channels discretely with the choirs, soloists and off stage instruments. The choirs are placed in the left and right rears, and the soloists take discrete positions around the listener rather than all of them being arranging front-and-center (so Mephistopheles tends to be placed in the right-front corner). And as the performance progress, they are moved around. For example, in the beginning of Part 4 Marguerite starts out in the front, but when the sound of the students and soldiers seep into her room she's moved to the right rear channel.Some people may think this is gimmicky, but I've attended plenty of choral music and in-concert opera performances where conductors do exactly this. And in this recording the results are pretty thrilling. The listener is placed in the center of the action and the discrete location of the soloists and chorus, combined with their movement adds a sense of spontaneity to the recording. It doesn't sound like you're just living to a reproduction of a performance but something created uniquely for home listening.Sound quality is mostly excellent. Putting aside the discrete use of rear channels, this is truly a recording that gives little hint that it's over 40 years old. The sound is spacious, warm and robust. There's no hint of tape hiss. My only complaint is the recording is overly reverberant in places, especially with the choirs.For those that already own a previous incarnation of this recording it's worth buying again if you have a surround sound system. If you only have stereo systems, then benefits are obviously fewer.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3AA270V7CNUYI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SKEZ9EU#wasThisHelpful","R3AA270V7CNUYI","A93LCEKKTMG7Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A93LCEKKTMG7Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"SETUP: Very easy. You connect the the extender wirelessly, select your network, enter its password, and that's it. If your router puts out both 2.4GHz and 5.0GHz networks it will extend each.PERFORMANCE: I tested this in a single-story home where my download speed is approximately 65 Mbps down/6 Mbps up .

"SETUP: Very easy. Downloaded the app to my iPhone 6 and in the app paired to the iGrill in seconds.USE: The iGrill doesn't just tell you the temperature of the probe, but it allows you to setup alerts with presets. You select what you're grilling (beef, pork, lamb, etc.) and then how well you want it cooked (rare, medium well-done, etc.). For example, beef/medium sets it to 140F. The app graphs the the temperature overtime to help you predict when you'll hit the goal temperature.Also note that the app can control multiple probes.RANGE: The iGrill is advertised as having a ""150' Bluetooth Smart range,"" but for me it cuts out on my iPhone 6 at about 50 feet (that includes the signal going through the outside wall of my house and an interior wall). Unfortunately, the distance between my grill and TV/couch is greater than 50 feet, so I cannot watch TV and monitor what's grilling without having to get up from the couch and walk into the next room. To the iGrill's credit, as soon as I move back into range the thermometer kicks back in  there's no need to re-pair the device.While the iGrill is an excellent thermometer, the range is so limited that I'm still going to have to walk near my grill to check the progress of what's cooking, which partially defeats the purpose of a wireless remote thermometer. While it would likely make it more expensive, if the iGrill could connect to my home's WiFi network I would never be out of range because I have a WiFi repeater installed near the back of my house that extends the network to my yard where the grill is.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2A2TF9JKLQXUP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00I25PGZO#wasThisHelpful","R2A2TF9JKLQXUP","A93LCEKKTMG7Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A93LCEKKTMG7Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"To test the headphones I listened to about a dozen hours of movies, orchestral music, opera, jazz and solo piano.The sound is clean, punchy, with a natural amount of bass. The quality was consistently excellent across all genres of music.The headphones deliver a very upfront perspective which is particularly flattering to recordings of only several musicians  it creates the effect of it sounding like you're surrounding by them. The only downside is that the headphones amplify ambient sounds from the recording venue, such as noises from the audience.The ear cups block out a good bit of ambient noise helping to minimize how much you need to turn the volume up to hear quieter passages of a recording. If you're hoping to use them at work to block out noisy co-workers they'll definitely do the trick (I tested the headphones at my office).Overall the sound is pretty similar to Sennheiser over-ear headphones, which I regard as the best prosumer headphones for music. That being said, I do feel Sennheisers costing about one-third of the Monster Octagon deliver the same audio quality.The construction of Monster feels pretty strong. While they are on the heavy side, they don't cause any pain when wearing for a while. It certainly helps that there is a good amount of padding on the cross strap that rests on your head.My only complaint is that given the high cost the headphones should have come with a hardshell carrying case rather than a fabric bag. Even though they feel tough I still wouldn't want them flopping around in bag.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1I9L9BBO2CI7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00M9DQOYW#wasThisHelpful","R1I9L9BBO2CI7","A93LCEKKTMG7Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A93LCEKKTMG7Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Lightroom 6 isn't that much different than version 5, so I'm not going to rehash explaining what the program does and why it is so great.There are four new features that are intended to convince version 5 users to upgrade:-Better performance-Facial recognition-Panorama merge-HDR mergeI suspect what people care most about are Panorama and HDR. (I've never had performances issues with LR5, and I doubt LR users are taking tons of pictures of friends and family over and over again that they need facial recognition).Here's the good news about these features:The output file for both the HDR and Panorama merge is Adobe DNG (RAW) so you can continue to modify the photo as a RAW film in Lightroom. This is pretty cool. Every program I've used for HDR and Panorama can only output a JPEG or TIFF even when they can accept a RAW files as an input (and of course, it's a major pain to have to convert your RAW files to TIFF or JPEG for programs that cannot accept RAW). (If I'm wrong on these please let me know and I'll change my review).The process has also been designed to run in the background so that you can continue using Lightroom while it's running -- it doesn't eat up all of the resources forcing you to take a break while it runs.Here's the bad news:You have almost no ability to fine-tune the HDR and Panoramic merge process. It's pretty much all automatic. Now both process work pretty well despite this. And programs that give you a tons of options can encourage endless unnecessary fine tuning that will ultimately get you to the same place as what Lightroom provides. But it's still strange we're given so little control over these processes, especially given how Lightroom is all about giving you the ability to manipulate ever aspect of a photograph to help you achieve your artistic vision.More about the HDR process: It doesn't produce the surreal look that's characteristic of HDR images where light glows.Take a look at the two photos I've attached. The one with more orange in the sky was done with HDR Darkroom, the other Lightroom. I didn't do any editing after the merge. I imagine most people will prefer the HDR Darkroom output, but the Lightroom version more accurately captures what the Hong Kong skyline looked like when I took the pictures. And I probably could get the Lightroom version to look more like HDR Darkroom through modifying the image more.One other complaint about how Lightroom does HDR and Panorama: there's no option to queue up a lot of images and let it rip at a scheduled time.So is it worth upgrading?Probably.Despite the lack of controls for HDR and Panoramic merge, there's a huge plus to having these features built into Lightroom and having the output file kept in RAW. For me that's worth the tradeoff of not having much control over the processes. I don't regret the upgrade and I'll abandon the third party programs I had been using. And when I consider what these third party programs cost vs the upgrade cost, it's about even.But if you want the ability to control the process than the upgrade may not be worth it for you at this time (especially if you want that surreal look to your HDR images).","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3TDDGYCZKE4IR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VWCKJVA#wasThisHelpful","R3TDDGYCZKE4IR","A93LCEKKTMG7Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A93LCEKKTMG7Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The french press hasn't really changed much since Bruno Cassol's 1935 patent -- his major innovation was the helical spring around the filter. Pretty much the only difference from one french press to the next are aesthetics. Unless someone completely screws up the filter and plunger, the taste from one to the next should be no different (which is the beauty of the french press -- everyone's works exactly the same).That being said, most Bodum french presses have a functional feature that this Bialetti made press does not: a groove on the top at the back that ensures the opening on the lid is always aligned towards the spout. See my picture. Having used a french press to make coffee for many, many years, I'm not afraid to say that from time to time I forget to make sure the lid is properly aligned before I pour my coffee. Bodum's top saves you from having to make sure you have it on right.This is a bit minor, but the Bodum beaker has a larger, better designed spout. See my picture.The Bialetti certainly looks handsome, but there are no shortage of french presses on the market, and given that they all make coffee exactly the same way, it looses points to Bodum's better functionality.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R4XO0J1TQVBRR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GU5L4EA#wasThisHelpful","R4XO0J1TQVBRR","A93LCEKKTMG7Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A93LCEKKTMG7Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Let me just jump right into this and say that I had two major issues:1. Motion Sensor. It has an extremely narrow line of sight. Look at the picture of the front of my house; what activates the camera are cars in the street. People walking on the sidewalk and even up to my house do not trip the sensor. The sensor won't activate the system unless you're right under it with your hand on the door nob. And because the system doesn't begin recording until about a second after the sensor has been tripped, someone can get underneath the camera and completely avoid being recorded.2. Camera Quality. It's awful -- worse than any five year old camera phone. I understand the resolution is low so to take up a minimal amount of storage space, but it's so poor hat you cannot identify anyone from it -- which more or less makes it worthless. Take a look at the screenshot of myself from the camera. There's just no excuse for how terrible the picture quality is.Not quite major issues:1. Where the wire goes into the camera is way too close to the mount (see photo). It can make installation difficult.2. There's no dedicated iPad version of the app. You have to run the iPhone version on your iPad.There were some features I did like:1. Setup is extremely easy and the smartphone app is pretty intuitive.2. The camera doubles as an intercom which use via your smartphone or tablet.

I did not like the feeling.That being said, the case is well constructed, does not obstruct buttons or jacks, can easily hold two credit cards, drivers license and metro card (I can get through 95 percent of days with just those four things), and the case can be used to prop-up the phone if you're watching video on it.If you primarily carry your phone in your pants pocket, definitely consider what it would be like if the phone were .5 inches wider.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1X2PJ18ESCCHH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NM9OC46#wasThisHelpful","R1X2PJ18ESCCHH","A93LCEKKTMG7Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A93LCEKKTMG7Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"While Apple has made a lot of improvements over the years with the battery life of iPhones -- I can often go up to 48 hours without a charge -- on day when I'm using my phone almost non-stop I do need to bring a portable battery with me in case I run low on power and there is not an outlet around.So combining a case and an external battery makes a lot of sense -- it's one less thing to carry.But the ZuZo is completely worthless as a protective case.1) The rim is not thick enough to protect the phone screen if you place the phone screen-side down. This is one of the primary functions of any cell phone case, and the ZuZo does not do it. If your phone was placed screen-side down and dragged across a surface the screen could become scratched if you do not use a screen protector (and even with one it could still become scratched).2) The case covers the headphone jack in such a way that it prevents headphone jacks with a 90 degree bend in them from being plugged in. This means swaths of headphones cannot be used with the case, such as any of the very popular Bose noise canceling headphones. One of the instances where I'm most often using my phone while charging it with an external battery is when I'm on a plane AND using my Bose noise canceling headphones.3) Unlike most other cases, the on-off/lock and volume buttons are not covered by the case. Instead there is an opening for them and the opening is so small that you can only use your nail to access the buttons (or at least my fingers are too fat).4) When charging the battery the LED battery life indicator lights on the screen-side of the case remain on. This is extremely annoying and distracting if you're watching something on your iPhone while trying to charge it. And again, that's a scenario I run into with external batteries while traveling on planes.As advertised it will recharge a near empty iPhone 6 one time -- I cannot find any fault there.One last complaint: the kickstand is wedge so hard in there I had to use a screwdriver to get it out. Other reviewers have had the same problem.Given all of these issues I'd rather prefer continue using my current case and carrying around an external battery and USB cord. That way I have a case that actually protects the phone screen, I can use any headphones I want, and I don't have to use my nails to access the buttons. And, I can get multiple chargers out of an external battery.","1.0 out of 5 stars","January 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R965286DM5DJ8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OHRU0BQ#wasThisHelpful","R965286DM5DJ8","A93LCEKKTMG7Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A93LCEKKTMG7Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In the winter my skin gets dry enough that I need to use a moisturizer on my face and hands to prevent my skin from cracking. So Nivea's body moisturizer was right up my ally.So let me get right to it:As soon as you apply the Nivea lotion you can feel the affect on your skin. It's a pleasant, almost tingly sensation -- it's rather refreshing. There's no doubt that it works as a moisturizer, and hours after application I can still feel the affects.That's the good. Now the bad.I find its smell to be unbearable. It's like baby powder with perspiration. And the smell lingers all day. 12 hours later I can still smell it on my skin.A lot has been said by other reviewers about the risk of slipping in the tub, and the bottle even comes with a warning; maybe I didn't apply enough, but I had no such issues.While the odor is a deal breaker for me, I understand that others may have no such issue.

"Here's what you get:A 4-foot lighting USB cable and a single port 2.1 AMP USB car charger adapter.The 2.1 AMP adapter will charge iPhones very fast -- about as fast as your AC outlet. Charge times with iPads are noticeably slower (Note: in my experience a 1 AMP adapter cannot provide enough power to charge an iPad -- it can only maintain the current battery level -- so definitely get the 2.1 AMP).So it's a complete package for charging your late model iOS devices, and gives you the flexibility to plug any other USB cord you have into the adapter for non-lighting port devices.Having owned many of these USB car adapters and countless aftermarket USB cords for iPods, iPads, iPhones, Kindles and other USB devices, I do not believe that Belkin's adapter and cord is any better than the competition -- there's certainly no justification for the $35 MSRP.Further, you should also consider the other options available, such as multi-port USB adapters and voltage inverters that include an AC port.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2HBADNYI4QG69/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LETJDNQ#wasThisHelpful","R2HBADNYI4QG69","A93LCEKKTMG7Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A93LCEKKTMG7Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"(This was review was written using iOS devices: iPhone 6, iPhone 3GS, iPad 3rd gen, and iPod Classic)NOTE: this unit does not have a CD player.OVERALL: This unit is an excellent value. For relatively little money you can overhaul the music system in older cars and fully utilize all of the media on your phone (music, streaming, apps), and add handsfree calling.Let me start with what are the best features of the pioneer media player before I go into more detail:1. Whether connected via Bluetooth or USB, when you turn your car on and the media player powers on, it begins playing exactly where you last stopped listening to audio. If you were listening to audio in an app, such as the podcast app (as opposed to the iPhone's native music app), it will resume playback there. I consider this a major plus because many factory installed car radios will not do this -- when powered up they always play the first track of music on your phone or iPod. I rent a lot of cars for work and it's shocking how many cars radios still do this.2. You can control playback of audio from your phone or iPod -- meaning, that when it is connected to the media center you are not forced to navigate and select audio through the media player. Again, lots of factory radios won't let you do this, and it's always easier to navigate on your device than through the media player.3. You can listen to audio from any app. Some car radios can be funky about allowing playback through third party apps, like the NPR app.INSTALL: If you've never installed a car radio before in can seem daunting, but it's really pretty simple. However, Pioneer's instructions are mediocre, and the wiring harness does not come pre-stripped, so you will need to have a wire stripper for the install. You also need wire nuts, or at least electrical tape. IMPORTANT: If your cars warning sounds and chimes are stored in the factory installed radio, then you'll also need to buy an aftermarket wiring interface to retain them (usually in the mid-$20s). You'll probably also need an antenna adapter (~$10) and a dash kit (~$15).BLUETOOTH: I had no problems paring several devices. Up to 3 can be stored in the media player's memory so that you can easily toggle between them without having to go through the pairing process each time you want to switch which device the media player is pulling audio from. When you turn on your car and the radio powers up it quickly finds my iPhone, connects, and begins playing audio.PHONE: This unit comes with a wired microphone. It has a clip that you can use to hang it from your visor or clip above the steering column; I installed it on the latter. When phone calls come in the media player displays what you'd see on your phone -- if it's from a number of a stored contact you see that contact's name; if not, you see the number. Through the media player's menu you can easily access the most recent call list and bring up your contacts directory. You can also turn the 1 through 6 number buttons on the media player into speed dial buttons for selected contacts. I think that's pretty spiffy. People on the other end of my calls said that my sound quality was good -- no issues hearing me.INTERFACE: The buttons are too small. You'll end up always controlling things from your phone.SOUND QUALITY: It's excellent, including through Bluetooth.OTHER FEATURES: This is actually a lack of feature: no CD player. It's crazy the the overwhelming majority of aftermarket radios still include a CD player. When was the last time anyone listened to a CD in the car? Compared to the rest of the Pioneer line you only seem to save a few dollars by opting to go without it. The lack of CD player does make the install easier because the unit is about half as deep as ones with the player.The media player also comes with a remote. I suppose it could be useful for allowing people in the back seat to change the radio station on their own.Some people have complained that the display is difficult to impossible to read during the day. I've had no such issues, even when sun light is shinning on the display and I'm wearing sunglasses. I think folks just need to adjust the settings.CRITICISMS: I cannot figure out how to display both the track name and the clock at the same time.As I mentioned early, it's ridiculous that the wire harness doesn't come pre-stripped. If you don't own a wire stripper or have access to one, that's an additional expense.I'm taking a star off for that.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2MX8NJXZWVQHF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MRYHMOE#wasThisHelpful","R2MX8NJXZWVQHF","A93LCEKKTMG7Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A93LCEKKTMG7Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Compared to other bumper cases I've owned going back to the iPhone 3G, this case feels no stronger or weaker. Short of performing a drop test with my own phone, I have no way of verifying if its ""shock-absorbent rubber core,"" ""polycarbonate exoskeleton"" and ""air cushioned corners"" provide superior protection to other cases. The manufacture offers no evidence of this either. With the lack of such evidence, I'm concluding that it offers no better or worse protection than the average bumper case. (It is described as ""military-grade"" but there is no explanation of what this means, such as if it is built to the standards that the US Army uses to protect electronics in the field).Ease of removing the phone from the case and accessing buttons and ports is also neither better or worse than other bumper cases.With iPhone 6 cases, I also own a Incipio NGP case -- which at the time of this review is the top recommendation on Wirecutter. I feel it offers the same amount of protection, is slimmer, and cost several dollars less.So far that reason I cannot recommend this case -- go with the Incipio.Note: included in the package are 3 different colored plates so you can add some level of customization if you so desire. It also comes with a screen protector which I never use because it interferes with the tactile interface experience -- your fingers don't glide as easily across plastic as glass. I'm on my 3rd iPhone and have never had problems with the screen getting scratched (I am careful not to put it in the same pocket as my keys). And the touch experience with glass is superior enough that I can live with some scratches, which are only really visible when the screen is off.REVISED 12/15/14","3.0 out of 5 stars","December 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2BX3X17IGCAKI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00M9E10UE#wasThisHelpful","R2BX3X17IGCAKI","A93LCEKKTMG7Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A93LCEKKTMG7Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Pros:It's pretty difficult if near impossible for the top to somehow come loose and cause water to spill out (where as this is a concern with bottles that have a latch).Size is perfect for bottle holder pockets on backpacks.The filter makes a difference, though the degree of that difference depends on the quality of the the water.Cons:There are no markings to indicate what's the max the bottle should be filled accounting for the space the filter takes up. If you fill all the way up to the top water spill out when you place the filter in. So you cannot fill up quite the whole way, and it's up to you to figure out what that point is.As for the BPA concerns, the bottle is advertised as BPA-free. If you don't trust that because it's a soft plastic, you could try putting some kind of sleeve on it to block out UVA light which is what causes chemicals in plastic to leach into the water. Or, just buy a stainless steel or glass bottle.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RHCXSCR5SFF7M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00O2SPF9M#wasThisHelpful","RHCXSCR5SFF7M","A93LCEKKTMG7Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A93LCEKKTMG7Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Putting aside difficulties with flying the quadcopter, I ran into major connectivity issues. About every two minutes the connection between the remote and quadcopter would go out, requiring that the battery be unplugged, reconnected, and the remote turned on and off. It was extremely frustrating to have to go through this so often.Oh, and how stupid is it that there isn't an on/off switch on the quadcopter? To power it on and off you have to literally connect and yank the cord.I had a hard time flying it -- no matter how much I tried, I could not get it to just hover. As others have noted, the scant directions provide no help with how to fly it.Also, you really need a very large wide open space to fly it, like a baseball field.I'll concede that I may just stink as a quadcopter pilot, but the connectivity issue is reason enough to junk it.","1.0 out of 5 stars","November 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3MBAWEIV1544P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NHLAETQ#wasThisHelpful","R3MBAWEIV1544P","A93LCEKKTMG7Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A93LCEKKTMG7Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This review was written using a Mac with OS 10.10 and an iPhone with iOS 8.1SETUP: To install wirelessly I had to first download Brother's software. The whole process took several minutes. Unlike most other wireless printers, you have to install the software -- the printer cannot be added to your wireless network using the control panel (there's no way to select a network and enter in the password).PRINTING: With both graphics and text it's fast. Text is crisp; graphics have horizontal lines as if it were printed on an ink jet, and the contrast is pretty poor. I'm impressed that such an inexpensive printer will print double-sided. I had no issues printing from my iPhone.SCANNING: Unlike a lot of other all-in-one printers, you can scan directly to your computer. That is, press the scan button and a file is dumped into your pictures folder (you can specify JPEG or PDF). You *do not* have to initiate the scanning process on your computer. Scan speeds are good, even when set to the highest resolution (600 dpi).COPYING: From either feeder or laying on the glass it's fast. You can have single sided pages converted to double-sided.WHO IS THIS PRINTER GOOD FOR: Small businesses that need a scanner and have to print maybe a dozen or so pages a day -- things like invoices. It might also be good for students who have professors who still require that papers be submitted as hard copies instead of electronically because the cost per print is much lower with laser than ink (and you only have to buy one color). Similarly, it would make a good printer for light personal use -- printing out a page or two every now and then.The printer also has an ID card print feature. You put your ID on the glass, press ID copy, then flip the ID over, press ID copy again, and it prints out a copy of both sides of your ID on a single page. I imagine certain niche businesses, such as health care, will find that very useful.FINAL VERDICT: There are lots of options in this price range with similar features, and I'd go with the Brother primarily because it's a laser printer -- ink cartridges are a money pit.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R222C78RUJYCRW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MFG57ZK#wasThisHelpful","R222C78RUJYCRW","A93LCEKKTMG7Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A93LCEKKTMG7Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Hyperbole aside, this may be the best designed roller luggage bag -- certainly the best in its price range. It brings together a number of smart design elements that make the bag easy to handle and ensure that it can fit into practically any overhead bin (except the bins on the CRJ planes).Below are the major features:-Rounded top. The reason that flight attendants are always telling you to put your bag in wheels facing out to the aisle is because the end of the overhead bin is curved. It's literally a square peg into a round whole situation. Depending on how large your bag is and how overstuffed it is, the top size can be squeeze it into the rounded end, but the wheels side cannot because they are rigid.This bag has a rounded top side so that the bag's shape actually fits the shape of the overhead (and this is why it opens at the mid section).This feature is especially important on smaller planes like the MD90 (typically used for less than 2 hour flights on major routes) where the overhead bins can be pretty unforgiving for bags that are slightly too long or too tall.-Wheels. The wheels on most bags tend to be dinky crap, and are often the first thing to breakdown. Timbuk2 uses skateboard wheels! They are extremely durable, large size provides a smooth glide, and they are easily replaceable (that is, it's not a proprietary part).-Handles on all sides. Sounds simple, but take a look at the bags people are using during your next flight. It's amazing how many do not have handles on the sides.-Exposed frame. Specifically, the frame for the wheels and telescoping handle is exposed to allow for easy repairs. I appreciate that the bag was designed so that when it breaks it can be fixed, rather than tossed (especially given how expensive it is).-Cannot be overstuffed. A lot of bags have a large top pouch that when fully stuffed can prevent the bag from fitting into narrow opening overhead bins. Timbuk2 was wise not to include such a pouch that would tempt you to over stuff, resulting in a situation when you need the help of two other people to squeeze the bag into the bin.Size: I went with the small because it's only a matter of time until airlines start cracking down on people who bring large bags on planes. European airports are already very strict about this, and during summer 2014 Delta was actually enforcing its  22"" x 14"" x 9"" rule, forcing people to check bags that were only inch over even though they would fit into the bin. The medium bag may fit into the overhead, but in the not too distant future (and already in Europe), you may not be allowed to take it on.I've used the small on several 5 night work trips without doing laundry  I think it's plenty big enough for most travel.Construction: like all Timbuk2 bags it's built like a tank. It should last many years before needing repairs.Final comment: Yes, the bag is on the expensive side, but think of luggage as an investment  it should not be something that has to be replaced every few years  it should last at least a decade (my old Boyt bag lasted 14 years). And the design should make travel as effortless as possible.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R8C9HDQVAQO9X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HZ16WJU#wasThisHelpful","R8C9HDQVAQO9X","A93LCEKKTMG7Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A93LCEKKTMG7Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Assembly: It took me about 15 minutes. No tools are required, but you will need something to cut two zip ties. The pieces certainly don't need to be forced into place, but a good bit of pressure needs to be applied to make sure the polls go in all of the way.Build quality: Once assembled it is light enough that a person can easily carry it. It feels solid, but note the weight limits. It also has a slight wobble -- enough that I placed my air mattress on the bottom rack to help anchor it.Uses: I've put it in a guest room for guests to use to unpack their close, as well store guest sheets and towels.Because of the weight limits, I would not treat this as your primary closet, loading it up with all of the jackets and suits you own -- it simply cannot carry that much weight.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2CJKCDF4TNDCZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00H7P1HC6#wasThisHelpful","R2CJKCDF4TNDCZ","A93LCEKKTMG7Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A93LCEKKTMG7Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm going to review this product through the lens of its intended use: a space saving speaker. I say that because it's not meant to deliver audiophile sound, but provide better sound than you'll get from your TV speakers without taking up much space (and I say that as someone who owns a 5.1 surround sound system with floor standing speakers).Size: Assuming that your TV is elevated about an inch or so by its stand and that the rim around the screen is also an inch or two,  The mono speaker is short enough that if placed in front of your TV it should not block the screen. But you should still measure everything before buying.Sound: Not surprisingly it's a big step up from the speakers on your TV. I tested it on a mix of TV shows with lots of dialogue, music competition shows, and movies. Sound was warm and crisp, with good bass response from the woofer. Simply put, it's results in a much more pleasurable viewing experience than you'll ever get with TV seekers.For fun I compared it to my 5.1 system -- perhaps not a fair comparison, but this is a pretty pricy speaker system. The center channel in my system provides a much more spacious sound with more bloom. It also helps that the center speaker is substantially larger than the Bose.Bose includes a universal remote that can be programmed to control all of your other boxes: cable, Blu-ray, etc.I also have to give Bose credit for including all of the connecting wires you may need, such as the optical cable for connection the speaker to your TV (it's amazing how most Blu-ray players do not ship with an HDMI cable).My one criticism is that Bose uses a proprietary cable of their own making to connect the woofer to the speaker, preventing your from buying a third party cable if you want to place the woofer farther from the TV than the included cable will allow. In fairness the speaker cable is 10' long, but take that into account before buying in case you do plan on placing the woofer way off to the side.I'm taking a star off for that, as well as the fact that I feel it's slightly over priced (at the time of this review Amazon is selling it for 600 dollars).","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RWU4JE44FW4X2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N1SSWXU#wasThisHelpful","RWU4JE44FW4X2","A93LCEKKTMG7Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A93LCEKKTMG7Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"For decades the ""Joy of Cooking"" was a cornerstone of kitchens because it covered the basic principals of cooking -- everything from how to cut specific kinds of fruits, vegetables and meats, to detailed explanations of ingredients and cookware, and even directions on how to set the dinner table.""The America's Test Kitchen New Family Cookbook"" takes things to the next level. It's designed to be as much as a reference book as recipe book.In addition to having an unfathomable number of recipes, on practically every other page there are series of colored photos (usually three to six) that demonstrate the preperation process of a recipe, typically focusing on steps that are applicable to other recipes. There are also all kinds of tips and tricks, such as how make a panini without a panini press -- use a grill pan and a dutch oven as a weight.Like the ""Joy of Cooking"" there are many pages devoted to cooking equipment, explanations of various foods (meats, cheese, pasta, grains, etc), directions of what to look for when buying fresh foods, and suggested brand name ingredients.Cookbooks are a snapshot in time, reflecting the culinary zeitgeist of when they were made. As such, ""Test Kitchen"" accurately captures current tastes and trends, devoting a good number of pages to dishes like pizza, barbecue, asian noodles, as well as all of the different kinds of grains and beans sold at the bulk grain section of stores like Whole Foods. If you're looking for recipes to lots of classic French dishes, buy ""The Art of French Cooking.""One word of warning: the serving size for most of the recipes is 4-6; if you're cooking mainly for two and don't want to deal with scaling down recipes, than this book may be of less value.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RKG1J428SE65/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1936493853#wasThisHelpful","RKG1J428SE65","A93LCEKKTMG7Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A93LCEKKTMG7Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When it comes to bed sheets you get what you pay for. The fiber of the sheets, thread count and weave all affect how the sheets feel against your skin, as well as the cost. Cheap sheets tend to skirt on all of these dimensions.The reason these sheets are so cheap -- while also coming with a comforter -- is because they're made of polyester. Bed sheets are traditionally made of 100% cotton. Not only do people generally prefer the feel of cotton, but it has several advantages.I'll get to the feel of the material in a second, but the two main disadvantages of polyester vs cotton, is that: 1) Polyester isn't as breathable as cotton. It traps more heat and does not wick moisture from your skin; and 2) The sheets will pill over time (from use and washing), meaning that small hard bumps appear on the surface. Good quality cotton sheets will not pill.As for the feel, polyester is much smoother than cotton. This isn't necessarily bad, but it's different enough that I wouldn't recommend buying polyester sheets blindly. Buy a pillowcase and sleep with that for a few nights.Before writing this review I slept with this sheet set for a week. It did get hotter than my cotton sheets, but I did not have any issues with how the fabric felt against my skin -- it didn't interfere with ability to sleep.Further, despite the heat issue, the texture of the sheets was a lot more palatable than cheep cotton -- cotton sheets around this price range can have an unbearable coarse texture.Who are these sheets good for? I think it's worth spending money to have good quality sheets. No only can they impact the quality of your sleep, but good sheets will last you many years (I have sheets that have lasted over a decade). I think this set is good for a situation where you only need the sheets for several years and don't want to make a huge investment, like a college student. Or, if you need sheets for more cosmetic reasons, such as just to keep a bed in a guest room covered. These are certainly stylish and polyester stays wrinkle free.Two final things to note: 1) The sheets are so thin they're transparent -- to the point that if you have a stain on a pillow or mattress (or mattress cover) it will come through; and 2) The queen size is a bit large. This could be a good or bad thing depending on if your mattress runs a bit small or large.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2N5OZJ7ZWQ1T1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KMNLE9G#wasThisHelpful","R2N5OZJ7ZWQ1T1","A93LCEKKTMG7Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A93LCEKKTMG7Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Overall the WF-2660 is a solid printer for light home use.The ideal user is someone who occasionally needs to print something out from the web, scan a document to e-mail to someone, or make a copy of a document. Given the cost of ink, if you're planning on doing a lot of printing there are much more cost effective options out there. So I would not recommend this for college students or for a home business.SETUP: Super easy. Removed all of the tape, inserted the ink cartridges, and connected the printer to my home network using the touch screen menu. When I went to print a document on my computer (MacBook running 10.9.4) it found the printer and automatically installed all necessary software.To recap the main functions of the WF-2660:-Scan via feeder or flatbed;-Copy B&W or color from feeder or flatbed;-Print single-sided or double-sided (I'm particularly pleased such an inexpensive printer can do double-sided printing);-Print from mobile devices, including iOS; and-Fax (people still do that?)It does all these functions reasonably well. That is, if you need to scan a document, print out something from the internet or word document, copy a short document, etc, it does these things just fine. But don't expect that the print quality, for example, is good enough that you can print your photos on photo paper and frame them, or, scan a picture at a high enough quality to use for any kind of artistic purpose.Print speeds depend on the file size of your document. It zips out word documents and web pages; when I tried printing a 60 MB TIFF file it took about ten minutes! Similarly, scan times widely range by resolution; color 300 DPI color is about a minute whereas 1200 DPI color takes several minutes.I've removed a start because the 2660 does not have a USB or SD ports -- so there's no way to print from a removable media drive or save a scan to it. I find such ports quite useful -- I've used them to print and scan documents on friends' printers.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RWKQRQ7M7SUDF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LV8QC2K#wasThisHelpful","RWKQRQ7M7SUDF","A93LCEKKTMG7Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A93LCEKKTMG7Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Philips Windshield treatment does what it claims, but the results are hardly night-and-day.And more to the point, there's a good bit of effort and planning involved in applying the treatment.For the DIY enthusiast this is all pretty minor, but for the average person it's probably a bit too much.First, the glass treatment cannot be applied in direct sunlight, and can only be when the temperature is between 40 and 80. So if don't have a garage, there could be several months in the summer when it can only be applied at night or very early in the morning, and in the winter only during the day (provided the car is not in direct sunlight).Apparently the chemicals in the treatment are dangerous enough that you need to wear googles during the application process, as well as gloves, and avoiding getting any of it on your skin. I try to avoid using things like bleach, so I wasn't thrilled having to deal with cleaning chemicals that come with so many warnings.Finally, the process of cleaning your windshield and then applying the treatment involves lots of scrubbing. I say this not to complain about having to use a bit of elbow grease, but to point out that between only being able to apply the treatment under certain weather conditions, having to deal with a somewhat hazardous chemical, and then having to vigorously scrub down the windshield multiple times, it's a whole lot of work for a pretty mild payoff.Definitely check out the directions before buying so that you know what you're getting into.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R23MTLY4TWVKFU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GZZ1YCW#wasThisHelpful","R23MTLY4TWVKFU","A93LCEKKTMG7Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A93LCEKKTMG7Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

" 0:26 MinsI've been an electric kettle convert since the late 1990s. I love the fast boil time, being able to leave the room while the water is boiling because it automatically shuts off, and the freed up space on the stove. I use mine 1 to 2 times a day -- coffee in the morning, usually tea in the evening.Electric kettles come in three varieties: glass, stainless steel and plastic.Even though plastic kettles are BPA-free, that doesn't stop people from fretting over them.While glass (which the Oster is) and stainless steel will put your mind to rest about issues with plastic, they are heavier, the surface gets hotter, and it retains heat longer.In the time lapse video I compared this Oster to my Braun WK200W Aqua Express Electric Water Kettle purchased in 2008 to see which could boil 2 cups of water faster. The Braun won, coming in at 2:07; it took the Oster 2:33. That's a pretty big time difference considering the price of the Oster and how old the Braun is (and remember, the Braun has been used at least once a day since 2008!).As expected, the surface of the Oster gets hotter than the plastic Braun, but not as hot as stainless steel kettles (my parents have the Cuisinart CPK-17 PerfecTemp 1.7-Liter Stainless Steel Cordless Electric Kettle and it gets so hot you can burn yourself on it).The Oster lacks some functionality found on other kettles in same price range -- namely the ability to set the temperature you want to heat the water to, and holding that desired temperature. The previously mentioned Cuisinart does this, as does Bonavita 1.7-Liter Variable Temperature Digital Electric Gooseneck Kettle.So that's why I give it three stars -- slow boil time and that other kettles that cost about the same have more functionality.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R259PIOHMFEN86/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00L9X1G1Y#wasThisHelpful","R259PIOHMFEN86","A93LCEKKTMG7Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A93LCEKKTMG7Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Glue traps certainly aren't humane, but they're the most affective way to eliminate a rodent problem.After Sandy hit NYC, mice invaded my apartment (I was living in the UWS side fairly close to the Hudson).

This isn't space-age technology -- it doesn't take much to catch a mouse -- so you should never be paying much for glue traps. And you don't need any bells-and-whistles like scented traps.

"(This review is for the R30 - 1100 Lumens)If you haven't converted all of the lights in your home to LED, it's worth the expense.They're night and day better than CFL:Use less power; do not require any warm up time; light output does not diminish after just several years, light output is not affected by cold weather; and last substantially longer.The Kobi Electric flood is extremely bright and puts out what appear to be a true 1100 lumen (a lot of times the light output ratings are suspect).The power usage is equally impressive -- 17 watts. A comparable halogen will use 75 watts.Despite being ""designed for commercial applications where voltage is 90v to 277v,"" it will work in any light fixture in your home with 110v power. But I doubt you'd want something this bright in your home. It's more appropriate for use in a garage or large enclosure, like a barn.In general LED bulbs are heaver than CFL, and this bulb in particular is fairly heavy.

"Sony has really pulled out all of the stops here, producing a highly versatile media unit at a pretty affordable price.The S6200 replaces the BDPS790 to become Sony's new flagship Blu-ray player.The only lost feature is that the 790 came with dual HDMI ports to support people who have a 3D TV and an A/V receiver that does not support 3D passthrough. And the construction of the 790 was arguably a bit better.Not only is the 6200 significantly cheaper than its predecessor, but it comes with some notable upgrades.Let me go through the various capabilities of the unit.1. Blu-ray: At this point there's really no measurable difference in picture and sound quality between players -- they all produce vibrant picture and sound. The main difference is load time, and the 6200 is very fast with its dual core processor.2. Streaming: The 6200 supports a slew of streaming apps (HBO GO is the major exception, and at the time of writing this review, Amazon Instant is not yet ready). Sony's new Netflix app is quite impressive. Not only are load times extremely fast, but it takes about a second for the video video quality to get to the optimal level. There's virtually no lag with scrubbing. Finally, the new Netflix app supports Dolby Digital Plus.Hopefully the new Amazon will prove to be as well designed.3. Music: Audiophiles rejoice. New to the 6200 is support for multichannel FLAC and DSD (DFF and DSF) files. As far as I'm aware, only the significantly more expense OPPO BDP-103 and 105 can do the latter.Sony continues to provide SACD support with DSD over HDMI.Suggested audio settings:DSD Output Mode: OnBD Audio MIX Setting: Off (has to be off to bitstream DTS-HD and DD-HD)Digital Music Enhancer: OffDTS Neo:6: OffAudio DRC: OffDownmix: SurroundI personally turn off all of the video enhancer settings  -- the video on Blu-rays is authored with assumption that no such settings will be used.Overall, it's quite impressive everything the 6200 will do, especially at its price point. In fact, anyone thinking of buying an Oppo should reconsider, especially if you plan on using an A/V receiver to process all of the sound.===============UPDATE #1: Sony says the Amazon App will be available in early April.UPDATE #2: I've now installed the Amazon App. As far as I can tell, the UI is the same as the one found in other recent devices, such as smart TVs. While it's certainly an improvement from the old Amazon App that the came with previous Sony Blu-ray players, navigation is sluggish (especially compared to the Netflix app), and the load time to get to optimal video quality is a solid 30 seconds to 1 minute. Further, my Roku circa 2009 has a superior UI and much faster load time. Given that the Sony has the processing power to load video very fast -- as displayed by the Netflix app -- I can't help but wonder if Amazon is purposely throttling speeds so to push people into buying their streaming device -- make it seem like the only way to get Amazon Prime videos to instantly load is with their box. Despite the disappointment with the Amazon app, the 6200 is still a solid video streaming unit, but depending on your needs (such as HBOGO), it doesn't quite match Roku.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R37GKNJ0O8BBO8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HPMCO14#wasThisHelpful","R37GKNJ0O8BBO8","A93LCEKKTMG7Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A93LCEKKTMG7Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"As a longtime Rowenta user (I'm replacing my DZ5080 purchased in 2008), I wouldn't use any other iron. Having used other Rowenta models and non-Rowentas, I find that Rowentas glide the easiest, and require the fewest number of passes to remove wrinkles.The DW9280 is like no iron I've ever used before. It puts out an incredible amount of steam -- so much so that it can be used as a steamer to remove creases from suits, skirts, hanging curtains, etc.What this practically means, is that you can iron clothes very fast -- you don't have to keep passing over the same spot over and over again. It takes very little time to iron a shirt and have it looking like it was pressed.I've also found that unlike my older DZ5080, the DW9280 stays hot all of the time -- after extended periods of use it doesn't go into reheat mode which can take a minute or two.While I'm sure many people will balk at spending so much on an iron when there are so many out there for less than $50, the ROI works out pretty well. If you cold wash and iron clothes like men's dress shirts instead of dry cleaning them, it doesn't take long for the iron to pay for itself (and you can clean dress shirts this way -- I can get about five years of life out of them). Given the cost of dress clothes, you want an iron that's not going to damage them. I've made the mistake of using irons in hotel room and have had them leave permanent marks on shirts; in 6 six years my DZ5080 never once damaged an article of clothing. And of course, you want something that produces good results, and fast, so it doesn't feel like you're moonlighting as a dry cleaner. (And with this iron in particular, there's added value in how it can be used as a steamer).My only complaint is that like every other iron I've ever used, the water tank's inlet remains poorly designed. If you pour too fast, you end up spilling. How water gets into the iron simply needs to be completely redesigned.Bottom line: highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R4O9HTTO30KN0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CLD39C0#wasThisHelpful","R4O9HTTO30KN0","A93LCEKKTMG7Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A93LCEKKTMG7Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

So you never get into instances when you're using your teeth to open the valve, sucking on the bottle or putting a death grip on it just to get the water out.As for its insulation abilities, reviewers are grossly overstating just how cool it will keep liquids.

So far it is holding air well -- I've kept it inflated for 3 and 4 days without having to refill.It feels as comfortable as any other air mattress I've used -- certainly comfortable enough for guests staying a few days.While it doesn't come with an air pump, the air pump I have for my car works with it (it has an attachment specifically for inflating air mattresses and rafts). And based on the price, it looks like you save some money by not having a pump come with it.My one complaint is the design of the valve. It does not have a way to allow air to flow in but not out at the same time -- so if you stop inflating, you have to immediately close it. I've had other air mattresses where the valve could do that.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 28, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R18L9HDC32OT91/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006JH1KES#wasThisHelpful","R18L9HDC32OT91","A93LCEKKTMG7Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A93LCEKKTMG7Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"While this DVD doe not fill in any holes in Szell's discography -- he recorded all of these pieces in studio with Cleveland -- it does provide a rare opportunity to watch Szell conduct, and conduct an orchestra that wasn't the Cleveland Orchestra.It's also especially fitting the one of the performances captured on video is Walton's ""Hindemith Variations,"" and that Walton was present at this concert and called to stage to take a bow. The ""Variations"" was probably Szell's favorite contemporary piece of music. After he conducted it for the first time in Cleveland during the 62-63 season, he conducted it again in 4 out of the next 6 seasons. I doubt there are many other instances of a conductor programming a new piece of music season after season like it were a Beethoven symphony.The interpretations of the three pieces on this DVD (also included are the Bruckner 3 and ""Eine Kleine Nachtmusik"") are not much different than the studio versions made with Cleveland (and they're a bit more polished thanks to being studio recordings).Recorded sound is serviceable. The Walton and Mozart are from 12/68. While the sound is clear with a good bit of presence, there's a high pitched buzz throughout the performances. It's not that loud and becomes white noise after a little bit, but it is there. The Bruckner is from 6/66 and is coarser, with distortions -- most noticeable when the brass are playing loudly. The sound is unfortunately nowhere need as good as the quality of radio broadcast recordings from this era -- and ORF's tended to be pretty good.In sum, this disc is for Szell fans -- they'll delight in getting to watch him conduct. For everyone else, stick with the Cleveland studio recordings of these pieces.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 28, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R19XEQROXA6DBA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GMM11PS#wasThisHelpful","R19XEQROXA6DBA","A93LCEKKTMG7Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A93LCEKKTMG7Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I need another Mahler 5 like I need a hole in my head, but I've been buying Ivan Fischer's Mahler cycle (admittedly) because the sound quality of Channel Classics' surround sound recordings are phenomenal, and Ivan Fischer tends to do pretty good work. Of the recordings released so far, I'd rate 2 & 4 the best (individualistic and refreshing), 1 as very good (no new ideas, but an extremely strong performance), and 6 as rather ho-hum. Unfortunately, this 5th is a low point for Fischer.If there was ever a performance I'd write-off as simply dull and boring, this is it. Fischer seems so concerned in having the orchestra sound as beautiful as possible -- and they are exquisite -- that little attention is actually paid to the score. Everything just plods along slowly with little thought. Case and point would be the second movement, which is anything but ""moving stormily, with the greatest vehemence."" Listen to any decent performance of the 5th, and the conductors will always push the brass to the front, especially the dotted rhythms where they sound like machine gun fire, and when they are muted or hand-stopped, waling out coarse sounds over the orchestra. But here, the brass sits quietly and politely in the back, never making too much of a raucous.The whole performances suffers from this even-keeled approach -- it's in the tempo, the phrasing and the balance.I don't expect new recordings to surpass everything that came before them -- and rate them that way. Fischer's Mahler 1 certainly didn't do that, but it was well executed enough that I've enjoyed listening to it many times. I doubt I'm ever going to revisit this recording.","2.0 out of 5 stars","December 28, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R28ERRYKYN5PPI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FAY6IZM#wasThisHelpful","R28ERRYKYN5PPI","A93LCEKKTMG7Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A93LCEKKTMG7Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is the replacement for the stock working end of the Squishy Face Flirt pole. My 1-year-old German shepherd dog is addicted to the flirt pole as an interactive toy - it is his highest value play item. We have done flirt pole work for about 20 minutes/day (out of 40-60 minutes of daily play sessions) every day for the last 6 months. We did only short, lower energy sessions when he was younger to prevent any injuries from overexcited play. We have gone through 6 tails in 6 months as they eventually get too shredded and dirty and have to be retired. Riley loves the squeaker in the tails, but, much to my disappointment, these pairs do NOT include the squeaker ... I did not read the fine print, having assumed that they included the squeakers ... apparently value pack means no squeaker as you will pay almost twice the price for the squeaker version. That's too bad as the squeaker barely lasts more than a few days. But anyway, it is a great interactive toy. I don't let Riley use this as a solo chew toy. He gets to catch it and gnaw on it as a reward and while taking a little rest, but I'm right there to make sure that the tearing gets minimized because the tassels will get torn off quite quickly by a determined shredder. Note that if your dog is like mine, you will need to step down the energy level by moving to a lower-value toy or activity before ending the session. This is really important to avoid the FRAP condition when your pup or adult is overexcited. Finally, be careful that your younger pup does not hurt himself/herself with it by making sharp, twisting turns that are tough on young hips.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RFZH94INFRA73/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HFFX5WS#wasThisHelpful","RFZH94INFRA73","A29NYH9RBFV9TH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A29NYH9RBFV9TH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This review is by a regular person, not someone who has received the product as a gift in exchange for an Amazon review (I mean, really, what is up with that?).The Sportazon bottle is certainly rugged and survives a beating both in the backpack as well as in the teeth of our German Shepherd pup who snagged it and ran away with it for a minute of chew fun. The latter alone is quite impressive as Riley can destroy most things in seconds. The compressibility of the empty bottle is another great benefit, but not unique to this particular brand of collapsible bottle.The main issue with the bottle is the tightness of the outside cap. My 5'0"" 100lb princess simply can't open it without compressing the bottle, which leads to a geyser when it finally opens. I can open the cap with some difficulty, but it shouldn't have to be that way. Yes, it's nice to have a great seal but this is a little too good. Now that said, we've only used the bottle daily on a 9-day trek, so perhaps it will wear in with time, and if it does, it's a 5-star item.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1GFJ5AWUCMWXU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00U203K3C#wasThisHelpful","R1GFJ5AWUCMWXU","A29NYH9RBFV9TH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A29NYH9RBFV9TH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"DeGraaf is the godfather of forest wildlife habitat management in New England, and every practicing forester, wildlife biologist, and ecologist must have his complete works on their bookshelf. As a wilderness ecologist who does not prescribe habitat management in interior forests, I still find his management prescriptions most useful as they parallel natural gap-phase dynamics found in wildlands. In practice, it is most important that you study what you have in your target landscape before you commission the chainsaws ... you will most often find that your target forest species are already there. That said, again, the depth and breadth of knowledge that DeGraaf et al. bring to the table is without parallel. Buy a copy for the foresters in your region.

"We've had the Petmate 21647 Pet Porter Fashion Dog Crate, Giant, Dark Gray for a few days now and we're really happy with it, as is our 9-month-old German shepherd Riley. This unit is an upgrade from the Petmate 21950 Vari 40-Inch Pets Kennel, 70-90-Pound, Bleached Linen that we originally purchased for him when he came home to us at 9 weeks (I used plastic crates inside of it to downsize it to accommodate his baby size and removed them as he grew). Finally, by the time he was 8 months old and 70 pounds, it was clear that I needed to up-size to an uber-giant crate as he likes to stretch out when sleeping and he could no longer sit up in it without stooping. Maybe this bothered him, maybe not, but it sure bothered me, so I initially pulled the trigger on the biggest Petmate Vari Kennel. When that arrived, I was dismayed by the poor fitment of the door - you had to really work it over and over to get it to close. Not cool. So back it went to Amazon and I ordered the Petmate Pet Porter and I was relieved that the door works smoothly. I must point out that I do not see any visible difference between the Vari Kennel and the Pet Porter other than the fact that the Pet Porter is dark gray versus the light tan of the Vari Kennel - aside from the door latch issue. Note that the Pet Porter door has the circular latch and a spring-loaded lock so it's kind of a two-handed task to open the door, which is different from the one-handed pinch latch on the smaller crates. I will also affirm that this crate has no holes on the back side, so you may have to drill some out in case you need it for airline travel (a 5/8"" or 3/4"" bit will suffice). So in summary, I think that Riley likes his new crate and I think that he really likes the dark den-like atmosphere afforded by the dark gray color. I'll know he's really good with it when he sets up his lava lamp and puts his pin-ups on the walls.Update at 4 months: Still pleased with this crate. I leave the door open whenever Riley is free in the house, which is 95% of the time, and he regularly goes in by himself just to snooze. The latch mechanism is a bit of trouble to secure sometimes as the whole door kind of floats in place. But there is nothing better in this size range out there - and it's not a deal killer.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RD9SRGLD2U5X6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000H6YWWE#wasThisHelpful","RD9SRGLD2U5X6","A29NYH9RBFV9TH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A29NYH9RBFV9TH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I purchased this antenna to improve my ATT MicroCell installation. Simply getting it up onto a window was not effective, so I drilled a hole through the house wall in preparation of mounting it outside on a small shelf I fabricated out of sheet metal. When I tried to remove the antenna connector from the MicroCell, the connector pulled apart, leaving the outboard-most piece of the connector firmly seated in the MicroCell and the center conductor protruding from the cable. I am an old amateur radio op and know to never pull/tug a connector off of a rig by the cable, and did not do so in removing this connector. I simply grabbed the fat molded-rubber end piece and pulled straight out (it is a MCX-type push/pull fit, not threaded). I examined the broken connector and found no compression ring, marks, or sleeve.I was looking for a bargain when I bought this antenna and got bit in the behind in doing so. You get what you pay for, right? Anyway, avoid this device if you ever plan on having to unplug the antenna, or else fabricate something to aid removal.Also, while the antenna does have an MCX connector, the product photo shows a ribbed metal collar at the distal end of the cable ... which is what seduced me into buying this unit ... but that's not what I received ...

"This is a great product that really works. It's been reviewed thoroughly here but I'll add a few points. First, make sure that your boots are somewhat warm when you put them on to get the best performance out of them. Second, I'm wear a size 9 boot and medium as specified by the manufacturer is somewhat small... I will go with the large next time. Third, consider getting the full DryGuy boot kit that includes the reflective tape for the toe cap of your liner ... I'd say it was a critical part of the functionality of the covers. Lastly, the bottom webbing strap is the chief failure point and it cannot withstand a lot of wear from walking around on hard surfaces. Most skiers may not have this problem, but as a ski patroller, the straps are unavoidably subjected to walking on hard, dirty surfaces whenever I have a case that requires that I head to the treatment room. With about 30-40 ski days per year, I have to replace these every year. Which I dutifully do because they really do work ... even when teaching patrol candidates on the hill when temps are -10degF and we instructors are just standing around while the kiddies play. I hope that the designer/manufacturer comes up with a more robust version ... perhaps kevlar straps would solve this problem. Sport skiers shouldn't traverse the parking lots with the covers on ... wait until you get onto the snow (they are very easy to put on).

"Wow, I just absolutely love my Ursa Turf Wagon. For too many years I owned the $100 mesh-sided Chinese carts that are found everywhere from Amazon to Tractor Supply. And for too many years I increasingly struggled with them as they began rusting away and their cheap tires bought the farm. So when it was time to replace the last cart, I started looking at alternatives. I found Ursa and the price immediately scared me away ... but as I looked deeper into reviews across the web, and particularly on horse sites, it became apparent that the Ursa Wagon was no run-of-the-mill tool. And when I found out that it was made in the USA, that was it ... I hit the checkout button.I was excited when the UPS guy came with the big Ursa box (yes, this kind of thing excites me) and within an hour I was looking at a newly assembled cart in the barn. I was absolutely floored at the design and execution of something that is so seemingly simple. A lot of thought went into every element of the wagon and I have yet to find a manufacturing short-cut on it. And it sure is pretty.Putting it to work was fun, be it hauling stone or firewood. The steering system works great and the wagon turns on a dime. This baby is very easy to pull when fully loaded and the optional Triple Grip makes two-handed pulling a breeze. Dumping the cart is easy ... with 300# of river stone aboard ... because the balance is just right. The ground clearance is excellent and smart, and I can haul the cart around on my woodroad and through brush without getting hung up.So, yes, it's an expensive cart but worth every single penny. Seriously.My only complaint is the handle that so very much needs some kind of latching system to prevent it from falling forward whenever the wheels are turned. Let me clarify: you haul the cart to its destination and park it and if you leave the handle up, it's going to fall forward with a bang as soon as the cart moves a bit. It more hurts the owner's feelings than it hurts the cart. But it would be nice if Ursa designed something to fix this issue ... the Ursa Latch! But my solution: a long bungee cord and a piece of fence wire tied to the end of the bungee at the rear of the bucket. Whenever I park the Ursa Wagon, I stretch the bungee from the rear of the bucket to the grip and we're good to go. Bottom line though: this issue is NOT a deal killer. This cart is my favorite outdoor tool and I use it every day across all four seasons.And again, made in USA? I am all over that.

"I am currently running one of the FI9821W cams as a puppy cam in the house. I also have three FI9805W outdoor cameras outside of the house, with one overlooking the brook to keep an eye on water level, one overlooking the dog's fenced-in area, and one as a driveway security camera. I love the picture quality of this camera! It is remarkable, as is the ability to pan and tilt. I like the mount that comes with it, too, as you can vary the angle of the camera base to get further down below the horizontal in case you have your cam mounted high up on a wall. The IR illumination is excellent.All of my Foscam cams work well and set-up was fairly easy (especially after you get the first one running). You have to read the directions thoroughly and follow them carefully ... and have a bit of patience. Make sure that you do the firmware update and know how to get at your router's web interface before you start. I purchased Blue Iris as a desktop monitor and run LiveCamsPro on my iPhone and iPad ... all were easy to set up, too. In regular operation, the cams all intermittently drop signal for a few seconds here and there and quickly regain it - which works fine for me so I have not drilled down to see why that happens. It happens fairly often regardless of the distance to the router, etc... so one star off for that characteristic. I know that my NetGear N600 router is not the problem as I run other wireless devices off of it without problem. If the dropouts lasted longer or the cams did not come back on, I'd knock off more stars.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3CNYZOIPVR12J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00F3KWZW8#wasThisHelpful","R3CNYZOIPVR12J","A29NYH9RBFV9TH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A29NYH9RBFV9TH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This review can basically be summed up in one word: wow.We live in an old 1890 farmhouse that sits aside a stream and I wanted to install a webcam so that I can watch it when heavy storms are in the area. You know, so that the wife and I and our dog can flee when The Big One hits and washes the place downstream. So I picked up a Foscam FI9805W outdoor camera and set it up about 60LF from my wireless router. Well it could not maintain a reliable connection to the router ... let alone any kind of quality feed. Being an old ham radio op, I was thinking yagi ... but having had great luck with panel antennae in the 5.8GHz band for video downlinks for multirotor flying, I figured I'd give a panel antenna a try for this application. Well raise my rent, I've gone from SIGNAL NOT FOUND about every two minutes to a full-blown 30FPS feed that just won't quit. All hail 14dBi.The direction sheet notes that you need to seal the SMA connector at the camera end to ensure that the rig is waterproof (the coax is integral with the antenna body on the other end). This implies that the antenna itself is waterproof ... I have been trying to verify that but no luck yet. Perhaps I need to take it apart after the next heavy rain and see if there is any water infiltration.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1V4J4YF9SZ2E3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00G2G61E0#wasThisHelpful","R1V4J4YF9SZ2E3","A29NYH9RBFV9TH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A29NYH9RBFV9TH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"If you have a Kestrel meter, you need this case. It is very well designed, very rugged, and includes one of the best belt/strap clips I've ever seen on an accessory case. I've used the clip on my belt, the front of my backpack straps, on the front of my field vest, and on my field-notes kneeboard ... it is bombproof. The price of this case is also spot on ... which is interesting, because Kestrel robs you for two simple die-cut screen protectors for almost the same price! Other reviewers have spoken highly about the sensor cutout - it is a very useful design that allows the meter to continue to track ambient conditions instead of conditions inside of the case (which could be buffered or affected by its proximity to your body). I still have no idea as to the purposes of the two long elastic loops (one inside and one outside) - maybe for a pen, but certainly not to hold battery spares ... but hey, to me they are just lipstick on a pig and I love bacon, so, so be it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R8PJ7Z8FUD3WV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001JEPK56#wasThisHelpful","R8PJ7Z8FUD3WV","A29NYH9RBFV9TH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A29NYH9RBFV9TH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have been a fan of Kestrel instruments for years in my work as an ecologist and as an avocational meteorologist. I just upgraded to the 4500 meter and thought that it would be useful to pick up the vane kit for use in a pollen dispersal study. When the kit arrived, I was quite disappointed in the quality of the rig. How they could call the pivot a ""precision pivot"" is beyond me as it takes at least 3 mph and sometimes more to turn a best-effort-leveled rig. The system cries out for a bearing and I stared at it for a long while trying to figure out how to retrofit one into it .. before finally deciding to send it back. Also - the kit did not include ""clear washers"" spec'd significantly in the documentation; there is no tripod included, although it is depicted on the sales page; the clamp on the lower R side of the product photo is also not included; there is no positive lock in the aluminum shaft assembly to ensure that the vane is perfectly vertical; and the case has pockets and straps that I've still not figured out how to use (but hey, I'm just a common idiot, so YMMV).I certainly can understand why Kestrel has cut the price of this rig by 20+ %. Cut it another 30% and maybe it would be worth it.

"I purchased this as a replacement for the OEM hose that came with my Rigid 3300psi pressure washer, after my neighbor borrowed the washer and apparently dropped it from a C-130 somewhere over Afghanistan and then had it shipped home on a pirate ship ... somehow puncturing the OEM hose (and bending the frame, and bending an axle, and then returning it without saying a word). That abject lesson in neighbor etiquette aside, this is an excellent, top-quality industrial hose that includes robust quick connects. Simply uncoil it the first time you're ready to use it - to let out any kink demons - and then plug it into your washer and wand and you're good to go. One thing: when you are coiling it up after use, disconnect it from your washer and wand, and then roll it up ... don't try to coil it in one hand like a climbing or rodeo rope ... it cannot absorb twisting like a rope. I lay it out across 50' of driveway and then walk along rolling it up at chest height as if it were on a hub. Bingo! No kinks! But protect those QCs to ensure a long life.

"This is one of the most ""real"" dog training DVDs out there. Ardis has put together a very straightforward, no-nonsense training DVD that gets right to the point. He uses the three-step process of teaching that has been proven to be the most effective way of transferring information (tell them what you're going to tell them, tell them, and tell them what you told them). Thus, for each training element, he first introduces the concept, then he switches to a clip or clips that demonstrate(s) exactly how to accomplish the task. Next is a short summation, and then a point list is shown on the screen (""To Review: 1., 2., 3., ...""). Very well done!The production values are not Hollywood - and that's fine with me.

"I must confess that I finished Warner's book in a less happy state than when I started it. I expected something a little different. For example, I thought that there might be more historical analysis of fairy tales, or even, perhaps a more detailed exploration of how the same tale might have varied across times and geographies.Instead, there were times when her  approach became a bit piecemeal, so that whilst she was certainly citing a lot of varying research, I was not altogether sure what points she was really making. And in fact, there were also times when I felt her points were generalised, partial, or even - wrong - there was quite a lot of application of twenty-first century analysis applied backwards, implying that the vision WE might have, today, of the meaning of a story, was the same as the meaning of the story back in the mists of 400-600 years earlier.The most glaring example of this, to my mind, was her interpretation of the Rapunzel story, at the end of which Rapunzel is thrown out by the witch because she has been hauling up a prince into the tower on her magical rope of hair, and is now pregnant with twins.Warner asserts that one of the `hidden meanings' of this story is `an unapologetic call for sex education for the young' I'm afraid I snorted in derision at that one. It might well be so, if it were written today, but, at the time?She also rather sweepingly categorises the differences between `myth' and `fairy tale' thus - classical mythology is all about the doings of gods and goddesses - a link therefore to religion, whereas `fairy-tales' are about ordinary people coming into contact with `magic'. W-e-e-l l - as many many fairy stories feature as central characters, protagonists, princes and princesses, one must wonder how `ordinary' these folk are.There have of course been several main strands through which the twentieth/twentyfirst century has interpreted `fairy' - firstly, through socio-political viewfinders, so that they may be seen as having a class-conscious point. Some fairy tales were regarded as bourgeois/revisionist and therefore unacceptable inside the former Communist bloc. The other main strand is of course psychological - post-Freudian interpretations. And finally, a feminist perspective - which either (depending on the story) celebrates the feisty, tricksy outwitting female -  Gretel in Hansel and Gretel or damns such behaviour so that fairy offers up only passivity as the role model - sleeping victimised princesses - and reserves opprobrium for the witch/bitch stepmother/older woman.In the end, although there is usefully garnered research, I just was not sure what points Warner was making, other than to say `look, fairy stories are much more than narratives told by grannies to little ones, here are some frightfully grown up writers who could also be regarded as using some of the elements of fairytale - eg Kafka, transformations, Metamorphosis, the magic realists like Gabriel Garcia Marquez, Isabel Allende, Angela Carter, and, ooh look, fairy also turns up in ballet - Swan Lake, and opera, The Magic Flute, and there are masses and masses of movies doing wonderful things with fairy tales'","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2G83BQO0KXQIY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0198718659#wasThisHelpful","R2G83BQO0KXQIY","A3MTULATO06OS5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3MTULATO06OS5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A beautifully written physical and emotional journey: love and loss on Mallorca, 1948-2005Peter Nichols The Rocks is an elegantly written read, with an interesting circular structureIt starts in 2005, with the accidental death of 2 British expats, octogenarians, who were briefly married shortly after the Second World War but then, weeks after the wedding, had a cataclysmic separation, and have not spoken to each other since. Despite living within a handful of miles away from each other, and both using the same coastal village for provisions, social meetings and the like, they have also consciously sought to avoid meeting each other by chanceGerald was something of a loner, in love with the sea, and also fascinated by Homer's Odyssey. It was whilst attempting to reconstruct Odysseus' journey, from Troy to Ithaka that he hove into port on Mallorca, met Lulu, married her, separated quickly, but never left the island. He wrote a book, and scratched out a penurious living from olive trees and lemon groves, in love with the land as much as he had been with the sea and his sailing boat.Lulu, a woman of great beauty and spirit, had had a much easier life, due to the generosity of wealthy friends. Her house, The Rocks serves as a hotel for well-heeled members of the intelligentsia. Lulu has become a famous hostess for the wealthy, arty set.Both Lulu and Gerald married other people, and the marriages had different outcomes for each of them, but both produced children, now grown. The second generation have a kind of mirror history to their parentsWe do not know what happened between Gerald and Lulu, but the `journey to Ithaka' - the influence of Cavafy is strong, and his poem, Ithaka - is the theme of the novel :Keep Ithaka always in your mind. Arriving there is what you are destined for.But do not hurry the journey at all.Better if it lasts for years,so you are old by the time you reach the island,Wealthy with all you have gained on the way,Not expecting Ithaka to make you rich.The melancholy, adventurous, sad longing of the poem is the same, blue, quality of this bookIts Ithakan journey spools backwards in time from the opening, to take us from the opening death of Lulu and Gerald, back in stages of 5-10 years or so, to the events which created the terrible parting, and, then, forwards once more.This was for sure an immersive read, though I did have a few question marks over the 1970, Marrakech set section. Given the times, the place and the characters involved I did not completely believe the restraint which the central characters in that section were showing (can't say more, fear of spoilers). I could see that Nichols needed things to happen as they did (or didn't) in order to drive the plot. But I wasn't completely convinced that he had written events in a way which was true to the character of the two friends, and to their connections with each other. So my interest did waver in that section as I lost some confidence in authenticity and integrity of characters who felt sacrificed to the gods of plot.I received this as a review copy from Amazon Vine, UK","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RK25E5OX5RKC8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1594633312#wasThisHelpful","RK25E5OX5RKC8","A3MTULATO06OS5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3MTULATO06OS5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Although I haven't read any of Nicholson's novels before, I am aware of him as a writer of refinement in dealing with a certain kind of English emotional restraint , where `still waters run deep' . This writerly strength, not to mention this strength in writing the lives of writers, was clearly shown in his stage play, Shadowlands, previously a TV play, later a film, exploring the life of C.S.Lewis, and particularly, his relationship with Joy Davidman/Joy Gresham.I was therefore attracted to this book, which explores the life and work of another writer, the American poet Emily Dickinson, and also that of her brother, Austin Dickinson, and of Mabel Loomis Todd, who was the principal champion and driving force behind getting Dickinson's poems published after her death. Mabel, a young and vibrant woman and the reclusive middle aged Emily never met, though Emily communicated with Mabel through sending her poems. Mabel, a married woman, and Austin, a married man (though not to each other) had a relationship which began its flowering in the dining room of Emily Dickinson's house, the only place they could conceivably meet to consummate their affair. Austin was in his 50s at the time of his relationship with Mabel, who was in her 20s. Mabel was in a remarkably open marriage for 1880's Amherst, Massachusetts society - her husband, David, had relationships with other women, which Mabel knew about, and sanctioned, and David too, sanctioned and approved of Mabel's relationship with Austin. Indeed, the two became close friends, and eventually the Todds found land which they could build on, (they had been renting short leases before) and where Mabel could meet with her lover. She and David continued to have a physical relationship. Austin, meanwhile, was in an unhappy marriage with Sue, who had initially been great friends with the remarkable Mabel, until the close emotional, spiritual and intellectual friendship between Mabel and Austin became more than platonic. Sue disliked sex, and Austin and she had been husband and wife without any sexual connection for many years. Emily, meanwhile, wrote poetry of huge passion and spiritual content, which seethes with the possibility that the spiritual, soulful intensity of her writing about love and connection may have been sublimated sexuality - or, possibly that she had had some earlier romantic experience to draw on, in her poetry. Emily never married, and lived withdrawn completely from society, looked after by her sister Vinnie.""I've none to tell me to but theeSo, when Thou failest, nobody.It was a little tie -It held just Two, nor those it heldSince somewhere thy sweet Face has spilledBeyond my Boundary -""What a hotbed mixture of both openness and secrecy, emotional expressiveness and emotional repression, co-existing within the strangle-hold of the morality of the place and the times.Nicholson structures his book with a further twist - Alice, a British writer, who herself has a rather complex relationship with loneliness, connection and intimacy, is preparing a film script in which she will explore Emily, her poetry, and that complex relationship between Mabel, Austin, and herself. The theme of watching, watchfulness and a kind of distance which in inherent in the idea of Mabel and Austin's initial use of Emily's house in which to carry out their tryst - with Emily, perhaps, as voyeur - is echoed by sections in the book where scenes from the screenplay are written from the point of view of Emily, as the eye of the camera, the watcher. And of course, the audience/the reader becomes an even more distanced eye, and thinks of the voyeuristic nature of fiction and film, perhaps""That's what we do with love. Create a story to overlay the passing events of our lives so that a pattern emerges. What was random develops meaning.Love as story-telling""The real letters between Austin and Mabel are full of philosophical questioning and discussion about the nature of love, its purpose, and the search for meaning. Alice herself is obsessed with these questions, and her two week stay in Amherst academia brings her into contact with a much older man, Nick Crocker, an academic, who is charismatic but also someone searching for meaning, and questioning the nature of love. So there are various prisms through which ideas can be examined.""So what about love? Is that just one of the little pleasures that fills our dwindling store of days?""The Emily, Mabel, Austin story (not to mention the Alice story) is further illuminated by Emily's poems, which Alice is working into her script, and which she discusses with Crocker.It also turns out that Nicholson in writing a loosely linked series of novels (this, I think, is title six, and there are various connections between the invented characters on the periphery of this novel, who have been more central in earlier novels, and also, there are characters and events in this which are, in Nicholson's words, `more seeds which I've planted, waiting for their turn to flower'I received this as a review copy from Amazon Vine, UK","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R18J8S7BVKIY8U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SX2RIUM#wasThisHelpful","R18J8S7BVKIY8U","A3MTULATO06OS5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3MTULATO06OS5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"John Steinbeck's Pulitzer prize-winning novel was both a colossus of a book, an infinitely worthy winner, and a far-from perfect book, a flawed book.On the front of the paperback version I started to read (before downloading from Kindle, as there was just too much I needed to underline) was the following quote from Steinbeck:""I've done my damndest to rip a reader's nerves to rags, I don't want him satisfied""The Grapes of Wrath was published in 1939 when the machinery of war was providing a terrible solution to the stock market crash and depression of the 30s, which is the subject of this book. It is a book written out of white hot, red hot rage, disgust and righteous polemic against an indifferent, blinkered and self-obsessed capitalism.The book follows the fortunes of one small family, the Joads, Oklahoma small farmers, homesteaders, and how the move from small family farming to larger and larger conglomerates, changed and destroyed our connections to the land itself, and to each other.The Joads stand for the thousands of other, unnamed, the small men and women.Like thousands of other homesteaders, losing their land and their livelihood in the face of conglomerate rapacity, the Joads follow the lure of jobs to be had, fruit-picking (for virtually starvation wages) in CaliforniaSteinbeck for sure uses and manipulates his readers, hectors them, lectures them, throws the red book at them, shoves our faces up against our own indifference, our sentimentality, our complicity. Having lacerated us with bruising accounts of our hard-heartedness, of our denial of the beggars in our neighbourhood, he cunningly and deliberately rubs salt in our wounds by exploiting our sentimentality.The deaths of many, through starvation and illness because of starvation, and the deaths and the suffering of some of the individuals whose journeys we follow, in the book are intercut with the casual death and suffering of animals, whether by our carelessness, or the carelessness of a red in tooth and claw natural world.Where are we most hurt, where do we weep most - is it for the suffering of our own kind, or is it for the suffering of another species. I knew my tears and my grief for the death of an animal were manipulated by the writer. But I also knew why, and I knew what he was showing me about myself, and could not, in any way, fault his manipulation here.Steinbeck also punches the reader, again and again, with the righteousness of left wing politics, the infamy of capital. Yes, we live in a world where it is now easy to see that communism and socialism (not to mention other isms) can be as self-serving of its own ideology, as much inclined to sacrifice the individual on the alter of its own drive to `progress' and `the ends justify the means' - but I don't personally have any problem with his polemic, placed in its own time.Yes, for sure there are long sections which are boring, where, for example, pages and pages are devoted to the hard graft of repairing cars - but, again, I don't mind, because he is wanting to make the reader realise the skill and the dignity of manual work. And yes, there are also at times problems with trying to give a flavour of the speech of the common man - at times the setting down of dialect gets wearing, and makes characters sound a bit simple or idiotic (my prejudices showing, clearly) , whereas this is not what is intended, and I think, again, Steinbeck is trying to offset a literature which is written by, and for, the ruling classes and the intelligentsia.I have to forgive all these `flaws', these niceties, about what literature should be, how it should NOT be polemic, how we should NOT be so at times crassly manipulated, because this is a book whose power, whose beauty, whose hugeness overrides its imperfections.My nerves are indeed ragged, I am sick and sore, hurt and confused. I feel as if I have been run over by a proverbial ten ton truck, repeatedly, and then, offered exquisite flowers, delicate, fragile moments, writing of transcendent glory, before, again Steinbeck punches me in the gut and delivers yet another knock-out blow, of polemic, putting me through the emotional wringer, or boring me with the innards of motors.But I don't care. This is a book which seethes with enormous power, and the roughness of its sometime edges are part of that power. `Perfection' would be, in this case, something to inhibit the power.I'm grateful, very grateful, to another reviewer (FictionFan) whose own superb review kicked me into reading thisFinally, this particular Kindle download version is brilliant, interlaced as it is with wonderful reproductions of paintings and drawings and stills from the movie which was made of this book. Thanks, again, to FictionFan for persuading me to this version .","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1FARDV2O2MXDL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00S5MU1FO#wasThisHelpful","R1FARDV2O2MXDL","A3MTULATO06OS5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3MTULATO06OS5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Jane Casey's The Last Girl is book 3 in a series written around the Met murder squad. Casey follows, particularly, the fortunes of her central character, Maeve Kerrigan, who in this book is a DC. Without having read any of the others I don't know whether she moves up the ranks in later books!What I particularly liked in this is the edgy, irritable relationship between Kerrigan, a thoughtful, intelligent young woman, and her immediate superior, DI Josh Derwent. Whereas Kerrigan has definite people skills and an understanding of psychology Derwent is a bull in the china shop, abrasive, intimidating, and an unremittingly sexist old dinosaur (like some of his fellow colleagues) Nevertheless, Kerrigan and Derwent have a curious kind of respect for each other, and are a good foil, in some ways. Most gloriously, Derwent is definitely in the Life on Mars/Ashes to Ashes Gene Hunt mode. A man so crass, so eye-wateringly rude, that his dreadful `you can't say that.....you can't even THINK that' pronouncements are darkly hilarious - because Maeve Kerrigan lets Derwent's crassness just roll off her like water off a duck's back - she recognises he is a bit of a pathetic puppy under the bluster, and he is certainly no predator.The particular crime under investigation in this one, is the murder of the wife and daughter of an unlikeable defence barrister, Philip Kennford, who is indeed a sexual predator, a serial philanderer. And moreover someone who has a bad history as far as the police are concerned, getting vicious criminals who are definitely guilty, off, due to his brilliance at the bar. And he has made a lot of enemies.Simultanously, along with the investigation of the domestic crime, is an ongoing enquiry into continuing gangland violence which is being overseen by Superintendant Godley, and this particular investigation will overlap the Kennford murder case. Not to mention begin to uncover some crossing the line activity within the Met itself.The tight knit, incestuous jockeying for promotion and advantage within the police team, echoes nicely with the more brutal attempts to become top dog in the drugs related battles for who controls the street supply, with traditional South London godfathers facing new rivals moving in on the turf from Eastern Europe.And it turns out that the Kennford family is itself a remarkably complicated one, as Kennford is on to his second marriage and has a string of discarded partners, some of whom may have been intimidated into having sex, by virtue of his professional power over them.With several tribes snapping at each others heels like hyenas, jockeying for pole position, whether as alpha females within the confused collection of past and present women around Kennford, the rivalries around seniority and promotion in the police teams, and the most deadly playing out of the battle for control of London's underworld, there is a lot of plot happening.Casey creates interesting characters with believeable relationships, and I particularly enjoyed the police procedural - there's not too much interminable detail around computers, it's mainly unravelling what is going on between people.The final denouement of the main murder, when it came, the unwinding, I have to say I wasn't completely enamoured of, not finding it fully credible.Nonetheless, an enjoyable read.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2Z47AFOD79Q95/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00B228C82#wasThisHelpful","R2Z47AFOD79Q95","A3MTULATO06OS5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3MTULATO06OS5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Sean Michaels is a Canadian author, and Us Conductors, astonishingly, is his first novel, and won Canada's version of the Man Booker, the Scotiabank Giller Prize. Without having read the other nominations, perhaps I can't comment : but this is an wonderful book, and I had completely surrendered to it by a handful of pages in, because, however the story was going to unfold, and whoever the characters were going to be, it was blazingly clear that here was a writer using language and imagery with beauty, conveying a lot with economy and precision. It made sense that this is a book about music (among other subjects) I think of notes, and the harmonics which arise from them, and I felt that quality in Michael's use of language, I kind of realised, he was taking about more than one subject at a time :""Lev Sergeyvich Termen is not the voice of the ether. He is not the principle that turned glass into firefly. I am an instrument. I am a sound , being sounded, music being made, blood, salt and water manipulated inair. I come from Leningrad. With my bare hands, I have killed one man. I was born on August 15th, 1896, and at that instant I became an object moving through space toward you.""Michaels teases the reader with the following statement, before the book begins""This book is mostly inventions""Having finished the book, I smiled even more broadly at the clever double meanings in his disclaimer, which is followed by a quote from Tennessee Williams""In memory, everything seems to happen to music""Leon/Lev Termen was a scientist and inventor, whose initial fame came through his invention of the theremin:  ` an electronic musical instrument in which the tone is generated by two high-frequency oscillators and the pitch controlled by the movement of the performer's hand towards and away from the circuit'Termen was a believer in the Revolution, and a believer in his country. He travelled to America as part of a trade initiative for Russia, between the wars, where the theremin, and his other electronic inventions presented opportunities, both to demonstrate the dynamism of Russia, the brilliance of its scientists, and to generate capital. Also, it appears that under the aegis of trade, espionage possibilities were possible.In America, which Termen found an exciting country, and one which welcomed his brilliance, both as someone who was an artist, and as someone who was a scientist, he met a woman who was to completely obsess him - a Lithuanian born violinist, Clara Reisenberg, (later Clara Rockmore)  Clara, in her teens, developed bone problems which cut short her burgeoning career as a violin virtuoso. However her musicality, and her meeting with Termen and the theremin, meant she studied how to play this, not as some kind of gimmick, but as an instrument in its own right.Although Termen by all accounts proposed to Clara several times, she married another.Meanwhile, Termen was inventing various security devices as well as refining musical ones, but was probably involved in darker matters. His loyalty to his mother country and those who were `minding' him in his sojourn in America, led to his involvement as an industrial spy for Russia.And then, in 1938 he was suddenly recalled to Russia, where he found himself regarded as a class enemy, and was imprisoned, and sent to the gulags.None of these pieces of information are really spoilers, as they were rather what I gleaned the book was about from the publisher blurbI decided not to investigate the finer points of biographical truth in Michaels' astonishing novel `this book is mostly inventions' till I had finished. And indeed at the end of the book the author does reveal what is true, and what might not strictly be true, but may have been pieced together from research and also from creative imagination""Because it trusts the worker's own senses, not the knowledge locked  away in the lessons and textbooks of the elites, the theremin becomes a revolutionary device - a levelling of the means of musical production""These are the bare bones of the book, a story of a man with a rather remarkable life, but this is far more than a biography, it is of course a work of literary fiction, a gorgeous thing, a meditation on the power of music and art, on politics, on Russia, on love as a compass needle for a life.I was, often, breathless reading this, particularly those sections set in the gulag""The winter came quickly, in place of fall. I lived only barely, by coincidence. At the end of every workday, wrecked, ruined, we trudged back into the camp. We queued for our evening mean: a morsel of herring, a spoonful of pea soup, bread. Someone might steal the soup or fish, but never the scrap of limp brown bread. The prisoners had made this rule themselves. This is humanity, at the end of the world: the refusal to tear away a piece of bread""I was delighted to be offered this as an ARC from the publishers, via Netgalley.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RGMC8K5ZPQ97H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1935639811#wasThisHelpful","RGMC8K5ZPQ97H","A3MTULATO06OS5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3MTULATO06OS5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I started Kate Forsyth's The Wild Girl, a weaving of the story of the Brothers Grimm and the mostly female storytellers who recounted the folk tales to the brothers, with high hopes, which, sadly, were never quite met.I'd recently read Forsyth's earlier book for adults, Bitter Greens, a wonderfully woven story of the real woman at the court of Louis 1Vth, the Sun King, Charlotte-Rose de Caumont de la Force, who was a story teller and writer, and how her life underlined the inner story of the fairy/folk tale of Rapunzel, one of the stories which she narrated. In that book, Forsyth does a brilliant juggling act with three voices, the real Charlotte Rose, the character within the Rapunzel story, and an ancient sister in a convent who explains a certain mystery around the Rapunzel story's real provenance.In this later book, there is one central narrator told in the third person voice, that of Dortchen Wild, `The Wild Girl' (double meanings inherent). Set in the early part of the nineteenth century, the story is one of real people and real history, interspersed with versions of the folk tales the Grimm Brothers collected. However, where research yields certain facts, there are always holes in the why of things, and it is this which lies at the heart of Forsyth's book, both its strength, in lifting dry facts into something which makes sense in the lives of real people, and its weakness - sometimes suppositions may be delivered as a kind of dark secret, a skeleton in a cupboard; one which may in fact be either bare, or hold a different skeleton entirely.The facts are these : the Grimm Brothers were very poor, and their family was large - mainly brothers, with one sister. This sister was the playmate of one of the daughters of a neighbouring large family - predominantly daughters, of a higher financial strata - the Wild father was a herbalist. One of the daughters, Dortchen, 7 years younger than Wilhem Grimm, was the source of many of those stories. Wilhelm and Dortchen wished to marry. The Wild paterfamilias was a harsh father and the poverty of the Grimm's meant permission was denied. Indeed, the Wild father was overbearing, cruel, and incredibly controlling, by all accounts. Neither Dortchen nor Wilhelm married others, though their regard for each other was noted.The historical background of this was primarily taking place as Bonaparte was building France an Empire, and Europe - whether in countries already occupied by France, or fighting against occupation - was at war, and its citizens often near starvation to fund that war.When the Wild father dies, the obstacle to Dortchen and William marrying was removed, yet there was a 10 year wait, filled with unhappiness for both, before that marriage happened, and it seemed to be in the end to have been a happy marriage, which both desired. It is Forsyth's `invention, or perhaps her intuition - true or false - which provides the answers to that 10 year wait.I had a certain unease, which I get frequently, when the lives of real people are used for invention - specifically when what is invented may be blackwash. It may be true - but then again, it may not be. It's a kind of ethical dilemma really, possibly calumny against a long dead person whom no one has probably heard of (except research scholars)My second slight disappointment was with the extreme, almost undecorated simplicity of the story-telling and language in which it is told. Forsyth is clear and plain, perhaps too clear, too plain - in some ways it is of course the perfect voice for the telling of a fairy tale, as this is the strength of the fairy tale, its language is unvarnished, without much in the way of descriptive embellishment. But fairy tales are short. This is a novel of over 500 pages, and I began to long for the dreadful waiting for Dortchen and Wilhelm to be condensed, for the story to be nipped and tucked and condensed - or, alternatively the language in which it was being told to have more variation and richness of toneIt is certainly a more than okay book, and the weaving of some of the stories being collected, and the real events in the lives of the two families, not to mention an excellent evocation of time, place and historical detail, are all strengths, but it needed more sparkle, I think, in the telling. True, there wasn't, often, much to sparkle at - unlike her earlier book, where both Charlotte-Rose and the ancient nun were both women of wit and vivacity - the central characters in this book are all fairly ground down and a little too dour to allow for much light and colour3  stars, rounded up","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3HWQNJNVJ78F5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CW0G5A0#wasThisHelpful","R3HWQNJNVJ78F5","A3MTULATO06OS5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3MTULATO06OS5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I received this enchanting, quirky, feel-good romance with a definite fairy-tale structure from the publisher, Chatto and Windus, via NetGalley, in return for an honest review.And my honest review is as cheerily warm and appreciative as the book itselfSara Lindqvist is a shy, spinsterish Swedish woman who adores reading, and worked in a bookshop. She strikes up an epistolary friendship with an elderly woman from Iowa, Amy Harris, who is also a great lover of books, and lives in a small town, Broken Wheel, which is dying. Much of their letter writing exchange, which goes on for over 2 years, is about books, and they send these to each other. Amy is clearly the kind of person with a big heart, and a lot of wisdom and patience, who rather enjoys the small foibles of humankind, and nonetheless has visions of wider horizons.""John says I think about historic injustices too much. Maybe he's right, but it's just that it doesn't feel historic to me. We never seem to be able to accept responsibility for them. First, we say that's just how things are, then we shrug our shoulders and say that's just how things were, that things are different now. No thanks to us, I want to reply, but no one ever seems to want to hear that""Eventually, Sara sets out for a 2 month holiday to visit Amy.Unfortunately Amy happened to die whilst Sara was en route..............So, what IS this book about - small people with a fair share of problems, a lot of humanity, and the fairy tale of a person who is the glue who brings people together. Amy was that person for Broken Wheel, and Sara, to her surprise, discovers that she is some kind of combination of both fairy godmother AND Cinderella, and, indeed, that pretty well everyone can go to the ball!Tipping a definite nod to the that true story of how bibliophiles engaged across the ocean - Helen Hanff's 84 Charing Cross Road, The Readers of Broken Wheel Recommend...., features both the letters between Sara and Amy, and the strange and magical account of what might happen when a passionate reader rides into town with her cavalry of books, and somehow magic happensRest assured, to those who dislike the genre, this is not `magical realism', it is, however, realism made out of `in an ideal world' rather than realism full of grit and despair.Passionate readers will delight at the appearance of all sorts of books, from the very highest of brows, to the most populist of beach reads.""The last thing Sara had done was get hold of a new shelf, on which she placed every unreadable book she could find, alongside every Pulitzer Prize-winner, Nobel Prize recipient and nominee for the Booker Prize""First-time author Katarina Bivald had her book published in her native language (Swedish, of course) in 2013. And I can offer no higher praise to her translator Alice Menzies than to say I had to keep checking the title page in disbelief that this was a novel `in translation' Beautifully done.And Bivald, like her heroine, is also a bibliophile who is not quite sure whether she doesn't prefer books to people..........though the evident generosity in her writing, and her viewpoint shows she rather loves bothBivald's lovely warmth, humour, whimsicality and heart in the creation of her small-town community reminded me, yes, of the Hanff book, yes. of The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society, but also of Armistead Maupin's wonderful community in his `Tales of The City' novels. It's not just the subject matter which brings up comparisons, its also the joyousness, the heart, the humour and the artistryWe have perhaps become too used to thinking of Scandinavian writers as being the source of noir crime fiction. If this book is an example of Scandi RomCom - bring it on!""Sara couldn't help but wonder what life might be like if you couldn't daydream about Mr Fitzwilliam Darcy (how had she decided on that name? One of literary history's most inexplicable mysteries), because you yourself had created him.""If I were to be a little picky, I think the book might have been a tad tighter as we got towards the end we are inevitably getting towards, and Bivald could perhaps have stepped on the accelerator, as within the last few chapters we know the destination, and kind of want journey's end, rather than to admire the view one last time, but this is a small observation.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R4WW6LQMJLN4N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TQDWHJO#wasThisHelpful","R4WW6LQMJLN4N","A3MTULATO06OS5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3MTULATO06OS5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"So states the female central character of the eighteenth century set The Song of The Sea Maid.I have been eagerly and anxiously waiting for Rebecca Mascull's second novel The Song of The Sea-Maid, after her first novel, The Visitors, was one of my stand-out novels of 2014Starting towards the tail end of the 1730s, the book follows the story of a young girl, initially unnamed; one with a ferocious intelligence, a watchful observance, even at aged 4, as a young vagrant, living through stealing what she can in the company of her older brother. I was immediately captivated by this child, and Mascull took me inside her head, I could hear her voice, the excitement, the undisciplined, dynamic, finely assessing intelligence of the child.Little Dawnay Price is arbitrarily named by and for the `benefactor' who captures her on the street and takes her to a place for destitute, impoverished children. The place is presided over by a man who sees nothing wrong in the fact that such destitution is not the children's fault, and neither may it be the fault of the parents, but rather of the structure of a society which gives to the haves and castigates the have-nots. Little Dawnay - whose voice is utterly believeable, whose intelligence, originality and burning desire for learning captivates - is of course doubly disenfranchised, by being a girl, and a powerless poor girl at that.By a series of fortuitous encounters with people of unusual benevolence and open-mindedness, and ability to stand against a morality which defended the status quo, Dawnay begins to transcend her bleak beginnings, and gets an education. This is, after all, The Enlightenment. Dawnay's observant mind and ability to grasp complex practical and philosophical concepts  mark her out as a `natural philosopher' - in other words, a scientist.She has an independent nature, an independent mind, and through those lucky encounters, becomes a person of some independent means.Eventually her travels - both in the world of books, of knowledge, and out in the real world, lead her to begin to formulate some very advanced conclusions - questioning the existence of a Deity, and making suppositions about evolution - a good century in advance of DarwinNow, Mascull is a meticulous researcher, as was clear in The Visitors, and also in this book. She is one who also manages to wear her research lightly, in that the reader does not feel lectured by the author, but her wealth of background reading is woven into the novel.However, with a novel which has a female scientist, and moreover one coming out with some very advanced theories a century early, the reader might find themselves frowning and thinking too much licence is being taken by the author. Mascull clearly anticipates this, as at the end of the novel she explains what her researches threw up. Firstly, there WERE a few female `natural philosophers' at this time. In the main, we do not widely know of them, because history is written by the winners, the rulers, the elite. And because of this, the farther we go back in time, the less likely it is that history will feature herstory. There were also `proto-evolutionary theories' bobbing around, there were fossils, and fossil hunters, even though it wasn't till a little later that Cuvier began to bring this discipline into mainstream.The challenge I found, however, - and it's one which Mascull admits - is that all those female `natural philosophers' were wealthy, daughters of the ruling classes. She did not want to write a kind of fictionalised biography of one of them, and was interested instead in writing the fiction of someone who had more struggles to engage with than purely that of her gender.As reader,  I wasn't altogether believing of all the good fortune Dawnay experienced, and perhaps particularly, the fact that she did not suffer the violence which a young woman, alone in a man's world, breaking the codes, living solitary, would be most likely to encounter. I did wonder if Mascull's clear kindness and desire for her characters to overcome challenges was glossing over potential dangers and keeping them well out of Dawnay's way. It struck me that almost all the characters in the book have a kind of nobility of nature - certainly all the characters we really get to know well. The adversities Dawnay meets are those of broad attitudes and beliefs held in society, rather than individual people with malevolent intent.So this was an interesting realisation - challenge and struggle and overcoming odds is the stuff of both life itself and literature. Mascull does not have Dawnay particularly engaged in struggle with an individual `predator', rather, the struggle is that of cultural and, indeed physical environment (very long term view Darwinian!) . Various historical events, whether created by mankind or by natural disaster also become the field of struggle and adversity which must be survived.In the central swathe of this book,  Mascull's wonderful ability to capture individual emotional tone, the voice in the head, of the central character was not quite present for me. What was happening instead, was considered observation, analysis of theory. It wasn't the sense of an author being determined to use her research material. Dawnay herself is doing the puzzling out and the analysis. Mascull's writing  continued  precise, careful, avoiding clich, but I missed the emotional quality taking me into feeling the heart of the character.And I believe this is because, during the central core of the book, what drives Dawnay Price is her scientific interest. Actually, Mascull was succeeding rather too well. Dawnay is always observing, reflecting, analysing - and doing that scientific thing of standing at remove. I absolutely believed Dawnay, but I could not quite get close to her.And then in the latter part of the book Dawnay makes some significant journeys in her own emotional development, as well as the journey in scientific understanding and analysis, and at this point, with a rush, I was back with the same kind of engagement and freshness that Mascull created and crafted in the voice of the young Dawnay.Rebecca Mascull is a fascinating writer. Old fashioned, in many ways - she's not doing edgy, flamboyant pyrotechnics in structure. There are interesting characters, particularly of course her central character. There is a narrative, things happen, people change. And her writing is excellent. Her books don't end when you close the last page, but continue to provoke reflection.Strongly recommended - this is one which can provoke good and fruitful discussion. And the more I reflected on the book, the more I came to love it. It sustains and grows, long after the final page.Terrific. A vindication of the pleasures of reading...........a book which draws the reader in, deceptively making it an easy, page turning journey, and then pounces on the complacent, relaxed reader and swallows them up!I was delighted, not to mention impatient, to receive this hot off the advanced press as an ARC.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1OLJ3J4CARQ8W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OGLKJZU#wasThisHelpful","R1OLJ3J4CARQ8W","A3MTULATO06OS5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3MTULATO06OS5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Norman Collins, writer, sometime publisher with Gollancz, creator of the Left Book Club series of books and was later in charge of BBC Radio's Light Programme. Later still, he was controller of television, when we only had the BBC. A single television channel. And even later, he helped form the Independent Television Authority.In other words, this was a rather busy man, who nevertheless wrote 16 novels and 2 plays.This particular novel, published in 1945, and starting during the phony peace, but with the potential for war as an undercurrent, and ending during the Blitz, is a veritable house brick at well over 700 pages, and in fairly small print too. Though it fairly whirls absorbingly along, with a terrific mix of memorable, believable `characters' - all pretty well ordinary working class Londoners. There is crime, - a central crime, and we know who did it, - there are romances, some of which are doomed to fail, others of which are more hopeful - there is seediness, there is deception, class-consciousness, socialism and fascism on the streets, penury, near-penury, greed - and oodles of affection for London itself, for ordinary people living ordinary lives, and displaying all the wonderful combination of nobility, generosity and mean-mindedness which we all do, all-mashed up together.Collins takes a Kennington House, 10 Dulcimer Street, whose widowed owner lets out rooms. Under the one roof are the Jossers - an clerk on the verge of retirement, his wife and their office worker daughter. There is an ageing ex-`actress' now a cloakroom attendant at a seedy club, there is a devout widow and her grown-up motor mechanic son, with impossible aspirational dreams. There is an overweight man, moving from unskilled job to unskilled job, with adenoids and an obsession with food. There is the money counting, terrified of poverty landlady, inhabiting the meanest room in the house so she can let the rest And there is also another room to let, waiting on a new tenant .............Out of this motley crew of characters Collins weaves a satisfying, well crafted, most enjoyable tale.This is my version of a cracking good read. Lots of wonderful humour, sharp observation - the reader rather knows from the off that there is a warmth and kindness, a wit and tenderness, - `a right rollicking good read'I've come to this reasonably hot on the heels of reading or re-reading Patrick Hamilton. It is another of the titles which Penguin re-released in their `Modern Classics' within the last decade, many of them, like this, wonderfully well written `minor classics' which sounds derogatory, but is kind of accurate. Collins in certainly not an Orwell, not a Graham Greene - but this is also miles away from disposable, forgettable, fiction","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2UYI8O77UU0KS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0141442336#wasThisHelpful","R2UYI8O77UU0KS","A3MTULATO06OS5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3MTULATO06OS5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When I finished Mawer's last book, The Girl Who Fell From The Sky, I felt shocked and almost a little bemused by the abrupt ending - though I also reflected that I had no idea what other ending might have been suitable. And I also found it a plus in that book that not every thread had been explained, not every character really revealed and understood.The Girl Who Fell From The Sky was a fictional story, with an initial inspiration coming from the fact that during the Second World War, 39 women had been recruited as agents from England by SOE (Special Operations Executive) to be parachuted into occupied France, to work with the Resistance. What kind of people were these incredibly brave, but also, perhaps unusually addicted to the adrenaline rush, women? Mawer's book centres on Marian Sutro, a nave and adventurous young English woman with a Swiss French mother, brought up bilingual, recruited as an SOE agent, eagerly learning the arts of duplicity, subterfuge, living dangerously, despite all the undoubted danger Sutro is also, in one sense, living free - escaping convention, escaping her family, her past, her history, inventing new identities - and living with a mission, making a difference.When I realised that Mawer's new book, Tightrope, would continue Sutro's story, but would bring her into the period of the cold war, everything fell into place. And I had even more admiration for Mawer, because nothing about the first book, despite the advantage, now, of hindsight, screamed `sequel'. Sometimes books with sequels planned are highly unsatisfying BECAUSE they seem structured for book 2.Tightrope is quite an uncomfortable book in many ways. How does someone who has lived in such an extraordinary way, with preternaturally sharpened senses, prepared to kill, prepared to lie, cheat, use sex casually and ruthlessly to relieve an overwhelming itch or as another tool of manipulation, then manage to live, after the war, back in suburbia, in a more narrowly confined way? That is Mawer's exploration, and Sutro's challenging journey.Mawer gives us a world with a character who is always going to be, a naturally unreliable narrator. Actually, the reader can probably be a lot more sure of Sutro than anyone else within the book can be!""Did I believe the story she told me? I really don't know. It is perfectly possible to believe two contradictory things at one and the same time - that is one of the brilliant faculties of the human mind. Without it we'd have no war and no religion and precious little else that separates us from the other species.""As a cavil, I wasn't completely sure about some of Sutro's sexual encounters, and at times, I was very aware that the writer was male, and wondered how differently a female writer might have explored writing a woman who uses sex without intimacy, in part because of the professional need to hide vulnerability, - which of course includes becoming emotionally intimate - and who also uses sex as an escape from some of the horrors of her past experiences, and as an escape from the humdrum. It wasn't the fact of Sutro's sexuality which I was `unsure' about, or even her degree of distance, but (perhaps inevitably) I was aware of the gender of the writer. The sex scenes take place in many ways quite clinically, from the outside, and were where I could not quite engage with the inner world of what Sutro was feeling - I think a female writer may have given a little more insight into Sutro's emotional responses here.Nonetheless, I found this a completely absorbing, dislocating, sometimes frightening book. The structure is clever, we learn her story backwards and forwards, and it is partly narrated by Sam Wareham, who initially meets Marian when she is 24 and he is 12. Sam is the son of a family friend, and as the story proceeds into the 50s, and he becomes a young man, from time to time his story connects with Marian. The edgy, shifting politics, as the countries who were Allies during the war shift, split, and take up new positions relative to each other, and the very real spectre of a nuclear arms race gallops apace, from the first horrific atomic bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, to the race for a thermonuclear device, the hydrogen bomb. Sutro is still at the heart of all this, as her brother, and also the man she first fell in love with, as a sheltered teenager before the war, both became physicists, working on nuclear fission and fusion.""On the desert island, the device called Ivy Mike detonated. A double flash, the flash of the primary followed microseconds later by the flash of the secondary. The primary was a plutonium bomb of the Nagasaki type, releasing a storm of X-rays that flowed down into the secondary and impacted upon the hydrogen atoms in the vacuum flask so fiercely that they fused into helium and, for a fragment of time, into all the atoms of creation and a few more besides........The island on which the device had been constructed vanished entirely. The thermonuclear age had begun.""I was left with perhaps a clearer understanding of why some `real' individuals may have acted in certain ways which seemed incomprehensible or motivated solely by motives of personal gain or a kind of emotional pathology. Without preaching, or indeed special pleading, Mawer makes the reader examine the moral maze of the times.And, for what it's worth, the ending of this book is wonderfully satisfying. Mawer brings in, in both books, the idea of a rather fiendish chess game variant, where you only see your own pieces on your own board, and can't see the moves your opponent is playing - this becomes a kind of metaphor for Marian, as she begins to be drawn into still deadly games in a world ostensibly at peace. And, yes, Mawer too is playing that game, and the end, where he finally shows us the board with all its pieces, the game across two books, is brilliant, and I laughed in delight and admiration.I received this as an advance review copy from the publishers via NetGalley","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1L1GJSV0WXNP3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SHL3VD2#wasThisHelpful","R1L1GJSV0WXNP3","A3MTULATO06OS5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3MTULATO06OS5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Clare Fuller's first novel, the brilliantly titled, teasingly contradictory Our Endless Numbered Days, is a strange, disturbing, beautifully written book about dark family dynamics, the wonder and magic of childhood, deep fears, obsession, staying alive, the end of the world tied up with the enduring power of childhood fairy stories, and their dark symbolismThe book takes place over a 9 year time period. It opens in Highgate, London, in 1985. Peggy is 17. She has returned to her family home after a 9 year absence, disturbed and traumatised after being inexplicably missing, kidnapped by her father, when she was 8.Back in 1976 Peggy was the beloved only daughter of a wealthy, apparently happily married couple, though both, in their own way, were rather self-obsessed. German mother Ute was an internationally lauded classical pianist, who has rather slipped into domesticity following her cradle snatching marriage to James. At 17, James was 8 years Ute's junior.Despite the hazy gloss which the returned Peggy remembers, of the summer of 1976, there were definite cracks and oddities in her parents' marriage. James had become a member of a group of Retreaters, survivalists preparing for a some-time imminent end of the world, `after the bomb falls', by retreating far from civilisation, finding remote pockets in the countryside, learning again how to fish, hunt, gather. The group is led by a mysterious American.Peggy, who is obsessed by the book The Railway Children, is nicknamed Punzel (as in Rapunzel) by her father. And, yes, all the symbolism and allegories are there a-waiting.In the summer of 1976 Ute departs for a concert tour. Left in the care of James, father and daughter appear to have a kind of idyllic summer (in the child's imagination) as they begin to act out the end of the world retreat in the jungly back garden of their Highgate mansion, which merges in the undergrowth, with the cemetery. They live under canvas, don't wash, and eat squirrels and rabbits which James traps.This, to Peggy/Punzel is all an enormous adventure, much more exciting than school and the discipline her mother imposes. And then the adventure gets even more exciting and wilder. James and Peggy leave the country, en route to die Hutte, a mysterious hut deep in the forest:`A magical, secret place in the forest' my father said with a catch in his voice. `Our very own little cabin, with wooden walls, and wooden floors, and wooden shutters at the windows.' His voice was deep and smooth; it lulled me. `Outside we can pick sweet berries all year round; chanterelles spread like yellow rugs under the trees; and in the bottom of a valley a Fluss overflows with silvery fish, so when we're hungry and need supper, we can just dip our hands in and pull three out.The Hutte is a real place, marked on a map, and Peggy is excited, as she expects they will meet Ute there.However, excitement and strangeness soon turn very dark indeed, as once far from civilisation, James tells Peggy that the world has indeed ended, and the two of them are the only survivors.Except, clearly, it hasn't, and they aren't. None of this is a spoiler, as we know, from the opening chapter, that Peggy is now 17 and has only returned from that hut in the forest two months ago. Peggy is forced to be an unreliable narrator because her father, who has created this narrative for her to inhabit for her endless numbered 9 years of days, has made a lie the reality by which the two have livedAn eight year old, and her father, in a dark, Grimm's fairy tale forest, the only beings left alive, somehow having to survive the freezing winters. What happens to a child with no other human contact except one other being - no other world view except her own, as told to her by the other human?A forest, too can be as inaccessible a prison as a tower. Not to mention the roles of various forests in other fairy tales.Fuller's dark, frightening book employs nothing of the supernatural - there are no tricks of external fantasy, but certainly the reader will be aware of the dark psychological undercurrents which the fairy tale is constructed to explain.It's a dark and twisted tale, but also has a strange beauty. There's a kind of seductive dream in the Walden-like idea of that life in the forest, a kind of honest simplicity of living within the landscape, learning its ways. Though nothing in this book is simple, and its whole premise is fashioned on a lie a father has created for his child.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2EAD2JWVU87ZO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1941040012#wasThisHelpful","R2EAD2JWVU87ZO","A3MTULATO06OS5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3MTULATO06OS5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Michael Robotham's Texan set thriller clearly owes a lot to Stephen King's Shawshank Redemption as a beginning, an idea, and a kind of relationship: Two convicts, ones the reader is absolutely meant to root for, in essence good and noble men, one black, one white. The white man Audie Palmer in theory is obviously in no way hardened, or dangerous, and is likely to get beaten and savaged. But somehow, he survives the ten years of his sentence, despite various inmates making sporadic beelines to try and kill him. He and the black man, Moss Webster, strike up a deep and quiet friendship during Palmer's sentence.Audie Palmer had confessed to an armed payroll robbery, in the course of which, 4 people died. The 7 million dollars taken in the robbery have never been found, and much of the violence meted out to Palmer in prison was from various inmates and guards and gangs anxious to beat the money's hiding place out of Palmer.The novel opens the night before the end of Palmer's sentence : he is to be released the next day. Instead of which, he escapes from prison, and goes on the run.Something, in fact, pretty well everything, is not what it seems.......and the reader very quickly will come to the conclusion that despite confessing to the crime, Palmer is clearly innocent. So that becomes another question. And, whilst rapidly everyone starts frantically searching for Palmer, including not just local law enforcement officers, but the FBI, one of the FBI agents is also battling with a growing feeling that Palmer may indeed be innocent (so, shades of The Fugitive too)Robotham builds a tightly twisting spider's web of a story, with some useful red herrings thrown into the mix. Central to the plot is that ten year friendship between Moss and Audie, both their back stories, the strong women in their lives, Audie's own background, figures with Mob connections, corrupt politicians and business leaders. And good police and bad police. And much more.It's a brutal story (if not always completely believable in terms of the amount of beatings, maimings, shootings and the like that the fictional human body survives) but what lifts it above just another thriller is the strong characterisations (although I do have a cavil, here too) and the extremely well drawn relationships. Audie and Moss, and their respective significant others are all extremely attractive characters, whom the reader will care about, and have empathy with, and this is also a big plus for this book. You will be involved, without a doubt.There are also a lot of very ignoble, unattractive villains, with little redeemable about them, and, because they are out to get the people we care about, it is a classic battle between good and evil and the reader will root for the heroes and want the villains to get their justs, tooAnd then there is that FBI agent who all the way through smells rats......and rather knows the rat is not at all Palmer. Special Agent Desiree Furness is a brilliant operative. And she is shrimp sized, and despite being as tough, feisty, brave and fit as any ripped muscle hunk in the Feds, is under a huge disadvantage as her size makes everyone think she is a wee teen. And she gets permanently teased and humiliated. However, she is made of very strong stuff indeed, gives as good as she gets, and provides much of the necessary humour in the book, as she can outclass most of those who patronise her in wit, sass and intelligence. Moss too has a nice line in not only repartee, but his own internal thoughts about matters, as related by Robotham (the book is third person narrative):""Moss is not a lover of the countryside. He's city born and bred, preferring to know the proximity of his nearest takeout than seeing newborn lambs gambolling in a meadow or a field of wheat shivering in the breeze. The countryside has too many things that buzz, bite, slither or growl, and it also happens to be full of murderous hicks who think lynching black men should still be a recognised sport, especially in parts of the South""If I couldn't quite go 5 star on this it was for two reasons. Firstly, in order to make all those many cliffhanging tension moments that are scattered in the various chases (all very filmic), there were rather too many coincidences for my liking, and in fact I did think, `this is filmic in structure - I could `see' the cutaways, and indeed hear the kind of soundtrack playing in my head - it for sure will get made for the screen. I would lay money on that, even if not quite a missing 7 million dollars!And the second reason is that though absolutely excellently done our heroes and our villains are on the one hand a little too noble and on the other, a little too unremittingly sulphurous in their villainy. I do prefer the greater discomfort of nuance.I received this as a review copy from the publisher, Little, Brown Book Group UK","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R37FSWX0W0GVZ0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0316252050#wasThisHelpful","R37FSWX0W0GVZ0","A3MTULATO06OS5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3MTULATO06OS5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Each of Tana French's books places a different detective centre stage, but a central character in one will crop up as a not-quite-peripheral, or even as a major minor player in another.Faithful Place has a particularly challenging protagonist/instigator-and-victim of fate. We met Frank Mackey as a powerful, charismatic, dynamic figure in The Likeness. Mackey heads up Undercover Operations. We don't know too much about his past, but he is hugely influential in The Likeness. And he will appear again as a slippery, influential player in The Secret Place, attractive and manipulative by turns. In those two novels, the reader sees pretty well only Mackey's mask.In this book, he is slap bang in the centre, and the source of his complex and damaged personality, and how that damage is used both positively and in a retrograde way, comes clear. He is like some kind of scorpion figure. Scorpions (well, female scorpions) are fiercely protective of their families - and the family, in this context, may spread far wider than blood family. But, as all know, their sting is deadly, and a wide berth should be kept!Mackey is certainly not an attractive figure here. The book is told in his voice, and that voice is generally brutal, unforgiving, self serving. What redeems him is his love for his precocious daughter, Holly. And his love for his ex-wife, Olivia, though it is largely Mackey's driven, controlling, self-protective angry personality which made Olivia end the marriage.Mackey came from a very dysfunctional family indeed. Father an alcoholic, unskilled, though with a huge potential which was never realised, due to neighbourhood enmities going back a generation; mother a manipulating fearful and aggressive mammy martyr. And the 5 children, Carmel, Shay, Frank, Kevin, Jackie, the battleground on which the parental war was played out.""One of my da's tragedies was always the fact that he was bright enough to understand just how comprehensively he had shat all over his life. He would have been a lot better off thick as a plank""Frank Mackey, back in his teenage years, had a secret first love, Rosie Daly. Theirs was a Romeo and Juliet affair as the Daly and Mackey fathers were sworn enemies. Frank and Rosie were deep in the planning of elopement and escape to England, but the night they had set for this to happen, Rosie didn't show up, and left a note for Frank, saying that she was going to England and was sorry to hurt him. This devastating blow to his idealistic dreams not only damaged, for life, his ability to trust, be intimate and open with anyone, but also meant that he also ran away from his own home, that night. He had after all, planned to do this with Rosie, now he did it alone. Twenty two years later, he is still estranged from his family who never forgave him for leaving. The enmity between the Mackeys and the Dalys has also grown, as the Daly family had been convinced, given that both Frank and Rosie vanished on the same night, that they had gone together, and that somehow Frank must have abandoned Rosie in England, and returned to build a better life for himself as a member of the Garda. The community don't have much liking for the Garda.And now, events happen which bring Frank back to his family and community, both personally and professionally, and these events fling open all the doors revealing community cupboards full to bursting with skeletons.It took me a little longer to surrender to this book than most of the others - and in the main it is because of the challenges of an unlikeable central character. French manages this brilliantly, but Frank's heat, and rage are uncomfortable to be with. But for sure you are made to fully understand and engage with why Frank's aggression, despair and anger are as they are - and he is also a man who struggles and positively tries to engage with his shadows.And it also has to be said that Mackey's dark wit keeps the reader going. His is an unkind humour, but he is amusing""A handful of ten-year-olds with underprivileged hair and n o eyebrows were slouched on a wall, scoping out the cars and thinking wire hangers. All I needed was to come back and find that suitcase gone. I leaned my arse on the boot, labelled my Fingerprint Fifi envelopes, had a smoke and stared our country's future out of it until the situation was clear all round and they (expletive deleted meaning `went away') ...to vandalise someone who wouldn't come looking for them""Now all I can do is wait impatiently for Tana French to write book 6, now i have finished reading all magnificent 5","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2IDDBQ9EQ8J5Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0143119494#wasThisHelpful","R2IDDBQ9EQ8J5Z","A3MTULATO06OS5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3MTULATO06OS5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a clever page turner, kind of easy, kind of straight forward. Absorbing, almost effortless - until you realise that there's a lot more going on, including neat and clever games with plot - a story being told within the central story which is also yet another story. Yet Kate Forsyth manages this without confusion or artifice, and the reader can easily hold the braided threads togetherBitter Greens is both a historical novel, a romance, and a fantasy, a fairy story - and at the centre of it all, are 3 strong female characters, fighting the powerlessness of a woman's lot, in their differing ways.The central character is a real character, who lived in Versailles, the King's Court, during the reign of the autocratic Louis X1Vth, the Sun King, to whom she was related, This was the time when the Catholic ruling elite were moving towards the eventual stifling of `dissenting' Protestant religion. Louis XIVth's reign saw the degree of religious toleration brought in by his grandfather, Henri of Navarre being rapidly eroded. He was far from a tolerant king, and in 1685 revoked the freedom of worship act, The Edict of Nantes, which had been passed in Henri of Navarre's reign. Huguenot's were forced to `convert', and to try to leave the country in order to avoid this, was punishable in some cases, by death.Charlotte-Rose de Caumont de la Force, the main character, (whose childhood nickname in the book is Bon-Bon) was a relatively plain, highly intelligent woman, one of Louis' cousins, who became a well-regarded writer. She had several lovers, but did not marry (scandalously) till she was middle-aged. Her family were Huguenot, and she `converted' to Catholicism, around the time when such conversions were enforced. She was exiled by Louis to a convent (a fate imposed on many women who displeased men, and particularly, a fate meted out to Huguenot women) So, `Bitter Greens' is her first person narrated story, mainly taking place at the end of the seventeenth century, in that convent, as she looks back on her life. However, Charlotte-Rose is the writer who is known as the author of the fairy-tale initial known as Persinette - (a kind of variant on Parsley,which features in the story) `Persinette' later was retold by the Brothers Grimm as `Rapunzel' - or, to give it a similarly herbal flavour, a variant on `rampion'Rapunzel is of course the story of the powerlessness of a young girl, who falls foul of a powerful witch, and is imprisoned in a tower (or convent, in Charlotte-Rose's case, after she fell foul of a powerful despotic monarch) It is also a deeply erotic story, though the eroticism is covert in the children's version. Rapunzel is rescued by (who else) a prince who climbs her outrageously snaky, ever-growing, shimmering ladder of hair.However, an earlier version of the story exists, from the pen of an Italian writer, Giambattista Basile, published some 60 years earlier, as Forsyth relates, but scholars have puzzled how (or if) Charlotte-Rose might have read it as the story was written in Neapolitan, and was not translated out of Neapolitan till many years after Charlotte-Rose's death. As she never went to Italy, and did not speak Neapolitan, it is something of a mystery. One which Forsyth wonderfully disentangles, explores, invents, surmises.So, the second story is that of `Marguerite' a fairy story told by a wise nun, who is the convent's infirmarian and herbalist, Soeur Seraphina. Marguerite, (another plant, name `Daisy') of course, is the girl who becomes `Persinette' and she too, like Charlotte-Rose, will transcend the powerlessness imposed on her by the witch.Where do malevolent witches come from, however - in this story, we get to understand, and see a further story about the powerlessness and lack of choices available to women.It is a marvellous tale within a tale within a tale - and, moreover, Forsyth upends the `victim' status of her imprisoned female, - though there are some attractive princes, even princes may be imprisoned by those more powerful than they - kings, fathers opposed to rebellious sons.Interspersed are also various poems by other writers on the `Rapunzel' theme.Hopefully, the fact that I've unpicked some of the rich substance to the story will not put potential readers off - this is a wonderfully told tale, with 3 extremely interesting major characters, one of whom (Charlotte-Rose) is wonderfully witty, sardonic, amused - and a remarkably sensual woman as well as a highly intelligent one. So the book has its degree of raunch as well!There is a wealth of historical, literary, artistic information, in here, but Forsyth wears her obviously careful research lightly, seamlessly, gracefully. You learn without `being lectured'Highly recommended, and I shall certainly investigate her second book for adults, which again mixes history and fairy story as it is about one of the Brothers Grimm.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R70X4850WB2QH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00APDWTFQ#wasThisHelpful","R70X4850WB2QH","A3MTULATO06OS5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3MTULATO06OS5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've been devotedly in thrall to the pared down, often stripped to the bone, music of Arvo Part, for some years. Part, arguably Estonia's best known citizen, created his particular style of minimalism, `tintinnabuli', based on the close harmonic overtones heard in the `tintinnabulation' when a bell is struck. Part's stunning music is not just empty stylistics, however, but always arises from his own deep connection to the numinous, to deep reflection, to his faith.Nearly 80 now, he continues to sear the listener with the potency and deep reflection in his work. His music is always something best listened to with full, awake, attention. And the silence and space between notes is as much part of the soundscape as the heard music.This particular CD consists of 2 works, a short a capella choral piece, Da Pacem Domine, beautifully floated by The Hilliard Ensemble, and a long orchestral piece Lamentate.Lamentate was inspired when Part saw Anish Kapoor's Marsyas in The Turbine Hall of Tate Modern, and had a kind of cataclysmic, cathartic experience from how he was affected by it. `Lamentate' is not a lament, as is often the case in sacred `Lamentations' for the dead, it is a lamentation for the living - for the fact that we are all in relationship to the knowledge of our own, individual mortality. Whether we consciously seek to live with awareness of that, or whether we live in denial, it shapes us.As Part's notes on this piece reflect "" I have written a lamento - not for the dead, but for the living, who have to deal with these issues for themselves. A lamento for us, struggling with the pain and hopelessness of the world.""From the crushing, weighty opening, of the first two movements, where it almost feels as if an implacable indifferent force will roll over the listeners, annihilating them, small, fragile, simple, beautiful and hesitant pause filled lines of melody arise in the third movement, carried by the solo piano. Later, these lines, are taken up, turn by turn, by other instruments. It's almost like an offer and an acceptance of tenderness, some comfort from another. Again and again, there are musical lines which arise, phrases which never quite complete and resolve - the ending is inevitable, but the answer can only be a kind of accommodation, a trying, a beauty created from a greater embodiment, so the `being here' is more and more fully realised.These crushings, these solo questings, these arisings of musical line from the solo piano which are then taken up, questioned again by other instruments, are like some kind of manifestation of grace - the comfort of human consolation and connection in the face of the inevitability of deathPart's own history and background in devotional music is within the Eastern Orthodox Church, but there are even threads of musical influences from Arabic music in one of the movements, Lamentabile.The whole movement of the piece, with the return, again and again to the knowledge of our mortality which shapes our living, is towards a deepening richness that comes from `living with knowledge'And, though not in any way (obviously!) a great fanfare of a triumphal piece, it is a piece which is astonishingly beautiful, moving...and though I surrendered to it quite viscerally, getting flattened by the implacable opening, slowly having little green shoots of growth, moving towards the light of day, connecting, and then being flattened, the whole was about `responding, with growing strength, to be in the here and now'As I reflected (as the piece makes the listener do so) I was reminded of the work of existentialist humanist psychotherapist Irving Yalom, and his books, specifically, Love's Executioner and Staring At The Sun. This music takes the same journey, and encourages `Living Awake'The performance in this version, is from the Stuttgart Radio Symphony Orchestra, with Alexei Lubimov, piano, and conducted by Andrey Boreyko. And it is all magnificent.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R276IMDB0H3GZA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000A69QCW#wasThisHelpful","R276IMDB0H3GZA","A3MTULATO06OS5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3MTULATO06OS5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As a lover of wild walking for almost all my adult life, and a devotee of wild water swimming for many years, it almost felt as if someone (well, to be honest, as this book was created by a wonderful and inspired collective group of women) that is,  a collection of wise, doughty and joyful someones, produced a book which absolutely fits me. To save all my friends buying me this for Christmas I've stolen a march on them and got it, pronto, for myself.Now this book may have a practical appeal just for those who live in the more-or-less-greater London area, but it is also an object of visual style and beauty, from the delectable cover, designed by James Lewis, to the wealth of wonderful photos taken of the watery destinations, and the walkers and swimmers themselves. So, if I didn't plan to use the book, it would still be one to aesthetically appreciate.Moving on to the purely practical, this is a brilliantly put together book - not only are the instructions clear, but there are useful details of start/finish by public transport, length of each walk, time taken, ease or difficulty of the walk, details about the swimming aspects - for example, depth, ease of access to the water, details of the refreshments available (oh yay!) graphics on a map of the route, details of the precise OS map it can be found on - and, even better there are details of how you can access each map on line to printout and/or to email to a smart phone. This is stunningly helpful, and is part, I believe, of the approach that the publishers, Wild Things Publishers, have taken with their series of books.So, an astonishingly well thought out package, in terms of both practicality and style - the book itself is far too beautiful to sully by cramming into a walking bag - particularly as eventually wet bathers will be dripping into said bag, nor would I want to break the spine of this book in my printer/scanner/copier just to print out the instructions.There is also additional historical information about wild swimming, and rights of way, which may spur readers to further thought about the land and our relationship to it. Plus very sensible practical advice to those who may be unaccustomed to the delights of pond, lake, river or sea and only have swum whilst under the influence of chlorination. Magic awaits!Many thanks to the authors, the contributors and the publishers for a gorgeous addition to my various walking books, and I shall enjoy both stepping out and pretending to be an otter, working my way through the 28 wild water and land experiences.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2SCQ6ZZ3ZHJ43/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WYX67M6#wasThisHelpful","R2SCQ6ZZ3ZHJ43","A3MTULATO06OS5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3MTULATO06OS5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A youngish Simon Rattle recorded this thrilling version of John Adams equally thrilling Harmonielehre in 1993, well in the middle of his tenure with the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra, and it is a stunning, exhilarating ride.My EMI classics version comes with disc notes which made my eyes and brain spin, , full of references to how Adams' piece nods to Schoenberg's writing on harmony, and tracing the Minimalist movement in the States, but these were not notes which spoke particularly to me.I first heard this piece in a concert devoted to `minimalists' and though I'd gone for pieces by two of my favourites, Part and Glass, this was the piece that sang out to me.What did make sense to me (both in the notes for that concert, and the liner notes here) is that the initial inspiration came from a dream which Adams had had, of a huge tanker rising out from the San Francisco Bay and taking flight.The terror and the shock and the glory of this is there in the explosive beginning. I remember the first time I heard it, like some sort of rollercoaster punch to the gut, nearly lifting me out of my seat. There is so much beauty in the frequently returned to power of this waking kraken, roaring out of the deep. Perhaps the surprise of the piece though is the delicacy and grace, a musical line also arises and is sweet, flowing, lyrical. The arch of musical line and the brute force of pulse, shimmer, repetition and development, the little threads of change which I find so exciting in minimalism, seem to tussle, tangle and weave with each other. It's like a dialogue between grace and power, powerful grace, graceful power.The second movement surrenders its opening completely to an expressive, expansive, unwinding, like coming free from gravitational pull. And curiously reminded me of the dreamy languor of Debussy, particularly L'Apres Midi d'un faun. But just when it seemed safe to drift dreamwards, Adams begins to wind everything up, and there's another kind of dialogue between dynamic tension, forward propulsion and the slow unwinding. I found this marvellous to listen to `in my body', like some kind of sympathetic nervous system/parasympathetic nervous system juxtaposition - heart speeds, heart slows, heart speeds, heart slows.And then there is the third movement. Oh my. All shimmer, geometric, like light on the surface of water on a lake, with a running breeze creating an extraordinary visual effect. This movement seemed, at times, quite Glasslike, his kind of hypnotic bright shimmers, lulling and rocking the listener, and firing them up, little jolts of change of rhythm and musical line. And finally, power, energy as that tanker pulls out to the starsA wonderful piece, both playful and sombre, filled with sunlight and crackling with thunder and electrical storm.The additional pieces on this CD are the mischievous `The Chairman Dances', taking some music from Adams opera Nixon In China. It is subtitled `A Foxtrot for the Orchestra' and, yes, the listener rather wants to cavort and twirl! And it is happy/silly, like some of the early Penguin Caf Orchestra - particularly, Telephone and Rubber Band, all wrapped up in a centre of dance orchestra stateliness.The CD is completed by two fanfares, the first, Tromba Lantana is almost melancholic, introspective, and then the final, titled `Short Ride In A Fast Machine' is precisely that, another shot of high energy octane, a big shout of fun and celebrationThis marvellous CD - both the execution of the pieces, and the programme itself, is a wonderful celebration/showcase of a composer who is so much more than merely a minimalist party liner.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R37QP7BKGKIEAQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000002RU2#wasThisHelpful","R37QP7BKGKIEAQ","A3MTULATO06OS5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3MTULATO06OS5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've been working my way pretty compulsively through Tana French, Irish literary crime fiction writer's books, since coming to her fourth book Broken Harbour, on the strength of two book reviewers blogs.Having just finished The Likeness, her second book, I'm reeling, punch drunk, from the emotional journey of this, which for sure must take part of its inspiration from Donna Tartt's first explosive novel, The Secret History, but is nonetheless in no way derivative, and is all imbued with French's own intelligence, style, and intricate character and plotting.Cassie Maddox, the central detective of her gripping first novel, In The Woods, is still feeling the after-shocks of the crime she investigated. No longer in the Murder Squad, she has relocated to the quieter shores of the Domestic Violence Unit, and has begun a relationship with one of the detectives from the murder squad.The Likeness does read as a stand-alone, for anyone who has not read In The Woods, and anything which the reader needs to know as background does get dripped into the story of this, as Cassie herself continues to come to terms with the events of In The Woods.We learn something about her professional back-story, too - unfortunately, this is a major spoiler which I think the publishers chose to reveal, and it represents my major criticism of this book (not French's fault) Cassie worked for a time a few years ago in Undercover Ops, infiltrating a drug ring. Her invented identity was that of a woman called Alexandra (Lexie) Madison. And then a body is found, in a derelict cottage, clearly a very recent murder victim. The wallet on the body shows the victim is called Lexie Madison. Running the identity through the police computer brings in the big gun of Undercover ops, Frank Mackey, who ran Cassie as Lexie. The shock is that this Lexie Madison is a double for the very much alive Cassie Maddox.The dead Lexie was part of an elite group of 5 post-graduate students, close friends, living in a beautiful, decaying mansion, Whitethorn House, on the outskirts of Glenskehy, a small backwater in the Wicklow Mountains. Inevitably police interest centres initially on the others in the group, but their stories all stack up, and the group are united in their grief that one of theirs is dead. And there are other suspects, which link in to Ireland's deep history going back through generations, and the tensions arising out of class and nationality - the working class and the peasantry of old Ireland, and the wealthy Anglo Irish landowners.Irish history is firmly woven into all French's novels.So, an audacious plan is set in place (and I'm afraid it is the spoiler of the blurb itself) Cassie could go undercover again as Lexie. The pathology report shows that the woman in the derelict cottage died from a single stab wound which did not happen in the cottage itself, the woman had run from someone to the cottage, and bled to death there. Had she been discovered earlier, she might have survived.The group (including the dead Lexie) were very much the golden, charismatic, bound together elite (and odd, skeletons in their backgrounds) of The Secret History. French adds something else into this however - there is very much a sense of the yearning, soulmate romance of deep friendship, above and beyond sexuality, the kind of friendship that arises in youth, and at the time seems as if it could last a lifetime. Even whilst within that place there is a kind of looking back to it, a `Lost Domaine/Grand Meaulnes' quality. Cassie herself and Cassie taking on this second `Lexie Madison' identity, and the 4 others is someone who longs for the powerful sense of belonging, of friendships as a more powerful bond than bloodkin, and a more powerful bond than the one-to-one of sexual partnership.""In the sitting room the piano is open, wood glowing chestnut and almost too bright to look at in the bars of sun, the breeze stirring the yellowed sheet music like a finger. The table is laid ready for us, five settings - the bone-china plates and the long-stemmed wineglasses, fresh-cut honeysuckles trailing from a crystal bowl - but the silverware has gone dim with tarnish and the heavy damask napkins are frilled with dust......Somewhere in the house, faint as a fingernail-flick at the edge of my hearing, there are sounds: a scuffle, whispers. It almost stops my heart. The others aren't gone, I got it all wrong, somehow. They're only hiding; they're still here, for ever and ever""And that quote is as powerful a paean to memory, and the sense of our pasts almost within reach, as any I've readThis is indeed a long book (she shares that too, with Tartt!) - at nearly 700 pages, but the unravelling of the story, the careful and believable psychology of all the major characters, the tangles and twists of all the relationships, and, for Cassie herself, the weirdness of being herself-and-not-herself, the whole question of identity, arising when anyone is leading any kind of double life, is superlative. And there is also the fascination of the police procedural itself, and how individual police can marry their work functions, with who each of them is, individually.Most of all - it is the wonderful, seductive quality of French's writing, and a first person narrator who grabs the reader and makes them as desperate to want the golden lads and lasses to be real, and unsullied as Cassie would like, because of her own yearning for lifelong soulmates, whilst at the same time, making us as needy of her fierce professional desire to solve that crime as she is. She (and we) know that there are two drives going on here, which may not be compatible","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1JSTV73LGOUGW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0143115626#wasThisHelpful","R1JSTV73LGOUGW","A3MTULATO06OS5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3MTULATO06OS5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Ali Smith's The Accidental is bold, playful, exuberant, and with its opening chapter about the very accident of conception itself - one egg, the possibility offered by a myriad spermatozoa, bursting vibrantly and provocatively into introducing the protagonist from - where, heaven?, hell? the here and now? - it reminded me not a little of Kate Atkinson's first novel, Behind The Scenes At The Museum.The title of Smith's book is of course mocking and, `Yeah, Right!' because the whole tenor of the book decries `the accident'. The mysterious agent-provocateur, Amber/Alhambra, whose conception, in the caf of an Alhambra cinema is detailed at the start, will enter the lives of a fairly ordinary family, in the guise of a saviour to some, and as some kind of devastating Kali figure to others, whose trail of destruction forces changes and awakening on them. Everything they are, everything that happens, came from their natures and their choices, not from `accident'But enough of this elusive waffle, what is the outline of this bookA family of 4, Michael, University lecturer in the English Department, serial philanderer. His wife, Eve, a successful genre writer in a kind of `invented biography' field, taking the lives of real people who died early and inventing longer lives for them. Eve's children: Magnus, 17, highly intelligent, falling dangerously apart, after his unwitting but still culpable involvement in a piece of Facebook flamery causes a classmate to kill herself. And finally, lastly, but absolutely not leastly,12 year old Astrid. The 4 - the Smart family (here, as so often Smith is making all sorts of pointed comments, as the family, and certainly the adults, are anything but) are on a summer vac holiday in Norfolk, and pretty disastrous it is turning out to be.Smith writes events from the point of view of each family member - not as first person narration but as seen from the point of view of the omniscient narrator - it is only Amber, the instigator of changes, who gets first person narration.Amber appears unexpectedly at the holiday cottage, and both Eve and Michael are convinced she has been invited by the other (their marriage is not altogether going swimmingly as shown by the fact that Eve thinks Amber must be one of Michael's current student seductions, and Michael she is some kind of `eighties feministy still-political women' for whom Eve is some kind of icon.On her first night with the family she rescues Magnus from a suicide attempt, blazes Astrid out of the sulking disaffected `whatever' she is heading towards, is violently fallen in love with by Michael, and becomes some kind of confessional for Eve. Her role, for each of the four, is ultimately healing, though for the adults, her healing involves a ruthless stripping away of their masks, and is both immediately, and ultimately painful.But what makes Smith's book challenging, entrancing, and, also it must be said, at times extremely irritating, are the games she plays, with form, structure, style, reference. For example, one of the Michael sections consists of a series of sonnets as Amber releases the writer from the cynical and rather tired analyser of literature. Amber's own sections, true to her movie inspired conception, runs through a dizzying movie iconic moments, clich moments from movies, explanation of our times.The Smart family's individual voices are not drawn equally successfully. Eve, for me, is the character who engages the least, and young Astrid is the absolute stand-out,""Astrid is taping dawns. There is nothing else to do here. The village is a dump. Post Office, vandalised Indian restaurant, chip shop little shop place that's never open, place for ducks to cross the road. Ducks actually have their own roadsign! There is a sofa warehouse called Sofa So Good. It is dismal. There is a church. The church has its own roadsign too. Nothing happens here except a church and some ducks, and this house is an ultimate dump. It is substandard. Nothing is going to happen here all substandard summer.""I have some reservations about the book once the summer was over, and the unravelling, the remaking, the inventiveness moved beyond the family's return to London and beyond, possibly because the final character journey which Smith explores, is that of Eve, who, for me, was the character who had worked less well, and who I found the least credible.But I am certainly minded to explore more of Smith's writing.

"Patrick Hamilton's trilogy of bar and street life in London in the late twenties and early thirties, linked by their three central characters, was originally published as three works : The Midnight Bell, in 1929 when Hamilton was 25, The Siege of Pleasure 3 years later, and the final volume, The Plains of Cement in 1934. They were then republished the following year as this trilogy, Twenty Thousand Streets Under The SkyThe novels are drawn in part (or the first one is) from aspects of Hamilton's own rather destructive life. Although they could indeed be read singly, without reference to each other, and in any order, it is through reading them sequentially that the widest understanding happens.The Midnight Bell is a West End pub. Two of the bar staff are Bob, who yearns to be a writer and is something of an auto-didact, and Ella, a plain, good natured young woman who is in love with Bob, although she has no hopes in that direction, as she is aware that his considerable physical charms, his wit, likeability and intelligence - not to mention his own intense susceptibility to pretty women, put him out of her reach.Bob has a growing problem with alcohol, but at the beginning of the novel it is no more than heavy drinking, and there is every likelihood, in his mind, that he will fulfil his literary ambitions, and make something of himself. Ella, the perfect kindly barmaid does not drink, and seems the least damaged of the three central characters. The other protagonist is Jenny, a ravishingly pretty young prostitute, aged 18, whose entrance one evening into The Midnight Bell will be cataclysmic for BobThe Midnight Bell is Bob's story, a decline and fall, laid absolutely low by love. As Bob himself is a witty man, this book ripples with Hamilton's sparkling word play and mordant observations. In fact, for my tastes, the self-deprecating humour, as an antidote to the darkening story, was almost a little overdone. In Hamilton's later books - most specifically in The Slaves of Solitude, his brilliant and sly humour is much less overt, and instead sparkles darkly and judiciously, rather than `and here's another funny line'The much, much, bleaker The Siege of Pleasure is Jenny's Story. Picking up at the end of the Midnight Bell, when Jenny's destruction of Bob is almost complete, Hamilton almost immediately back tracks to show how Jenny, who is not consciously wicked, became a woman of the streets. Unlike the destructive, vicious and racketty Netta of his other highly acclaimed novel, Hangover Square, another stunningly beautiful, completely amoral woman who uses her beauty to part men from their money, Jenny, though absolutely self-obsessed, has a kind of charm and a desire to please. Jenny's dark destruction is also due to alcoholism. The Siege of Pleasure also seethes with Hamilton's socialist, egalitarian politics - Jenny is a well-drawn individual woman, but she is also a representative of the unfairness of the class system. The best she can hope for is a life in service, and, at the start of the book, becoming the live-in housekeeper and cook to a trio of elderly siblings, represents a big step up on her own humbler, violent beginnings. Her fall is rapid and its start happens in a single evening.But, for me, the stand-out is Ella's story, in The Plains Of Cement - London and the area between Oxford Street and the Euston Road, form the bulk of it, though the glamour of theatre land, and the poverty of Pimlico, are also drawn. Ella is a good young woman, kindly, and with a kind of commonplace store of clich driven phrases, which however come with a homespun innocence from her. She is another with few prospects, and, her only escape could come through marriage, except that she accepts her plainness is unlikely to make this likely. One of the denizens of the bar is a truly irritating, desperately lonely on the verge of elderly bachelor, Ernest Eccles. Eccles is screamingly annoying, the kind of person whose conversation is full of meaningful innuendo which is at the same time WITHOUT meaning. The developing courtship (if indeed that is what it is) is wonderfully handled, and Ella, appreciating Eccles' good qualities, must juggle moral choices - she has a dearly loved mother, and a hated, bad-tempered stepfather - also working in the bar industry, fallen from almost being a `self-made man' to a bottle and glass washer. Ella gives half her earnings to her mother; the stepfather is mean as well as an emotional bully.This again is a bleak book, but it is the writer's wonderful humour, light touch, fine ear for dialogue, and the internal running commentary of Ella's thoughts whilst her `out in the world' external doings and sayings are happening, that makes his work such a delight to read.The excruciating progression of Eccles' courtship of Ella, and her frustration, embarrassment and changing feelings towards her elderly admirer, moment to moment, are wonderfully drawn.The detailed, authentically delineated Ella comes from the same kind of world as Enid Roach in Hamilton's The Slaves of Solitude - and Ernest Eccles, though not consciously bullying, in the manner of the obnoxious Mr Thwaites in that book, is equally a boor, insensitive, solipsistic and insufferable in his pomposity. Hamilton writes from inside his central female characters utterly believably.The autobiographical basis for the first novel in the trilogy came from Hamilton's own love affair with a prostitute, and his own alcoholism. His father, too, was an alcoholic, an unsuccessful writer, and made an early, disastrous marriage to a prostitute. Out of his own dreadfully destructive nature and nurture Patrick Hamilton created finely crafted literature. Alcohol, and its potential for destruction, as well as its ability to create a rose-tinted world, runs through all three books, as does the various ways in which capital exploits labourIn the end, despite the humour, the storyline, the well drawn characters, and the marvellous journey of 3 novels sequentially, which can be enjoyed as solo outings, it is Hamilton's depth and humanity which grabs me, every time. His touch may be light, and have at times an almost Restoration style comedy of manners going on (the trajectory of the courtship between Eccles and Ella) - but light, in Hamilton's touch, is never limited to the superficial, and he has an enviable ability to whisk aside the surface, and leave the reader heart-clutchingly aching as they engage with, not only his central characters, but ourselves. He is some kind of witness to the lives all those who are not the explorers who discover continents, the astronauts who step on other planets, the rulers of nations, but those who live inside the ordinary dwellings, the denizens of those Twenty Thousand Streets Under the Sky","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3CEHOEEKBXD9T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1590172566#wasThisHelpful","R3CEHOEEKBXD9T","A3MTULATO06OS5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3MTULATO06OS5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was interested to read this Carnegie medal winning author from the 50s, and found this an enjoyable read (though with some reservations, as detailed in the last paragraphs) I discovered that this particular book was not the Carnegie medal winner - that is another with the same overall setting - medieval warfare - Knight Crusader.Peter Staunton, a young, clearly upper-middle class boy, and his ditto friend Gwyn, are staying with Gwyn's uncle `in the Welsh Mountains'. As Gwyn (devoted to things scientific) and Peter (drawn to history) walk in the ruins of an ancient Norman Castle, Carrag Cennen, Peter discovers a medieval gauntlet, which has the mysterious power, as he later discovers, to take him back in time to 600 years ago.To aid the young (or even the adult) reader, Gwyn's uncle and the friendly local vicar, history buffs both (like the author) offer twentieth century instruction on the Normans and their battles with Welshmen and women whose lands they had captured. Very fortunately for Peter this advance tuition does happen before he does, in the end, go back in time, preventing him from making a complete idiot of himself.Gwyn's Uncle and the friendly Rev do also manage to darkly tell the boys about certain local myths which will explain why and how Peter has the mysterious gauntlet experience, since it turns out he is descended directly from the de Blois Norman knights whose castle it was. And, surprise, surprise, once back in time, he also meets a boy who looks remarkably like Gwyn but is the son of the main Welsh chieftain, active in resisting those Norman Conquests in his area.I have no hesitation in recommending it to its target audience - any boy who is a fan of invented warfare, of the Star Wars variety, might be intrigued by the same tales of derring-do carefully set in a very real, but equally `alien' world - that of 600 years ago.As an adult, there is probably a little too much obvious instruction of the reader about the things he doesn't know, using Peter's lack of knowledge, to be credible - it's a device I particularly get irritated by in adult fiction, where two characters, who WOULD have knowledge, are made to give the reader, who lacks the knowledge, vital technical information - the device where Einstein turns to Niels Bohr and says, ""so, Niels, remind me about the basics of particle physics, there's a good chap!"" - Or, in this case, Peter, firmly back in the fourteenth century, son of a powerful knight, who all his life has been defending the territory, is continually saying ""so what exactly is a trebuchet?"" ""what is a mangonel?"" and the like. Curiously, Roger de Blois, Peter's fourteenth century father, does not seem to wonder why his son seems to have forgotten everything about medieval warfare, armoury, jousting, falconry and the like.Some books written for children do seem to be able to be read with critical surrender by adults - this was not one of them, I felt every one of my more sophisticated and mature years, and the gender gap, very keenly - not to mention the uneasiness of someone who is sensitive, as a denizen of a `United Kingdom' of the substrate of patronisation of the Celtic races which is part of our history. I'm not quite sure, even for young boy readers in the time this was written, whether this would have been such an enjoyable book if you were Welsh, as opposed to English.Although adventure loving girls interested in history might also find much to appreciate in this, I would suggest that the lack of any female role model for a girl to identify with could prove a little puzzling and frustrating. There is only one female of any note, the central character's mother in the fourteenth century, and though she demonstrates an ability for elegant dress, and is an authority on genteel table manners in the period - she spits on the floor, never on the table itself - and manages to gnaw on bones without dribbling down the front of her elegant apparel, this may not be enough for a girl reader who would like to know her own part in history. Oh, there is a particularly smelly old witch who makes a brief appearance, whom pretty well everyone thinks is a fool, not to mention far too grubby to take seriously. But that is it, as far as females are concerned. As a well-past-my-girlhood adult reader, I could enjoy this in a manner which tries to think myself into the mind and heart of a small boy, but I'm pretty sure that it would have annoyed me as a young girl, as even back in the day, I definitely preferred `children's books' which did have at least one young female who did rather more than model fashions look pretty, and play admiring and passive audience to the young (male) adventurerSo - probably a fabulous book for a young boy who is not Welsh, who loves tales of the olden days, a good bit of derring-do, and fine writing. For them this may be 5 star, I've docked a star because I can't escape from the culture of my own time, place and gender.I guess this IS the advantage where enemies are intergalactic - you can make the bad guys anyone and no one!The book is completed by the original black and white illustrations by T.R.

"The Expendable Man is set in America - Los Angeles to Arizona, in 1963, and is most firmly rooted in the politics of that time. Politics and law both at large, and how they play out within the hearts and minds of individuals.This was a golden time in America's view of itself, the American Dream - at least for those who already were the haves of society. America had a charismatic, dynamic young president, championing liberal values, respected at home and abroad. But the times also had (when do they ever not) darker, more sinister undercurrents.This is actually a book which is very hard to adequately and enticingly review - because there is very little a reviewer can say about it, if they are not to spoil the necessary journey which each reader must make. I'm particularly glad I picked this up without any prior knowledge, except that being a Persephone book, it would be well-written, that it was a `golden-age crime' and that it had been described, on publication, by the New York Times as : ""the author's finest work to date, of unusual stature both as a suspense story and as a straight novel"" And, that NYT reviewer spoke truly - this book delivered. Here is as much as I can say:Hugh is driving from Indio to Phoenix. Against his instincts, he picks up a young female hitchhiker. He knows this is probably not a sensible thing to do, but he is a decent man with younger sisters, and thinks it is better that he be the one to do this, rather than leave her perhaps to be picked up by some other, less decent man. The highway is deserted and dark is approaching. The girl, who definitely looks and acts, more than a little aggressively, is clearly someone with something to hide. And appears to be one of the dispossessed poor. And everything moves downhill from there  on in. Quite rapidly, and quite unstoppably.Something about the book is, right from the start, implacably tense and oppressive, even the description (which hooked me immediately) of the landscape, in the opening paragraph :""Across the tracks there was a different world. The long and lonely country was the colour of sand. The horizon hills were haze-black; the clumps of mesquite stood in dark pools of their own shadowing. But the pools and the rim of dark horizon were discerned only by conscious seeing, else the world was all sand, brown and tan and copper and pale beige. Even the sky at this moment was sand, reflection of the fading bronze of the sun""Hugh has something about him. He seems more than a little uptight; more than a little fearful; perhaps, even a little prone to suspicion and paranoia. Yet the reader must accept that he is a good man, and senses that his motivation for picking up the teenage girl is exactly what we are told it is. Hugh's tension, Hugh's curious nervousness instantly infects the reader, and we too make the journey, uneasy, and compelled.More can't really be said.....but if you are looking for a wonderfully taut, psychologically authentic, brilliantly written suspenseful crime thriller, which will deliver surprising and truthful shocks, and set you thinking hard - do read it. It's a stunner! Highly recommended","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R31HFYC5AXI9TK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=159017495X#wasThisHelpful","R31HFYC5AXI9TK","A3MTULATO06OS5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3MTULATO06OS5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Edmund White, American writer whose subject is often the sexual mores of society - as a gay man born in 1940 he has lived through, and charted, many changes in attitudes towards same-sex relationships - here writes a rather brilliant book about the dying days of nineteenth century realist writer and journalist, Stephen Crane.Hotel de Dream mixes known facts of Crane's life and known at-the-time assessment of  his character, with plausible `what-if' invention. Large sections of the book contain the dictated work of a last novel, The Painted Boy, which Crane, painfully dying from tuberculosis, coughs up his life's blood to finish, dictating it to his `wife' Cora Taylor, in wrenched out, feverish whispersCrane, who did die from a final pulmonary haemorrhage, from TB, in a health spa in Germany, at the ridiculously young age of 28, was a writer in the naturalist, realist tradition. He had a passionate social conscience, and empathised with the disadvantaged and powerless in society - particularly those outside respectability. He had been involved in a law case, protecting a prostitute against an unlawful charge against her. The case was lost, and Crane himself censured by sections of society which had lauded him for his literary gifts. He had met Cora, who also became a journalist, and was separated from her second husband, though not divorced, and ran a bordello Hotel de Dreme, in Florida. Settling in England for a while, Crane become the friend of Joseph Conrad, Henry James, H.G. Wells, and Ford Madox Ford. In England, Crane and Taylor lived as, and were believed to be, husband and wife.However, White's book is not purely a biography, or even a straight biography written as fiction. Although Crane had dictated his final work, as he was feverishly dying, to Cora, that work was The O' Ruddy, not The Painted BoyThe Painted Boy, the novel within the novel, is White's imaginative invention, and within it, Crane inserts himself as an observing character, so there are various mirrors, illusions, inventions, but delivered with realistic imagination, using known facts, as well as `what if.......'White's central idea for The Painted Boy, was to say `what if' this writer who was known to have understanding and acceptance for those who were outside conventional morality, who was humane and empathetic, had encountered those who at the time were absolutely seen as deviant and abhorrent - the gay community - and, particularly, poor young boys who turned to prostitution as a means of making a living.He charts a love story between Theodore Koch, an upright, conventional, married banker, who falls headlong in love with an abused street boy, Elliott. Crane is also a character within the book, who meets the boy (who is dying of syphilis, as Crane himself is dying with his own disease) and, despite an initial abhorrence, is moved to an act of kindness towards the starving boy, gains his trust, and hears his story, with which, as writer and journalist, he wants to honour the dispossessed, and also castigate society with.""The more Elliott talked the sadder I felt. His voice, which had at first been either embarrassed or hushed or suddenly strident with a whore's hard shriek, now had wandered back into something as flat as a farmer's fields. He was eager to tell me everything, and that I was taking notes, far from making him self-conscious, pleased him. He counted for something and his story as well.""I found this an absorbing and tenderly written book, and was further intrigued by White's afterword, where he not only reveals `what's true and what ain't', but also, explores the fact that Crane's earliest biographers (who had known him) were also fabulists. One of them, the critic James Gibbons Huneker, who also features in the `real' sections of White's book, did recount the meeting and conversations between Crane and a young male prostitute, and recorded that Crane began to write a book about his story, perhaps to be a companion piece to an earlier story of a female prostitute `Maggie, A Girl of The Streets' Although this in part clearly acted as a springboard for White's Hotel de Dream, recent researches have revealed that Huneker, and the other early biographer did not always possess pens which flowed with the light of truth","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2PIZVAD62S6WF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003H4RBI0#wasThisHelpful","R2PIZVAD62S6WF","A3MTULATO06OS5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3MTULATO06OS5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Nella Larsen's Passing was originally published in 1929, and is a chilling, chilly account of the politics of race, class and gender. Larsen was an African American, seeing with a rather steely eye into some of the uncomfortable accommodations which might be made in order to best gain the riches and rewards which America offered the educated and wealthy - at least, those who were white - or could `pass' as suchIrene Redfield, involved in charitable foundation work to advance her race, married to a doctor, could indeed `pass' for white, but would regard this as a betrayal of her race. She only uses `passing' in order to gain anonymous access to comfortable places such as tea-rooms in elegant hotels, where, if she didn't `pass' she would be unable to enter.A chance encounter brings her in contact with another `passing' woman whom she has not seen since their girlhood. Clare Kendry however, made different choices through her ability to `pass' Clare has been living as white for some years, married to a white man who is casually racist, she is a part of that wealthy white urban middle class.Irene and Clare have taken very different approaches. Irene has lived more comfortably, protected from harsh economic realities through her husband's position. She is upright, disciplined, correct, gracious and inflexible. She is also, it seems, a person of principle but her principles are arrived at through rationality. She is actually, a little chilly, and very controlling.Clare, by contrast, whose early life was less privileged, lives as an accomplished survivor, exploiting her extraordinary beauty and grace, and the fact that no one in her present milieu dreams she is anything other than one of them. The challenge for Clare though, is that this has led to her losing all contact with `her' people.""It's funny about `passing' We disapprove of it and at the same time condone it. It excites our contempt and yet we rather admire it. We shy away from it with an odd kind of revulsion, but we protect it.""This is a short, most interesting book, rescued from being purely sociological observation by a believable, developing story. The challenge I found was that the writer's style is a little too structured and measured - whether this is because this fits the rather chilly controlled manner of her central character, Irene, I'm not sure, but this is told in the third person, so I suspect it is the author's voice. I do have a preference for more lyrical writing - Larsen is an Enlightenment voice, rather than a Romantic one","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R197M6NL42M7JW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DXXRHIY#wasThisHelpful","R197M6NL42M7JW","A3MTULATO06OS5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3MTULATO06OS5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I had enjoyed, with reservations, Lissa Evans earlier book, Their Finest Hour and A Half, also set on the Home Front during World War 2, which featured a film crew turning out Ministry of Information Films. Evans has a nice line in both humour and pathos, but my reservations of that earlier book were that characters verged a little into caricature, and the book could have withstood a lot of cutting and paring backIn this later book she has done that paring back, and turned her attention to a smaller number of characters and central relationshipsNoel is a 10 year old precocious orphan. Fiercely intelligent, a loner, a bit undersized and easily bullied. And he has a godmother whom he adores, and with whom he lives, rapidly heading for dementia and desperately trying to keep it together. Mattie is home schooling him, in rather anarchic fashion - particularly in left-wing politics, abhorrence of war, and feminist politics (she was a suffragette who was imprisoned and force fed for those pains) Both Noel and Mattie are desperately trying to avoid the authorities finding out how bad things are, and, particularly, neither want Noel to be evacuated to a safer place as the blitz begins to bite.Unfortunately, all attempts fail, and an officious relative of Mattie's steps in and Noel is evacuated to St Alban's.He is a rather unattractive looking child, and has retreated, in grief, to stoic silence, leading to all concluding he is simple minded. As it is the prettiest, most spic and span children who get first picked by host families, Noel is the shop-soiled reject no-one wants. Until Vee, a desperately poor cleaner, on the verge of middle age, living by her wits, supporting her elderly mum and feckless adult son, sees an opportunity for a little extra cash coming her way, by taking in Noel for the duration. Much cleverer than Vee, who is actually possessed of a great deal of imagination and survivor instinct, given half a chance, the two slowly begin to make common ground, finding, for Vee, ways to avoid continuing to be the victim that class and some bad judgements have made of her, and, for Noel, putting his fertile intellect in the service of money making scams gives him the first small beginnings of escaping from grief.Evans has created a couple of extremely likeable oddball, misfit characters whose relationship with each other, initially built on mutual dislike, slowly moves towards something bordering a kind of mutual respect based on what each can gain from the other, into a warm heartedness based initially on `being crooked' in order to survive. There is plenty of humour to be found in the sharp exchanges between the two, with Vee, especially having much to learn from the greater intelligence and wisdom of her young evacuee""We're telling people you're my boy and then you're using words like...like ""original"" and ""hence"" No one from St. Albans ever says ""hence"". And you should say ""my mum"" not ""my mother"" and anyway you just don't sound right. You sound as if you come from somewhere posh and I sound - ``Common', said Noel.Vee coloured. `You don't say things like that about people', she said. She fiddled with her hat. She thought she'd been looking smart and now she felt like a greasy rag. `You don't know anything about me,' she said. `I was at school till I was fifteen, I was clever. I wanted to be a teacher.' ""The nicely drawn supporting characters include Vee's dotty mum, endlessly writing letters to Churchill and Chamberlain, offering them advice on winning the war, her adult son Donald, exempt from call-up through a dicky heart (and scams of his own to pursue) and another very aged suffragette whom Noel befriends.What I particularly liked, is that for all Evans' light touch, there are real emotions which the reader is confronted with. We end up rooting hard for this most unlikely pair of individuals, individually and together.A definite feel-good read.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2T3JJZD31Y85K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LO1T1IQ#wasThisHelpful","R2T3JJZD31Y85K","A3MTULATO06OS5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3MTULATO06OS5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Claire North's (who she?) wonderful page-turning mind-mangle across, primarily, the mid to latter part of the twentieth century is dizzying, disorientating and dazzling!North is already a successful author with a couple of pen-names, within particular genres - YA and fantasy. This book is so very very different that it seemed sensible to use separate names, for different audiences, and to avoid preconceptionsHarry August, is a `Kalachakra'. This concept (if not the word itself) can be found in philosophical thought from both the European Classical Philosophical Tradition, and, (where the term comes from) from the Tibetan Buddhist tradition (sometimes written as Kalacakra) It refers to the concept of time being circular, the wheel of time, as opposed to linear The circularity of time is a concept within which many ideas, from the nature of matter/time and their connections, to the idea of parallel universes, forking time/choice, re-incarnation and the transmigration of souls, can find a home. The Kalachakran is also aware, and has memory of their prior incarnationsNorth has taken the idea of a kind of repetition of time/choice (say, in filmic terms, Groundhog Day AND Sliding Doors) but has come up with a very clever and mind blowing concept - linking classical thinking and the future - that, from recorded history, there have always BEEN those who were reborn, again and again, within their own time frame - not, as it were, time travellers from the future or from the past - if you were born, as Harry August is, in his first life in 1918, and are then reborn, you are reborn into your own life and your own time - still, where you were born the first time, in the same place, but you will have awareness of that earlier life, and may perhaps make different choices, parallel choices, choices which may be occurring in a parallel universe. The clever twist is, there will be other Kalachakra, born perhaps half a generation or a generation later, who may be able to bring you awareness of the future - and `messages' can be passed, next generation child to dying elderly person back and forth through time. Confused? Dizzy? Its like walking in one direction on an escalator travelling in the opposite direction.A club, (dating back thousands of years, reflecting all those thousand years back circular timers) the Cronos Club, a secret organisation, passing messages back and forth in time, exists to protect its own. The law, the rule, which must not be broken is that the large events of past and future must not be changed - to seek to bring future knowledge back into the past is to irretrievably change the nature of the past and thus the future, with potentially cataclysmic effects.Unfortunately someone, or more than one someone, is subtly doing this. Small scientific changes begn to happen, from some time in the 1920s, which should not have happened at that time. Very very subtle technological changes, opening the possibility for earlier discovery of yet more changes. And some members of the Cronos Club are aware of this.North keeps a wonderfully firm hand on her inventions, technologies, theories of physics, and marries this to a very human story. This is absolutely a `literary' novel full of authentic psychology, believable people and relationships in time and space, friendship, betrayal, greed, thirst for power and domination, with a very well thought through twist. There really is plenty for those who like their science fiction to have science within it, not just fiction. There are no aliens, no spaceships, no intergalactic battles - just us, within a period from 1918, comprising most the last century, and a little into this - but with a deeply unsettling, deeply plausible twist - the world is ending (as it will, one day) but, it appears that it will be ending faster as knowledge from a little in the future, gets used a little earlier.The book is full of brilliant pull-the-rug-out twists, which had me absolutely shouting Oh NO Oh YES in shock and recognition.

"In many ways I got more out of reading McCleens's harrowing, bleak and beautifully written book on madness and faith after finishing it, whilst the questions it raised continued to challenge and linger in my mind.Madeline, the central character and narrator has been resident in a psychiatric hospital somewhere in England, for more than 20 years, since being admitted, bloodied and in wild confusion at the age of 14Now a recently appointed new doctor, Doctor Lucas, has been appointed to clean up the asylum and its inmates, and produce meaningful statistics to show his methods work. He decides to fast track the long-term, seriously ill patients with combinations of treatment approaches designed to provoke catharsisMadeline was the daughter of proselytising Christian fundamentalists. Her father, particularly, seemed more closely related to some of the American, separatist sects who hearken back to previous centuries. The family have moved to a small island, somewhere off the coast of Great Britain. Her father, a man who becomes progressively more fearsome and implacable to the young girl, is nonetheless a figure of derision to the local community, who, if believers at all, are of a more moderate and easy kind, and do not wish to be burdened by fervent attempts by what appear to be glassy-eyed zealots, to offer salvationThe reader knows from the start that something traumatic and terrible happened to Madeline, aged 14, and because she has been institutionalised, it was probably something she did, rather than something done to her. We know her mother is dead. We also know at the start of the novel that something......strange seems to have happened to the powerful new doctor, as the novel begins with Madeline meeting a NEW new doctor, who will be changing her treatment.In many ways, enough hints are dropped during the book for the reader to spot the trajectory. WE might be fairly clear about the awfulness of the shocks and revelations to come - but the point of the journey isn't for the reader to discover `what happened next' but for us to discover how Madeline will be affected by what she discovers of her own, deeply buried and forgotten history, which was so traumatic that she has retreated from it into a twenty year amnesia.It is Doctor Lucas, a man in his own way as deeply fanatical and fundamentalist about the implacable rightness of his methods and ideologies about psychiatric medicine as Madeline's father was about religion, who begins to push down the barriers of Madeline's forgettingWhat fascinated me about this story was the unspoken questions and answers about the psychology of those with unshakeable beliefs in their own rightness. McCleen (who was herself brought up in a Christian fundamentalist family) for sure shows us that Madeline and her parents are damaged and damaging by the fierceness of their beliefs. But there are clear parallels between the damage caused by the man of religious faith who cannot be wrong and the man of scientific methodology who cannot be wrong. There is a kind of pathopsychology which is equal and opposite in both.Hypersensitive to something transpersonal and numinous, Madeline is fragile by both nurture and by nature. She hears too much the hidden voices in wind and water, as it were, and is not enough aware of the materiality of wind and water.This is, without a doubt, a deeply lacerating, sorrowful, and painful book.However, it is also stunningly beautiful in places - Madeline's fragility and sensitivity give her a sense of wonder and poetic engagement to that which cannot purely be reduced to matter. She has a kind of joyous, romantic, Pantheistic immersion in life-in-the-landscape.""The land was glowing at the edges, catching light here and there as if someone was running with a burning branch and touching life into it. That morning, I felt it was being presented to me, and each day, for quite a long time after that, waking up was like being a gift that I tore open again and again. We each tore it in our different ways""McCleen's book has left me thinking a lot about the particular dangers of an implacable sense of rightness, the midline of complexities and discomfort which are the lot for those who accept a world without unswerving certainties, and, on the other end of the spectrum, those for whom the absence of any possibility of any certainties may be such a terror that it drives them towards and under the influence of those who admit no questions or doubts at all.I received this as a review copy from Amazon Vine UK","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2HRO2HI57SIIC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00L2DMYT4#wasThisHelpful","R2HRO2HI57SIIC","A3MTULATO06OS5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3MTULATO06OS5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Neels Robbins and his wife June, twenty years younger, are both like relicts of the sixties: teachers, suffused with the ideals of A.S. Neill, and, in Neels' case in particular, a strong belief in the ideas of Jean Jacques Rousseau, particularly in the educational field.The title of the book is from Rousseau's Emile: a treatise on education:""Let there be no book but the world""Experience itself is to be the teacher, and the child - a kind of noble savage, with innate and inherent goodness an humanity - is not to have its potential confined, restrained, restricted by the strait-jacket of formal education.Neels sets up a school and a community to further these ideals. June is a teacher at that school. They have two children, Ava and Fred. However, even within the community of children and adults who are allowed to be free to express themselves without restriction, and who might be considered to be eccentrics by the 9-5 society, Frederick is strange. Very strange, disturbed and disturbing. As labelling with a diagnosis, and, having labelled, treating, is counter to Neels' philosophies, as it implies a judgement on Fred's strangeness as wrong. Had he been diagnosed, his symptoms would most probably have put him somewhere on the autistic spectrumAva is more `normal' and indeed, yearns for a more normal childhood, a more normal school, to Neels' annoyance and disappointment. But she too has a kind of disenganged, dissociative quality to her nature. As do both her charismatic father and her less-hard-line in view mother.Twenty years after the childhood experience, which might be seen, by some (Neels' view) as having been idyllic, but might be seen by others (and this, at times, is Ava's view) as having not served them that well, not helped them to fit into the world and into relationships with others, Neels and June have died, through illness and old age. Fred and Ava drifted away from contact with each other.In fact, Fred has become a drifter, a loner, earning his living here and there in unskilled labour. Ava is a peripatetic music teacher, `The Singalong lady', and is married to Dennis, the brother of her closest, her only, childhood friend Kitty.And the story begins thus: Fred is arrested in connection with the disappearance, and later death, of a young boy. It seems likely that Fred kidnapped the boy, and, once his body is discovered, possible that Fred killed himAva, in first person narration, sets out in shock on a journey both actual and in memory, to try and understand what has happened. Everything she knows about Fred tells her he cannot be a murderer. She believes he is innocent - but, if he isn't, who is responsible for what he has become. Are her parents, particularly her father, to blame. How responsible is Ava herself, for not taking sufficient care of a younger brother difficult to love.Other strands of the story are told as from the point of view of her husband Dennis, from Kitty her best friend and sister in law, now a therapist, and, finally from Freddy himselfThis is a slowly unfolding, very thoughtful book, and if some of the events are hinted at, signalled, - and some are surprising and shocking, it is more an exploration of understanding (for Ava) and a series of further reflective questions, not always answered, for Ava and for the reader.Cohen writes carefully, reflectively and well, and I settled in with interest and absorption to this book as it deepened and revealed itself.This was a very satisfying read, though something about it meant it is a book I enjoyed, a lot, but was not in the end unstoppably grabbed by.The reason for this lies in the fact that all the central characters have this sense of detachment, observation rather than engagement, in the worlds they live in. As I haven't read any other books by Cohen, I don't know if this is a symptom of her writing more generally, or specific to this book only.I am most engaged by those writers who can not only credibly show me other lives, and make me understand them and be interested in them, as Cohen absolutely does, but can do this not by a mere observation of those other lives, but, somehow, by getting me to inhabit them. Because that is where their own writing springs from, a kind of inside of the other empathy, rather than a dispassionate, more aloof observation.Cohen's characters, are all observers rather than inhabiters, with the possible exception of Kitty,I received this as a review copy from Amazon Vine UK","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1CSU6FT49NEYM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IJKJTMI#wasThisHelpful","R1CSU6FT49NEYM","A3MTULATO06OS5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3MTULATO06OS5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Woodson is a black American, and tells her story as a `brown girl' born in 1963, both as her own, individual family story and the wider story of black history from a particular time and place. She is an award winning writer for children and teens, but her reach goes way beyond being confined to appeal `only to children'In many ways, I think the challenge involved in recognising that children are completely capable of understanding great and subtle complexity of meaning, but that they may not have quite the sophistication of adult vocabulary, is a brilliant discipline for a writer - it hones their craft. Some writing about complexity for adults leads to writing becoming over fussy, even designed to confuse or show off dexterity, but the really excellent writer who chooses to write for a younger audience - like Woodson - somehow keeps all the layers of meaning held within simply arresting, clear images, clear languageI had to take this clear and pared down book extremely slowly and very carefully, anxious not to miss anything.Woodson's words are spoken softly, but they are powerful, and her images rolled unstoppably over me, leaving me, many times, breathlessly weepingThe starting point, is a poem by Langston Hughes, the rest of the story is Woodson'sHold fast to dreamsFor if dreams dieLife is a broken-winged birdThat cannot flyHold fast to dreamsFor when dreams goLife is a barren fieldFrozen with snowBorn in Ohio, but raised also in South Carolina, where her mother and her father's mother were from, she tells of an experience from the North and the South.She reminds us that in 1963:In Birmingham, Alabama, Martin Luther King Jr.is planning a march on Washington, whereJohn F. Kennedy is president.In Harlem, Malcolm X is standing on a soapbox talking about a revolutionmeanwhile :In Montgomery, only seven years have passed since Rosa Parks refusedto give upher seat on a city busShe recounts the confusing experience of marital break-up, from the child's viewpoint, and the pain when families are torn apart, the conflicts when the people you love are no longer all living together - a sense that `home' is forever lost because it now belongs in several different placesOur feet are beginning to belongin two different worlds-Greenvilleand New York. We don't know how to comehomeand leavehomebehind us.To set against the pain of loss and breakup as relationships end and the older generation who were strong and powerful become frail and the ones to be looked after, is Jacqueline's secret excitement at beginning to master words, to discover that she is, she will be, a teller or storiesFor days and days, I could only sniff the pageshold the notebook closelisten to the sound the papers made.Nothing in the world is like this-a bright white page withpale blue lines.

"The Slaves of Solitude is set in 1943 in a suburban boarding house, in `Thames Lockdon' (loosely modelled on Henley-on-Thames) There is a seedy, penny pinching respectability, a po-faced rather right-wing sense of little-England righteousness which stalks the pages and the mean, soulless little rooms of the `Rosamund Tea Rooms'. Rosamund is no longer a tea-room. The economies of war have turned the tea rooms into a boarding house, where those of more than slender means have found possibly their final resting places - several of the residents are quiet elderly spinsters or widows.The central character is Enid Roach - how she hates both her names, and the spiteful sobriquet of Roachy, or even worse, Cockroach, which were hers as a not successful teacher. Miss Roach is teetering on the edge of 40. She is a refugee from London, where she still works as a publisher's assistant, though to be honest, more of her work involves accounts and clerical duties than reading manuscripts. Bombing flattened her rented accommodation in London; hence she has shored up here, commuting daily.She is far less grey and nondescript and irretrievably spinster than she thinks. Various onlookers (some of them the elderly ladies and gentlemen in the boarding house) like her ability to be more free-thinking and less petty and insular than many. For example, she leans towards sympathy with Russia, and does not automatically assume that every German is a Nazi. She also has a certain something `a rather nice face' which makes some men see her as not quite past interest.Unfortunately, the boarding house also contains a horribly blustering and opinionated bully in the person of Mr Thwaites, who embodies everything about little-England righteousness, and an unerring instinct to attack the tender and kind, who don't have the killer instinct to lash back. His victim, on a daily basis in the nasty boarding house dining room, is Enid.Two other major movers of the novel's dynamic are a kindly, heavy-drinking American, one of the `over paid, over-sexed, over-here's, Lieutenant Pike, who has some designs on Enid, and a further nemesis, in the hands of Vicki Kugelmann, a German woman who has lived in England for well over a decade, and has been taken under Enid's kindly wing, in part because of her degree of being ostracised for being German, but, also for representing, like the Lieutenant, a wider world.Hamilton captures, beautifully, the narrow world, the thinking processes, the pettiness and the glories of his characters. Although in many ways this is a dark, sad book, echoing Enid's sad cry:`at last she put out the light, and turned over, and adjusted the pillow, and hopefully composed her mind for sleep - God help us, God help all of us, every one, all of us'it is also horribly, viciously comic in its exposure of the nasty, small-minded petty tyranny of the Mr Thwaites of the world, who imagine their spiteful drivel and their pompous utterances against their fellows is `bluff humour' instead of the wearing, pointless savageness of its true nature:`You know', said Mrs Barratt, I don't think you really like the Russians, Mr Thwaites. I don't think you realise what they're doing for us.' ....Mr Thwaites was momentarily taken aback by this unexpected resistance, and there was a pause in which his eyes went glassy.`Ah' he said at last. `Don't I?....Don't I...Well, perhaps I don't...Maybe I thinks more than I says. Maybe I has my private views....'Oh God, thought Miss Roach, now he was beginning his ghastly I-with-the-third-person business. As if bracing herself for a blow (as she looked at the tablecloth), she waited for more, and more came.`I Keeps my Counsel.' said Mr Thwaites, in his slow treacly voice. `Like the Wise Old Owl, I Sits and Keeps my Counsel.'Hamilton is clear where his loyalties lie, and where he wants ours to lie. `Thwaiteness' is not the glittering crime-against-humanity which fills the news, which `the silent majority' may look at, and tut at, in horror, but it is instead, a relentless small spitefulness and viciousness, on a daily basis, which arises out of those small lives, as much as, on the other side, daily small kindnesses may arise from the lives of the nameless.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1CGDVNIU7W83R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1590172205#wasThisHelpful","R1CGDVNIU7W83R","A3MTULATO06OS5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3MTULATO06OS5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"And of course, she can. One of the many qualities I admire in Tremain's writing is that she is not someone with just one book, endlessly regurgitated, in her. Other than the excellence of her writing, always present, she is capable of inhabiting many times, places, themes, characters and plots. This facility sets her up well for the short story.One of the major problems (to my mind) with the genre, is that the time taken to read a short story may (or may not) fit well with a reader's own time for reading. Finish a short story when you still perhaps have another 10 or 15 minutes that you had wanted to spend reading, and you may need to start another story. This can mean you rather lose the sense of completion and reflection on the one just finished, and, possibly even worse, if you read too many shorts at a sitting you quickly discover the author's `tricks'. Because Tremain is not formulaic, I didn't get repetitive read syndrome from her collection!The subject matter of many of the stories is love and its loss - and this is explored not only in romantic love, but also in the love between parents and children, both ways, and the loss which may happen through bereavement and also the passage of time and shifting of relationship between children and their parents, over a lifetimeThere is also a strong literary flavour to several of the stories. The title story concerns a young woman who had a damaging relationship with an older man, and, partly in an attempt to heal, turns the relationship into a highly successful novel. Life seeps into art, with interesting consequences for the woman.I also particularly liked The Housekeeper, an imagined story of the inspiration for Daphne du Maurier's iconic Rebecca, in particular, the character of Mrs Danvers. This story was a little like looking in distorting mirrors, as Tremain plays with fact and fictionThe Jester of Astapovo takes the reality of the death of Leon Tolstoy, but from the point of view of the station master of the little isolated place where Tolstoy, on the run from his wife, came by chance to dieI preferred these longer stories, 30 pages or so, to the shorter ones, probably because of the possibility of clearer development of character, as events unfold.The only story which I was not so enamoured with was the final one, `21st century Juliet' a modern reworking of Romeo and Juliet set across class divides, and incorporating immigrants from Moldavia. This was the only story which seemed a little contrived","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RHK2D32ODPDDH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LO1T1OA#wasThisHelpful","RHK2D32ODPDDH","A3MTULATO06OS5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3MTULATO06OS5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Love, death and the wild, wide worldHelen MacDonald's aching, raw story of loss and relationship speaks so much of longing that reading it is as much about being fed, sustained by grief, as her hawk is fed by the death it has dealt. Indeed the two, love and death, are linked.We love because we will lose, or be lost to, that which we love. It's the presence of death which fiercens the love. Mabel, Helen's hawk, is of course overwhelmingly real - but that reality is thickened by all the metaphors accreting to her. The potency is the potency of what the hawk represents, in history, in literature, in imagination to us.There are 3 major strands in this book. The first, which created or re-created all the rest, is the loss of MacDonald's father, and the bottomless grief that brought a sundering of relationship, an absence.As a child, MacDonald had been obsessed, possessed by falcons, birds of prey, and then, specifically, the goshawk. So the second strand is the making of relationship. She returns to everything that initial possession was about, and engages on building a relationship with a goshawk. Which she discovers can only be done by negating herself, becoming an absence, as, initially, in any way, the presence of human is too harsh for the incredibly highly charged, responsive, awareness of a terrified hawk. Human space can only become tolerable to hawk by the patience to not intrudeAnd, finally, she examines another writer T.H. White. White was also a passionate hawker. He was a man painfully within his challenging contradictions. Like the goshawk, one with a charged, reactive  nervous system. White had recorded his own story of relationship with goshawk, The Goshawk. I hope that the success of MacDonald's book encourages the re-publishing of White's, as I'm now anxious to read it.Much of White's account (there are plenty of extracts in MacDonald's book) is dark, anguished, irrational. And much of MacDonald's book is also outside the rational - there are many accounts of her vivid dreams, the boiling of raging emotions, the unendurable overwhelm of feeling. But this is part of the power of this book. We are not creatures of reason alone, reason the visible tip of a fiery iceberg beneath.MacDonald's book was another one of those which I read with a sense of some deep value I can't articulate - through a mist of weeping. The value is that of having, often, no idea at all of the why of that weeping. All I can say is that, for me, weeping without any obvious, recognisable emotion behind the weeping is a way in which my body seems to respond to something being named from a place of authenticity. Reason says `I don't understand' but, on some deep level, the fabric of my being respondedA book this raw and personal somehow calls forth the raw and personal response from the reader. I would have liked to have read it slowly and savouringly, and maybe this is what I'll be able to do, at some point, on a re-read, as I know the writing is very fine, and the information, about hawks, landscapes, T.H. White, and more, of interest. But I was not able to read it like that. Instead, a savage gulping down of chunks of it, thrown this way and that by feeling and sensation. Longing, I suppose. That desire to experience the world through the sinews of some other than human understanding.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RXAZTPNJDHRD8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JLLD7TU#wasThisHelpful","RXAZTPNJDHRD8","A3MTULATO06OS5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3MTULATO06OS5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Ruth Rendell writing as Barbara Vine can always be relied on to produce a complex, absorbing and intelligent page turner.In this book, published in 2002, which I have been happily re-reading, the major topics are genetically inherited diseases (a topic which also featured in The House Of Stairs) the ticking of the biological clock, and the challenges children (or the lack of them) can impose on a relationship, and, perhaps more surprisingly the Reformation of the House of Lords 1999 Act, which removed the voting rights of the majority of hereditary peers.Martin, 4th Lord Nanther is a biographer. He is researching a biography of his great-grandfather, who was elevated to the peerage by Queen Victoria. Henry Nanther was one of Victoria's Physicians-In-Extraordinary. He was a specialist in haemophilia and as is known, one of Victoria's sons, Prince Leopold, was a haemophiliac.As Martin investigates his family tree it becomes obvious that Henry was a man with a succession of secrets, and with no doubt bloody skeletons in the cupboard.Meanwhile, Jude, Martin's dearly loved second wife, increasingly hears the insistent rhythm of the biological clock, and, despite a history of miscarriage, is increasingly desperate to conceive. Martin already has an adult child from his first marriage, and is secretly unwilling to be a father again, though unable to express this to Jude.And, running parallel to the story of the past (his exploration into the life of his ancestor) and of the future (the question of offspring) are the present debates of the abolition of the voting rights of hereditary peers. Martin has a traditional affection for his status, even though at times he finds the weight of history and custom stultifying. The further he enters into his great-grandfather's past, the past of `the blood doctor' and the mysterious history of haemophilia, how it arose in families and was transmitted, the more he finds himself thinking about bloodlines and inheritance in terms of the history of the House of LordsIf I have made this sound dry, it's not my intention - it is a slow paced, thorough, detailed and very absorbing page turner.If, as some reviewers have noted, some of the story of the big reveal of the First Lord Nanther's secret life is pretty obvious to a half awake reader, that is not really the `point' of the book. Sure there are mysteries where the feverish page turning is the reader wanting to know what happens next, but there is another kind of page turner, where the reader, understanding the forms of fiction, may absolutely be ahead of the game and know the outcome - but the point of the journey of discovery is not the reader's - it is the journey of discovery the central character or characters need to make. And this book is really that second kind.The reader has the benefit of hindsight and is in fact the almost omniscient one, but, as in life, what so often might be perfectly obvious to an outside observer on another person's life is not what the person deep within their own story is aware of.Rendall-as-Vine is thorough and absorbing in her research - she does it deeply, and imparts it lightly.As ever, she is meticulous and fascinating in her creation of different times, and places, thoroughly believeable characters, and their motivations. As the reader sees where things are heading, they may well think `surely no one would...........' but, in fact Martin Nanther is the one who makes sense of the why, in the closing pages of the book","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RADV2JWRYZFFG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1400032520#wasThisHelpful","RADV2JWRYZFFG","A3MTULATO06OS5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3MTULATO06OS5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This wonderfully witty first outing in a series by L.C. Tyler certainly falls into the sub-category of crime fiction now described as `cosy'. I loudly and publicly chortled, whinnied, snickered, giggled and less ostentatiously grinned through this clever, playful, good humoured outing. Though set firmly in the modern era - emails do get a mention - our central character/investigators could quite happily have been travelled back to the 50s.Ethelred Tressider is a crime writer. Actually, this rather old-fashioned, donnish and endearing individual is 3 writers (with different pen-names) Although he dreamed of being a Booker-winning lit-ficcy type of scribe he happened to write a first novel, featuring a rather plodding but meticulous detective, 2 years away from retirement, which was a fairly runaway success. (sounds a bit familiar?) Twelve novels later his detective has miraculously aged 6 months and acquired an interest in gloomy Norman Church Architecture. Tressider has also started another series, historical crime, (sounds familiar?) set in the time of Richard II, and also (sounds very familiar?) a third, female identity as a doctors-and-nurses romance writer. His no-doubt lantern jawed doctor specialises in oral and maxillofacial surgery.Ethelred has an opinionated, overweight literary agent with a remarkably bad dress-sense, and an obsessive predilection for low-end chocolate bars. Size and availability matter far more than quality. Elsie is probably the best and most clear sighted chum that Ethelred will ever have. Though she does also keep her beady eyes upon her twelve and a half percent.When a murder is committed close to Ethelred's home in more ways than one - not only location, but also, the victim is his dead wife, Ethelred is of course one immediate suspect. But rather in the manner of some of those other `cosy writers' (Ngaio Marsh sprung most to my mind, because of the wit in Tyler's writing) the obvious is not the only route. Whilst Ethelred is rather keen to uncover what is going on, it is Ethel (who is the author of some of the chapters) who is most keen - principally because she thought Geraldine, the ex-wife, was a total Bitch. For some reason Ethelred is less keen to have Elsie along as his `herring-seller's apprentice' The title of the book comes from the fact that a crime-writer's major tool-of-the-trade is the liberal use of the red-herringFull of sassy, witty, sideways pokes of fun at writers, the writing and publishing industry, writer's blocks, crime fiction in particular - including several delicious little forays into well-known writer/book pastiches, this wonderfully light touch outing introduces an investigative pair who will no doubt continue their affectionate, exasperating, bickering relationship in the unmasking of other crimes. Though (whispers) the apprentice, Elsie, on this showing is probably the more efficient investigator of the two.Tyler himself has also now launched into the first of a second series - set in historical times A Cruel Necessity (A John Grey Historical Mystery) Look out in a few years' time for the love lives of dentists to make an outing!....and I've immediately downloaded the next in the adventures of Elsie and Ethelred Ten Little Herrings.

"Simply, I loved this book, though it took me quite some time to realise that.Miranda Richmond Mouillot, an American woman whose maternal grandparents were Jews living in France at the time of the Second World War, was driven to discover the truth about the effects of that devastating time on her grandparents, individually, and on their relationshipHer grandparents had a seemingly rather unusual story : they met, at some point in the 40s, as two very different people, trying to make sense of themselves in a time and place without sense. Anna was a doctor, specialising in lung medicine. Armand did not have such a clear vocation, although later he was an interpreter at the Nuremburg trials (he spoke German as well as French) More specifically he was one of the interpreters and translators involved in translating Goering's spoken testimony.At some earlier point, as part of a group of Jews trying to stay a step ahead of the Nazi occupation of France, the two met. Actually, they seem to have met, lost contact and made contact on a few occasions. It is assumed that they fell in love. They certainly married and had two children. And at some point bought a house in Alba-la-Romaine. However, something hidden, not addressed by either, some family secret, happened in that marriage, and after a very short period Anna left France with her children, and the two never spoke to each other again, though certainly Anna's daughter, Miranda's mother, and Miranda herself, stayed in contact with both of them.  Armand moved to Switzerland. Armand particularly would neither speak to, nor about, Anna. Mention of her threw him into cold ragesMiranda needed to understand what had happened in her family, but for more than purely individual reasons.The book is her quest, through visits and conversations with her beloved grandmother and her more distant, erratic grandfather, to get to the narrative of those lives - and the lives of others, in that time. Through her own experience as the grandchild of European Jews, she shows how the dark events of those times still continue a presence handed down to later generations.The book is fascinating as a piece of investigation, but is much more than that. There is the objective truth which might be provided by records and the like, and then there are the personal stories, the memories which overlay the stories, and indeed may come to feel more real than what may be indicated by records. There is something also, mysterious, some sort of `collective unconscious'. For example, Miranda's potent, overwhelming response to the sight of the dilapidated, decaying, neglected house her grandparents had bought half a century earlier - her sense of coming home.I'm not revealing any of the rather complex personal stories which Miranda found, as answers to her quest, as that is the reader's journey to make. There is also much that she failed to discover, and the failures, the not-knowns, became in the end as potent as what was known, in terms of what the whole process of finding precise causes and effects to her family mystery.  Indeed the mystery of that time, goes wider than purely the narrative , or attempt at a narrative, of one particular family; so much of what happened in Europe at that time still seems beyond any rational comprehensionMouillot writes very well - and, at times, but not too often, she writes beautifully, arrestingly. And what I mean by that, is that the reader is along for the journey, and from time to time the author will make a comment which stops the reader in their tracks, and makes them think - often a statement which needs to be reflected on, and sometimes a passage of description of the landscape, the country, the people, which rather grabs the reader by the heart and takes them inside the experience she wishes to help us feel.As I progressed deeper onwards through the book, I found myself, often, with tears pouring down my face, because something of the heart of the experience of `another' - other lives, had struck me. And I did not always rationally know where those tears had come from. In the end, I discovered pages and pages of highlighted text, where Mouillot had made me pause, pause, pause again and understand something of experiences of another time and place, filtered down the generations.This is a very tender book, soulful and authentic, and took me to many more reflective places than I initially expected. Recommended without reservationsI received this as an ARC from the publishers.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJ4EG0QUFD1EY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0804140642#wasThisHelpful","RJ4EG0QUFD1EY","A3MTULATO06OS5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3MTULATO06OS5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Now I am not, in the general run of things, a reader of the Romance genre. Not unless there is a lot more going on than just the simple story of boy/girl meets boy/girl, there is some sort of problem, there may also be some sort of rival boy/girl and the main couple will/will not surmount the obstacle and live happily ever after/die a horrible death.In fact, it has to be said I infinitely (in literature!) prefer the tragic end/star crossed lovers scenario than the Hollywood, sunset, hearts, flowers, wedding bells wrap. Unless skilfully done, with lots more going on (yes, that's you, Jane Austen, incomparable writer of fine romance and much more) the genre leads to a sugar overload which might predispose regular readers to diabetes.So, it is no wonder that I never encountered Mary Stewart, as she does belong firmly on the Romance shelf - and, but, and, but I would therefore never have ventured there - till my interest was piqued by a book blogger who likes the same sort of lit-ficcy stuff I do, and for very similar reasons. She was praising Stewart to the skies. So I asked her to recommend one. And this is it.Now, for sure this sits firmly within the genre, in that there is a man and a woman who will meet, there are problems ahead, there is indeed some possible rival and there will be/or not some resolution of satisfaction or dissatisfaction for our central characters (and no, I shan't tell, you'll have to read the book if you really want to know) Suffice it to be said though that Mary Stewart, now having some of her work re-issued in the `Modern Classic' category, was a prolific writer of Gothic romance-thrillers. Oh, and 'Gothic' is not used in the twenty first century sense to mean that you are going to be unpleasantly surprised to find a job lot of vampires werewolves zombies and ghosts have somehow got trapped within the pages. Think, more, the idea of dark secrets, high drama, possibly an isolated setting, or the idea of all this in the mind of our doughty probably female protagonist. She writes with a history which happily acknowledges `Gothic' in the sense of Austen's Northanger Abbey, or, even more pertinently for THIS book, Jane Eyre, rather than Hammer Horror Central Casting. The Gothic is very real and very human.I was hooked from page one to page-the-end. There is indeed a dark thriller, we have men tall, dark, handsome, charismatic and probably not to be trusted. It is the 1950s. Our central character , Linda Martin. (shades of Jane Eyre, which even she acknowledges, as she is a well-read young woman) is an orphan, whose parents died when she was young. She spent the second half of her childhood in an orphanage, and then, as a young assistant in a dreary school. Chance comes Linda's way to become a governess (hello Jane!) to a little boy, scion of a family with a dark past and a probably darker future, deep in the French countryside. The family have a slightly different version of Mr Rochester on board. For reasons which are perfectly intelligent Linda, who is half-French (French mother, English father) and who lived in France until her parents' death pretends that she speaks very little French and understands even less - the employer was strict in their requirement for an ENGLISH governess as they wanted the boy spoken to only in English - though there may be other reasons for this. Linda's hiding of her perfect French and her French ancestry gives rise to a lot of intentional humour for the reader. Linda is a most attractive heroine, given to self-mockery, and is someone who rather enjoys winding up the bad-tempered people she meets with deliberate mangling of `Franglais' to annoy.There are apposite little quotes, often from Shakespeare, as sub-chapter headings - our heroine/narrator, as stated earlier, is a reader.Stewart is a wonderful writer - and particularly, a wonderful evoker of landscape. As I did some exploration into her life and works, I was utterly unsurprised to find she was a passionate gardener. Anyone who can so beautifully and evocatively describe plants, trees, skies, light and the scents, sights and sounds of the natural world is someone who has spent loving time within that world.And, just like Miss Austen and Miss Bronte, Miss Stewart comes from a time when what is undoubtedly sex and desire is rendered much more potent for the fact it is not laid out for us. She is much more interested in exploring the subtle workings of the human psyche, than the rather more prosaic exploration of removed garments and anatomical diagram!And, suffice it to say I have now downloaded Stewart's My Brother Michael, also highly praised, and will be skulking the Romance shelves of my local library to find more by this fine author.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3W26RMCKX8609/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004YD1S8C#wasThisHelpful","R3W26RMCKX8609","A3MTULATO06OS5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3MTULATO06OS5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"What is particularly fine about Sansom's Shardlake, is not just that there are complex, credible stories, blending known history with the imagined individuals Sansom so wonderfully delineates, nor just the excellent evocation and fleshing out of time, place and history itself, in a form without dryness  - what is known or surmised from research given life and fascinating detail, nor even just the marvellous word-smithery, the satisfying way words, sentences, paragraphs and all the rest are put together.Instead, it is I suppose the creation of a character, lawyer Matthew Shardlake, who is wonderfully complex, authentic, self aware, honest about his failings - and is totally credible. I love the insecurity and keeping-the-reader-guessing of the Unreliable narrator - but, actually, with what relief I surrendered to an utterly reliable narrator, letting the reader inside his heart and head - it is the WORLD our narrator lives in, which is unreliable, dangerous, not to be trusted.And what a world it is. It is 1546, Henry VIIIth, monstrous, psychopathic, with ultimate power,  is dying. The kingdom is riven with religious and political extremism, with factions vying for power and control, readying themselves for the time when the king dies (itself a treasonous topic to even give voice to). Henry's son, Edward, is still a boy - which faction will win the right to rule as Regent? These were most dangerous times - particularly as Henry flip-flops, as his health declines, in his own faith on the spectrum of reform and tradition. It's a most Orwellian time, with trials for heresy, torture, betrayal and burning for espousing beliefs which may have been acceptable last month, and are so no longer, this.Shardlake (well, I should probably say, Sansom) drops nuggets of fascination on every page about this period in the dying years of Henry's reign, like the fact that the very clothing people wore could be something which broke the law - there was a class system in terms of who could wear what, fabrics, colours, decoration - you literally were not allowed to dress above your station - or the details of Tudor medical practice.But, to return to Shardlake. Someone, another reviewer, possibly a blogger, made mention that Shardlake felt like `a friend'. And that it is exactly. A fictional person (I suppose we must admit) but one so real that the reader kind of forgets Sansom wrote the book, as the `I' of Shardlake's narration is so very, very real. And because we care so much for this remarkably honest, perceptive and subtle man, we care for those HE cares for, we see the world through HIS eyes, we trust who HE trusts, and if he is mistaken in his trust it hurts US, we too feel the betrayal. He is a kind of moral touchstone. Weirdly, very very weirdly Shardlake reminds me of Jane Eyre - in that, here we have a person who can look at themselves clear, a person that others see as having fine judgement, a person of intelligence and integrity.I must admit it took me an age to read this 600 page book, simply because I found my level of anxiety and unease too high to sit with - the painting of that world 5 centuries ago rendered close and very scary indeed.`Lamentation' the title of the book refers to a very dangerous pamphlet, a kind of religious confessional, written by Henry's last wife, Catherine Parr, which has gone missing. The Queen's faith is a little too radical/reformist compared to what Henry is now professing, as he is beginning to lean towards a more traditionalist, Catholic stance, as regards belief about the Mass. Along with the investigations and schisms in Court, between King's party and Queen's party, Shardlake also has private investigations, particularly the difficult case of a brother and sister, one a religious reformist, one a traditionalist, with a deep enmity between them, and a hidden secret, implacably fighting each other over a will which has been designed to foster their personal enmity. Fiction and fact, private individual and the larger stage of known, powerful, historical men and women, are woven together most skilfully.Tremendous, absorbing, and very chilling. Particularly when we too could be said to live in `interesting times', where, to quote a well known line from a poem by W.B. Yeats - `the best lack all conviction, whilst the worst are full of passionate intensity' - fervent, implacable ideas of right and wrong, MY right, YOUR wrong, stalk the land.I finished this caught up in a huge roller-coaster of emotions, feeling both relief and sorrow, and thinking about certain ambiguities. Who knows.There is also a very useful laying out of historical fact, and also historical conjecture, by Sansom, at the end of the novelI received this as a review copy from the publishers, Mulholland Press","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R16HI3TGB5E53X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00K6ECROM#wasThisHelpful","R16HI3TGB5E53X","A3MTULATO06OS5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3MTULATO06OS5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""I seemed to see Bell as she was almost the first time I ever saw her, walking into the hall at Thornham to tell us that her husband had shot himself""From the first chapter of The House of Stairs........and yes, it's a great hookline!I read this many years ago, and a blogger reminded me of its excellence, hence my re-read, and because I know the outcome/conclusion could settle back and enjoy the journey Vine takes us on.It was originally published in 1988, and was I think the third book Rendell wrote as `Barbara Vine', where her interest is more in dark and complex psychology and a more literary style of writing than her crime and detective fiction `Ruth Rendell' books. Detectives rarely figure in Vine, but the complex central characters twist and unfold often dark deeds, dark motivations, dark historiesThis is firstly a splendid evocation of loose, permissive, vibrant and sexy 60s London.Elizabeth, the central character and narrator, now a woman on the edge of her 40s, is looking back from the 1980s to that earlier period of her life. She is a writer of beach read historical fiction, fairly famous, fairly well off. However, she hankered to be a more serious writer, due to her love of Henry James, and really also wished to write a biography of James. Echoes of the plot of James' Wings of The Dove are a kind of parallel or subtext to this.Elizabeth, as a passenger in a taxi spots a woman heading towards a tube station who she has not seen for nearly 20 years. `Bell' Sanger has a murky past, and there is also a relationship from that past of some obsession, on Elizabeth's part, with Bell.The first person story is told by Elizabeth partly in present time (that is its 80s setting) and partly back to the time when she first encountered Bell, in the 60s, and their lives connected, in a dark and destructive way. The narrator is trying to unravel her own past, her own complicity, her own history, and understand her own damaged life. Much of this damage occurred in `The House of Stairs', a large house in West London, owned by Elizabeth's recently widowed aunt, Cosette, who is wealthy, generous, and middle-aged . Cosette is determined to recapture the youth and romance she never had by filling her house with the trendy, freeloading, experimental bright (and not so bright) bohemian young things of swinging London.Bell has a dark past which we learn all the way back to childhood. She is extraordinarily beautiful, bearing a strong resemblance to Bronzini's portrait of Lucrezia Panciatichi. She appears to be passive and indifferent to sex, but is passionately determined never to work. In fact, for Bell, a life of drudging poverty is preferable to working. But freeloading, though not in an obvious way, is something she has a skill for.Elizabeth too has a potentially dark secret - as an inheritor of a degenerative, rare condition, Huntington's chorea, her family `curse' which may or may not lie dormant within her. At the time of the book's earlier setting, predictive genetic testing for the disease was unknown, as was the statistical mapping of its inheritance. As the condition tended to stay dormant till adulthood inheritors might have already had children before they realised what they might have passed on to them. Elizabeth's own body feels like a ticking time bomb; though symptom free, she is not yet old enough to know she is `out of the woods' and free from that inheritance.So, with her aunt Cosette, desperately seeking to rediscover youth, Elizabeth unknowing whether she will succumb to a terrible condition or not, and Bell, charismatic in some unostentatious way, amorally in search of a way to enable her to suck the money out of anyone she can, and indifferent towards the methods she might use to achieve her ends, Vine assembles a wonderfully drawn collection of individuals from across the classes, painting a portrait of a society moving from the more rigid mores of the 50s to a period of change, shake up and anything goes sex.And the twists, turns and plot intricacies, though slowly unfurled, are inexorable and keep the reader glued to `just another chapter'","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1TJG2BBUNETJP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0140114467#wasThisHelpful","R1TJG2BBUNETJP","A3MTULATO06OS5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3MTULATO06OS5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Good Heavens! Michelle Lovric has a rich, inventive imagination, steeps herself in research, wears it lightly, and overflows with a kind of earthy vitality that seems to belong to an earlier century and indeed to be more akin to South American literature than English literature. Or it may just be the time and the place she is writing aboutThe marvellous Book of Human Skin is set in Venice, and also in Peru, or what later became Peru, at the tail end of the eighteenth century, up to and beyond Napoleon's death on St. Helena in 1821The book is written in 5 voices, each of which is excellently delineated. Two of them are quite definitely of the devil's party, even though one of them is a deranged nun who believes she is due to ascend in beatitude, and 3 are most definitely on the side of the angelsMinguello Fasan, born in 1784 is a vile, sadistic, sneering, puffed up and very funny scion of the house of Fasan. He bears more than a passing resemblance to the monstrously compelling central character of Patrick Susskind's Perfume. Minguello, right from the start has a whiff of brimstone about him, and whether by nature or by nurture is determined to express that fully. He is the second born of the house, and aware of the dislike in which everyone holds him, including his parents, is determined to inherit all his family's substantial riches. And he is a passionate collector of books which are bound in Human Skin.Marcella Fasan is his younger sister. Born with a congenital weakness, she is nonetheless loved by all, and almost immediately becomes the next target of Minguello's sadism and ire (something happens to his older sibling) Marcella is intelligent, a gifted wielder of the pen and pencil, loyal, loving, resourceful and refuses to accept the role Minguello assigns her (dead through his many designs)Gianni delle Boccole is bright, devoted to Marcella, but appears a dolt. By circuitous means he learned to read (though most assume him illiterate); he is Marcello's valet. Though he can read, he can barely write, and certainly has a more than usually phonetic grasp of spelling. Initially, his often hugely funny misspellings were a little irritating or contrived, but by the third or fourth of Gianni's tellings of the tale, I was sold on him. And some of the tale is so dark and seamy than the levity of unintentional writos are a relief!Doctor Santo Aldobrandini is a poor young orphan, with a desperate desire to help and heal, and a large and tender heart, who gets himself, by hook or by crook, apprenticed to learn the craft of physic.These four start their journey in Venice, a proud, patrician, sophisticated, urbane, cultured - not to mention decadent (according to some) - state, whose fortunes will be changed by Napoleon.Sor Loreta, the deranged, delusional nun, dreams of becoming a martyr, a saint, and the prioress of Santa Catalina, Arequipa, in modern day PeruAnother way of looking at these five (and there are many other equally ebullient characters who might almost have strayed from Balzac or even Rabelais) might be in the tradition of some of Rossini's operas. And I'm sure this is deliberate, on Lovric's part, as another character, the current prioress of Santa Catalina, is devoted to Rossini's music (not all nuns are quite the dour characters which the outside world thinks they might be)In this, Marcella and Santo are of course the young lovers (Rosina, Almaviva/Lindoro) (Santo, like Almaviva in The Barber of Seville is expert in disguise in order to gain the enemy stronghold to meet his truly beloved) Gianni, valet, is Figaro, and Minguello the much more wicked version of the merely buffoonish Doctor Bartolo, and the equally sadistic Sor Loreta a notched up version of the prim Berta,This is a glorious, twisty, turny (utterly credible within its own reality) plot. Characters that make sense in place and time. Humour which is as dark as you like, but, overall, an explosion of intelligence, vivacity, inventiveness and originality.As you can tell, I like Lovric rather a lot, following my earlier read of her later novel, involving the wonderfully tressed Irish sisters The True and Splendid History of The Harristown Sisters: A NovelThe 466 page novel is followed by a much soberer and more explanatory 30 page afterword by Lovric, where she lays out the factual aspects of her book, and where she departed from the facts. In essence, all the historical information IS there, but may have been woven in a unique way by Lovric. The dots are in place, she does the joining.I think I've gone off reading 'wood books' and will stick to the less potentially dangerous Kindled editions. Readers of this will understand my new sensitivities..........","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJN4X4ZNEPYLS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1408809648#wasThisHelpful","RJN4X4ZNEPYLS","A3MTULATO06OS5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3MTULATO06OS5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Ossian Ward's sumptuously illustrated book is definitely not one to squander on an eReading experience - go wood book, you will not regret itWard, who was Time Out London's Art Critic is absolutely passionate about Contemporary Art, and is keen, clear and generous in sharing his passion and knowledge in ways that help the interested but possibly intimidated and don't know where to start layperson.Starting with the idea of approaching each artwork as a tabula rasa, from the viewer's perspective, he suggest 6 ways of coming into relationship with a piece - taking Time; staying with the Associations which arise (which of course can only happen if you give a piece time); looking at the Background the artist comes from - country, culture, influences;coming to Understand the message, intention of the piece; Look again; and finally, at this point, Assess.I really like the way Ward's writing helps the viewer into a kind of relationship with a piece of art,  and into self-as-well-as-artwork reflection.Having set out his suggested protocols, he then breaks down Contemporary Art into seven majors categories, and walks the reader through several examples of each type, and often includes a couple of pieces of work by each artist, in order to underscore a back-story and background for that artist. He finishes each chapter by taking a couple of works within the category as an example under the spotlight of close scrutiny.The chapters/categories are, Art as : Entertainment; Confrontation; Event (Performance Art); Message; Joke ; Spectacle; MeditationSomething `clicked' for me in the description of one particular work in the Event section, and the photograph illustrating it.Marina Abramovich is a Serbian performance artist, many of whose works have involved her publicly harming and mutilating herself in some way, or allowing and also offering the audience the choice to approach her in whatever way they wanted to relate to her. Yes, her Background, and her country's history of course gives a certain context - are we shocked, yes, did we become immured and deadened to the complex violence showing on our TV screens from that region, yes.In a retrospective of her 40 year career at New York's MOMA, she staged a piece which ran for 3 months, where daily, for 7 hours, she sat, without moving, in a chair facing a table, with an empty chair the other side of her. Event visitors were free/invited to take the chair opposite her. Other observers watched the two watching each other. The photo shows Abramovich in a long red robe, like some high priestess. She sits erect, as though hewn from stone. The deep flowing red gown - red for passion, blood, potency - but whose blood - is Abramovich the one who sheds the blood, or is she the one who is wounded. Inevitably the table and the chairs' positioning, and the seated pair (an audience member has taken the chair) this looks like some sort of confessional - but, again, who is (silently) confessing, who is hearing, what is being heard. The intense, neutral presence of Abramovich becomes like a therapist holding a space which allows the other to bring themselves into presence - and, by all accounts there have been some extreme reactions from those who `took the other chair'.That particular image has had powerful resonances for me, and it feels as if working slowly through Ward's lavishly illustrated text is making me see, look, in a changed way. Which after all is what art, ancient and modern, seeks to doI recommend this most strongly. Particularly considering the price of this wonderful book - Ward is practically giving it away, crammed as it is with such a visual feastI was lucky enough to receive this from Amazon Vine UK as a copy for review","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R23CUUZ0T89ZBA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1780671938#wasThisHelpful","R23CUUZ0T89ZBA","A3MTULATO06OS5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3MTULATO06OS5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Although I still feel Sarah Waters never equalled two of her Victorian set novels, Fingersmith and Affinity, this may be partly because most authors have a certain pattern to their work, and if a reader has a familiarity with that author, sooner or later they will be aware of their particular tricks and habits. By the time I read her first novel, Tipping the Velvet, which I found disappointing, and her second world war novel, The Night Watch, she had become predictable, even a little tired, to me, and the rich, complex, exuberance of the first two I read, and their cast of unique, properly quirky and layered characters, so typical of Dickens, Thackeray and Collins, had fallen away into something more run of the millI hesitated whether to read The Paying Guests, due to mixed reviews. In the end, I was glad I made the journey, even if this did not properly fascinate until the Second Section.Set in London just after the First War, Frances Wray and her mother are sliding into genteel poverty. Frances' brothers were killed in the trenches; her father had made bad investments, and his death leaves the two women nearly penniless. They have a large house, and decide to let out the top floor. Leonard and Lilian Barber, a lower middle class couple move in.The slow first part of the book, where I felt most predictability was happening, was the inevitable move towards the major relationship. Complete with a several sessions involving a lot of heavy breathing and sex which has to be extremely furtive, because deeply shocking and forbidden. Etc.I did find myself also having to fight off a constant voice which was saying `this is post First World War - why didn't Frances get a job? The First War certainly saw the start of women really coming forward in the workplace, so it felt strange that this was not something which seemed to be in anyone's mind, even more so when a couple of Frances's friends, from the same class, are in the workplace.Eventually, there are a couple of quite horrific and cataclysmic events which then take the novel into much darker territory, and that is when I began to find my interest was really engaged, and the book moved away from being a bit Mills and Boon/Black Swan formulaic, and became something much more psychologically intricate - the effects of guilt, shame, terror of discovery, the agonies of conscience, the conflicts between courage and fear, and how shared guilt can destroy relationships.Although this was all terrific stuff, I was not sufficiently swept up by the novel to stop myself having some questions about realism. Some of which can't really be explained, due to spoilers. However, there is a section which does demand huge physical strength and fitness, and one of the people who needs this has come quite close to shuffling off this mortal, and it seemed pretty impossible that they would have been able to carry out the task.  The `wrap' of the book also seemed a little contrived, after the tremendous build-up of the psychological journey the central characters were making, it almost felt as if Waters had run out of steam. There is a long courthouse sequence, and how that resolves, did not feel quite as expected. It felt like an ending Waters wanted for the characters, rather than an ending true to reality3  rounded up to 4 stars","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R33V7G5OUJIWWM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1594633118#wasThisHelpful","R33V7G5OUJIWWM","A3MTULATO06OS5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3MTULATO06OS5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"David Nicholls crafts a fine story here, a tale of 25 years of a marriage.Connie is a wonderfully attractive, vivacious artist, with a disastrous history of relationships with egomaniac, `bad-boys', all artists or would-bes.Douglas is a scientist, involved in genetic research, stolid, solid, repressed, steady, anal-retentive. He is passionate about his work, centred around the humble fruit-flyConnie and Douglas meet, and she embarks on a rebound relationship with him. Jump forward over quarter of a century. Connie and Douglas are at a crucial point in their relationship. And they have an 18 year old son, Albie, very much a chip off his mother's block, about to leave the nest for University.And the family are about to embark on `the grand tour' which was fashionable in the nineteenth century - in this case, all based round a whistle stop tour of major European galleries - Albie has followed the arts, like mum, and is possibly going to be a photographer of genius. Or not, hard to tell whilst he is absolutely inhabiting the stage of rebellion and identity searching. Albie and Douglas do not get on. At all.Whilst Nicholls brilliantly charts, forward and backwards in short, interlocking chapters, the current and past trajectory of this family's dynamics, with a deal of warmth, humour and light touch, what for me is missing is a certain depth. Pain there undoubtedly is, but Nicholls, and his central character don't take the reader there and really engage them with it. It is a very balanced, thought through book - a kind of Richard Curtis romance. And very well done, there is a kind of harmonious predictability about the plot, a tying up of loose ends, satisfying but not ever edge of the seat. The inability to really engage with emotion meant this was a pleasant journey, whimsical, but a bit too lacking in grit to really grab the heart and guts of this readerThere is one other major flaw - it's absolutely easy to see why Douglas falls for captivating Connie, and remains captivated. I could not, however, other than cerebrally, see what was in it for Connie. Sure, the rebound from the dangerously attractive, unreliable one to safe Douglas, but Douglas is never shown as particularly attractive, even though he is clearly a good man. It seems all to come down to `he makes me laugh' which we are repeatedly told, Connie tells Douglas how much he makes her laugh, Douglas tells us that Connie says he makes her laugh - but there isn't much obvious humour, or wit or funny in Douglas himself.

"The subject matter of Richard Powers tellingly titled `Orfeo' is immense - immortality and transcendence, the desire to make sense and purpose of it all, and what remains always outside our ability to grasp its intangibility, but is always on the edge of our yearning reach.Orpheus in classical mythology is a poet and musician of such power that all of the natural world is charmed by his music. In one version, he is the son of Apollo. He descends to the world of the dead to bring back his wife Eurydice, a task which ultimately fails as he disobeys the instruction to not look back.The central character of Powers' book, Peter Els, though initially trained as a chemist, with a particular interest in its metaphysics, the secret at the heart of matter, falls as passionately for the metaphysics of music, becoming a composer. The book charts not only the history of music, the intense experience, the yearning, the transcendence, the way, which, if we pay attention to it, it can be felt almost at a cellular level, but also, through the central character in space and time (America, 1960's onwards) the life of that country.And there is more. At the start of the book, Els is 70. He has begun, in his search for a music which is present and meaningful, to return to his earlier training, and look at the building blocks of living matter, the alphabet of DNA, and how parallels can be found with the alphabet of music. He is exploring the music of biology, at cellular levelUnfortunately, in a world fearing chemical and biological terrorism, the discovery of a home lab where genetic engineering is taking place, makes Els a fugitive, on the run from the security forces.Els's `run' also takes him into a spiralling run backwards and forwards into his own personal history, through first and last loves, the start and ending of relationships, with women, with his closest friend, with his child, and most profoundly, with the Western classical tradition, into Minimalism and beyond.This is a weighty, difficult, challenging read in many ways, exploring music and specific pieces in immediate depth, diving into the heart of them, and Powers uses language most potently, but demands work from the reader. His clear craft of language, the sense that every sentence is constructed with care, like notes perfectly placed, holding their hidden harmonics, meant it was important to understand precisely the meaning of often complex words. I was using the dictionary frequently. I was also highlighting, almost on every page, observations about art, about music, about biology, chemistry, philosophy, metaphysics, which were telling, weighted and beautifulAnd most of all, the wonderful, illuminating journeys through musical works, both real, and imagined (some of Els' compositions) sent me back to listen, or to listen for the first time.In this, Powers' reminds me a little of another American author, Siri Hustvedt, another fierce intellect, who in `What I Loved' with a central character who is a visual artist, creates invented pieces of art through words so real that I could see them, and went vainly searching for them via Google, convinced that Hustvedt must have seen or made them. I had exactly the same response to Els's compositions. Powers writes so impeccably and presently within the heart of specific `real' pieces, that, surely he must have heard the pieces his central character composes.This will no doubt be a particularly potent novel for those steeped in the Western classical music tradition, as practising musicians, and probably even more so for composers.""The point of music is to wake listeners up. To break all our ready-made habits""It may not be the book if music holds the space of background:""Half the clientele have their own earbuds, the other half use this music, if at all, only as protection from the terrors of silence""""Music..............doesn't mean things. It is things""","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3VT89R4DT4PV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0393240827#wasThisHelpful","R3VT89R4DT4PV","A3MTULATO06OS5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3MTULATO06OS5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Finnish author Emmi Itranta astonishingly wrote her first novel, a delicate, dystopian Sci-Fi outing, simultaneously in Finnish and English. Born in Finland the author is resident in the UK. Memory of Water won one Finnish literary prize and was nominated for another.We are beyond `The Twilight century' (our own) Mankind's wasteful, indifferent attitudes to its own species and to the planet we share with other species, has resulted in the climate changes from which there is no real return. There has been the melting of the icecaps, the warming of the planet, and most of the landlocked freshwater has gone. Much of the land is given over to huge landfill containing the unrecycleable wastes of this century and the one before - plastics, electronics, consumer junk, which there is no longer the power to use.Potable water comes, strictly quota controlled, from desalination plants. Hoarding, iillegally tapping into this water supply, and possessing more water than the agreed quota is a capital offence.China has become the dominant world power, `New Qian'. World culture is now Chinese culture, and the world is a Chinese empireSet in `the Scandinavian Union', Memory of Water's narrator and protagonist is 17 year old Noria. She is the daughter of a tea master, himself part of a long lineage of tea-masters (i`Tea-masters are 'the watchers of water, but first and foremost we are its servants'I received this as a review copy from Amazon Vine UKIn some sense, Noria's lineage makes her a traditionalist, and an observer and adherent to older duties and customs than those imposed by political decree. The tradition is one of interior discipline and reflectionNoria and her childhood friend Sanja, a skilful inventor and repairer of those long ago obsolete pieces of junk found in landfill from `The Twilight Century' become in some sense, unwittingly, unwillingly, the guardians of human, peer, connection, set against the hierarchical connections of dictatorship and its apparatchiks.I was fascinated by way this story was told, the creation of the world, and the often quiet, lyrical language. Characterisation was excellent, and Noria and Sanja, their friendship and its challenges, beautifully handledItranta's interest in sci-fi and dystopian literature is impeccably on the side of reflective, imaginative thinking, and geopolitical awareness, rather than blazing light-sabres and intergalactic derring-do. Writers and books she recommends as her inspirers or books to inspire others include Ursula K Le Guin, Margaret Attwood's The Handmaid's Tale, Ray Bradbury's Fahrenheit 451 and George Orwell's 1984.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R54W0LDSNOY76/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062326155#wasThisHelpful","R54W0LDSNOY76","A3MTULATO06OS5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3MTULATO06OS5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Ransom Riggs quirky, spooky, YA lit-fic horror crossover, set in Wales, is a sure-fire delight - with this adult, never mind the YAYAs!Riggs is/was an avid collector of strange photos from long gone times, and began, particularly to be fascinated by faded, peculiar photos of children. Probably they were attempts at trick photography techniques, with the photographer playing around with exposure, framing, shutter time and the like, but he had amassed a steady collection of these from various flea markets and vintage sales, as the afterword to my copy, where an interview with Riggs is include, explains.So, the photographs and the development of a fabulous story to link them, developed. The central character in this book, 16 year old Jacob, is shown some of these photos by his Polish Jewish grandfather, and then discovers more, and the people and meaning behind them.Jacob is in many ways a typical adolescent of his kind. Gifted, (though not really initially understanding in what way) intelligent, introspective, a loner, not quite the son his controlling parents might wish for, he is nevertheless extremely close to his grandfather, Abraham, who appears to be retreating into senility, with paranoid stories of monsters. Following his grandfather's death, which damages and fractures Jacob, he becomes determined to try and track down and discover more of Abraham's past as a young boy, leaving his native Poland as the Nazis moved in, and arriving as part of a kindertransport at a school on a remote island off the coast of Wales; that is Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar ChildrenHow Peculiar those children were, not to mention the Peculiarities of Miss Peregrine herself, and how Jacob (first person narrative) discovers his own connection to all this is a wonderful journey. It is extremely well-written, twisty, turny, mind-mangling and with some genuine shocks which do not feel gratuitous. And it has also a lightness of touch, Jacob has a self-deprecating, self-mocking sense of humour and is a fine companion for the reader.And those photos (which made me choose to get the real, rather than eread, version) are most weird and wonderfulAlthough personally I felt that the inevitable fight between the goodies and the baddies at the end was a bit clichd, I am aware that such battles are needed, but this was the one section of the book where Riggs did not quite sustain his absolute originality for me, and also, the one area of the book where I realised I was not the intended audience.Terrific page-turner.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3IBD2445ZW19E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1594746036#wasThisHelpful","R3IBD2445ZW19E","A3MTULATO06OS5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3MTULATO06OS5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Patrick Hamilton is a not-quite-forgotten, admired author, who specialised in getting inside the heads of those who were disaffected, on-the-margins, or even, dangerously psychopathic - he was a stage and film writer, as well as author, and responsible for the highly charged, tightly wound, thrillers of sinister psychopathology, Gaslight, and RopeHangover Square was one of his most iconic novels. Set primarily in London on the very edge of, and then just at the start of, the Second World War, this follows the fortunes (pretty well unstoppably downwards) of George Harvey Bone, a not quite impoverished, weak willed man with a severe drinking problem, some undiagnosed dissociative mental health problems, and a dangerous 2 year infatuation with a hard, vicious untalented actress.Bone is an unlikely subject to capture a reader's compassionate interest, yet he does, because despite the fact that he is someone of a definite wasted life, a bit of a bumbling, nave and pathetic character, he is nevertheless like a lost and vulnerable puppy, possessed of great sweetness of temperament, despite his irritating flaccidity of purposeNetta, the object of his adoration, is a beautiful and completely amoral, woman, without any charm, wit, intelligence, talent or likeability. Her one asset is her extraordinary beauty, which is clearly barely even skin-deep. Whereas Bone is a marshmallow, ineffectual, likeable drunk, Netta, and her closest crony, louche, spiteful Peter, are hard, aggressive, deeply unpleasant drunks.The trajectory of the story is George Bone's worsening mental health problems, and the hopeless infatuation with Netta, who is completely uninterested in George, in any way, except as someone to sponge money from, and exploit.This should be an unbearably depressing book, but instead, there is a kind of gentle humour in George, a puppyish enthusiasm and a potential for excitement and joy which carries the reader along, despite the awareness of the grim background of war on the horizon, the predictable and nasty leanings towards Fascist sympathies espoused by Netta and Peter, and George's inability to free himself from the nest of vipers he can, in some ways, clearly see.Perhaps Hamilton's ability to make us feel George from the inside, and care about him, too, comes in part from what must have been a certain self-identification in the writer, as Hamilton himself had a disastrous relationship with alcohol, child of an alcoholic father, he died in 1962 of liver cirrhosis. He was a writer who definitely identified with the underdog, the marginalised, and the powerless in society.J.B. Priestley in his introduction to the the Penguin Classics edition of Hangover Square, describes Hamilton as one of the best `minor novelists' writing in the interwar and beyond years. And lest that seems like damning with faint praise, it is I think fair, admiring praise.However.........I should caution anyone who gets the edition, with the Priestley introduction to AVOID reading that introduction if you have never read Hangover Square, as foolishly, in the closing paragraph of his otherwise pertinent and interesting introduction, he reveals one of the major spoilers.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2U5W80IMHV5DM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1933372060#wasThisHelpful","R2U5W80IMHV5DM","A3MTULATO06OS5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3MTULATO06OS5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Finnish writer Pasi Ilmari Jaaskelainen has written a creepily seductive, thought provoking, alluring and wickedly mischievous book, which might have special appeal for writers, since writers, aspiring and world famous, and the nature of fiction itself, is the subject matter.Books have started to mysteriously change in Rabbit Back, a small town in Finland. Rabbit Back is also home to a world famous children's writer, Laura White, who writes children's' books about a dark and mysteriously peopled world. Inevitably, being a world famous Finnish children's' author writing about invented, strange creatures which have a fascination for adults as well as children, there are obvious possible parallels that Tove Jansson may have been the initial inspiration for Jaaskelainen.Laura White, it transpires, gathered around her a group of children, with the aim of grooming them into becoming writers. All are now grown, and famous authors in their own right.However...there was a dark mystery behind Laura White's creation of the Rabbit Back Literary Society, and its small, select recruited members. And the group also have an arcane, and somewhat deadly practice - The Game, which has evolved over the years, and exists for a set purpose of furthering the craft, practice and ritual of writing itself.The membership of the society has been restricted to 9, for many decades. Until a young teacher, with a recently published story, is invited by White to become the tenth member. Ella Milana, as well as becoming the newest member of the Society, is a keen literary researcher, and has discovered the strange changes appearing in classic texts.Milana has agendas of her own to pursue when something cataclysmic happens at the party which secretive, revered, Laura White gives, to introduce Milana as the tenth member, to the other nine, and to the wider, glittering celebrity world who accord White some kind of literary goddess status.And this is Finland, where a belief in dark elementals may be more widespread. Snow, and the Far North, do weird and wonderful things to imaginationSo, we have some strange conglomerate of a David Lynch Twin Peaks type clever weirdness, a crime investigation, an arcane, cultish group of highly intelligent, ruthlessly ambitious-in-the-pursuit-of-their-craft writers, Folkloric background, and a wonderful, wickedly dark and playful imagination. Not to mention a clear love of literature, and its power, and many reflections on just why writers write, who they are, how they do it, and how and why we read.""Everybody comes to the library naked. That's why they come here-to dress themselves in books""It's a joy. It's a gem. It's dark, spooky, not completely explained by reason. And I want more from Pasi Ilmari Jaaskelainen. There seem to be a couple of short stories translated into English, but not, at the moment, any second novel. Keep writing Pasi Ilmari, keep writing.The translation must also be commended (I assume, not knowing Finnish!) because I had no sense of the clunky, as happens when translation is done by those who are too literal, and miss some kind of `writerly sensibilities. So I hope Lola M. Rogers is also making sure that Pasi Ilmari is steadily working on another book, which she will translate""Reality was a game board for all of humanity to play on, formed from all human interaction.

"I am not, by any means, a fan of the vampire genre, which seems to have drowned in a sea of its own overdone gore.However.............when a writer whose work I admire happens to write a book which features the pointy teethed, sanguinary creatures, that might well draw me in. The writer, not the genre.Lynn Shepherd is a writer with a wonderful feel for nineteenth century literary fiction, primarily using classics of that period, as springboards to twist and skew and refocus, into detective novels, with her running detective, Charles Maddox (actually, there are two of them, a great-uncle, and his great-nephew)Having already stated I do not find the vampire genre appealing, I must also say I avoid `pastiches' like the plague, because generally the original does the whatever so much better. The exception, is where something is written which is substantially different, substantially true to itself, and where acquaintance with the original can only delight and enhance reading of the new work - which, however, could PROPERLY be enjoyed on his own substantial merits, without any prior knowledge of `the original.And, I must say, that knowing Shepherd had used the Bram Stoker novel, and her love of nineteenth century literature, and her understanding of place, time, culture and language of the period, and a kind of ability to inhabit the world of the original, I bought this book eagerly, knowing I would not be disappointed.And I wasn't, I absolutely wasn't. It becomes the fourth `vampire' book I can read - and re-read - Stoker himself, Elizabeth Kostova's The Historian, Marcus Sedgewick's rather more scientific imagining A Love Like Blood and, now what Shepherd has done.Her research into historical events (The Great Exhibition, scientific investigations, thinking, and inventions) not to mention her inhabitation of Stoker's text, is prodigious - but lightly handled. I was swept up feverishly turning pages, and it was only in the pauses between reading that I thought about that research, that plotting, that characterisation, those little embroiders of the text that are sly nods to the original.Inevitably, there IS gore (well, it is within the subject matter) and, yes, it is rather shocking and horrid, but, she really doesn't luridly indulge the X-rated aspects. And the violence is also plausible, (sadly) in its mannerIt's quite a short book - 233 pages, and is - magnificent.What I particularly love, love with Shepherd, is her delectable, precise use of language, her structure is beautifully measured, there is a real craft here, which does remind me so much of the more formal language of nineteenth century literature""I found it hard to believe so great a tempest could be coming, seeing the white mares'tails high in the pearly blue sky and the wide sweep of sea barely rippling in the breeze, but the man had some knowledge that I did not possess, for by sunset the clouds had amassed into great heaving battlements of every colour -red, violet, orange, and green, flaming at the west in the dying sun, and darkening behind us as the storm gathered pace. We could seem far ahead in the distance, the lights of the little town my father told me was our destination, and as the wind began to rise the captain rigged the ship as high as he dared, desperate to outrun the storm and make port before nightfall. But there was no time. There was a moment of deathly stillness, when the wind seemed to die in the sails.........I could hear sea-birds wailing like lost spirits above our heads""Yes, that is right, it's the arrival, in an unholy storm, by sea, to WhitbyThere are several stories going on here. Charles Maddox, like Jonathan Harker, visits the `Dracula character' in his castle home in the Austro-Hungarian empire. And the bulk of the novel is written through the voice of the omnipotent author, describing Maddox's thoughts and actions.There is also a parallel story involving `Lucy' the daughter of a kind of stage magician, performing magical acts, and capitalising on the growing success and fashion for spiritualism, in the wake of the American Fox Sisters. Lucy's story is told in her journal, and is in the first person (from which you can deduce, Lucy's is the arrival in the storm)There is also the omnipotent authorial voice revealing herself to be the self-conscious writer of this book, occasionally making mentions of scientific and social advances which will come in time. This is not in any way intrusive (well, not to me, anyway) and adds another layer, reminding us that this is a referential piece, springing from an established literary heritage, and that writing itself has a history, and that there are cultural fashions in writing.Shepherd is playful, and she plays well; I like the way she teased me into actively thinking about what I was reading, even whilst my heart was in my mouth and I was being swept along by the `what-next, what-next' of narrative. I needed to be slowed down, to appreciate the detailThere is an afterword, which also explains how her springboard for this book was not only Bram Stoker's text, but some real history.There is, also a genuine shocker of a climax. One which is ultimately most satisfying","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/ROC6FBYAS0P9P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0345545435#wasThisHelpful","ROC6FBYAS0P9P","A3MTULATO06OS5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3MTULATO06OS5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Major deals are also being made by the Chairman of the Board of Trustees, a Property Magnate desperate for a peerage.The star piece of the exhibition is a little known work by Gainsborough, which comes with a mysterious curse, and an equally mysterious historyBattle lines are set out between high art and high finance, high art and populism, academia and stylistic soundbites.""He worries about the Nowness of Now. Such a depressing concept, he reflects, his lip rising with an academic's disdain. Absurd name, too. Nowness will be a celebration of Britain today `reflecting the volcanic dynamism inherent in the twenty-first century2 This breathy tag sometimes runs through his head as he struggles with leaden directives from his paymasters in government.""Think a combination of the slap-stick, magical, sexually confusing world of Midsummer Night's Dream, combined with the wit and social setting of a P.G.

Not to mention the possibility of near death by drowning in raspberry coulis.And a dog whose tail just can't make up its mind which way to pointThis is a delightful piece of puffery, which nonetheless says some very pertinent things about a society structured on spin, where neither the bread nor the circuses are that much to be celebrated. And where the course of true love never runs smooth......except, sometimes.The novel fairly zips along, taking place on Midsummer's day 2001, and lasting for 288 pages, with short, fairly bite sized chapters.

Nothing is going the way she thought it would. Shes having trouble with her manager boyfriend, her music and her confidence. After renting Kyles house they end up being force together and find they get along and have a lot more in common than the surface would suggest.I liked Lourdes and I liked Kyle  I liked them both together. But man oh man, Ms. Novak  I could have totally done without anymore Noelle! Her and her dumb parents are like nails on the chalkboard to me. Kudos on writing characters that make me want to smack the crap out of them!! Noelle pops up enough in this book to make you crazy and to wonder if Kyle should be sainted.The cover of the book is a little misleading - But the feel good Christmassy romance is alive in well in this book. This series continues to be excellent.Cherise Everhard, October 2015Book provided by the author in exchange for an honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1NPV6YOYUJRGG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0778318443#wasThisHelpful","R1NPV6YOYUJRGG","A37E6RW5BUX4U0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A37E6RW5BUX4U0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have super long and super straight hair.  I am almost 40 and have a TON of grey hair that I get rid of with regular dye jobs.  That can make my hair very dry. I normally buy packets of Ion deep conditioner at the beauty supply place where I pick up my dye.  It is a dollar a packet and does a very good job.This product, however, not only covers better, it conditions better.  I keep it in my shower now and try to condition once a week.  I can really feel the difference, and I can see that my hair looks shinier.  The smell is light and floral  it smells very good.I thought Id be out of the jar in no time, considering the amount I use with the Ion product I am used to  - but I find that even though this product is thicker, it spreads nicer and because of that I am not using as much.I really saturate my hair from the top of the neck to the ends and then lightly apply to the hair that covers my scalp.  Because my hair is so straight it can get greasy and looked weighed down.  I dont get that with this.This is an excellent product and I am glad I got the chance to try it.Cherise Everhard, October 2015I received this product, free, in exchange for an honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3LPRUEFJGX6XW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0144S0J0O#wasThisHelpful","R3LPRUEFJGX6XW","A37E6RW5BUX4U0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A37E6RW5BUX4U0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The author gave this book to me in exchange for an honest review.Margery is a college student who stumbles upon an arrogant loner on campus who is so rude to her that naturally she starts stalking him and wanting him.  Im all for the bad boys but Valmont is such an arse in the beginning that I didnt like him and was so confused as to how the author could think anyone would.Margerys dialogue at first comes off juvenile and the interaction between her and Valmont is odd. While I found myself liking the idea of the story, the execution of the story I was lacking.  Besides some editing issues, I found myself thinking the author took for granted we knew what she was thinking or where she was going, so instead of stopping to show us the path  she just let us blindly follow.  I found myself reading and rereading paragraphs trying to piece together what I had missed, only finding I missed nothing  and was justifiably confused.While this book is a series of 5 short stories combined, the totality still feels small and short.  The 5 total read like a normal one story novella.  I didnt understand Valmonts relationship with the school and the teacher or why it was introduced.  I didnt understand his relationship with his family, his uncle or his cousin  or why that was introduced.The sex scenes are graphic, but lacked the detail and storytelling that make them real or hot.  I felt like the author was more interested in shocking the reader than titillating the reader.Im not a professional editor or reviewer, obviously, but I am a professional reader.  My advice to the author would be to use more detail in her writing, show us ALL of what you are thinking, not just bits and pieces and hope we can put them together.  Get more readers to edit your work, honestly, and let you know where the holes are.  Your ideas are good  you just need to develop them a whole lot more.Cherise Everhard, October 2015","2.0 out of 5 stars","October 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1KYSDTBMRAWPE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013PLG84M#wasThisHelpful","R1KYSDTBMRAWPE","A37E6RW5BUX4U0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A37E6RW5BUX4U0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I got this for my husband and son so they could see the critters that come poking around their bate pile.  I didnt expect to get so excited to see what pictures we capture, but I find myself looking forward to each viewing.This is our first trail camera, so we kind of stumbled through the set up process.  While the instructions seemed very straight forward there were one or two steps I would have wished for more detail.  Our first viewing of the pictures we were excited to see we captured 20 plus pictures overnight.  Unfortunately, they were all of my husbands face, my son walking around and one squirrel.After that we kind of narrowed down where we went wrong and how to adjust the settings a bit.  Now we have captured deer, a woodchuck, turkeys and a TON of squirrels!Like other reviewers have said the pictures at dawn and dusk, when it goes from light to dark or dark to light, arent as good quality as the others taken in dark or light.  The transition seems to confuse the camera so any pictures taken at that change tend to be poor.  Luckily, the transition doesnt seem to last long.Im really impressed with this camera and the pictures that it takes.  I look forward to each wildlife photo captured.  I would definitely recommend this camera to anyone who likes to get candid photos of wildlife.Cherise Everhard, October 2015","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R12N7BAAZ4NGOP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00T34P36A#wasThisHelpful","R12N7BAAZ4NGOP","A37E6RW5BUX4U0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A37E6RW5BUX4U0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My first thought when receiving this was Wow!  The packaging was extremely well done and elegant.  It is a presentation that would definitely befit a gift giving.  Its beautifully done and the watch was in the box securely, and protectively, but it still managed to be a beautiful package.My second thought was boy is this thing heavy!  Taking out of its protective box I was taken aback by how heavy it felt.  It definitely has some weight to it, more than what Id normally like on my wrist.  You definitely could feel its presence.My third thought was this thing is huge.  I didnt have to unclasp the watch to put it on, I slipped it over my hand easily where it hung off my wrist way too big.  I looked in the extensive instructions on how to remove a few clasp-thingies (No thats not a technical term) but was sad to see there werent any.  So I had to wait to go to a local jeweler and have them do it.  That was kind of a bummer, I was looking forward to wearing it instantly.My fourth thought was this watch is built to last.  It feels and looks incredibly sturdy and strong.  I dont think this is a watch that is going to break or scratch easy.  It just seems to have been made with a lot of care.  I dont know the Invicta name or their reputation, but I was impressed by the quality that seems to ooze from this watch.My fifth and final thought was, sadly, its kind of manly.  The head and the band (Again, Im sure these arent technical terms) are quite large and not at all feminine or delicate.  In fact when I opened it, my husband thought it was for him.  After I told him it was mine and put it on he declared thats a mans watch.  The face of the watch, to me, keeps it from being a mans watch, but the rest of it could totally be a mans watch.  Its just not as girly as Id expect with a name like Angel.Overall Id give this watch 5 stars, happily and easily, based on quality vs. price, had the watch been a little more feminine, lighter and not so huge.Cherise Everhard, September 2015","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RMD6CFK6GULU6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013VADVBU#wasThisHelpful","RMD6CFK6GULU6","A37E6RW5BUX4U0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A37E6RW5BUX4U0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Maya and Del were in love and once upon a time were to be married.  But Maya left Del heartbroken and they both went their separate ways.  Years later they are both in their hometown again for different reasons and forced to collaborate on a city project.  Theyve both changed, a lot, but as they work together they find that even though theyre different people now some things like their chemistry and attraction havent changed.This threesome in the long running and for me, much loved, Fools Gold series has not been my favorite.  When this one started I thought I was going to really love it.  I love old loves reunited and given the second chance.  Its one of my favorite story lines.  This book started out pretty strong, compared to the previous two, so I had high hopes that this book was going to make up for the mediocre previous two but for me that loving feeling soon fizzled out and while I found myself liking the story I wasnt wowed and I didnt love it.Part of the problem was the conflict in the story was strange to me.  I didnt get why Dels mom was doing what she was doing and it seemed odd and selfish and screamed Im a martyr!  Then when the conflict comes to light Dels reaction was over the top and mean.  I didnt get that, either.  I didnt like that part of the story and it was unnecessary filler.While I like Del and Maya I never fell for them like I have for previous characters in the story.  They were OK  nothing special.  The story wasnt bad but it wasnt great either.  Im glad I read it as I still havent lost my love for Fools Gold or this series, I have high hopes that the next threesome will bring back the greatness I expect from this author and series.Cherise Everhard, September 2015","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3AP8WYHGFLME4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0373788983#wasThisHelpful","R3AP8WYHGFLME4","A37E6RW5BUX4U0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A37E6RW5BUX4U0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Over a t-shirt with it left unbuttoned, or buttoned up, he really likes it.With the weather changing and getting a little cooler, it's been put on at night when the temperature drops and we are still out and about.I have washed it several times and so far it has maintained it's color and the fabric looks and feels great.  It didn't shrink at all from washing it and it fits and looks like it did the first time he put it on.I like the way the shirt looks on him, it's casual but not as casual as a flannel that he would normally reach for.I definitely will be buying more shirts like this one for him.Cherise Everhard, September 2015","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2Z86QI8FQ3MAL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XH7I3IE#wasThisHelpful","R2Z86QI8FQ3MAL","A37E6RW5BUX4U0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A37E6RW5BUX4U0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"With everyone wearing the fitbits  I was a little jealous of the gadget, but it was an expense I couldn't justify.  So with the offer of this item, I jumped on it.It was really easy to set up.  I downloaded the free app from the app store and followed the booklet instructions.  Then I synced my phone and the watch together.  I think it took all of 5 minutes from start to finish.  At first I tested it walking and counting my steps and then checking to see what it clocked.  It was pretty accurate, give or take a few steps here and there.The feature of monitoring your sleep was a trip.  I was really amazed at how accurate that was.  It was interesting to see how much or  how little restful sleep I actually got.I don't have the NUYU scale so I had to enter my weight in manually on my phone, no big deal.The calorie counter was also a nice feature and worked well.My little complaints with the device are it's looks  it's kind of ugly to me and the the synchronization.  A lot of times I had to to try two to three times before it would take.  I also forgot to sync it one night and so all the extra walking and calories I had burned the day before were lost.  That was a bummer.I didn't use it in the water or shower, when I see water resistant I am not to confident with it's capabilities.  I prefer the water proof title.All in all I can't complain about it, it's worked great for me.Cherise Everhard, September 2015","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3H4NNWHFXRQ76/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XRPT6Z0#wasThisHelpful","R3H4NNWHFXRQ76","A37E6RW5BUX4U0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A37E6RW5BUX4U0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Lucy and Ian come head to head over the fate of a childrens camp.  Lucy wants to save her beloved camp and Ian is purchasing it to develop the land.  As they fight for what they want chemistry enters the picture and they find themselves attracted and at odds.I liked Lucys character and I enjoyed Ians as well.  I liked their story and the story of the camp, and their back stories.  What kept me from loving this book were all the side characters and stories.  I believe side characters add to a story, but in this case they added too much.  This isnt a lengthy novel and so much of the focus was on Lucys sister, Ians sister and all the drama that came from both, that I felt like Ian and Lucy didnt get their full story.  There characters and relationship didnt develop as much as they could have if the focus would have been more fully on them.Its an easy book to get lost in, and I would like to see what happens to all the characters in the book, side and main.  I just hope in future books we get a promise of a future story from the side characters instead of them sharing the main characters spotlight.

"I received this product, free, in exchange for an honest review.I am new to the oils world  so I havent quite learned all the uses for the products yet.  So far though, I am enjoying the journey and the oils!OK, first I received the pump  although it didnt work.  Disappointing?  Sure.  Was it a deal breaker?  Did it ruin my day?  No, I simply work around it.  The pump would definitely simplify things but I just muddled through until I could transfer the oil to an old and empty soap container that I cleaned out.As I am new to oils, I am really new to carrier oils.  I was a little concerned as to how this would absorb into my skin.  I pictured myself slicked up like I was covered in baby oil.  Luckily, that wasnt the case.  My first application was to my knees with some oils to help with joint swelling and arthritis.  The oil absorbed into my skin without leaving any greasy look.  I was able to apply it at work without anyone noticing anything but my herby scent.I will definitely purchase this carrier oil, again.  It has been very helpful.

"My Sister and my Grandmother introduced to me to Diane Mott Davidsons writing years and years ago  and half the fun of reading them was seeing what yummy stuff was going to be cooking.  Getting this cookbook was a fun trip down culinary lane!Ive only cooked two recipes so far  The Anniversary Burgers (a fancied up grilled burger) and Big Bucks Bread Pudding with Hard Sauce.  The burgers were delicious  a great way, and easy way, to elevate your burgers.  They were juicy and flavorful.  The Bread Pudding was also very yummy; however, I did not care for the hard sauce.  It contained rum extract and that is not a flavor I care for.  The pudding itself was cooked individually in a muffin tin  making the serving size perfect.  We ended up eating the puddings minus the sauce, no one in my house cared for the sauce.The next two recipes on my to-cook list are Blondes Blondies and Stir Fry Chicken with Asparagus.  The variety in this cookbook is nice.  The recipes are simple and the ingredients seem to be easy to find, nothing too exotic.

"I had reservations about reading this book.  It sounded heavier than what I am used to with Kristan Higgins writing.  The subject matter of both Jenny and Rachels storyline is disturbing to me, Rachels especially, and I wasnt sure I wanted to read her heartache.  I read Kristan Higginss books for their humor and happily ever afters.  So I really hesitated to read something I was sure was going to make me feel miserable for the players within.That being said I ended up loving this book.  Yes there are some emotionally draining moments  but thankfully Kristans humor is present enough to balance the scales.  The book isnt an easy mindless read; in fact its the opposite.  I found myself questioning decisions made within and learning that maybe I am not so black and white on certain matters as I thought I was.The hero of this story, to me, is Leo.  I adored him.  I loved his snark and his contradictions.  I loved his rough exterior and tender heart.  I loved the way he and Jenny were just themselves together, imperfections and all.These characters grew throughout the story, adapted with their circumstances and learned to be a different kind of them.  Their personas didnt change  just evolved.  It was a reminder to me how much things can affect you.  How we continue to everyday to become more of ourselves.I cried through the better part of the end of this book.  I was so invested in these characters, their lives, I felt like I was a part of their world.  This isnt a book that will leave you feeling miserable; there is plenty of happy on the horizon  just different versions and chapters of happy.It was an excellent read and I am glad that I talked myself into it  I wouldnt have wanted to miss this.Cherise Everhard, August 2015","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1E37AORP2EI9G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=037378497X#wasThisHelpful","R1E37AORP2EI9G","A37E6RW5BUX4U0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A37E6RW5BUX4U0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Im one of a rare breed that LOVES going to the dentist.  I love it because I love how clean my teeth feel when I leave.  This toothbrush gives me that same feeling.There are three different speeds for the cleaning and whitening settings.  I have not made it past the first speed.  The other two speeds rattle my brain too much and arent comfortable at all for me.  I do not feel like I am being short changed in the cleaning department because the brush isnt at full speed.  I think it does a fine job  I love it.I like how easy the head comes off the handle  my medicine cabinet shelves are too short for it to be all put together and be able to stand up.

"This book was given to me by the author/publisher in exchange for an honest review.This is a series of werewolf serials put into one book.  There is a different werewolf pack starring in each book  though you will hear all the pack names woven in and out of the stories, since each pack is aware of the others.I really liked this series and I think this set is the way to read it.  Once I figured out that each story was actually a set of super short series combined to make it one read, I decided that I had lucked out discovering them this way.  I think having to read one separately, or while waiting for others to be published would have driven me nuts.  I am glad I got to read them in their entirety all at once!I really enjoyed this take on the werewolf world and the little things that made it unique for me.  I liked how each pack was very different in their culture.  The only thing they have in common is there werewolf/shape-shifting abilities.My one problem with this story was the editing.  There are some very easy to spot and fix mistakes.  One of the bigger ones is that in two separate stories the author calls a main character the wrong name, several times.  This confused the heck out of me.  I was like Who is Rhiannon?  Who is this Nic?  And it caused me to go back and reread  thinking I missed something crucial.Other than that I was totally immersed in this world and I am going to start her dragon series, next.Cherise Everhard, May 2015","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R21LIT2DNL4N36/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00US7I8SQ#wasThisHelpful","R21LIT2DNL4N36","A37E6RW5BUX4U0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A37E6RW5BUX4U0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love everything tree, Irish, Celtic, Pagan, etc so this necklace spoke to me on many levels.  When I was offered it, I jumped at the chance.I have been wearing it since it was delivered and have received many compliments.  I love the way it looks and feels.  It looks like it would be heavy but its amazingly light.  It looks gorgeous.The chain is thin and the clasp small  I thought it would be a necklace Id have trouble putting on by myself, but so far Ive had no problems.When I began this review I went to the product page to see what the price was and I was surprised by how little it is selling for!  Its really a fantastic deal; I really thought it was going to be much more than that.This would be a terrific gift for any tree and/or Celtic lover!Cherise Everhard, May 2015","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1QE85UE9HGY7Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TEZ87JI#wasThisHelpful","R1QE85UE9HGY7Q","A37E6RW5BUX4U0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A37E6RW5BUX4U0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It looks like I am the only one who isnt thrilled with this pizza oven.  Some of the problems that occurred were complete user error  others were design flaws, to me.Day 1: we get ready to have pizzas for dinner.  Its assembled and ready to go in a few short minutes  Bonus!  It was very easy to put together.  I continue in reading the instructions and discover for first time use you have to cook the stone on high for twenty minutes and then let it fully cool before cooking.  Well by the time this was all said and done  we grabbed something else for dinner.Day 2:  oven is ready to go  and so are our pizzas.  Unfortunately our pizza peel did not fit with this grill and we were having one hell of a time transferring pizza to oven without dough tearing and toppings dropping.  After trying everything in our arsenal  we eventually folded the pizza in half to make a calzone.  It was easier to get in there without a peel  but was still a pain in our arse!Observations and tips:You definitely need to purchase THEIR pizza peel.I didnt find it was cooking evenly so we spent our time moving and rotating in order to avoid edges getting overcooked and the middle undercooked.If youre set on this grill  get the stand.  We were cooking on our patio and the low profile made it very hard to see what was going on.If toppings drop down the sides it creates a real mess and is not that easily cleaned.Read all the directions BEFORE planning your pizza night.Personally, I didnt think the final product was worth it.  It will be a long time before I try this again.Cherise Everhard, May 2015","2.0 out of 5 stars","May 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1W6J3SOWVC9UW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FYO368K#wasThisHelpful","R1W6J3SOWVC9UW","A37E6RW5BUX4U0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A37E6RW5BUX4U0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Jasmine is a plus sized model on her first real photo shoot when she encounters Mack and Victor  soon she discovers they are were-bears.  She handles the surprise like they told her they like cheeseburgers.  No big deal at all.This is a really short story.  The plot and the characters arent fully developed and then its ending  abruptly.  I was a little taken aback.  I felt like I never got the whole story and thats a shame because it could have been so much more.There is a twist at the end during the sex scene that I didnt seem coming and as much as I like my kink, I didnt think it fit.  It came out of left field, for me, and I think the story would have been better without it.  It didnt feel true to the any of the characters.I really would have liked a longer more developed story.

"I got this item for my husband and son who like to hunt.  It arrived just in time for Turkey season to open up.They already have one of the plastic decoys. This one next to it looks so much more lifelike.  It is very easy to set up and take down.  They already prefer it over their normal decoy.When setting up, however, my husband noticed that no matter which of the positions you put the turkey in  the tail drags on the ground, preventing movement.  He likes the decoys to move a bit so he thinks the stake needs to be longer.The price is definitely great for the product  I think it is worth the price and then some.  Most decoys are in one position and cost a little less.  With the 3 different positions to choose from, it seems you get more for your money.We are very pleased with this product and look forward to it helping us put some turkey in the freezer!Cherise Everhard, April 2015","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2L4VMIK3JZWK6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RQ8RBZQ#wasThisHelpful","R2L4VMIK3JZWK6","A37E6RW5BUX4U0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A37E6RW5BUX4U0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was given the first book in the series by the authors in exchange for an honest review Once I finished that one, I immediately purchased this one and dove right in.  I was aching to know what happened next.This is the 2nd book in a 4 part series about Finola a seemingly normal woman and Sebastian the white tiger shape-shifter she has become enamored with.  The books are cliffhangers and this one was really had me lost in the story.  I groaned out loud when I came to the end!You get to know the characters a little more, and as you do you get more invested in their story.  Both Finola and Sebastian have hidden layers and I have a feeling we are only scratching at the surface so far.Its another extremely short read, I raced through it this afternoon.  It has me crazy twitchy for the next two  its that good.  Even though its shorty, it is plenty steamy, suspenseful and sexy  though Id be lying if I said I didnt wish each book was full length.

"I received this book free in exchange for an honest review.Finola Malley is having a really bad night.  She just broke up with her boyfriend, gets called into work and then gets attacked by some men and approached by a white tiger in the parking garage.  It kind of makes your bad days look good in comparison, doesnt it?When all is said and done she finds herself face to face with a breathtaking and very naked man.  The attraction is instant and puts a serious effort into making a bad night end really well.I blew through this book in about an hour maybe a little more.  To say this is a short story is an understatement.  Its more like an appetizer than a short story, though I am still hungry for the main course, I am happily satisfied while I wait.  It was a delicious first course.After reading this book, I immediately had to purchase the next one  I am dying to read the next chapter in Finola and Sebastians life.  I discovered that their story has been divided up in to 4 stories.  Had the other two been available I would have snatched them up as well, but it looks like I have a month or so to wait.  Uhhhhggg!There was a what I thought a kind of big editing boo boo, but I am hoping it will be easily fixed otherwise I found this tale practically perfect.This is an enjoyable sexy read and will leave you wanting more.Cherise Everhard, April 2015","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2OCEMQSJI3FKL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VDSDQ86#wasThisHelpful","R2OCEMQSJI3FKL","A37E6RW5BUX4U0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A37E6RW5BUX4U0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I like cereal.  Never for breakfast but I like it for lunch, snack, dinner and sometimes dessert.  I have had and been a fan of Kelloggs Special K for years, but have only ever had the original flavor.  Those are delicious by themselves but the other 2 flavors provided in this set were outstanding.I have been taking them to work with me.  Eating them with and without milk.  I prefer them with the milk, but without the milk they are a quick easy snack to help sustain me through the day.My new favorite flavor is the fruit and yogurt.  I could eat that every day  all day.  I like the convenient containers  very handy for us cereal lovers on the job.  My favorite thing about this is that is forces portion control on me.  I tend to be a bit of a glutton when it comes to cereal.  I use an obscenely large bowl and then when I am finished if there is milk left over, I add more cereal.  It is a vicious cycle.I havent yet seen this product in my grocery store, but I am on the lookout.  I will definitely be purchasing this again.

"I ordered these for work, thinking they were adult sized.  Not being able to cancel the order once I realized my mistake, I was stuck with them.  I cant comment on how they would fit on a young girl of the same size as I dont have one.  All I can comment on is my impressions of the product.First, had they arrived in my size I wouldnt have worn them, they look like uniform pants to me.  The cheap polyester kind that would make you cringe if you had to wear them.  The feel of them is rough and unforgiving.  There is a sticker on the pant that says flex fabric but nothing about them says or feels flex.  Quite the opposite.I cant imagine any young girl that I know wanting to wear these.  They are just not very hip or stylish.  Its like a blast from the polyester past.  I picture myself wearing them and my thighs sweating.  LOL!  They just dont look comfortable, they dont feel comfortable.They looked like a decent casual dress work pant on the picture, but up close they are just too manly and too uniform for this lady and any young girl I know.  They look itchy and unbreathable.Cherise Everhard, February 2015","2.0 out of 5 stars","February 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1YJ8LZPDBI6EL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NAWUSBG#wasThisHelpful","R1YJ8LZPDBI6EL","A37E6RW5BUX4U0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A37E6RW5BUX4U0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Like everyone else on the planet we have become smoothie freaks.  The husband and I prefer green smoothies while our son likes the fruit smoothies and milk shakes.My regular blender is a beast and also breaks ear drums.  Since I like to mix my green smoothies for breakfast whilst the hubby is still sleeping, this wasnt always polite.  This isnt a silent machine by no means, but compared to my blender its a not as deafening.  It also is quicker with the smoothie-ing so I dont feel AS guilty about my noise making in the morning.I love that the container you blend in is the container you drink from.  Less clean up!!  The directions ask that you dont fill the container past the 20oz mark.  I suggest you follow that rule.  I had premade some smoothie packets that got a too generous in the oz department now and then and when they went over the 20oz mark there was spitting and sputtering coming from the seal making a mess.  Not fun.Other than my operators error I have not had any issues.  Its pretty user friendly.  My son uses it on his own and he tends to play the helpless victim whenever he can so Mom will do it for him, but he had a hard time faking not being able to make a milkshake with this thing  its too easy.It cleans up really easy and the containers fit right in the cabinet with our cups and glasses.  The price seems comparable to the job that it does. Make sure you have enough liquid in the jar to make the smoothie smooth.  This blender tends to come to a halt if there isnt enough liquid.Cherise Everhard, February 2015","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RVIIJOJ7KWFXE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LU2HZLE#wasThisHelpful","RVIIJOJ7KWFXE","A37E6RW5BUX4U0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A37E6RW5BUX4U0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I got this light for the closet that has been built under the stairs in our dungeon, er basement.  There was no light previously and it is a closet that is used by my husband quite frequently.  He had just complained to me about the lack of lighting in there when the offer to review this product came about a day later  it seemed like fate!When the light arrived I was skeptical.  Its a teeny tiny light-bar.  I thought the petite light wouldnt illuminate a drawer, much less a closet.  I set it out on the counter and headed to work, mildly disappointed in my husbands surprise.When I got home that night I noticed the box was missing so I asked him about it.  He saw it on the counter, assumed correctly and happily that it was his and immediately installed it.  He just peeled the plastic off the sticker and stuck it in the center of the closet  voila, illumination! I asked if it worked and he looked at me like I was nuts, and replied yes.I had to see for myself.  I opened the door and the light popped on!  I could see!  The light IS tiny but its shine is mighty!  Upon standing there in shock, unmoving, it eventually turned off.  So I moved it a little and it turned back on.  I was really impressed.Our closet is about 5 tall by 3 wide and 3 deep.  It easily lights up the entire thing.

"This is a very tasty and sweet little snack to have handy.  It's not a snack if you have a craving for chips or something salty but if your sweet tooth is craving something, this could do the trick.I took this to work one day and after sampling it, I was very surprised by how much I enjoyed the taste and the crunch.  It was very hard to put it away and not eat the whole bag.  I stuck to the recommended serving size, which wasn't a lot, considering I wanted to devour the whole bag, and felt really good about having a healthy little snack at work.There isn't anything in its ingredients you can't pronounce.  It's just apples, apple juice and cinnamon.  No complaints there.  Non GMO, organic, no added sugars... again, no complaints.My only complaint is that it's a product of Chile.  Seriously?  With all the apple orchards in this country, heck, in my state alone, we have to import this from Chile?  That also may be why this is a pricey little product.

"I have one of the first Kindles so there is no back light.  I dont read a lot in bed, but on occasion, I like to.  I was worried that even with the light it would be hard on my eyes.  It really isnt.  I find that if I put the light directly on the screen I get a brighter glare from the bulb but if I tilt it slightly to the side I receive a nice even light on the screen.It clips nicely and securely to my thick Kindle case.  The light adjust and moves easily and stays in the position I settle on.  I have even clipped it on pages of my current paperback reads successfully.  You need to clip it to a decent chunk of pages, but it doesnt mar or tear the pages.Its winter in Michigan and its dark and dreary, even with my living room lights, I am finding the extra light helpful this time of year.

"Grey and Ben had been childhood friends and sweethearts.  Then just a few short days before their wedding  Ben dies.  Greys world is destroyed.  Jagger, Ben and Greys lifelong friend, has been with Grey through the past two years watching her struggle to put her life back together.  When Grey decided its time for her to return to their hometown of Thatch, Jagger joins her.This book had a lot of angst and a lot of love in it.  Jagger has been in love with Grey since they were kids but stepped aside when Ben staked his claim first.  Hes getting impatient waiting for her to be his.  Hes ready, but when they get home there seems to be more than the ghost of Bens memory to contend with  Thatch is swimming in drama.I really loved the relationship between Jagger and Grey.  I liked that their friendship was old and solid and his feelings for her completely romantic and endlessly deep.  The sadness and struggles they both felt and dealt with regarding Ben also felt very real to life and brought many a tear to my eyes.What kept this book from being a five star  was the needless and what seemed endless drama once they reached Thatch.  It came at them from all sources.  It got to be way too much.  Too much drama, too many secrets, just too much for this girl.Even with all drama, this book was an excellent read and makes me wonder who is going to star in the next Thatch book.

So far I havent found one thing I dont like about the pan.The pan seems to cook evenly.  Its very light, yet durable.  Clean up is a dream and it there isnt a residual odor from the food cooked previously.  Sometimes when you cook a food with a strong scent, fish, onions.  It can linger on a pan even after it has been washed.  I havent found that to be true in this case.  Whatever has been cooked washes away completely, even the scent.I dont know what to say that hasnt already been said.

Now my phone can reach my dresser from the outlet, or my window sill and I dont have to fall out of bed in an attempt to quiet the alarm before it wakes hubby!It didnt come with the wall outlet attachment, but I just used the one I bought for my iPhone and it worked perfectly with it.  I havent noticed any difference in the charging time or wireless performance as it states on the package.  It works just like my iPhone cable did.Im always nervous when trying a new brand, but luckily those nerves didnt last long.  I  have been using this product for a couple months now and if my cable should go missing, I would definitely purchase another one to replace it.

"A friend of mine bought some towel hooks while on vacation one year and I have wanted some ever since.  Unfortunately, every time I found some, they were the wrong finish or design.  When I found these, I was excited.They fit nicely on my cabinet drawers or doors, whatever I chose.  Unfortunately, what they dont do is hold a towel.  I dont care the size, the thickness, the style Ive tried it all.  They fall off.  The actual hook is so small I dont think it could hold Barbies towel.Even after I failed with every hand towel I could come across, I began searching for towels with loops on them.  I figured a loop would have a better chance on the hook.  I finally stumbled across a set of towels from Target by Threshold that have tiny loops.  I thought I hit the jackpot.  I run home and place my towels on the hook and the towel touches the ground.  Gross.  So I put the hooks on the cabinet drawers and Success!!  Well, for a moment.  The minute you dry your hands, or open the drawer, the towel STILL comes off.My husband is going to try to bend the hook some more  to the point of closing it just enough to slide the towel loop in.  If that doesnt work, Im chucking them in the trash.  They were supposed to be handy in the kitchen; they are just causing me more work and money!!Cherise Everhard, July 2014","2.0 out of 5 stars","July 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R14NR1XWUKV6PN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003IUKMZW#wasThisHelpful","R14NR1XWUKV6PN","A37E6RW5BUX4U0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A37E6RW5BUX4U0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"First of all I love this series and this author, I always feel like I have to say that before I give a not so favorable review.  3 stars arent bad, but its not that great, either.Larissa has been the personal assistant and masseuse to hunky ex-football star, Jack.  Recently relocated to Fools Gold with Jacks business and partners, Larissa has embraced Fools Gold and its people.  She and Jack have an interesting dynamic.  Not only are they co-workers, they are charitable partners and best friends.  They depend on each other for so much.  They balance.That is until Larissas mom comes to town and tells Jack that Larissa is in love with him.  Suddenly these two are looking at each other in whole different light.  Could Larissas mom be right?  And what could that do to their already perfect relationship?Since the beginning of this threesome of books, I have been eager for this story.  I liked the glimpses of Jack and Larissa I have read previously and their story had real promise.  Unfortunately the closer they got to their romance, the less they seemed like who they were.  Their characters morphed into something I didnt really recognize.  They both had their hang ups with the past but it got old real quick and the level of hurt and cruelty that was dished out, by multiple characters, to each other was ridiculous.Basically what started off strong and had me excited took a detour and changed the way I felt about their story.  Sure you get your happy ending, no surprise there, but its the conflict between Jack and Larissa, Jack and his ex and co-workers, that took this 5 star story down to a 3.  Luckily the conflict was short-lived.  Had I not had such high hopes, this may not have bothered me so much.  Still a good story, just could have been better.Cherise Everhard, July 2014","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1NF8WPVWYJTSV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0373778937#wasThisHelpful","R1NF8WPVWYJTSV","A37E6RW5BUX4U0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A37E6RW5BUX4U0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I like this necklace and have received several compliments each time I have worn it.  It is very delicate and feminine looking  but it is made sturdy enough that I dont feel like it is going to break at any moment.I did not receive the box it said it would ship in.  Instead it came in a tiny plastic bag shipped in a padded mailer - probably not the wisest packaging and shipping choice.  No the clarity and color is not the best, but it states the grading accurately and really at .25cttw you cant tell the color or the clarity without getting out a professional jewelers loop.  The photograph is an accurate representation and I think the price also reflects that.  It looks beautiful to me.I have a horrible time wearing necklaces as I find the chains are constantly snagging on my hair.  As a result when I do wear necklaces they are usually beaded or leather.  It has been nice to add another dressier necklace to my collection that I can wear without going bald in the process or ending up with a hair chain by the end of the night.Cherise Everhard, July 2014","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RIE5PF6R4AUJX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HCBE8SA#wasThisHelpful","RIE5PF6R4AUJX","A37E6RW5BUX4U0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A37E6RW5BUX4U0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I tested these new shoes out on vacation.  Probably not the smartest idea, but what better way to put a new shoe to the test than roaming from tourist attraction to tourist attraction?First of all with any new shoe it seems there is a breaking in period - a time to get used to the new shoe and how it feels on the foot.  I didnt experience that breaking in period.  In fact, from the moment I tried on the shoe I loved the fit.  Walking around all weekend long just confirmed my earlier thoughts.  The shoe is fantastic.I was hesitant ordering these shoes online, afraid I would get a shoe that didnt fit well.  The shoes are very light weight and fit my foot perfectly.  It is a very flexible shoe.  I did a half hour aerobic workout to test their flexibility on some more vigorous foot movements and the shoe passed with flying colors.  I dont run, but found this shoe to be great for walking and aerobics.I have never owned a New Balance shoe before, but after this one they will be the first I try in the future.  I cant find anything to complain about - the color, the look, the fit, the feel and the price are all wonderful.  After a weekend of breaking in my new shoes, I am blister free and happy with my new shoes!Cherise Everhard, July 2014","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2U3DJICLVDFQ4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DOEA5HM#wasThisHelpful","R2U3DJICLVDFQ4","A37E6RW5BUX4U0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A37E6RW5BUX4U0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Living in the small town of Plum Orchard, working as a phone sex operator and fending off the moral patrol on a daily basis wouldnt seem like an ideal situation.  But Marybell Lyman has had one hell of a life  and no one knows the depths of her secrets, not even the women she considers her best friends/family, her fellow call girls.  For the past 4 years she has hidden behind what she calls her shield  a colorful spiky Mohawk hairdo and enough Goth makeup and clothing to put Marilyn Manson to shame.  She has a heart of gold  but most people stay far away, except Tag Hawthorne.  He seems to have made it his lifes mission to get to know the untouchable Marybell.  And he is the one person in the town she needs to keep hidden from.When I first started this book I was pleasantly surprised by the steamy sexual situations and witty banter.  I was intrigued by Marybells mask and past and found myself wanting to know more.  I even had decided to order the first books in the series so I could get to know the other side characters better and the back story more.  The more I learned the more curious I was to know how it all started.  I was convinced this was going to be a 5 star rating and I wanted more!But then somewhere along the way, I began to lose the enthusiasm and excitement.  As Marybell and Tag got closer, the feel of the book changed.  Things got a little cheesy and dramatic and then the momentum of the book slowed and suddenly I was more focused on just getting through this one, no longer interested in reading anymore.  By the end of the book I was happy with the result, but not elated or blown away.  It was a good book and although it wasnt as great as it started, I still enjoyed it.  Am I interested in reading anymore in the series?  Maybe, but Im not in the hurry that I once was in.Overall it was good.Cherise Everhard, June 2014","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1HT7IHBH0G2MZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0778316319#wasThisHelpful","R1HT7IHBH0G2MZ","A37E6RW5BUX4U0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A37E6RW5BUX4U0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"3.5 starsI love playing games with my son and husband.  We dont have much in common when it comes to indoor activities or television shows, so games we all enjoy are always welcome.First things first  some tedious assembly is required before you can play.  The instructions were easy enough to follow but it was still more work than what Id like when I want to play a game.  The score board/answer cards that you assemble are of cardboard and I ripped two in the process, they still work, but that made me wonder how long they are going to last.The game rules and directions were easy to follow and we all got a kick out of taking the oath at the beginning of the game and coming up with a punishment if we should be caught in lie.The giant green foam fingers were fun, at first, but soon became too hot and constrictive feeling.  We ended up alternating between holding them and wearing them.The game itself was fun to play but we decided more players, like my sisters family, would be even more fun.  It was a learning experience finding out what each of us Would or Have done, and we laughed a lot and talked a lot through the questions and turns.The age recommendation is 12 and up, and my son is almost 12  each card gives you a choice of 3 questions and a couple times I found it hard to ask one that would apply to him as they seemed a little over his head, not inappropriate, just not applicable.Overall, we had a lot of fun with this game and I cant wait to try it with a few more people.  I think even kicking the kids out of the equation and adding some adults and a few beverages could make for an entertaining evening.Cherise Everhard, June 2014","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R6726KAIBBPEL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EDBZ9IA#wasThisHelpful","R6726KAIBBPEL","A37E6RW5BUX4U0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A37E6RW5BUX4U0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"3.5 starsI inherited my mother in laws Nikon N50 years ago when she received the digital version.  I love the camera and had often borrowed it whenever we vacationed or I wanted to document an event with flawless photos.  Along with the 35-80mm lens I also have a 300mm lens.I like the padding in this bag, the shoulder straps, pockets, etc.  What I dont like in this bag and the other bags in my collection is that it seems that I either can store my camera and one lens or two lenses and no camera.  I wish I could comfortably fit all 3.  I like alternating between the two lenses and I do it quite frequently, especially while on vacation.  I have yet to find something that, like this one, is easy to carry and also good on protection, yet can haul everything.The one camera bag I do have that fits everything is more like a piece of carryon luggage - great for storage, but a pain for lugging around.I love the way my 300mm lens slides down into this one and is supported by the padding.  I wish there was more storage.  I realize I am a dinosaur, but I love film.  Id like to be able to comfortably fit film, extra batteries, etc.  I have a collection of Crown Royal Bags that I use to store my extra lens, film, batteries, etc.  I guess I can continue to carry one of those around in addition to this camera bag.  So I look a little ghetto with the tell-tale purple and yellow bag, at least I know where all my stuff is! Im still going to keep my eyes open for my perfect camera bag.Cherise Everhard, June 2014","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1CA62LWRYKZRT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IDYS0XY#wasThisHelpful","R1CA62LWRYKZRT","A37E6RW5BUX4U0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A37E6RW5BUX4U0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My neighbor introduced me to this product many summers ago over a glass of wine.  She polished my wedding ring with the polishing cream, then put it in the little jewel soaker while we drank and chatted.  When she removed it I could not believe how clean my ring was  more than that I couldnt believe how filthy it had been!  It looked brand new.Since that time I have been a fan.  I have purchased it for every female in my family for Christmas and have used nothing else, since.  Because I have a platinum ring I have to occasionally I take my ring to the jewelers to get the scratches polished out because platinum scratches easy (not from the cleaner), but I no longer have to pay for them to clean it as I keep it clean with this stuff myself.Once upon a time my sister ruined a turquoise and silver ring of mine in jewelry cleaner my mom had  it destroyed the stone.  So far I havent found anything that this is harmful to.  I even left an amethyst necklace in it over night on accident and was pleased it was shiny  not ruined.This stuff lasts FOREVER!  When the polish cream started to harden, I just added a little water to soften it and it worked like new.  It is well worth the money.The addition of an eye glass cleaner this time around was new to me. But I have used it and found it works excellent as well!I am a huge fan of this product and will continue to buy and recommend it to others!Cherise Everhard, June 2014","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ZDMFXBFWU8G9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005LD9BLA#wasThisHelpful","R2ZDMFXBFWU8G9","A37E6RW5BUX4U0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A37E6RW5BUX4U0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My office manager recently brought in her Keurig so we ladies dont have to make the long trek to the coffee station in the main lobby.  Now we have our fancy coffee daily and dont have to fight with the salesman and customer to get a cuppa!I keep a drawer of snacks for those times when my hunger overtakes me and I need a quick fix, trail mix, raisins and instant oatmeal packets are always on hand.  When I was offered this product I was excited as it takes the normal oatmeal packets to a whole other level.I first poured the oatmeal and the fruit and nut packet in a mug and soon realized it was going to be way too small for my meal.  I didnt like how crammed it was going to be  so I transferred those contents to a bowl  then set the mug under the Keurig as directed.  Placed the little apple spice container in the machine and presto  a fragrant hot water came out.  It smelled like Hot Cider or Wassail - Yum.  We arent quite sure what ounces our Keurig is so I had used the smallest setting.  In mixing the oatmeal I felt, at first, it was going to be too watery.  So I ended up dumping a bit of the remaining water down the sink.  I was bummed that after it sat a while it thickened and I realized that water would have been perfect as it was a tad too dry for my tastes.  But the flavor was delicious and the oatmeal wasnt as mushy as instant oatmeal usually is.The next time I made it I used the full cup of water and was happy with the results.  The texture and moisture was perfect.  The addition of the fruit and nut packet make it more of a meal than a snack, but sometimes that is just what I need.  The box it all comes in is a bit bulky and space sucking, so I immediately ditched the box and used my own storage for its contents.  Its hearty, sweet and delicious, easy and quick to make.  I will be buying more and keeping them handy at work.Cherise Everhard, June 2014","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2SOU4JYO5P0KR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IP6Y21E#wasThisHelpful","R2SOU4JYO5P0KR","A37E6RW5BUX4U0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A37E6RW5BUX4U0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I was all kinds of excited when I learned Elizabeth Lee would be writing a new series featuring motocross riders. I thoroughly enjoyed Reid and Nora's story in the first book, Throttled, and was anxious to get to read Brett's story. I wanted to see him get tamed. :)I can't deny I was a little apprehensive of the pairing between Brett and Georgia at first. She had been through so much already with losing her first husband at a young age and I wasn't entirely sure how she would pair with manwhore Brett. My fears were laid aside relatively quickly during this book because, honestly, once things started happening between them, Brett had eyes for no one else. (The best version of ""tamed"" I can ask for.) Even still, it wasn't all smooth going between them. While I can't say she was still hung up on her first husband, his loss definitely affected how she looked at life and love. She was terrified at the thought of losing love again and when the guy you're falling for has a dangerous job as Brett does, those fears get stirred up pretty quickly, understandably.I wound up really loving Brett and Georgia's story. He was healing from his injury. She was healing from losing Jamie. They were both going through a lot and I loved how they were there for one another. They had crazy chemistry and things got pretty steamy between them. While there were plenty of feels with this book, it was pretty low on angst, which I appreciated. There's no doubt these two were better together than apart. I loved reading along as Georgia got a second chance at love and began truly living again. I also, of course, enjoyed watching Brett find something real. It was a great story.Of course, we get a glimpse into some pretty special moments between Nora and Reid <3 as well as learning more about some of the other characters we were introduced to in the first book. And after the buildup between Chase and Hoyt  and that epilogue  I can't even tell you how much I'm already looking forward to their story in Clutched.

"Kendall Ryan is an author whos been on my list of authors to try for quite awhile now. Somehow I missed this books release, but when I started seeing the companion novel Monster Prick advertised, I knew Id found just the book I needed to try. So, naturally, I decided I needed to read this one before Monster Pricks release so I had the whole story. Im glad I did. This was a great quick read that was as funny as it was sexy. I definitely enjoyed it.Books with manwhore lead characters are often off-putting to me, but this one wasnt. (I think that was because I did a little research and learned he was reformed early on, so we didnt really see that side of him. That Im ok with.) Hayden was an arrogant ass and crass as the day is long, but he was also funny and  deep down  a good guy. Hes on par with some of the other unapologetic manwhores Ive read in books and I did enjoy him. His mind was a fun place to spend a couple hours.I liked Emery, too. She was intelligent, driven, real and, most importantly, didnt roll over for Hayden immediately. She was (more or less) immune to his charms, but willing to consider building a friendship with him. Of course, these things have a way of escalating quickly when two people have as much chemistry as they did. But I liked that she held him at arms length at first anyhow. I enjoyed watching them get to know each other and become something more than friends with benefits.Screwed was a good book and one that I devoured in a matter of a couple hours. I found myself engrossed in Hayden and Emerys world and I enjoyed the lack of true angst  though there were twists and misunderstandings  and the abundance of humor. Ive already looking forward to Gracie and Hudsons story in Monster Prick.

"Since I first picked up Wallbanger years ago, I've considered myself a big fan of Alice Clayton's books. She has her own special brand of humor and it shines through in the dialogue  internal and otherwise  of each of her heroines. It's not often I find books that are genuinely laugh out loud funny. Except, you know, when I'm reading one of her books. I had high hopes for Nuts and I wasn't disappointed.I love love loved the rural setting of Nuts. Watching Roxie transition from life in Hollywood to a much slower-paced life in upstate New York was wonderful... and, more often than not, hilarious. It was really fun to watch her come into her own back in her hometown, even if it was ""temporary"" at the time. I enjoyed reading along as she introduced the residents of Bailey Falls and the patrons of her mom's diner to new and delicious meals and as she interacted with them. (And, of course, hot farmer Leo.)The chemistry between Roxie and Leo was apparent from their very first meeting, when  thanks to some rogue sugar snap peas  he ended up facedown in her lap on the floor with his (wal)nuts all over the place. (Which, PS, is one of my absolute favorite scenes in the entire book. I literally laughed out loud. Went back and reread it. Laughed out loud again. Brilliant.) Leo was just what Roxie needed to keep from getting bored during the summer back in her hometown. And, you know, it was just for the summer... so what could go wrong? It was never meant to be anything serious. (*cough*)Of course, it's not all fun and games and sexy times (though there are PLENTY of those... and they're hot). There has to be a little drama to drive the story forward, right? I was honestly 100% surprised by the ""twist"" introduced in the book. It took me aback for a little while because it was a pretty big secret to keep, but I got over it. And, honestly, I think it even made the whole story that much better once I accepted what was going on.Nuts was a great start to a smart and sexy new series. The characters were fantastic. I loved the humor. The sexy times were pretty darn hot. There was really only one thing that didn't sit all that well and that was the heavy handedness of the talk about organic farming. And, honestly, that was more my personal beliefs (as well as growing up with a lot of traditional farmers, and working with them to this day) and not something that was wrong with the book. That said, it still didn't keep me from thoroughly enjoying the book. The secondary characters were nearly as fantastic as Roxie and Leo. I can't wait for Cream, the second book in this series. I think Oscar and Natalie will make a fantastic pair and I'm excited to read their story. Oh, backtrack for a second... the epilogue? From Leo's perspective? 1000% perfection. It might be my favorite chapter in the entire book. I finished this book with a happy heart and a goofy grin.I received a copy of this book from the publisher in exchange for an honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RMRKZE6CRVY3A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1501118137#wasThisHelpful","RMRKZE6CRVY3A","A3Q6CMXMGESPOG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3Q6CMXMGESPOG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I was so ready for the conclusion to Gavin & Dixie's story, but I wasn't sure if my heart could take it. I knew it would be an emotional journey and I was right but it was beyond perfect for them.

"Kristen Ashley has done it again! (Not that I'm at ALL surprised by this. She's a genius.) I started Walk Through Fire in the midst of a moment of panic during a HUGE book hangover and it was exactly the thing I needed to get me over it. (And, of course, leave me with a hangover for a completely different book.)Anyone who follows my blog knows I'm a total sucker for a second chance love story. It's one of my favorite tropes. The first part of Millie and Logan's story ended twenty years ago  we don't know exactly why, but we do know it wasn't pretty. I had some rough moments with Logan during the beginning of this story, ones I was entirely sure I'd be able to move past, but I did. Oh, did I ever. It took some time, but I was singing the man's praises for sure by the end.I liked Millie at the beginning, though I was a little cautious because I didn't know what exactly she'd done in the past to break Logan like she did. I didn't want to be too far in her corner if there was a chance she'd done something unforgivable. Gods, it was just the opposite. Of course, I'm not going to spoil things for you, but damn. Her story broke my heart. It was with the revelation of the truth that Logan finally won me over entirely, too. It wasn't all pretty, but it was real and raw and I felt every single minute of it.Of course, moving on from issues of the past was only part of the challenge for this couple. His daughter was determined to cause problems  I don't know when I last wanted so badly to wring the neck of a character in a book  and there's the ongoing saga with Benito that kept me on edge several times throughout this book. Through it all, however, there was no doubt in my mind that Millie and Logan were the real deal and that they would, eventually, work past the other things and move towards something real again. They had it all  chemistry, passion, love and mutual respect. They got each other. They understood each other's lives. They belonged together.I loved getting lost in the world that Kristen has built here with Chaos. I love her writing, characters and stories. I feel like I'm living it, not just reading it. I had ALL THE FEELS and I loved (nearly) every second of it. And that epilogue? *contented sigh* I couldn't have asked for anything more perfect than that was. I'm not entirely sure who gets the next book (but damn, I sure hope it's Hound) but I do know I'll be waiting anxiously to find out and get my hands on it.I received a copy of this book from the publisher, via NetGalley, in exchange for an honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/ROLK8UOWX3DYS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1455533254#wasThisHelpful","ROLK8UOWX3DYS","A3Q6CMXMGESPOG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3Q6CMXMGESPOG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Surviving Ice was of the read in one sitting variety for me. It grabbed me right from the very start and there wasnt a chance I was stopping until I finished it. I loved Ivy and Sebastian both, so I was as gripped by their chemistry  and eventually the romance  as I was the suspense.Ivy was a great, strong female lead and I admired the way she was handling everything surrounding the death of her uncle. A lesser woman wouldve broken, but she remained strong. She intrigued me in Chasing River, so I was thrilled to learn the final book in the series would be hers. Sebastian was a fantastic male lead. I loved that we got to spend roughly half the book inside his head. (Dual POV, when done right, are my favorite.) He was keeping plenty of secrets and couldve been quite dangerous to Ivy, but I still liked him. And I LOVED the sexual tension between him and Ivy.It was impossible not to find Ivy and Sebastian a perfect match. They complemented each other so well. They were both strong and independent. Their chemistry was smokin hot right from their very first meeting. I couldnt wait to see how the story between them progressed as secrets were revealed. Oh, and its worth mentioning their chemistry at the beginning and the resulting sexual tension gave way to some SERIOUSLY HOT sexy times. I was definitely fanning myself.Surviving Ice wasnt an edge of your seat type of suspense book, but I liked that part of the storyline. I was so sad for Ivy and her loss and I was legitimately concerned about how much she knew and what danger that knowledge would land her in. I NEEDED to know how things would turn out and thats definitely part of what kept me obsessed with finishing this book  in a matter of just a few hours. The other parts, of course, was the characters and the kissing. :)Man, I hate to see this series come to an end, but Im glad it wrapped up the way it did. I had pretty high expectations for this final book and it exceeded all of them. I thought it was a great way to finish up this series and, though Im sad its over and that I have to give these characters up for now, I cant wait to see what Kathleen gives us next.I received a copy of this book from the publisher, via NetGalley, in exchange for an honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R5MSB3EYNKBGJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UDCNHQO#wasThisHelpful","R5MSB3EYNKBGJ","A3Q6CMXMGESPOG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3Q6CMXMGESPOG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Lia Riley is one of my new favorite adult contemporary authors. If it wasn't official after Last First Kiss and Right Wrong Guy, it definitely is after Best Worst Mistake. I loved her new adult series, but I think I might love the Brightwater series even more. (Shhhhh.) I've been looking for a series to fill that small town sweet romance hole left in my heart when Candis Terry's Sweet, Texas series ended and this is definitely the one. Of course, it's also over now (*wipes tears*) so I guess I have to go back to the drawing board again.Best Worst Mistake was exactly the book I needed in my life when I read it. It was sweet, sexy, heartwarming and romantic. I fell head over heels for the characters and loved their story. It's a kind of Beauty & the Beast retelling and it just totally made my heart happy. Be prepared for the big cheesy grins  and a fair few feels  when you read this one.I've been waiting for Wilder Kane's story since I first heard about him earlier on in the series. And, let me tell you, Lia wastes no time jumping into the story this time around. That first chapter? Holy cow. There wasn't a chance in hell I could put this book down once I started. It was definitely of the ""read in one sitting"" variety for me. Wilder was nothing short of amazing. I do love watching a closed off man let go of the baggage of the past and realize that life can still be good  or even great  even if it's different than he thought it would be. I just wanted to give him a big hug and tell him it would be alright... that it would be BETTER than alright.Quinn was no slouch herself. She was intelligent, sassy and a little bit awkward. I swear, I fell for her about the first time she started babbling  something she does A LOT. I loved her quirky side and her book-themed tees. I liked how honest she was and my heart ached for the things she was dealing with when it came to her father and his health... and the possible implications on her own health. She was such a realistic character. You couldn't help but love her.Together Wilder and Quinn were nothing short of magical. There was heat  oh boy was there  but there was also something real and raw, right from the beginning. She helped him realize that he's not a broken man and that he's more than the sum of his injuries. He helped her realize that life is worth living and enjoying to the fullest, even if there might be an expiration date on the memories made. My heart was so full as I watched these two come together, let go and find something real. Add to that appearances by the earlier couples and Grandma and this book was the perfect series-ender.I'm so sad this series has come to an end, but even more, I'm excited to see what Lia gives us next. She's definitely on my auto-buy author list. I'll read anything she writes and I strongly suspect I'll continue to love each new character, book and series. I can't recommend this one enough!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R4A0COXZ7C2X3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SRYUVRI#wasThisHelpful","R4A0COXZ7C2X3","A3Q6CMXMGESPOG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3Q6CMXMGESPOG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Upon reading the blurb for this book at the end of Perfection, I promptly went to Amazon, bought a copy and jumped right in. I'm a total sucker for romances between two enemies. Rory and Connor had a heck of a history  and the whole town knew it. I couldn't wait to see what would happen when those competitive, angry feelings turned into something else. Throw in a fake relationship and some very real chemistry, and I was totally hooked.I really liked both Rory and Connor. Their backstory made me shake my head and laugh. It was over-the-top... in the best way possible. When they are both picked to work on the same construction project, sparks fly and things just get more interesting. I loved their banter and their chemistry. They might've been rivals who hated each other in theory, but there was so much more there than that. The plot was a little spastic at times, but I didn't care one single bit. I enjoyed reading about these two characters so much, the oddities barely registered. I knew once the fake relationship agreement was thrown in, things would get interesting quickly and I was right. I had a big ol' goofy grin on my face during the biggest part of this book.Checkmate was fun. I liked that characters from the first two books made an appearance and reading this book strengthened my resolve to both go back and read the first book and continue reading this series. Not only was it laugh out loud funny, it was also charming, sexy and romantic. I'm definitely a fan of this author and series.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3T1JMN2TA0P9V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NZ73ZXY#wasThisHelpful","R3T1JMN2TA0P9V","A3Q6CMXMGESPOG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3Q6CMXMGESPOG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book was first brought to my attention by my friend Steph (of No BS Book Blog) when she did the Harry Potter Spells Book Tag. Unlike me, Steph isn't big on the ""reading for feels"" thing so when she talked about how she loved this one, how much it made her feel and how she regularly rereads it, I knew I had to find out what all of the fuss was about.If I'm honest, I have to admit that after a couple chapters, I wasn't sure if this book was for me. I kept going because I trusted Steph's opinion and there was something kinda charming about the characters, even if there were a couple things bugging me. I'm really glad I kept going, too. It was a delightfully quirky, romantic and funny book.Though this was the second book in the series, I didn't really feel lost or like I'd missed much by not reading the first. (Though I do plan to go back and read it at some point.) The only thing that was kind of a mystery was the Bradford obsession with food. I'm not sure if the first book clears that up any or not. While odd, I could still read and enjoy the book without knowing the trigger for their obsession.The characters totally made this book. I liked Zoe pretty well from the start. I could sympathize with her over her weight issues and Trevor's attitude in the beginning towards her made me really skeptical I would come to love him. There's just no easy way to put this  he was a douche. He was attracted to her, but didn't know what to do with those feelings and it wasn't pretty at first. BUT, he mellowed. He accepted his attraction and I absolutely loved watching him fall for the woman who is unlike the women he's usually attracted to. I think I loved it most of all because of the way his character transformed and the awkwardness that ensued as he accepted his feelings. They were super cute together once he stopped being a jerk.Perfection was funny and heartwarming and definitely gave me plenty of feels. As uncertain as I was in the early chapters, I liked this one a lot. Plus the blurb for the following book caught my attention so I'm pretty sure I'll continue on with this series... and I still want to go back and read the first one.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2862HUWIA51UU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005JL196Y#wasThisHelpful","R2862HUWIA51UU","A3Q6CMXMGESPOG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3Q6CMXMGESPOG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It's been awhile since I read a Brazen book, but with all the great-sounding new releases coming in the next couple months, I have a feeling I'll be reading my fair share (and probably then some) until the end of the year. I can always count on Brazen books to give me steamy heat and sexy romance. His Fantasy Girl was the first of Nina Croft's books that I've read, but it won't be my last.I knew as soon as I read the synopsis for His Fantasy Girl that I'd have to read it. I loved the idea of the perfect, clean cut woman (who just happens to be a police officer) being reunited with her ex-con one night stand (who happens to be the father of her child). I do enjoy a good opposites attract story. Add in a secret baby (well, ten year old) and I'm hooked.I'm just a little sad to say the romance didn't work for me as well as I hoped. Logan burned so hot and cold that I had a difficult time believing he was interested in more than just sex with Abby. His back and forth between ""this is no more than sex"" and ""well I guess I'm just not good enough for more"" gave ME whiplash. I can only imagine how Abby felt. Now, there's no denying the level of passion between Logan and Abby. Their sparks had sparks. The sexy times were hot as hell. I did end up warming to this pairing later on in the book, but it did take me some time.All in all, His Fantasy Girl was a good, sexy romance. It was a quick read and I look forward to seeing where this new series heads next. I have my eye on it!I received a copy of this book from the publisher, via NetGalley, in exchange for an honest review.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R19IRW8F6D7ZZW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014CR0OPW#wasThisHelpful","R19IRW8F6D7ZZW","A3Q6CMXMGESPOG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3Q6CMXMGESPOG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"After years of trying many different types of portable chargers for my phone, I've finally found the perfect option. I frequently travel to conferences and other places where I want to use my phone for hours (and in areas with questionable cell service or limited wifi) so I'm quick to drain my battery. This charger has been the perfect solution for me. It's not overly bulky and as long as I remember to take my USB cord  it allows me to keep taking photos, looking at maps, posting on social media, etc. without worrying about what it would do to the charge on my phone. I would recommend picking up an extra USB cord for whatever device you're using this to charge and just storing it with the charger in the mesh storage pack it comes with, that way you're always prepared.

"I've been waiting for Lianne's story since I realized how freaking awesome she was during the Shameless Hour. Let me tell you  I wasn't the least bit disappointed. It was great to get into her head, learn more about her life and her insecurities, and watch her take her own shot at love.I loved Lianne before starting this book and throughout it, my affection for her only grew stronger. I enjoyed that she was a contradiction  beautiful, famous actress on the outside and shy, kinda nerdy gamer chick on the inside. I love atypical characters. She was kind of awkward at times, which I found endearing, and I loved her spunk. It was wonderful to watch her come into her own during this book.DJ was adorable. He was so sweet and thoughtful, but still sexy as could be. (Hello, perfect guy?) I hated what he was going through and how it affected him. No one deserves to have to deal with what he did. Through it all though, he was a wonderful guy. I loved watching him in his element when he was DJing and, of course, with Lianne. They had great chemistry from the start and I really enjoyed watching things grow between them  and how they each grew as a result of what was happening between them. I was also pleased with how DJ (eventually) handled the truth of his situation where Lianne was concerned.One of the things I love best about this series  besides everything, of course  is the how the characters are all intertwined. This means that, with each new book, not only do I come to love a couple new characters but I get to catch up with my favorites from earlier in the series. And, you know, since I have a tough time giving up characters I love once I've finished their book(s), this is a perfect situation to me. Win-win!The Fifteenth Minute was sexy, sweet and had plenty of feels. It was everything I wanted and a great addition to The Ivy Years series.

"I've found each book in J.K. Rock's Camp Boyfriend series wonderful in their own way and Camp Forget-Me-Not was no exception. I'm really sad to see this series come to an end, but I think it went out on a high note.Being perfectly honest, Kayla wasn't the easiest character for me to like at first. She's a popular girl and it's obvious how much that popularity means to her. She's sacrificed her relationship with a longtime friend, Nick, in favor of being with the ""right crowd"" and she's regretting it now that Nick is famous and back at camp. I questioned her motivations at first. Did she only want him because he was famous or was it more than that? Did she miss the strong connection they had? What was the real story here? Because the story was told solely from Kayla's POV, I couldn't get a real feel on what was going on with him outside of the scenes he shared with Kayla. So I was left with a lot of questions all around.The romance wasn't my favorite in this book  I definitely wanted MORE. MORE of everything  communication, time together, kissing. I did find myself frustrated with Kayla and Nick at times because of the lack of communication. Then, you know, I remembered what it was like to be that age and I tried to take it a little easier on them. ;) I did, however, LOVE reading these important scenes that shaped their friendship in the past and led them where they were today. And when they were good together, they were REALLY good together. The issues of the past had definitely left a mark on their friendship (and the possibility of something more) but I did to see them move on and realize there was something good there.My favorite part of this book, hands down, was Kayla's growth. We spend the entire book in her head, so we get it all. I loved reading along as she came into her own and realized who she was, outside of her friends. Friendship is so important, but so is being true to you. She was a far more likable person once she started to realize this. I loved her journey.Despite my small issues with the romance, Camp Forget-Me-Not was a great book. It was a wonderful conclusion to the Camp Boyfriend series. I love what Joanne and Karen Rock did with this series. Each of the books made me nostalgic for the time where summer was the most important part of the year. I never did go to a camp like this one, but my days and nights were more often than not spent with neighbors and friends, making memories. You can't read these books without being transported back there. I've read them all with a big, cheesy grin and, often, a tear in my eye. I am kinda sad to say goodbye to this series and these characters, but I imagine I'll do rereads in the future.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ALUOUKE7C3UC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00O1R3I0M#wasThisHelpful","R1ALUOUKE7C3UC","A3Q6CMXMGESPOG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3Q6CMXMGESPOG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"While there are multiple stories in the '90s Playlist Anthology, my rating and review is solely on Brighton Walsh's My Strongest Weakness.I'm a big fan of pretty much anything that takes me back to the '90s, so I was over the moon when I heard Brighton Walsh, one of my favorite authors, was going to be part of a '90s anthology. I couldn't wait to get my hands on her story because, honestly, everything she writes is amazing, and a book set in one of my personal favorite decades was bound to be something magical. I wasn't wrong.Oh, Tia and Mason. Can I tell you just how much I loved them and their story? There's a reason the whole ""opposites attract"" trope has been done over and over. The reason? It's fantastic. How can you NOT love watching the punk rock chick and the frat boy together? Now, the whole secret hookup thing added another level to the story for sure. It further complicated the situation and made for some great drama. (And even a few tears from yours truly.) But as I read this book, I couldn't help but see how, even through their differences, just how absolutely perfect Tia and Mason were for each other. And, in turn, just how perfect the story was for me.I'm often concerned when I go into a story in an anthology that it won't be enough story for me. That it won't be long enough, there won't be enough character development or growth and that the story will fall flat. Boy, did I have nothing to worry about here. My Strongest Weakness gave me wonderful, developed characters, SUPER HOT sexy times, a sweet romance and great character growth. I can't ask for more from any book I read.I thumbed through a couple of the other stories in this book and I'll probably go back and read them sometime. Brighton's was the one that I just couldn't NOT read. And I'm glad I didn't wait.

"I always know to expect an emotional roller coaster from Rebecca's books and Beyond What is Given was no exception. This book wrecked me and put me back together. (At least twice.) But I loved every minute.Oooooooh boy, this book. I can't say a whole lot without running the risk of spoiling a huge part of the plot, so I'll tread carefully. I loved both of the characters. Grayson was amazing. He was every bit the swoony, yet complicated, man I expected to find here. He won me over early on, even with the secret he was keeping. (The secret? Broke my heart in so many ways. But I was eventually put back together.) Samantha was pretty darn great herself. She, too, had her fair share of secrets to keep but they weren't quite of the same extent as Grayson's. But she was fun and sassy and the pairing between her and Grayson was so perfect I was rooting for them right from the start. There's no doubt things there were complicated as hell, but it was easy to see how perfect they were. Not only was their chemistry out of this world, but they made each other better. (And I'd be remiss if I didn't mention the smokin' hot sexy times because WOW. *fans self*)I thought Beyond What is Given was a great addition to the Flight & Glory series. I loved seeing more from characters I fell in love with early in the series. I did find this book had a little more drama than the other ones, but it didn't bother me. I was so wrapped up in the story, I'd take all of it. This book has its fair share of twists and turns and I was taken by surprise a couple times. I laughed and cried (quite a bit) but ended the book with a big smile on my face.

"So, if I'm going to be completely honest, I wasn't entirely sure I would like Tristan's book. I've been having trouble reading books with ""manwhores"" in them as of late. I've lost my tolerance for their crap. I went back and forth quite a bit in the beginning. But, once I accepted him for who he was and, more importantly, who he was becoming, I kinda loved him. A lot.The characters definitely drove this book. I really liked Alex from the beginning. She was strong and sassy. My favorite kind of heroine. I loved that she called Tristan on his crap. She was dealing with enough and, though she was undeniably attracted to him, she wasn't going to be a doormat for him. She wasn't falling for his game. She wanted more. As I said above, Tristan was not the ultimate book boyfriend in the beginning. He was a jerk. He said things that had me simultaneously rolling my eyes and gritting my teeth. But he was unapologetic and he didn't try to hide who he was. I had to respect that, even if I didn't like it that much. Once Alex came into his life, he slowly began to change and I started crushing on him hard. I couldn't not. His character's development was fantastic and something I enjoyed as much as the romance.Slow burn is the name of the game with the romance in this book. If you're someone who needs immediate gratification when it comes to your books, this one probably won't work for you. The slow burn is one of the things I liked best about this book, however. Anytime an author can give me that much chemistry and sexual tension and then a really fantastic payoff in the end, I'm content. More than content, really. I'm thrilled. That's exactly what happened with Alex and Tristan. I had my doubts about these two very early on in the book, but there's no denying just how right they were for each other. I ended this book with a couple tears because of the sweet (and wholly unexpected) ending.When I finished this book, I'd rated it 4 stars. Upon further reflection  and because I haven't been able to get it out of my head  I decided to up the rating to 5 stars when I wrote my review. I love when a book takes me completely by surprise and this one definitely did that. This is the last book listed in the series, but I can't help but hope for more. I've really enjoyed these characters and would definitely like to see more from them. I loved this end to the series.

"I was really excited to start this series as I loved Sarah's Love by Numbers so much. I couldn't wait to see what the spinoff would bring. I wasn't at all disappointed.I was really happy to learn that Lady Penelope would get the first book in the series. I liked her in Eleven Scandals to Start to Win a Duke's Heart. Though I didn't want to see her with Simon, I wanted her to find her own happily ever after. She deserved that. Bourne was an unlikely match for her in the beginning, but I loved seeing how things progressed between them. It wasn't long before I was a total believer and couldn't wait to see them further explore their connection, even if it all started off as something less honorable.This was a great start to a new series.

"Holy crap. This book. It was romantic, sexy and full of feels. I loved the nerdy heroine and the hero with all if his baggage. The banter was great and there was tons of both humor and heart.Philippa is easily my favorite of Sarah's heroines. I loved her scientific approach to life and love (and the marital bed). She was easy to connect with and like. She was nerdy and kind of strange, but I found that all extremely endearing. I loved how she pursued Cross and how direct she was with him. I love how Sarah's female characters are a stark contrast to the ones I read in most other historical romance. They're not afraid to pursue what they want and I appreciate that.Cross, with his baggage and complicated past, was an unexpectedly good match for Philippa. They were more similar than they realized and I loved their banter and chemistry. The sexual tension was off the charts. Smokin' hot. He couldn't resist her, no matter how hard he might've wanted to.

"I LOVED Temple, Mara and their story. There's no doubt it was complicated, what with her being thought dead and him suspected of murdering her. The web of lies and deceit went back years and I loved seeing how it all unraveled when they found themselves face to face again.As far as heroines go, Mara was outstanding. Granted, her choices all those years ago ruined a perfectly innocent man, but you can't really fault her for wanting to escape the situation she was in. Temple was complicated, but so freaking easy to like. For a man to have gone through the things he did, but still come out on the other side with a good heart, speaks highly of his character to begin with.The romance in No Good Duke Goes Unpunished was great, too. I'm a big fan of second chance romances, and while theirs was tinged with years of lies and complications, I still enjoyed it. I loved their chemistry and the way it was so easy to tell how much they cared for each other.This book was a great addition to a historical romance series I've fallen head over heels for. As sad as I am that there's just one book left, I am so happy to jump into the final book and FINALLY find out Georgiana/Chase's story.

"This isn't my first Lauren Layne book, but it is my first of her adult titles. It won't be my last. As a matter of fact, I'm already anticipating the next title in this series, Steal Me. Fortunately, November isn't too far away.I really liked the pairing of these characters and the setup for the story here. I couldn't wait to see what happened when stubborn, closed off police officer Luc, who was constantly trying to stay out of the spotlight, met up with the woman and reporter, Ava, who was intent on shining that light brightly on him. I enjoyed watching them play off each other and I loved their banter. I enjoyed watching each of them struggle with what their chemistry and developing connection meant for their careers. Ava's was torn between wanting to tell the story and wanting to protect Luc. Luc wanted to trust to trust Ava, but was having a difficult time because he needed to keep himself closed off from the reporter side of her. As the lines blurred, it made for an interesting dynamic between these two.I knew it would be a bumpy ride, and more often than not, I enjoy good, antagonistic chemistry between characters. I definitely liked both Luc and Ava and felt like I understood their motivations. There's no denying there was tons of chemistry between them. While I started out enjoying their banter and bullheadedness, there was a little more back and forth than I could personally take at times. I understood why there was as much conflict between these two as there was, but it did make it difficult to root for them at times. But when they were good together? They were amazing. They were passionate and had a connection that went beyond the bedroom, no matter how much each of them were insistent that all they could have was a sexual relationship. The sexy scenes were hot and romantic; the perfect combination for me when it comes to romance.Luc's family was one of the high points for me in this book. I absolutely LOVED the Moretti clan. How can you not? They were meddlesome in that way the best families are, especially when it's clear they have their clan's best interests at heart. Thick or thin, they stuck together. And Nonna? She was a hoot and a half. I loved that lady. At times it felt like the rest of the Moretti's overshadowed the developing relationship between Luc and Ava.So, while I might not have fallen head over heels for Frisk Me, I absolutely enjoyed it and would recommend it to anyone who enjoys strong characters and (more than) a little conflict in their romance. The payoff for the frustration and lack of communication was an ending that left me with hearts in my eyes.I received a copy of this book from the publisher, via NetGalley, in exchange for an honest review.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1H0XD3TARNNAF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TXN4Y8Y#wasThisHelpful","R1H0XD3TARNNAF","A3Q6CMXMGESPOG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3Q6CMXMGESPOG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When I read Behind the Scenes, as invested as I was in Ally and Liam's story, I still found myself wanting to get to Vanessa's story. I was intrigued by her character and her relationship with her family, as they seemed to want more traditional things for her than she wanted for herself. When I realized her book, in fact, was going to be a LGBTQ story, I found myself even more interested. While I've read several m/m romances, this would be my first f/f. I wasn't sure if/how it would work for me, but at the end of the day, it's about two people falling in love. How can you not get behind that?I liked Vanessa in Behind the Scenes. I loved her in this book, even in the moments where I wanted to yell at her for what kinda seemed like playing with Brianna's feelings. On closer look, however, she wasn't doing it consciously. She really was just that conflicted about the things she was feeling. With her upbringing, it wasn't easy to admit she might be gay. She was struggling to come to terms with so much during this book  her own personal truth, her career, growing up and being on her own. Who hasn't faced at least one of these struggles at some point? It was because of that, if not her sexuality, that I found it easy to connect with her. I loved her journey and her character growth as she accepted herself.The other half of this story was Josh's. Oh, I had some mixed feelings about Josh along the way. He came off as such a self-centered, spoiled jerk in the first book, it was a little tougher to get me on his side. But, it happened sooner or later. He was facing his own issues in this book and, while I don't think his character growth was quite as impressive as Vanessa's, I appreciate it for what it was and I don't want to diminish it. I think he has a little further to go  and I'd love to catch up with him in a few months to see his progression  but he certainly won me over. I saw a whole new side of him in this book, one that was more vulnerable and honest. I liked it.Under the Lights was a fantastic read. I couldn't get through it fast enough and, once I was finished, I desperately wished I had read more slowly or that there was more to the story. But, not because it was incomplete. Because I adored these characters and just wished for more. What we did get more of, however, was Ally and Liam, who are facing brand new issues in this book as she's away at school and he's working. That was, honestly, a little unsettling because I liked them so much. But, it was also real. Long distance relationships are hard under normal circumstances. When you're dating a celebrity and you're on opposite coasts? There are bound to be troubles.This book is classified as young adult, but I would definitely say that, with the issues it takes on, it's absolutely on the upper end of YA and almost new adult. I think it will easily appeal to readers of both genres, too. Under the Lights gets all the stars from me. I wish I could give more than five, as a matter of fact. It was real, raw and beautiful.I received a copy of this book from the publisher, via NetGalley, in exchange for an honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1WP9JXK2AFSNG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00X3ODI90#wasThisHelpful","R1WP9JXK2AFSNG","A3Q6CMXMGESPOG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3Q6CMXMGESPOG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought this book several months ago after it hit my radar for the first time, but I took forever to get around to reading it. It sounded great and I was interested, but it got lost in the stack of review books. Once I got an ARC for the second book in the series, Under the Lights, I knew I needed to finally dive into this one. While I'm kicking myself for taking this long to read it, I'm also kinda glad I waited so I could binge read the series.It's been a long time since I read a famous person/regular person book and I have to say, this one really hit the spot. I really liked both Ally and Liam. The supporting characters were interesting. Even with all the ""teenager drama"" and conflict, I enjoyed the story. It was believable and real, as were the characters. More than anything though, I loved Dahlia's writing. She has a fresh voice, even when writing a trope I've read a number of times.The romance between Ally and Liam was great. I loved how they just got each other. Of course, this made it a little difficult at times to watch as he paraded Ally's best friend Vanessa around as his (fake) girlfriend as a PR stunt. I was so much in Ally's head that I felt every emotion she felt. And believe me, between her father's illness and this relationship drama, she was feeling a lot. I was in this 1000% as they navigated the bumpy waters of having a real relationship in secret while letting the world think Liam was in a VERY public relationship with someone else. It was messy. It was dramatic in that way that young adult books can be. But it's all of that which made it realistic and engrossing.One thing I've learned with Dahlia's books is that you should expect the unexpected. You might think you know what direction a story point is heading, but more often than not, you'll be completely wrong. This is just one of many reasons I love her books. It would've been so easy for her to turn Ally and Vanessa's friendship into frenemies or to draw out her dad's storyline. Instead, she made it her own and I loved what it was.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RVCAG1A21G6EH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KE4RL68#wasThisHelpful","RVCAG1A21G6EH","A3Q6CMXMGESPOG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3Q6CMXMGESPOG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In order to keep this review spoiler free, it's gonna be a short one. I've struggled with the thought of how to write it and not give anything of substance away  and even briefly considered NOT writing a review, but that's against my nature. So, here we go...Layla, Roth, Zayne and the rest of the Dark Elements crew are back with the third and final book in the series and there's a lot more at stake besides who Layla will end up with. The Lilin is on the loose. Layla is changing. Bad things are happening across the city. While I won't say the action is non-stop, I will say there's A LOT of it in this book. When it's time for you to read this one, make sure you set aside a few hours. You won't want to put it down. I didn't. I actually refused to even cook dinner. Pizza delivery FTW! But I digress.I absolutely loved the world Jen built in this series and how she really showcased it during this book. Some of the unknowns were wrapped up in surprising ways. We get to see a whole new side to the familiars. The romance was fantastic. And above all, the character growth was incredible. Each of the characters has really come into their own since the beginning of this series, but no one perhaps more than Layla. She's a strong, kickass chick and that's one of my favorite things in books.I can't say enough how much I loved this series and appreciated this ending. Not only was I pleased with how the love triangle wrapped up, I was completely engrossed in the non-romance storyline. I laughed and cried, because Jen has this way of giving you the feels but off setting it a bit with humor. And trust me, this book had plenty of her trademark humor. It also had some pretty emotional moments that left me reading for tissues... and wine. I truly do hate giving up these characters and this world  which is a lot more interesting than the real DC  but I'm happy knowing they're all in good hands now. I loved Jen's words on Facebook after the release of this book and can't think of a more perfect way to close out this review...""I think it's a good time to remind you that stories never truly end. Even when you get to the last book in a series and come to the very last page, and have experienced all the ups and downs, the characters and everything you felt while following them on their journey, live on. They never go away, and when you're ready, they'll always be waiting for you to come back to them.""","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R36VSI1EAQPG34/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00P5QJ212#wasThisHelpful","R36VSI1EAQPG34","A3Q6CMXMGESPOG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3Q6CMXMGESPOG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've always enjoyed Nazarea's contemporary novels, so I wasn't at all surprised to find myself completely hooked on the characters and the story from the first few pages. I tend to avoid books where the main character is struggling with any type of memory loss. I just find it so horribly sad. The way this one was told, however, in the alternating Before and After, softened the blow. It was still emotional, but not overwhelmingly so.I really liked both Rike and Peyton. Though, if I'm being honest, I liked Peyton more in the Before and Rike more in the After. However, I always liked them together, whether in Before or After. I enjoyed watching them get to know each other in the Before and Peyton try to get to know herself in the After. I don't want to say much for fear of ruining this story, but I thoroughly enjoyed them together. The secondary characters were pretty incredible, too. Now, I never got as much of a feel for Lindsay as I did Scott, but somehow this foursome was just perfect. Scott I loved. He was a little bit of a jerk sometimes, but there was no doubt how much he cared about those closest to him.Before & After was a relatively quick read. Once I got wrapped up in Rike, Peyton and the struggle they were facing, I couldn't stop reading. It ended too soon for my liking (but only because I'm a greedy reader) but with a final sentence that packed an emotional punch. (I love perfect last lines in books.) This book was gritty and it wasn't without some seriously emotional moments. The love scenes  which they were plenty of in the second half of the story  were sexy to the point of being downright dirty. (And you know I love a good dirty talker.) I loved how Nazarea worked in poems and songs to the story. They were beautiful touches to an already fantastic story.There were only a couple things I struggled with in this book and, while one might be a little spoilery, I have to mention it because it's something I feel strongly about. In the Before, there's a moment where reformed manwhore Rike gets annoyed with Peyton and decides he needs to sleep with someone else. WHY WHY WHY?! Why do we do this? I seriously considered putting the book down at that point, regardless of how much I was enjoying it up until then because that is right at the top of my literary no fly zone. There are few things that will turn me off to a book more than the guy (or girl) screwing someone else because they can't have/are mad at/other reasons the person they're interested in. UGH. It seriously makes me both ragey and twitchy and that's a bad combination. But, I am glad I soldiered through. This was the first time I saw what an amazing friend Scott was and how he really wasn't quite as selfish as I thought from previous scenes. Rike did have to work to get me back on his side though.The other thing I struggled with is something I'm not even sure I should mention, but I will anyhow. I started off reading this book in eARC format, but there were a large number of grammatical and spelling errors. (I know, I know, we don't judge books by their unedited ARC and I would never base my rating on that.) I can usually force myself to look past them, but I was struggling with that here. Before I reviewed the book, I wanted to make sure they had been fixed in the final version  plus I was looking for an easier reading experience  so I bought it off Amazon and read the second half in final format. It was a smart move on my part. SO much more enjoyable and I found it even easier to get lost in the story that way.So, despite the one moment where I wanted to throw my iPad across the room, I thoroughly enjoyed this book. It was easy to fall for the characters and cheer them on through the ups and downs. Plus, I'm a sucker for a good second chance story and I loved how the second chance was intertwined with the initial falling in love. I flew through this book. There might've even been tears. I do hope Nazarea writes more about Scott and Lindsay. I could use a good follow-up novella, at bare minimum, to see what happens with them.I received a copy of this book from the author in exchange for an honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2TRJP7NDCT1DZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012UGFF2O#wasThisHelpful","R2TRJP7NDCT1DZ","A3Q6CMXMGESPOG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3Q6CMXMGESPOG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When I first heard Christine and Laura were collaborating on a new adult series, I was over the moon. Christine's Hooked is one of my favorite books of 2015 so far and I thoroughly enjoyed Laura's Past Heaven. I just knew these ladies would combine to make something special.I was drawn to Taren and Alec immediately. (Alec probably more so because it's a little tough for me to relate to the Greek lifestyle. But I digress.) I liked that they had history, even if it wasn't necessarily pleasant history. But, I'm a sucker for a second chance story and I couldn't wait to see them get theirs. I suspected there would be some drama and controversy as they were approaching college with completely different priorities  Taren's focus being on parties and fun with her sisters and Alec's being on remaining alcohol free and finally doing something HE enjoyed instead of what was always expected of him. Despite their differences, or perhaps because of them, they fit together really well. They balanced each other out and helped each other grow. And believe me, both characters matured and really came into their own during this book.When I started The Pledge, I didn't realize it was set at the University of Maryland. That was a surprise and I actually enjoyed the setting a lot more than I thought I would. (Sorry folks, WVU fan here. I take my rivalries seriously.) ;-) Since I live in the DC area, I've been to UMD a fair few times so it was easy to get the lay of the land, so to speak, and I find that always helps when I'm reading. (Otherwise I picture each campus looking like WVU and, well, that's just not realistic. Ha!) I also loved the idea of the Acroletes (aka Gymkhana, which I was more or less unfamiliar with before this book) and would totally drive to College Park to see them. I just might have to, as a matter of fact. So, hooray for introducing me to new things!At the risk of getting spoilery, but not too much... I was fascinated by the red string of fate. This, too, I was unfamiliar with before reading this book. (I've done a fair few internet searches since, however.) I really enjoyed this and liked how the authors wove it seamlessly into Taren and Alec's story. There was *maybe* a bit more drama than I would've personally liked between these two characters, but it still worked for me. Sometimes it's hard for me to put myself back in the shoes of the characters I'm reading when they're that much younger than me. I often forget just how important and dramatic EVERYTHING was when I was that age, too. I just have to remember to read through that lens and not through the one of a 30+ lady who has a little more perspective now. (But just a little.) ;)The Pledge is a great start to a new series. I thoroughly enjoyed reading it and literally couldn't put it down until I finished. It was totally a one-sitting read for me. I'm interested to see who gets the next book  I'm really hoping it's Alexis. She caught my attention in this book, so I'm anxious to get her story. (And, if I'm honest, I had some problems with Julie. She totally rubbed me the wrong way, but that's not to say that she can't be redeemed somehow.) I guess I'll just have to wait and see! Regardless I'll read it because I adore these ladies and their work.I received a copy of this book from the author(s) in exchange for an honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1JALOTN0F0YDI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012JMGSSE#wasThisHelpful","R1JALOTN0F0YDI","A3Q6CMXMGESPOG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3Q6CMXMGESPOG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I just love Karina Halles books. (Her contemporaries, anyhow. Ive been too much of a chicken to read her horror series. One of these days) I fell head over heels in love with Love, in English when I read it last year and Im thrilled it has spun off into whats essentially a standalone series. Love, in Spanish was a wonderful conclusion to Vera and Mateos story. Veras brother Joshs story, Where Sea Meets Sky, made me want to embrace my own inner wanderlust and travel the world (and, you know, hopefully find love in the process). With Racing the Sun, its time for Ambers story and I couldnt wait to learn more.We originally met Amber in Where Sea Meets Sky. I liked her character in that book, but she wasnt the main focus so I didnt form any strong attachments to her. In this book, however? I absolutely adored her. I found it so easy to get inside her head and experience the story from her perspective. She was a strong, smart woman and I found it really easy to be in her corner for the duration of the book. I loved her journey and how she matured over the course of this story.Derio. Oh, Derio. How does Karina write such amazingly complicated, wonderful men every single time? How can you not fall for the quiet, brooding, sexy older brother of your charges? As much as I loved this guy though, I also wanted to smack him silly at times. He was so completely clueless about how his actions affected Amber sometimes. His life was on hold for a few years because of circumstances out of his control, so I felt like he should have been more aware that he was pretty much doing the same thing to Amber.I really enjoyed how the romance progressed between Amber and Derio. It wasnt something that happened overnight, but over time. It felt real. It was romantic and sexy. I enjoyed their banter and the oodles of chemistry between them. Their love was complicated, but there was no doubt it was also real. This book was sexy at times, but it was also quite emotional. I was so invested in Ambers character and her relationship with Derio that there were definitely tears. This is definitely a book of the feel all the feels variety.Racing the Sun is another beautifully-written novel about complicated love and everything that comes along with it. Karinas writing style is such that not only do I feel every emotion the character is feeling, but its like Im right there with them. Her descriptions of the settings and scenery are so detailed, so vivid, that I dont even need to have prior knowledge of a place to be able to picture it fully. I just love her attention to detail when it comes to setting the scene for any one of her books. She always has a way of making me want to get a passport, jump on a plane and never look back.I received a copy of this book from the author in exchange for an honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R95W6S13RS3F0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00P42WTGC#wasThisHelpful","R95W6S13RS3F0","A3Q6CMXMGESPOG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3Q6CMXMGESPOG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Im not even sure where to start when talking about this book, but OH MY HELL, I loved it. Its near the top of my favorites of 2015 so far and if you made me choose, it would probably be my all time favorite M/M book. Yeah, its that good. Expect non-spoilery flailing ahead.I cant even tell you how quickly and fully I found myself sucked into this book. Theres something about a friends first romance that gets me every single time. After two chapters of Wesley and Jamies story, I couldnt even think of putting the book down even for a minute. I loved how we were teased with their backstory while watching them come face-to-face again after several years. I loved their chemistry and just knew things were bound to be hot and full of feels down the road as they and especially Jamie  struggled with their attraction and what it ultimately meant. These characters were both so real and it was easy to get wrapped up in their lives.I loved both Wes and Jamie so freaking hard. Wes mightve been out of the closet, but there was one thing he wasnt dealing with  his feelings for his (former) best friend Jamie. Wes didnt do relationships because he wasnt ready to give a part of himself to anyone else. Hookups are fine for him. Its not as though his heart didnt already belong to another. Jamie, on the other hand, was straight. Hed only had one gay experience and that was with Wes when they were younger. He had no real reason to believe he was anything but straight until he and Wes were face-to-face again. I loved watching his character growth as he came to understand himself a little better. Wes, too, had his fair share of character growth throughout this story. Reading along as they experienced all of this together was magical. It was real and raw  and not always pretty, but never overly angsty.While the main characters were phenomenal, the secondary ones were pretty remarkable in their own ways. One of the biggest highlights of this story, for me, was Jamies family. I loved them so hard. They were so supportive of Jamie in all ways and their reaction to his coming out warmed my heart in ways I cant even begin to explain. Not everyone has a family like this. I dont want to spoil anything for you, but just know to expect a couple totally heartwarming scenes with this group. Also of note is Holly. I wasnt so sure about her at the beginning but I definitely grew to like her so very much by the end of the book.While I never read a book solely because its hot and dirty, its often a bonus I thoroughly enjoy. Let me tell you  Him is freaking hot. The times Wes and Jamie are together are more than just sexy, theyre emotionally charged. Thats what I loved about it so much. The devil is in the details and Sarina and Elle did a *fantastic* job of writing the detail. And Im not talking about the description of events as much as the reactions and emotions the guys are going through. Gods, its just so good. Theres no denying the sexy times got my heart racing, but they also melted it a few times. It was obvious with every word just how much these guys felt for each other.I had incredibly high expectations for Him because I know how incredible Sarina and Elle are on their own. Every expectation was exceeded. Him was everything. This was pure brilliance and all I could ever want in a book. I laughed and cried. I loved the journey. And the sexy scenes? I legitimately thought my iPad would catch on fire. Smokin hot. I hope these ladies pair up soon for another book because WOW. I highlighted roughly half of this book because it was so freaking perfect. I could keep talking about this book forever. But really, you just need to take the time and experience it for yourself. Whether youre a fan of M/M or new to the genre, I think youll find something here to love.I received a copy of this book from the authors in exchange for an honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R15RL7AK730XM7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011LSLI9G#wasThisHelpful","R15RL7AK730XM7","A3Q6CMXMGESPOG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3Q6CMXMGESPOG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I mightve been late to the party that is Candis Terrys Sweet, Texas series, but I fell for this series hard and fast. I loved the small-town setting and the cast of characters. Ill definitely credit this series with my foray into the world of mass market paperback adult contemporary romance. Im totally addicted now.After four books and a novella about the Wilder boys and the town of Sweet, Texas, I was SO VERY READY for Jakes story. Im a sucker for a military hero and a second chance romance, so I was thrilled to find both in this book. I absolutely adored both Jake and Annie. My heart broke for him and the guilt he was carrying around after his time in combat. He was such a good guy and it was so easy to want better for him. I wanted him to find a way to deal with his guilt and live his life again. I knew he could do that with Annie. I loved this woman. She was so strong and determined, yet sweet and caring. She was a great mom. I loved how she fought for Jake. Their past was messy, but she never stopped loving him, even if she did push him away. Watching them work their way back together was wonderful. It was low on angst, big on heart and had me feeling all the feels. It was romantic and sexy and tugged at my heartstrings.I love standalone series. In most cases, I lack the patience to wait two or three books to get to the happily ever after for ONE couple. I much prefer a quick, sweet romance that gives me all the feels. Also, with standalone series you tend to get updates on your favorite characters from earlier on as the new books come out. Since the characters I read tend to stick with me and I always want to know more about them once theyre together, I love this. Candis definitely gave us a glimpse of the previous couples from the series in this book and it totally warmed my heart. And one of the biggest standouts for me was how she introduced a new and important character into the mix and made him part of the Wilder family. Of course, Im talking about Peter, the man Jared was in love with before his death. Ooooooooh boy did I get all emotional when he was brought into the clan. (Im doing it again now just as I type this review, as a matter of fact.) SO MANY FEELS.To me, Truly Sweet was utter perfection. I laughed and cried and, as much as I hate to say goodbye to this series, Im so incredibly happy with how it all wrapped up. The epilogue was pure gold. I cant imagine a more perfect ending. If I could give this book more than five stars I would.I received a copy of this book from the publisher, via Edelweiss, in exchange for an honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RTOWV7N2EOML6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=006235115X#wasThisHelpful","RTOWV7N2EOML6","A3Q6CMXMGESPOG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3Q6CMXMGESPOG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As I mentioned in my review yesterday for Again the Magic, I have quickly become a historical romance AND Lisa Kleypas addict. I can't even tell you just how much I'm enjoying her Wallflowers series (which, just in case you're curious, I'm currently on the fourth book) but I'm going to try.While I loved the way Again the Magic kicked off, in a way, the Wallflowers series, the real magic was to be found in this second book, when these four ladies make each others acquaintance and form their plan. I love swooning over sexy men in books as much as the next reader, but I get just as much pleasure from strong female characters. Annabelle, Lillian, Evie and Daisy are all just that. I loved the friendship they forged when they could've easily been considered competition. Their banter was brilliant. Each of them had their quirks, but together they made a fantastic team. There was no ""girlfriends behaving badly"" here either. These ladies had a GREAT, strong friendship and I really enjoyed watching it happen.The romance, of course, was all kinds of swoony and fantastic because what else would you expect from Lisa's books? Annabelle, as the oldest, is the first to find her match. It was an unlikely one at that. Annabelle was looking for love with a peer but found it instead with the self-made butcher's son, Simon. Annabelle had the tendency to be (more than) a little snobby, but I didn't mind much because I understood where she was coming from. Simon was wonderful. I'm a big fan of when a man relentlessly (and in a non-creepy) way pursues a woman once he's interested. I was rooting for them so hard.This book, and the series so far, is just fantastic. I'm completely enthralled with the characters, romance and overall story. It's sexy, swoony and has its fair share of humor and feels. I can't ask for anything more. If you're new to historical romance like me, this series is a fantastic place to start. But, be warned, you will likely decide to chuck your entire reading list aside and binge on these. I am. :) #noregrets","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2RE488L3JIZW6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000FC2KJ2#wasThisHelpful","R2RE488L3JIZW6","A3Q6CMXMGESPOG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3Q6CMXMGESPOG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"What I would have liked to know before I bought this EROTICA/PORN book. (Minor spoilers)THIS BOOK IS FOR ADULTS ONLY1. What type of book is it: adventure, action, drama, etc?  An erotic supernatural monster harem story.2. What is the story about, in general? The story involves Zack/Mary figuring out what the `big plan' behind all the coincidences in his/her life has been. Sadly, it might INVOLVE that plot but it's not ABOUT that. The book is about Zack/Mary and his/her friends exploring every possible erotic genre and fetish imaginable. The book, in essence, tries to break through almost every possible social taboo short of child pornography and incest.3. What/Who is the target audience? I believe the book is tilted towards a male adult audience. Females can enjoy it too, but they aren't the target. Nevertheless the story does touch on many fetishes.4. What are the erotica genres in this book? Major Emphasis:  Non-human (Fae, Were, Yeti, Vampire, Succubus). Lesbian sex. Heterosexual sex. Sharing. Swapping. Polygamy. Loving Wife (The wives DO have sex outside of the relationship. Often with people the husband never meets or knows.) Group sex. Minor Emphasis:  Fetish (Public bathroom sex, office Sex, watching, peeking). Debatable Emphasis: Transsexual (Magic changes genders, so it's not exactly a man dressing as a woman or a woman dressing as a man).5. How is the proofreading? Very few spelling errors or kindle format mistakes. Thus, its good.6. Do the characters evolve? Are they likable? The character development gets pretty shallow as the book descends into almost unrestricted smut and ego porn. There are some limits, but few. Zack does evolve, not because of action events in the story, but because he is changed into a woman and now explores his feminine side upon occasion.7. Do you have to suspend disbelief? The only real thing that threatened my disbelief was the introduction of the Grandparents. A book and change in this series and Grandparents suddenly pop up like whack-a-moles. They are mentioned in one liners, here and there, but never as ALIVE.Beyond that, I didn't take the book too seriously considering that it abandons non-erotic pretenses and engaging romance.8. Does the story keep its pacing?  The story gets pretty dull as it avoids exploring the vast dimensional universe that Zack visits. The adventure usually comes to Zack in the form of demonic/Arch-Demon attacks or requests to help with the sporadic rescue or tragedy. Like the previous book, most of the book story takes place at Zack's home or the mall. The Tarantula is a third spot.This book is not really about Zack's dangerous conflicts. It's about providing Zack and family the necessary credible scenes for sexual exploration and taboo breaking. As an EROTICA book, it considerably overreaches. As an ADVENTURE book, it's pretty dull.9. Is the book worth the asking price? This is a $5 book and closes on the upper level of standard ebook prices. Considered on its own merit, I would have liked to pay less. Since the first book is priced at 99 cents, the combo price is alright.In conclusion: This is a thematically shallow book that is very ambitious in its desire to break through reader taboos. It does this through Zack's character development and by sacrificing the inherent adventure possibilities in the vast dimensional world. Dangerous story conflicts are filler. They are used to provide credible reasons for Zack to explore his different genders and break through the mentioned taboos. The background plot calcifies under the constraints required to push the porn/erotica relations. Some readers might find credible romance strained because intimacy is shared with far too much ease to match the heartfelt proclamations of love. The proofreading is above average, with almost no spelling errors or kindle format goofs. The price is $5 which is merely `ok' for this story volume but, if combined with the 99 cents of the first book, remains cheap. This is a rather risky book. It explores so many erotic genres that many a reader might be offended at one time or another. A reader might enjoy the erotica if they try to read it with a very open mind. Story wise, it might not be involving enough to satisfy most expectations.2.7 Stars","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RKWGICRB3A8TY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NOAZI6E#wasThisHelpful","RKWGICRB3A8TY","A2K3ZMPJQ9WO8I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2K3ZMPJQ9WO8I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"What I would have liked to know before I bought this book. (minor spoilers)(Eventually... FOR ADULTS ONLY)1. What type of book is it: adventure, action, drama, etc? This is an urban fantasy romance harem story. It's also rather `slice of life' manga-ish. I was NOT aware of this when I began reading.2. What is the story about, in general? The story is about Zack. He is a down on his luck Shadow Walker that wants to find a job to pay the rent without going crazy. The job he finds turns out to be a door for self discovery with some light adventure, and a lot of sexy monster girls.3. What/Who is the target audience? Young adults and those with a penchant for harem manga genre.4. How is the proofreading?  Average. I have found some spelling mistakes and a ton of Kindle format errors. The combination of `goofs' is not glaring but does permeate the entire story.5. Is there character development? Evolution is slow but it is there. The main character is written cute, funny, VERY wounded, generally submissive, powerful and kind to a fault. He is the other side of the `bad boy' passion stereotype. In short, he is almost Tenchi Muyo (manga character) in his qualities. These qualities are there from the very beginning, but the reader slowly explores them through the book. I am not sure if it should be called character `evolution'. It's more along the lines of character `exploration'.The characters began to blur together for me. There were simply too many to keep track properly. Twice, I had to backtrack to figure out who a secondary character was. Also, most of the women are `drum roll' babes or almost babes. It made me wish for a dumpy grumpy female protagonist of some kind.6. Are the characters likable?  It's a light romance harem story. That only works if the protagonists are likable.  There is a level of compelling perversity about the whole set of relationships because ... ehem ... its one guy and a lot of women ... and they don't mind sharing.7. Do you have to suspend disbelief? Any idealistic world where loving partners easily, willingly and without malice share their intimacy with others strains my disbelief. I am not saying it doesn't happen. I am saying that it MOSTLY doesn't happen. Lastly, I found the marriage thing supremely ridiculous. That's all I'm going to call it, `marriage thing'. I have a MINOR spoiler tag and think this is as far as I can push it. I wish it had been funny so I could laugh about it.8. Does the story keep its pacing? This book has a very interesting supernatural premise that is used as a basis for a male fantasy harem story. The books focus is soft erotica. The story is not based around pornography but it IS based around sexual tension, and eventually involves sexual acts. Though I don't mind some 'ego porn' (scenes were the protagonist is lauded with praise or admired) the book is eventually clogged with far too much of it. Most of the story takes place in two places: a mall and an apartment. Thus, if there is any doubt, this book is NOT an action story. It has some action events, but those are merely used as tension building devices to stroke the `ego porn' aspect of the story.9. Is the book worth the asking price? It is a 99 cent ebook. That is very cheap for a 550-600 page book.In conclusion: This is a very slow soft erotica urban fantasy harem book that focuses on sexual tension and some soap opera drama. Eventually, two scenes are so explicit they cross the line into full porn/erotica. The main protagonist's abilities and the world building might intrigue some readers. As the erotica and ego porn increase, readers might grow less enchanted with the story because most of the action seems injected not for itself, but for the cuddling and hugs afterwards. The fertile ground for grand adventure is left mostly, but not completely, fallow. Events grow increasingly hokey until swift changes near the end of the book finally clip the 'hokeyness' to manageable levels. This might be too little too late for some readers. There is very little that will interest readers outside of the `boy fantasy` or 'monster erotica' target audience. The proofreading is average because of kindle formatting errors, missing words, switched words, etc. The price is VERY cheap. Regardless of my disappointments, I was entertained by the story to the point that I think it is a slightly above average `ok' read. If you're the target audience, give it a try. It won't break your bank.3.1 Stars","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3FV44C7TIXGLB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NOATVX0#wasThisHelpful","R3FV44C7TIXGLB","A2K3ZMPJQ9WO8I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2K3ZMPJQ9WO8I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"What I would have liked to know before I bought this book. (no spoilers)1. What type of book is it: adventure, action, drama, etc? This is a sci-fi alien invasion survival thriller.2. What is the story about, in general? The story is about the adventures of a small group of scientists and U.S. Marines that find themselves among the very few survivors (less than 10) of an alien invasion.3. What/Who is the target audience? Teenagers, young adults and alien invasion aficionados.4. How is the proofreading? The kindle version suffers from a lack of scene divisors. The fact that you don't initially know when a scene begins or ends, trips the reader up considerably.5. Is there character development? We get to at least know the characters. Their personalities are unchanging, without evolution. On top of that, the conflicting personalities have a predictable diorama that could have been picked from any multitude of movies. Almost none of the protagonists show more than cursory pain at the loss of their loved ones. It made the characters incomplete, almost vaguely robotic. The only prevalent worry of planetary death is emphasized at every opportunity. Not too shabby on this point.6. Are the characters likable? So-so. I don't find most of the characters particularly immature. I find their actions logical, if lacking the deepness of truly rounded individuals. I like that the characters make believable mistakes. Some of those mistakes felt dumb, but were in line with the stress of the situation. Of all the characters, the Marines were the most entertaining. They were the ones actively involved in pushing the overall conflict thread forward.7. Does the story keep its pacing? This is the part that hurts the story quite a bit. Most of the read is rather dull because it is predictable. There are maybe three action scenes that were interesting. The rest of the time, I was able to telegraph exactly what was going to happen chapters ahead of time. I didn't need to read the content. I actually tested this by coming on to a crucial point, analyzing the tendency of the story and simply skimming ahead. I was spot on. The ending, admittedly, was NOT exactly predictable. Yet, that was the one point where the story should have had some amount of predictability. In short, the ending was very unsatisfying.8. Do you have to suspend disbelief? A LOT of logic errors, moments of improbability and other factors strained by disbelief. ****For the sake of not providing spoilers in the review, I am going to list all these points on a comments thread.****9. Is the book worth the asking price? It is a 99 cent ebook. There is no reason at all to not purchase the ebook and give it a chance. It is less than a bottle of water.In conclusion: This story is a mixed bag. In one hand the story experiences a rather dull and predictable series of events. These -do- manage to remain within the scope of the story's alien invasion. On the other, it has good moments of action that sporadically inject energy to the dull story. Most characters don't evolve beyond the range of their initial roles and lacked the scope of well rounded personalities. The dialogue felt mature, but the predictability made it a little inconsequential. The ending, honestly, is disheartening because it is the sort of thing that should happen MIDST book, not at the end. The proofreading is good, except that there is ZERO indications of when a scene ends and another starts (kindle format). The price is modicum at 99 cents. In short, this is an 'OK' story, with serious kindle formatting problems, a bland ending and generic protagonists.2.6 Stars","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R79WGGG0Y5EE5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00K3NEE6K#wasThisHelpful","R79WGGG0Y5EE5","A2K3ZMPJQ9WO8I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2K3ZMPJQ9WO8I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"What I would have liked to know before I bought this book. (minor spoilers)1. What type of book is it: adventure, action, drama, etc? This is a fast paced superhero action thriller.2. What is the story about, in general? The story is about Mathew, a normal yet brilliant man with a vicious tumor that decides to roll the dice by scheming his way into a superpowered death match, in order to earn the money to be cured.3. What/Who is the target audience?  Superhero fans, comic fans, young adults and teenagers.4. How is the proofreading? I didn't notice any spelling errors. Good job.5. Is there character development? No. The characters have very static roles. The main protagonist doesn't face any real moral dilemmas. Sure, he had to overcome difficult trials, but every single life and death encounter, except for one, had little moral ambiguity. The main character, literally, only kills the `blood thirsty' players. He never has to contend with the dilemma of killing or fighting someone that doesn't deserve it. He has difficult hurdles but not difficult choices. He is also rather generic. Frankly, he's a little unimpressive. Except for the love interest, I find all secondary characters lacking in depth. Regardless, they support the main protagonist in a compelling manner.6. Are the characters likable? Sure, the main protagonist is likable. Understand that the main character's affliction is an almost exact carbon copy of John Travolta's role in the movie `Phenomenon' and move on from there. You will find analogs for Superman, Shadowcat, Silver Samurai, a dumb Franklin Richards, an evil Quicksilver/Flash, Colossus and Giant Man, among others. The character clichs are obvious but they are done in a somewhat compelling manner. They somehow didn't break my story immersion. Understand that the reader doesn't really get to know these characters very well. They serve a role and are discarded. At most, they felt like distant acquaintances.7. Does the story keep its pacing? Yes. It is a royal rumble. What's not to like? Having said that, the book was rather cookie cutter and sanitized. The story doesn't take any real risks with the main character. The protagonist enters a death match and only kills the ones that perfectly earned their deaths.  I wish the story had taken at least ONE real risk, but it doesn't. Either way, it was entertaining. I can't say I was bored. This book moves pretty fast.  Every single twist and turn that this book is able to deliver, I have seen elsewhere. I mostly knew who would defeat whom and how. Perhaps someone with less reading experience will be surprised. I welcome their rush of discovery.A bright note is the light romance. It was actually well done, relaxing even.8. Do you have to suspend disbelief? Yes. There wasn't any real brilliance in how the protagonist went about fighting in the deathmatch. In fact, the tactics were very predictable. My disbelief is challenged with the convenience of coincidences that allows the protagonist to have the PERFECT ally, with the perfect weapon, at the perfect time and in a perfect position.  I count at least 5 coincidences in a row for that to happen.9. Is the book worth the asking price? The ebook is $5 and is within the range of a standard read. It's not an excessive price.In conclusion: A story with a world premise that is very interesting but that does not take any risks. The main protagonist faces no compelling morally ambiguous or ethical contentions. The most glaring moral ambiguities conveniently fix themselves. With one or two exceptions, most supporting characters lack enough depth to be deeply memorable. The light romance manages to be both sweet and enjoyable. The flow of the story is pretty fast and steady. The action is well written, if not very surprising. The price is $5 and approaches the high end of standard ebook prices. I didn't notice any spelling errors as the fast pace kept my attention moving. In short, the merits of this read hedge out the weaknesses with enough style to be entertaining. I think most readers will have some fun.3.1 Stars","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R65WF7S1KH5GQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00E55QLO0#wasThisHelpful","R65WF7S1KH5GQ","A2K3ZMPJQ9WO8I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2K3ZMPJQ9WO8I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"What I would have liked to know before I bought this book. (minor spoilers)1. What type of book is it: adventure, action, drama, etc? This is a military sci-fi action story.2. What is the story about, in general? The story is about Jeffrey, his son Leif and Stacey. The three are embroiled in a crazy conspiracy that will endanger local space.3. What/Who is the target audience? Teenagers, young adults, fighter pilot aficionados, military sci-fi aficionados and those who enjoy the strangest conspiracy theories.4. How is the proofreading? I didn't see more than two errors the entire time.5. Is there character development? Yes and no. The story timeframe is pretty short. Because of this the reader doesn't really evolve with the characters. How much evolution can a character do in one or two weeks? Of all the protagonists, Jeffrey is the only one that stands out as a three dimensional character in more ways than one. We have a compelling physical description, a skill set, a particular way of looking at events and experience. Leif lacks description and feels generic. Stacey is the typical clich babe with the tough background that makes her more appealing. Frankly, all characters beyond Jeffrey are pretty shallow. Antagonists are one dimensional in extremis for most of the read. Their character evolution comes too little too late.6. Are the characters likable? Yes and no. Jeffrey is likable because he is the only one that feels `real'. The other two main characters I can only describe as `fuzzy'. It's like I can't quite picture them as people, more like generic frames. They aren't unlikable, but they don't instill a sense of investment. The antagonists are probably the worst of the lot. They are (forgive me for the childishness) lame. I felt more entertainment, even more respect, for the generic one dimensional scene fodder goons than the actual antagonist leaders.  The antagonist leaders are crazy. I don't mean `compelling story' crazy. I mean `how the heck can these crazy nuts tie their shoe laces together' sort of crazy.7. Does the story keep its pacing? I would say that the story kept its focus for about sixty percent of the book, according to kindle. I enjoyed the manner the book began. We're thrust into the middle of the story with a bang. It was great. I loved the aerial combat descriptions and the mentality behind them.I lost significant reader immersion when I realized what the whole big conspiracy was all about. The execution lacked the most basic appeal to me.8. Do you have to suspend disbelief? With regards to the events involved, yes.Two scenes felt slipshod and farfetched in the first sixty percent of the book. Those were mere irritants that added some spice to the story, even when they felt forced upon it. There are, at least, three different logic errors that stress my disbelief as they would affect story resolution.The main conspiracy in the tale is so farfetched, so insane and so out of proportion to logical thought that it may break reader immersion. Considering how crazy humans can be, I don't doubt people may believe the craziest things. I simply cannot believe the scope and reach of this particular conspiracy. Though some nations might have leaders whose political and popular ideals support twisted insanities, those leaders in question have dedicated secular and religious mechanisms that uphold those illusions (North Korea's god ruler comes to mind). The antagonists in this book do not have such mechanisms and have regardless been able to build a powerful network of cult fanatics that's similar to the Scientology infiltration (Operation Snow White) of the U.S. government in the 1970s.9. Is the book worth the asking price? I had a lot of fun for about sixty percent of the book and the volume costs around $4. Give it a shot. At worst you'd be out a movie popcorn bag.In conclusion: This book is a roaring military sci-fi story with thrusters that sputter before reaching the end. The main conflict point lacks the necessary background to make the conflict both compelling and believable. The lack of background builds a frivolous base for the fun military action. As the story progresses, the action become increasingly convenient, evolves faulty logic and incredulous coincidences. The main protagonists are `ok' but merely `ok'. The antagonists are severely underwhelming. The price of the book is good at $4. The proofreading is well above average. Well done on this. The book, regardless of all its faults, still manages to build a somewhat interesting weave that makes it impossible to completely dismiss it. To me, it was a slightly below average experience that almost, but not quite, pulled it off. I will consider reading the next installment, but will definitely have to think about it. Nevertheless, this author really does have a ton of potential.2.8 Stars","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1O8NTVUNQOZ42/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005IR0N70#wasThisHelpful","R1O8NTVUNQOZ42","A2K3ZMPJQ9WO8I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2K3ZMPJQ9WO8I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Since this is a rather well established book, with a lot of reviews, I'm going to forgo my usual point by point review format for the sake of brevity.Zero Sight is written with an interesting prose and verse. It feels both artistic and humorous. The young adult main character has a compelling sense of wit, perspective and wryness that charms and exasperates in equal measure.The book doesn't really 'DO' much. You won't find an epic struggle for the fate of the world. In fact, a good portion of the story is taken up with detailed peculiarities of magical perception, wonderfully excessive verbosity and wry commentary. It is one of the few reads where most of the verbosity is entertaining enough to forgive its detraction from the story pace.The story itself revolves around the main protagonist acclimatizing to the new world he's in. It's a book of learning and understanding. There won't be a lot of 'exploration' but certainly a good quantity of 'adaptation'.There are a few spelling errors from both kindle glitches and simple editing mistakes, but these are minor.This is a good book.3.8 Stars","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2B6G0W05QE8NU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004UB2WME#wasThisHelpful","R2B6G0W05QE8NU","A2K3ZMPJQ9WO8I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2K3ZMPJQ9WO8I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"What I like about this game.Its easy to get into with simple screen touch controls. The tanks look funny and non-threatening. That makes it a nice kids game because it all looks like cute ping-pong balls bouncing around. Even the sound reinforces that perception. The game, IMO, is rather short but has a lot of re-play value. It doesn't take any time to start blasting away, and the game doesn't require extensive training to get going.What I don't like about this game:There are a few odd bugs. Exploding enemy tanks, in the middle of their explosion cinematic, can sometimes send 1 ball your way. Found that odd.  Towers can be shot at range without any retaliation. Makes them too easy. No color selection for your tank. You're green.Wished the levels were more complex and difficult with extensive combat areas.Off the top of my head, this is all I remember about this game.  IMO, it is worth the effort of a download. :)","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3LYDNCDW4YALC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005FYBN1G#wasThisHelpful","R3LYDNCDW4YALC","A2K3ZMPJQ9WO8I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2K3ZMPJQ9WO8I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My observations on this package.1. The item came stamped from China. That was a bit of a surprise as I thought I was purchasing from USA.  Live and learn.2. I verified the quality of the roll brushes and have found some differences to the OEM ones. The metal grooves on the support rod of the smaller brush remove a larger amount of metal. The rod seem to be slightly thinner. The machining is cruder. That means the brush is weaker. The black plastic fans on the smaller brush are less sturdy then the OEM ones, more malleable.3.The side brushes were a pleasant surprise. They are much better made than all the replacement brushes I have seen. Instead of seeing a cut on the plastic and knitted brush strands, there was no cut and the strands seem inserted into a support inside the white plastic blades. VERY nice.As you can see, there are some good points, some bad points and a surprise.  I still think this was a good purchase, but the differences did provide me with some worry.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3NZE31XI1ZFNT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00F4PTW46#wasThisHelpful","R3NZE31XI1ZFNT","A2K3ZMPJQ9WO8I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2K3ZMPJQ9WO8I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"What I would have liked to know before I bought this book. (no spoilers)1. What type of book is it: adventure, action, drama, etc? This is an epic fantasy with a lot of military action and some small group adventures. It also has a lot of soap opera.2. What is the story about, in general? The story is about the 2nd Rebellion/War. Previous protagonists are now woven into a larger web. The story is not about -them- in the war, but about the war and them in it.3. What/Who is the target audience? Teenagers, young adults and high fantasy aficionados.4. How is the proofreading? There are some spelling errors, but not many. Was able to notice about three.5. Is there character development? With one singularly powerful exception, not really. The evolution of the main protagonists doesn't evolve in this installment. In this book, they use their learned lessons to push forward the epic fantasy. Most of the characters overcome difficult obstacles, but their emotional and personal sacrifices are minimal. I still cannot consistently keep in mind Miro's face or features. His description perpetually slips away. That's not good. It makes him generic. Killian has very little page time and matching character evolution. He's delegated to a secondary or tertiary role.The single powerful exception is Amber, of all people! Though her role is limited, Amber suffers through hell and comes out stronger in the end. Sadly, Amber is the 'defacto' archetype that needs to be rescued a few times. It gets repetitive.6. Are the characters likable? Yes and no. The story implements the 'virgin' pure archetype with most of the female protagonists. Almost none of them arrive in the story experienced with men. They are virgins until they bed the man, or one of the men, they love. Culture doesn't seem to be a factor. The men, of course, aren't so limited. They all exude the experience of ... well ... experience. I didn't understand why have that dichotomy.Last, in this installment the protagonists have evolved complexity but become unbalanced towards merits. Their flaws fail to resurface, as if they are forgotten.7. Does the story keep its pacing? There are a lot of clichs and HUGE jumps in time. I did not find those pleasing, but the book does keep focused on what it wants to deliver. There are enough epic battles and high adventures to keep me coming back for more.8. Do you have to suspend disbelief? I'm sorry to say, yes. There are clichs upon cliches and coincidences upon coincidences. Certain characters, no matter what distance apart they are, what si1tuation or what improbable adverse situations they find themselves in, WILL conveniently meet for the maximum theatrical and drama effect. That means that characters will meet, not only improbably, but at the precise window of convenient opportunity necessary for the most. The author doesn't take time to build a successive series of events that would lead to such meetings. They simply happen. Deal with the coincidence.9. Is the book worth the asking price? $4 isn't bad at all and giving the book a try won't break your bank.In conclusion: This is an epic fantasy story that is marred only by time jump pacing issues, massive amounts of clichs and awfully predictable or convenient scenes. To balance such, the reader is also presented with fast engrossing action scenes and moments of heroism. Epic battles will feed our need for affirmative heroic action. The light of hope shines bright in a dark world even as new threats crop up to engage our protagonists. Sadly, the attractiveness of the characters spans the whole gamut of levels; from the very compelling to the forgettable and bland. The antagonists continue to be singularly one dimensional in their rapaciousness, if clever in their goals. The price for this installment is $4 and is still within the modicum range. The proofreading is pretty good with almost no jarring spelling errors. I think the readers might enjoy this book, if they can successfully deal with the predictability of seriously telegraphed events, the cliches, and the coincidences.3.0 Stars","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RVQMSRHRIXR5R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HVF7OJ2#wasThisHelpful","RVQMSRHRIXR5R","A2K3ZMPJQ9WO8I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2K3ZMPJQ9WO8I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"What I would have liked to know before I bought this EROTICA/PORN book. (no spoilers)THIS BOOK IS ABSOLUTELY NOT FOR CHILDREN1. What type of book is it: adventure, action, drama, etc? This is an urban fantasy erotic supernatural thriller.  Wow, that's a mouthful of adjectives.2. What is the story about, in general? The story is about Ceridwen Brent, a brilliant thaumatology graduate researcher and her changing relationship with Lily, her half-succubus boarder.3. What/Who is the target audience? Adults who enjoy stories with a lot of lesbian, bisexual and kinky sex.4. What are the erotic genres seen or hinted at within this story? Predominantly: sexual tension (the hint of sex, but no sex), non-human (half-demon), lesbian, bisexual.  Minor:  MILF, sharing, older male/younger female, heterosexual.5. How is the proofreading? I think there are many sentence structures that could have been written better. On the first few pages you will notice tense errors (past mixed with present and such).6. Are the characters likable? Most character's are enjoyable in a superficial manner and sexy in their own way. They provide a general basic story among the raunchy sex innuendo or plain sex. Some are pillar characters for divergent branches of erotic naughtiness.There is character evolution but the changes are sometimes abrupt, chaotic, and ultimately resolved by (drum roll) sex, kinky sex or sexual related innuendo. Its pretty darn shallow. Then again, it's an erotica book. Enjoy it for what it is and you'll do fine.7. Does the story keep its pacing?  It all depends. The book targets particular kinky delights. If you happen to like supernatural non-human(Lily is half demon) lesbian sex, you might not be disappointed.One thing that is interesting about this story is that the sex is never very detailed. Instead of long drawn out sexual escapades, the author focuses more in the innuendo leading to it, brief descriptions and after the fact conversations. There are a lot of small scenes that `salt and pepper' the story with sex, but they are all small. It takes a little getting used to.A lot of the book focuses on what people are wearing. Some people will find it tiring, but I find it somewhat understandable. It's a book about erotica and what people wear influences reader naughty desires.The book does not completely abandon a plot. The reader will go through an investigation and some dangers. The investigation is very predictable, but at least it is an effort at some story within the porn.On a personal note, I find the world building very interesting, if a little dry. This is a pretty complex universe that has a lot to be discovered.8. Do you have to suspend disbelief? Considering this is a high magic urban fantasy sexual exploration book, I didn't take it seriously from the start. I read it as mindless hedonistic escapism.9. Is the book worth the asking price? As erotica is something that's very personal, you'll have to decide if you're willing to pay $3 to explore your own naughtiness.In conclusion: A shallow tale that does not completely abandon a story plot. The book is written to tickle the naughty sides of adult readers. The world building is interesting because of its vast untapped complexities. The antagonists are one dimensional and superfluous. The story is really not about confronting said antagonists. It is about Ceridwen's sexual awakening, personal awakening, magical awakening and the changing relationship with Lily. The price is modicum at $3. The proofreading needs some work, but isn't a deal breaker. I was entertained by this book, but I read it understanding I was not going to read a literary masterpiece and that not all the sexual escapades would be to my liking.3.0 Stars","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R10NGCFGU4MBGC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006IYIESW#wasThisHelpful","R10NGCFGU4MBGC","A2K3ZMPJQ9WO8I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2K3ZMPJQ9WO8I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"After reading a fascinating article about the role 5-HTP in balancing your mood and regulating stress levels I immediately ordered a supply.  Since your body cant get 5-HTP from food its really essential to supplement and these capsules are incredibly easy to take.  They are easy to swallow and have no aftertaste.These have been an amazing help during a very busy season.  Ive felt less stressed in general and have slept like a baby ever since I added these to my regimen.

"This scale pretty and that's pretty much all it has going for it.  It's slim and easy to store as well but it is very small and is really too small to be used as either a kitchen or postal scale.

"I love Philosophy's shower gels but this is not among my absolute favorites.  It's good and does smell vaguely of a Krispy Kreme glazed donut, but it isn't the best scent the brand has offered.  It's by no means bad, but just not as awesome as I've come to expect from Philosophy.  It foams up beautifully and leaves hair and skin smelling nice - as do all their shower gels - but there's nothing particularly spectacular about it.  It would be a good, rather neutral starter scent for someone new to the brand who does not want a strongly scented gel.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3KOXLVAV499FT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BK9TGIM#wasThisHelpful","R3KOXLVAV499FT","A2V2IA1P5MWP9H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2V2IA1P5MWP9H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am a huge fan of Dr. Perricone who recommends a daily dose of Acetyl L-Carnitine as part of a healthy weight management program.

Its really an amazing supplement that does an incredible number of things.I take my daily dose every morning with breakfast.

"I love my coffee and I want to be Earth friendly at the same time so these reusable filters are the perfect solution for my Chemex 6 cup coffeemaker.

These are incredibly sturdy so they keep all the grounds where they are supposed to be - in the filter and not in my cup - even fine grounds.I love that these provide a wonderful, pure tasting, smooth cup of coffee since there are no freaky bleaching agents or other chemicals used.There is a tiny bit of maintenance since these are reusable - boiling the filters before the first use and every month or so after that - but its super fast and they dry so quickly that its almost a non issue.I definitely highly, highly recommend these versatile and eco-friendly filters.

"This is a lovely blend of fantasy and dark reality with a cast of interesting characters.  Alison, Taron, Jeff, and all the others, while not entirely likable, were well written.The story does take a bit of getting used to as it switches around quite a bit but once you get used it you settle down and begin to enjoy the (quite crazy) ride.  Its certainly not your usual story and Alison doesnt seem to move the action along any but is sort of an observer of it all which makes this very different from most books.This is also a witty social commentary from the very first chapter.  The perspective is just slightly off so you really get to view events in a way that you may not have before and that forces revelations that you most certainly would not have had before.Overall this is an intelligent, well written book with a pleasant dreamworld feel that is sure to entertain.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RVUPAC01EPK8E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004KA9TTE#wasThisHelpful","RVUPAC01EPK8E","A2V2IA1P5MWP9H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2V2IA1P5MWP9H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I absolutely love this Garcinia Cambogia!  It was super easy to incorporate into my routine since I just take a pill while I'm preparing each meal of the day - breakfast, lunch, and dinner.  So easy to remember!Since I've been using this I've noticed a definite decrease in my appetite so I'm no longer snacking between meals or staring at the vending machine mid-afternoon.  My cravings for sweets has significantly decreased as well.  I've noticed that I'm just naturally not eating as many sweets as before and I don't even miss them.Between my decreased appetite and my new ability to pass up dessert this has made a huge difference in my life and I definitely highly, highly recommend it!*This item was received free for the purpose of testing.

"I have been taking these Alpha Lipoic Acid supplements for a while now after reading about its beneficial effects for skin and body in one of Dr. Perricones books and they have made such a difference!  I take mine with breakfast and dinner and its an effortless way to improve my skin.My skin looks fresher and firmer and Ive noticed a significant improvement in skin tone evenness.

"I was unable to limp through Eat, Pray, Love and had zero desire to see the movie so I was unsure how enjoyable of a read this would be but turned out to be reasonably good.The main problem was that I just did not care for the characters.  Alma was supposed to be interesting but she just seemed rather bland and just like the other five zillion other female characters set in the 1800s.  There was nothing compelling about her story and she wasn't particularly likable as a person either.  I just felt no emotional connection with her at all.  I frankly spent the entire book not caring one way or the other what happened to her. And her relationship with her husband was just too predictable that it was laughable, if I'd been able to laugh at that point.The writing was good but some sections went on and on and on.  There were just large chunks of the book that simply would not end.  Then, inexplicably, the story made a sudden time jump.  Sometimes it was months, sometimes it was years.  It was incredibly frustrating.Overall this was a decent read if not particularly wonderful.  If you've enjoyed the author's previous works I'm sure you will enjoy this as well however this is perhaps not the best book to introduce you to the author's work if you haven't read her before.","2.0 out of 5 stars","February 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R39LUT4N89O1U3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0143125842#wasThisHelpful","R39LUT4N89O1U3","A2V2IA1P5MWP9H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2V2IA1P5MWP9H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I thoroughly enjoyed the author's first book The Expats so I knew this would be equally good and it was everything I'd hoped for and more.The story was immediately engaging and left me wondering until the ultimate reveal about the identity of the mysterious author.  The revelation was brilliant, absolutely brilliant and left me actually saying ""Wow!"" out loud. It was that good.It was interesting to follow the story from the various character perspectives and see how things developed for each of them.  While I never really liked Isabel as a person she was a brilliant character and very well written.The level of suspense was consistent and had me hardly blinking as I read.  I felt every bit of the mysterious author's anxiety as events unfolded and it made the story that much more intense.  The manuscript tidbits sprinkled throughout were delicious little bread crumbs to follow as the story progressed and I couldn't wait until the next one appeared so I could learn more of the story.Overall, this was brilliant and a must read for those who enjoy suspense.  Fans of Steve Berry will thoroughly enjoy this.  I highly, highly recommend it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2LJN0WZO8ULEH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385348479#wasThisHelpful","R2LJN0WZO8ULEH","A2V2IA1P5MWP9H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2V2IA1P5MWP9H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I wanted to dislike this from the start since Mary was such a miserable human being but I just couldn't which is a testament to the quality of the author's writing.  She made even such a disgusting person as Mary not quite sympathetic, but at least tolerable enough to finish the book.  I did have many times when I wished I could smack the woman though.  I realize this is set in the 1600s but she's just such a horrible person even for the wacko Puritans that I was truly shocked.  Her behavior was simply unacceptable in many instances and I actually found myself hoping that she'd get sick and die.  I, of course, didn't want the Native Americans to kill her because I didn't want them to be punished but I held out hope that she would be shunned by her Puritan community upon her return and starve or freeze to death.  No, really, she was that despicable of a human being.  She had simply no redeeming qualities whatsoever.  What is possibly even more disturbing is that this was a kinder, gentler representation of her and in real life she was actually, if possible, even worse.If you can manage to get past your disgust for Mary the story is actually quite informative and interesting.  The interactions between the natives and the invading Puritans were well illustrated and clearly had a strong level of historical accuracy.  I've never been a big fan of the Puritans and this book made my dislike for them even more intense.Overall this is a solid read and I certainly recommend it but be prepared for some intense emotions as you accompany Mary on her journey.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3G55Y2MQ16M5O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0451466691#wasThisHelpful","R3G55Y2MQ16M5O","A2V2IA1P5MWP9H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2V2IA1P5MWP9H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am absolutely in love with these headphones!First, they are very lightweight, which makes them incredibly comfortable to wear even for long study periods or while watching movies.  The padding is super soft and I really, really appreciate the padding at the top of the band which makes them even more comfortable.  The ear cups are just the right size so your ears are covered to provide the best sound.  The sound quality is great for music, movies, and phone calls and its so nice to be able to go cord free!These were super easy to pair with both my iPad (iOS 8) and Mac (Yosemite).  They were recognized within seconds and I was listening to music within a minute of taking them from the box.  I love that the volume can be controlled directly from my keyboard when I'm using them with my Mac.Charging is ultra simple with the enclosed USB charger.

"After having a Misfit Shine and then losing it due to the poor wrist band construction I decided to give their Flash model a try in the interim until I can order an Apple Watch.  It's plastic so it does feel and look inexpensive but not outright cheap.  The plastic band is remarkably comfortable and fits snuggly.  There are also no sharp edges that stick out and catch on sweaters or coats anything.Setup was easy, you just pop the little circle in the band FROM BELOW.  I think a lot of people are having it pop out or having the band break because they force it in from the top.  It fits quite snuggly in the band and it's almost impossible to lose it since your wrist keeps it in place from below and the band does not stretch like the Shine's band does.Syncing with my iPhone running iOS 8 was super easy and took maybe two minutes the first time.  After that it takes maybe 30 seconds to sync when I want to see my updated stats throughout the day.  While this does not sync sleep data with HealthKit it does sync steps which is nice.  I would like to have it sync the sleep data, but I'm assuming that will come with the next app update.Step and sleep tracking is effortless.  There is no tagging, no nothing.  You just put it on and go.  It tracks sleep and steps automatically and is remarkably accurate.  If you do read or watch television in bed before you go to sleep it may think that you've already gone to sleep and add that to your sleep time though, which has happened once or twice to me but it's not a huge deal for me.I like that this is water resistant and can be worn in the shower, while washing dishes, etc.The only issue I have with this is the battery life.  It's supposed to last six months before changing the battery.  I've had mine for just under a month and have had to change the battery three times already which is incredibly annoying especially since I've lost entire days of information because I didn't know that the battery had died.  It may be that my unit just has a defect.Overall, this is a good quality device.  Due to the lower cost I'm not particularly worried about losing it and the water resistant feature is very nice.  If you're looking for an interim device to get you through until the Apple Watch is released this is it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1X3QNZ8HK3VMT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NIU9YEC#wasThisHelpful","R1X3QNZ8HK3VMT","A2V2IA1P5MWP9H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2V2IA1P5MWP9H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Id noticed lately that my knife set was becoming quite dull and that I needed to sharpen them so I purchased this great sharpener.Its quite small so it fits easily in a drawer when not in use.It is super easy to use and I sharpened my entire set of knives in a matter of a few minutes.

"My television is an older model with only one HDMI port so I need a switch to control all the devices hooked up to it.  This is the perfect solution.This is very slim and small and was tucked behind my television so there are no cords or anything visible.Connection was ultra easy.  It was just a matter of plugging the HDMI cables into the switcher and the switcher into the television.  It took all of two minutes.Everything works seamlessly.  Switching is automatic and effortless.  I have my Apple TV hooked up to the second port so when I want to watch it I just turn it on and the device knows immediately that it has been turned on and switches over to it automatically.  When Im done watching I turn off the Apple TV and it switches back to the regular input.Video and audio quality are excellent and you would never know that the line doesnt run directly into the television.I definitely highly recommend this handy little switcher.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R156866HZGY31D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OHHG768#wasThisHelpful","R156866HZGY31D","A2V2IA1P5MWP9H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2V2IA1P5MWP9H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is hands down the most terrifying psychological thriller that Ive read since Flowers in the Attic!  The author did a brilliant job of drawing you into Beths world and really making you feel her emotions both during her imprisonment and afterwards.It was a bit disorienting at first to have the point of view switch between Beth and Dominic and then Beth and her mother, but once I got used to it it really added a nice dimension to the story and provided room for Beths experiences to be fully explored from all angles.The author kept the tension high throughout and I found myself flipping the pages as fast as I could read them, wanting to find out what happened next and yet cringing at what I discovered.I definitely highly recommend this beautifully written and complex thriller!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1J2JPLTSBE4QJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PFQ65SA#wasThisHelpful","R1J2JPLTSBE4QJ","A2V2IA1P5MWP9H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2V2IA1P5MWP9H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"My wife is completely pleased, in every regard, with this wrist watch. (Yes, I know that that's redundant - but please read on.)I find it sometimes difficult to buy her presents. She is very critical, in terms of quality and style, of her possessions and she has a much better sense of style than I do.However, every day I check Amazon's ""Deals of the Day"" and I saw this wrist watch as well as others by this manufacturer listed at a very good price. Though I did not know if she would like it, wanting to buy her a gift, I took a chance.I initially ordered the Johan Eric Women's JE2200-09-001.9 Herlev Rose Gold Case and Peach Leather Watch with Diamond Accents which is very pretty but, immediately after placing the order, I took a look again and saw this one (Johan Eric Women's JE2200-09-001 Herlev Rose Gold Case and White Leather Watch with Diamond Accents) which I felt was even more elegant.So I canceled the first order and placed the order for this white one.I'm glad I did.When I gave it to my wife, she was immediately struck by its exceptional design. She has now been wearing it for several days and she notes that it keeps excellent time, the white color goes with everything, and it is very comfortable on her wrist. She also says that, in her opinion, the rose gold case is much nicer looking than 'plain' yellow gold or silver.The Johan Eric company makes a number of variants on this watch. Peoples' tastes vary and the choice of a particular style is, of course, a personal decision.But when I showed my wife all of the variants, she said that I had picked the 'right' one. It's not often that she is as pleased with a gift that I buy for her as she is with this one.I cannot comment at this time as to the longevity of the watch but it does seem to be made with a great deal of integrity plus it carries a two-year warranty. The leather watch band is first-rate and, as I stated, its time-keeping is excellent.Even at Amazon's regular price, in my opinion, it represents superb value for money.Therefore I can give this wrist watch an enthusiastic recommendation.Thank you for reading this. I hope it has been of some help to you.Lawrence H.

"In my opinion, there were only two conductors who never made a single bad record.One was Arthur Fiedler. But, due to the extremely large number of records he made, I doubt that we will ever see a ""Complete Arthur Fiedler"" box set. (Who could afford it?)The other conductor in this exalted group was Fritz Reiner.The Reiner box set under discussion here is an absolute treasure. I shall not discuss the music, performance, and sound quality themselves about which there have been many, many reviews and articles written over the years; these are easy enough to find if you are interested. And anyone reading this review (or who is interested in this set) almost certainly already knows the quality of the music, the quality of the performances, and the quality of the sound recording. (If you are new to Fritz Reiner and are going to hear his performances for the first time, well, I envy you: you are in store for a real treat! You'll hardly believe your own ears!)Suffice it to say that all of the above characteristics are nothing short of superb, even transcendental. There may be some recorded performances of the included works which equal Reiner's but, at least in my experience, none - NONE - which surpasses them.You will need the included book (well-printed and very informative) to see what is on the individual discs; the back of the sleeves (cardboard reproductions of the original LPs complete with original notes in minuscule-sized - yet easily readable - print) and even the face of the CD itself may not be complete (the labels on the fronts of the CDs show only Side 1 of the LPs from which the CDs derive).The box which contains the CDs itself is made of heavyweight cardboard, beautifully printed in color, and is very space-efficient. It will look nice anywhere you choose to put it.At a person's request, I have placed the list of the recordings in Amazon's Classical Music Forums section within the thread entitled ""New Fritz Reiner Box.""There will be some who will quibble about ""faults"" in the notes, ""faults"" in the remasterings, or ""faults"" in this or that. In my opinion, any ""faults"" in this set are trivial and really unimportant. (And when you hear the magnificence of the performance of the 'Eroica"" you won't give a d--- whether it is mono or stereo!)Several of the same performances/recordings of works are repeated on two discs because they originally appeared on two separate LPs (the 1812 Overture, for example) but to my mind this is of no consequence. Also Reiner/Chicago recorded several works on two different occasions; both are included in this set. [See the fourth Comment appended to this review for more details.]The CD sides are short; one is even less than 30 minutes (as was the original LP). Again, this is of no consequence, at least to me.My only ""quibble"" is that I wish this set had been released in hybrid SACD/CD format (or, even better, as 24-bit 192kHz downloads). But even that is a minor point to me as I already own the 17 Reiner discs issued as SACDs (and, if you have SACD playback capability, I recommend that you buy them too even though the sound quality on the discs in this set are superior to any earlier 'Redbook' CDs of the same recordings which I myself have heard previously).I could also mention that it might have been nice had Sony included the ""Carmen"" which Reiner conducted in 1951 with the RCA Victor Orchestra (Ris Stevens, Jan Peerce, Licia Albanese, Robert Merrill, a ""dream"" cast if there ever was one!). I believe that it was his only complete opera recording.All that being said, I'll recommend that you just don't worry about any minor ""quibbles.""I believe that you should just sit back and enjoy the music.I STRONGLY recommend that anyone interested in classical music BUY THIS SET. I believe that it will indeed become the one of the most important sets in your collection.A Personal Note: my parents gave an ""RCA Victor New Orthophonic High Fidelity Record Player"" (a blonde mahogany consolette on four legs) to me in the summer of 1956. It was my first record player which could play 33 1/3 and 45, as well as 78 RPM records. I can't tell you how happy I was. I thought it was the be-all and end-all of hi-fi!Though I had little money (being only 13 years old), I started buying records when I could. And I soon discovered that I had to ""sneak"" them in, something at which I became quite proficient (how about you?).On Sunday, February 17, 1957, my parents had some friends over and they all went out for the afternoon, leaving me home alone.Naturally, as soon as they left, I got onto my bicycle and rode across town to Dee's Appliances of Audubon, NJ to look at their records. (They sold records at 20% off list, in other words, $3.19 for a $3.98 record, a price irresistible to me.)An album cover caught my eye. It was RCA Victor LM-1999 Red Seal (SLP-13) and it was, of course, Fritz Reiner's recording of the 1812 Overture and other works. At that time I knew very little about classical music (I had never heard the 1812 Overture) but, because of that cover, I bought it. (Over the years I bought many albums because of the cover, almost always with similar luck! This cover is reproduced on two of the CDs in this set though it loses something of its impact in the small size.)With no one else being home, I was able to easily bring it into the house and play it.I loved it.I still have it.(Plus, over the years, I have acquired several stereo issues of it, now including the one in this set. That 1812 Overture performance, without cannon-fire and slightly abridged, is still the best performance of the work I have ever heard.)That's how I was introduced to Fritz Reiner. (Actually I had heard Fritz Reiner conduct before - I had the complete ""The World's Greatest Music"" on 78s and he conducted several of the works included - but, as the performers were not listed anywhere, I did not know this at the time.) So this one was my first ""official"" Fritz Reiner record - but by no means the last!There are other important record sets out there; the Arturo Toscanini: The Complete RCA Collection is one of them and there are many, many others. You wouldn't want to have just one classical set in your collection. Of course, you will also have a great many individual discs in a good collection but these sets are a convenient way to have music with some common thread (conductor, performer, composer, etc.) available to you in one place and at a relatively low price (and who cares if we have a few duplicates? Not me!).This Fritz Reiner-The Complete RCA Recordings one is certainly the new cornerstone of my own collection and, if you have read this far, I am quite certain it will become yours too. So I'll repeat: BUY THIS SET!Thank you for reading this. I hope it has been informative to you.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 15, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R39MY8JGQLARXU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BT70J0Y#wasThisHelpful","R39MY8JGQLARXU","A3GVXKCTFN3YDN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3GVXKCTFN3YDN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought a Garmin nvi 4.3-Inch Portable GPS Navigator-250W on December 4, 2007. Last year, 2012, I noticed that the internal battery would not charge completely. Recently the unit, though it worked when plugged in, would not work at all on the internal battery power (and, as I like to use this in 'walking' mode, battery power is necessary).Though I own three other Garmin units (all newer), I like this one and I called Garmin to inquire about them replacing the battery.I was told that Garmin no longer supports this model and will not work on it.Frankly, I think that this is disgraceful; my unit is less than 6 years old. This, in my opinion, bodes ill for my having confidence in Garmin. I do not know if the other major manufacturers, TomTom and Magellan, support their units longer. But I am unhappy with Garmin. (I certainly will NEVER buy one of their really expensive units if they do not support their own products for a reasonable length of time - and I feel that less than six years is NOT reasonable!)Fortunately, Amazon offers this Battery Replacement Kit for Garmin Nuvi 250W with Installation Video, Tools, and Extended Life Battery.. There are other replacement batteries for the 250W offered on Amazon but this one comes complete with all necessary tools and accessories (and believe me you'll need them, especially the small Torx screwdriver!). It also comes with an instruction CD; the video included on it is also available to view on YouTube if you want to see the steps before ordering.I do have to say that any resemblance of the internal parts of the unit shown in the instructional video and what I saw in my own unit is strictly coincidental.But, using a bit of common sense, it was fairly easy to replace the battery. Based on what I had seen on the video, most of what was in my unit was self-explanatory.But I did have some problems. Innovate88, the company which supplies this battery, includes a bit of double-sided tape to hold the new battery in place. Unfortunately, even with much 'language,' I was unable to pry off the backing on one side of the piece so I went upstairs and found some Velcro tape (two sections which hook together) I had bought and I used that in place of the supplied double-sided tape. It was easy to remove the plastic backing from that and both sides, when pressed together (one piece glued to the case and the other to the battery), are joined 'permanently.' (Of course, you may have more luck than I did in removing the backing from both sides of the piece of tape.)And naturally, at the very end of reassembling the unit, I dropped one of the tiny screws which hold the case together. More 'language' ensued, a flashlight was employed, and after about ten minutes or so, I found the screw. (This was my own fault of course, not Innovate88's.)Because of all that frustration (the double-sided tape and the dropped screw), it took me much longer to replace the battery than it should have. I can't even tell you how much time it actually took nor can I tell you how much time it would take someone less of a 'klutz' than I am to do it.But really it shouldn't take long. If your unit looks similar to the one in the video, I would say ten minutes tops. If not, then maybe fifteen minutes. (Just don't drop any screws!)Now, of course, the big question: Did it work?Well, if it hadn't, I wouldn't have given this replacement battery five stars. Since I did, you can pretty much figure out that it did indeed work, and it works perfectly.When I turned on the nvi, the indicator showed that the battery was fully charged. Even though the unit had no power connected at all while I was changing the battery, all of my Favorites were retained in memory. The only things lost were the time and time-zone settings. I manually set the time-zone to Eastern Time and the clock itself was set as soon as the Garmin located the satellites.I am extremely pleased with my purchase. Frankly, I had a lot of trepidation prior to buying this but I thought, well, the most I can lose is less than $30.00 so it's worth trying.I'm glad I did.One of my newer Garmins is the Garmin nvi 285W/285WT 4.3-Inch Widescreen Bluetooth Portable GPS Navigator with Traffic ('Traffic' is no longer supported but I never used it anyway); I also like this unit very much and I see that Innovate88 offers a battery replacement for it (Battery Replacement Kit for Garmin Nuvi 285W with Installation Video, Tools, and Extended Life Battery.). When the time comes, I'll buy one of these too.The Innovate88 company packed everything very carefully and shipped very quickly (two days from Texas to NJ). Therefore I highly recommend this product and this company.I hope that this review has been useful to you and I thank you for reading it.Lawrence H.

"When I saw this Nico New York 2 Tone Bracelet Set offered by Amazon Vine, I thought my wife would like to have it.Unfortunately, she is displeased (and that is the ""polite"" term).Please IGNORE the two-stars I give it; please read on for the reason for that rating.The following are my wife's complaints.First, the ""three"" bracelets are permanently entwined; they cannot be separated.Second, this bracelet is obviously intended for a large-boned woman. The size cannot be adjusted and, on my wife's wrist (which measures about 6 1/4 inches), when her arm is down, the bracelet slips down over her hand (which is also very small) and, when her arm is up, it slips halfway up her forearm.Plus it really does look much too large on her (she is 5' 4"").So, after trying it (and letting me know in no-uncertain-terms what she thought of it), it has been put back into its plastic pouch, there to remain.It is constructed of painted metal beads and looks to be well-made, considering the low price. The two-star rating is my wife's opinion of its styling, fit, and functionality, and her opinion does not consider its construction quality which, as I said, appears to be fine. Taking that quality into consideration (plus my own personal opinion of the styling), I myself would give this bracelet at least FOUR STARS (and a case could be made for giving it FIVE STARS). But I must defer to my wife ...To sum up, there are certainly some women on whom it would look good and who would like it, especially if they're tall and/or large-boned.Unfortunately my wife is not one of them.But, if you are, you might want to give this bracelet a chance. I think that it's nice.I hope that this review has been informative and of some help to you.","2.0 out of 5 stars","October 4, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3OX8R29JTB8SI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BIDCSTY#wasThisHelpful","R3OX8R29JTB8SI","A3GVXKCTFN3YDN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3GVXKCTFN3YDN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I ordered this Revlon RVDR5111BLKD Ultimate Snub Nose 1875 Watt Pro Styler for my wife. It arrived yesterday and she used it this morning.She is very pleased with it. She has been using Remington hair dryers of which she has three different models; the model she likes best of the three is this Remington D8410 Keratin Therapy Dryer.This new Revlon model is smaller than her Remingtons and much lighter in weight. This weight difference is immediately apparent and is very important to her. It's not as though that the Remington is inordinately heavy, but lighter weight does make for an easier-to-use hair dryer.However, the Revlon model has one fewer heat setting than the Remington. The Remington has three heat and two speed settings; the Revlon has two heat settings and two speed settings. Both have a cold-shot button.But the settings offered on this Revlon are all one needs, according to my wife. Like that Remington, the Revlon has rocker-type switches which are arranged very conveniently.This new Revlon model also comes with a concentrator attachment as well as a diffuser attachment, both packed in the box. The Remington comes with a concentrator and does offer a free diffuser attachment but, oddly, you must order it separately, rather an annoyance.Cleaning the filter is not nearly as convenient on the Revlon as it is on the Remington. On that model, you cannot lose the cap. Its clever design keeps the cap attached permanently. Not so on this Revlon; its snap-on/off cap could be dropped or lost, but, really, only if you are very careless.Both are fairly quiet, as these things go, but she always uses ear plugs when drying her hair, something she recommends to everyone.This morning she found that the warm (the lower of the two) heat setting and the high speed setting dried her hair very quickly and left it very nice (she has baby-fine hair). She said that most probably the low speed setting would have done just as well, though she did not actually try it.The light weight of the Revlon is most welcome but it does raise a question: the much heavier Remington comes with a four-year warranty but this Revlon has only a two-year warranty. We suspect that the extra weight may be a result of the sturdiness of the Remington's motor but of course we do not know this for certain. Nor are we certain if this will make any difference in real world longevity.However one thing is definitely certain: this new Revlon model costs just a little more than half of what that Remington sells for! Thus this Revlon hair dryer offers very good value for money.All in all, my wife is very happy with her new Revlon hair dryer. While it remains to be seen whether it will hold up as well in the long run as the Remington models have done, based upon her use this morning, which went very well especially due to the light weight of this hair dryer but also, most importantly, for the way her hair came out, she (and I) give this dryer our highest recommendation.Thank you for reading this.===============================================================================================================================================Update: March 19, 2014My wife likes this hair dryer so much that today she had me order another one as a 'spare.' We recently returned from a trip. She states that it dries her hair noticeably faster than any other dryer she has previously used which is why she took it along on our trip. As she always takes a 'spare' when we travel, she wanted another one of these to take along rather than one of her other older models which she had brought on this trip.Once upon a time when we were traveling, her hair dryer broke. ***Horrors!!!*** We had to quickly find a store and buy another one (which was whatever they had in stock and not what she wanted). So now she always takes two hair dryers with us which is why she wanted another one of these.She had been happy with most of her older models until she got this one. She has been using it constantly since September 2013 and it has become her favorite. So now, due to have two of them, she is a very happy lady! (She also says that its current price here on Amazon is a bargain.)We continue to give it our highest recommendation.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 22, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2J5HHRTQRKW66/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BV5EW8Y#wasThisHelpful","R2J5HHRTQRKW66","A3GVXKCTFN3YDN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3GVXKCTFN3YDN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The title of this review says it all: this truly is a superb USB to S/PDIF converter. And at its current price here on Amazon, it is a true bargain.This review will be of most interest to those who use a computer with a GNU/Linux operating system though much about the quality of this converter will be applicable to anyone.I have a home theater installation with, among other components, a Yamaha RX-Z9 9.1 Home Theater Surround Sound Receiver which I purchased new in 2004, a ZaReason MediaBox 5330 (a media center computer, purchased last year, running the Xubuntu Linux operating system) through which I can play music, movies, etc. and, of course, use it for whatever else one would normally use a computer), and ten (10) loudspeakers (including a subwoofer).The receiver has no HDMI inputs (it was designed just before the introduction of HDMI) but it does have digital sound inputs (both TosLink and Coaxial).I wanted to have the best sound quality possible in this system, for movies as well as music. I recently purchased a StarTech.com 7.1 USB Audio Adapter External Sound Card with SPDIF Digital Audio Sound Cards ICUSBAUDIO7D which is a fine unit and it represents very good value for money.But it is limited to 16-bit depth and 48kHz sample rate. Though the sound coming through it was really fine, I thought I'd like to have a converter which offered ""true"" 24-bit 192kHz output. (But, if you choose to purchase the StarTech unit - its price is only about 1/6 of the V-LINK 192 under discussion - you won't go wrong. I'm keeping mine.)I did some research on the web as well as here on Amazon and, as a result, I purchased this Musical Fidelity - V-LINK 192 - Asynchronous USB To SPDIF Converter.Its performance is nothing short of superb. And at Amazon's current price of half the manufacturer's list price, it represents outstanding value for money. (The unit is being sold by a company called ListenUp which sets the price; the orders are fulfilled by Amazon.)Now if you are familiar with GNU/Linux operating systems, you know that the default sound output is done by ALSA (Advanced Linux Sound Architecture). PulseAudio is also commonly used. The default digital USB output through ALSA is set to 16-bit 44.1/48KHz and that is true for PulseAudio as well.So when I placed this device in my system (no special drivers are necessary when using this in a GNU/Linux environment), according to its LEDs, I was hearing only 44.1 or 48kHz sample rate, no matter how the original (FLAC) file was encoded (I have several 24-bit 192kHz FLAC files).ALSA's sample rate, I understand, cannot be changed, but PulseAudio's can be. So I changed my sound output from ALSA to PulseAudio.I found the following instructions for Linux on the web (they're what you'll find if you search):Instructions to change PulseAudio sample rate in /etc/pulse/daemon.conf fileIn the Terminal, type< gksudo gedit /etc/pulse/daemon.conf >Then look for the following line:; default-sample-rate = 44100and change it to look like this:default-sample-rate = 48000Note:- Make sure you have removed the "" ; ""Save and exit the fileNow you will need to restart pulseaudio for that to take effect.To restart pulseaudio use the following commands in the Terminal:< pulseaudio -k >  and< pulseaudio -D >Naturally, when I did all of that, it did NOT work. (I had even restarted the computer.) According to the Musical Fidelity converter's LED indicator lights, my media center computer was still outputting only 44.1 or 48kHz. So, rather than giving up, I tried making some other changes.In the file there is also a second line which reads ;alternate-sample-rate = 48000 to which the instructions make no reference; at first I left it alone, then I changed that rate (only) to 44100 on my second try and then on my third try to 192000 (removing the "" ; ""). But these changes did NOT work either.I ""Googled"" the problem but found no answer.So I became ""creative"" myself.What I did was this:I followed the same (first two) initial instructions as given above:--- In the Terminal, type--- < gksudo gedit /etc/pulse/daemon.conf >--- Then look for the following line:--- ; default-sample-rate = 44100but I then edited the file so that the appropriate section looks like this:  default-sample-format = s24le  default-sample-rate = 44100  alternate-sample-rate = 192000; alternate-sample-rate = 176400; alternate-sample-rate = 96000; alternate-sample-rate = 88200; alternate-sample-rate = 48000; default-sample-channels = 2; default-channel-map = front-left,front-right(Notice that I ADDED four more lines (all with the "" ; "") - there had previously been only two, one default and one alternate - and I changed the default sample format from s16le, the standard default, to s24le as well. Also please note - very important - there are three spaces before the words 'default' and the first 'alternate' - unfortunately Amazon does not allow this to be shown. In other words, all of the words 'default' and 'alternate' are placed directly underneath one another.)Then I restarted the computer.NOW --- everything works! My 24-bit 192kHz files play at 24/192 and my 16-bit 44.1kHz files play at that level.This applies only to music played through the Audacious music player. If I play music with the VLC Media Player, the sound is outputted only at 48kHz (but I do not listen to music via the VLC player as it introduces gaps between the files; Audacious plays everything gapless). Movies are always at 48kHz - 48kHz is VLC's maximum so nothing playing in VLC is up-converted plus I left VLC's bit-rate setting at s16le - and the V-LINK passes full surround sound.I have to tell you - I have had my home theater for twenty years now and there have been many changes in electronic equipment within it over the years. But this change, with the Musical Fidelity V-LINK 192 as well as the changes in the PulseAudio sound settings, has effected a MAJOR improvement in sound quality. I can hear it myself by merely comparing music files played through the VLC Media Player (48kHz) compared to those played through Audacious (set to up to 192kHz) and even sound played via the analog connections.My son is a sound professional who lives on the West Coast and he will be coming to visit in late November. He has a better ""ear"" than I do and I am anxiously awaiting his visit so he can hear for himself what has been achieved. (I want his opinion on the whole thing!)In the mean time, I am enjoying music played in this home theater more than I ever have in the twenty years I've had the theater and I believe that this V-LINK is the ""key"" to producing the superb sound I am hearing.Obviously I give it the highest recommendation possible for me to give and I thank you for reading all of this.Lawrence H.

"I have a home theater in which I have a media center computer; this uses a GNU/Linux operating system (Xubuntu). Its default sound is good (it has a TosLink output) but I wanted something better, to wit, USB sound output. (This review will be of most interest to those who also use Linux.)I received this StarTech.com 7.1 USB Audio Adapter External Sound Card with SPDIF Digital Audio Sound Cards ICUSBAUDIO7D yesterday and I now have it set up.Frankly, it is not quite as easy to use as one might think; this has nothing to do with the product itself which is nothing short of superb. Rather the difficulties are due to the nature of your computer and just how knowledgeable you are about changing parameters.The default in almost all computers is for the sound to be routed through the computer's internal sound card to the line or headphone output jack. These are analog jacks. The quality of the computer's sound card determines the quality of the sound you will hear.Unfortunately, most internal computer sound cards are mediocre. Of course there are some which are superlative but these are few and far between (not even to mention very expensive).This little inexpensive device allows complete bypassing of the computer's sound card in favor of your amplifier or receiver. If you have a high quality one, it and it alone will determine the quality of the sound you hear (of course this also depends upon the quality of that to which you are listening!).As stated, I use a GNU/Linux operating system on my media center computer located in my home theater (it is a ZaReason MediaBox 5330 model with the Intel i5 processor and 16 GB RAM).Hooking this device to a computer is very easy. You merely take the included USB cable, plug one end into your computer, and the other end into this device.Then you connect one end of a Toslink cable to the S/PDIF output on the back of this sound card and you plug the other end into the appropriate Toslink connection point on your amplifier/receiver.Will you then immediately hear digital sound?No.First you must go into your sound settings section and change the settings from the default analog to the appropriate USB digital setting.After you do this, will you then hear digital sound?Again, no.You must go into the sound settings section of the programs you use to play media. In my case, I use three: VLC Media Player, SM Player, and Audacious.Each of these has its own settings menu (in VLC's case, you'll want to use the advanced menu rather than the simple one).Once all of THOSE are set properly, will you THEN hear digital sound?You bet!!!And it's just great. The sound in my theater, whether playing music (FLAC files) via Audacious, or movies (videos), especially ones with ""surround"" tracks, through VLC or SM Player, is so much better than the analog (surround) sound I previously used as to make such a comparison meaningless. There is no comparison! My wife can easily hear the difference and I would guess that almost ANYONE would hear the difference.DTS (regular or lossless)? Not a problem. Dolby Digital (regular or lossless)? Not a problem. 7.1 output? Again, not a problem.Just a pleasure!Why would I need a device such as this? It is because my receiver, a Yamaha RX-Z9, was made just before the introduction of HDMI connections. If you have a receiver AND a computer with modern HDMI connections, you don't need this. One HDMI cable will carry picture as well as audio. But if you want digital sound output from your computer, with all of its advantages, and your computer does not have an HDMI output, and/or you have a receiver which does not have HDMI but DOES have digital audio connections, then this is your device.And, at 33 bucks or so, it won't break the bank!It also has analog outputs which carry up to 5.1 analog channels if your receiver has those inputs. Naturally it will also output straight stereo. It even has a headphone jack as well as an analog line input jack. It's quite a versatile instrument!By the way, the changes in audio configurations I mention above apply to ALL computers regardless of the operating system (Windows, Mac, Linux, etc.). It may be a bit trickier to use with a Windows computer (a CD with the necessary drivers for Windows is included; no special setup is required for Mac or Linux) but it still shouldn't be too difficult for fairly knowledgeable people.Its specifications claim it supports 16-bit 44.1/48 kHz sound output. But I can tell you that playing a 24-bit 48 kHz sound file sounds tremendous. I played a ""record"" downloaded from a company called Pristine Classical. It has several pieces within it: all of the experimental stereo recordings made by Arturo Toscanini and the NBC Symphony, recorded in 1954. I chose to buy the 24-bit 48 kHz FLAC file and I played it through this device just this morning.I need not say any more than that it sounded as if it had been recorded yesterday!For all practical purposes, no one need worry about any ""limitations"" in this unit's specifications.Just please take my advice: if you are comfortable about changing parameters within a computer, or, if you know someone who is, or even if you are willing to spend money to hire someone who can install this properly, then by all means buy this item if you have need for such a device.If you are not comfortable, for any reason, then merely use the default sound settings of your computer. Frankly, they are adequate for many people.But I truly am extremely happy I bought this StarTech device. (It is not the first item I have bought from this company; in my experience, their products are first-class in every way.)I give it my highest recommendation for anyone who has need for it.Thank you very much for reading this.Lawrence H.

"I am enjoying my new Neptor 5600mAh 3.1A Output 2nd Gen Dual Port Fast Charging External Portable Battery Pack Travel Battery Charger for iPhone 5C/5S, iPad mini, Samsung Galaxy S4/S5, Note, Nexus, LG, HTC and Motorola - Retail Pack Includes Flashlight Color Matching USB Ca... which is made in That Country Where All Things Are Made.Its input voltage is listed as 5V 1.0A and its output is rated at 5V 2.1A + 5V 1.0A. Its capacity is a claimed 5600mAh.Note that while both outputs, the 2.1A and the 1.0A, can be used at the same time, if that is done the unit will throttle back the electrical output to a total of 2.3A. The instruction manual states that ""Concurrent use of the two ports will make the charging speed slower."" So unless you have an overriding need to use both ports at the same time, essentially this is a one-port battery pack.I charged mine up fully and attempted to power a set of speakers (Kinyo UC-270) which are usually powered via a computer's USB port (or an AC or DC USB adapter). Unfortunately, after about two or three minutes, the unit shut down. (I have a Verbatim 2,200 mAh Portable Micro-USB Power Bank Charger 97927 which does the same thing - it shuts down after powering those speakers for a while.) It's not that the speakers draw too much current, it is evidently something inherent in the design of these small external chargers; they may ""sense"" that they're not actually charging anything. A different external charger, mentioned below, has no trouble at all powering these speakers.But this little Neptor unit does power and charge (at the same time) my SanDisk Sansa Clip Zip 4GB MP3 Player (Blue) which is my primary use for it. It also charges my cell phone and works as well with that phone as it does with the Clip Zip player. (I have not yet charged my phone from ""zero"" charge so I can't tell you how long that would take. My cell phone is a LG Volt White - Prepaid Phone (Virgin Mobile).)As you may have read in other reviews, this device comes packed with a wrist strap. Why anyone would want to carry this battery pack around in his or her hand while having it secured with a wrist strap is beyond me. In any case, as you may have also read, the strap is very difficult to attach due to the fact that the lanyard is fairly thick and the hole through which you must thread it is ridiculously small. It can be done but, for me, it is not worth the effort. The wrist strap has been put back into the box where it will stay unless I come up with another use for it.This device also features a flashlight which can be used in an emergency in a dark room or outside at night to see your door's keyhole, a nice touch. Unfortunately it is not adequate for use as a regular flashlight.I charged my Neptor fully exactly two weeks ago. Of course at this time I cannot state whether it will hold 80% of its charge after one year but if I do not actually use it for one year, I'll report on this claim.Like the Verbatim pack I mentioned above, this unit does not come with any case or means to carry the USB cord and the unit itself together conveniently. Fortunately we have a ""dollar store"" not far from us where I bought a semi-hard side ""camera case"" which holds both of the items together (I did the same for the Verbatim).Overall, while in my opinion, this is a very good unit and can be recommended, in view of the fact that it actually needs to sense that it is charging something (not merely powering an item), there is another one you may wish to consider - the rather ungainly Burro Mobile Charger - AA-Powered, USB Power Pack - Building Better Lives in Africa which, even considering the extra cost of 4 NiMH rechargeable batteries and a charger, is less costly than this neptor one. (Even if you buy two sets of rechargeable batteries, the Burro's cost is less.) This Burro has its own set of, shall we say, anomalies but, in my opinion, it is an excellent external phone chargers and it powers my Kinyo speakers as long as I need; I have run them several hours and I still had battery power left. While this will not be important to most of you, it is to me.So, in conclusion, again I'll state that I do indeed recommend this Neptor Model: NP056K external battery charger but I do suggest that, if you have need for something which can power a device but not actually charge it, you investigate some others, especially that Burro model I mentioned. But if that is not a concern, then in my opinion you can't do much better than this Neptor 5600mAh 3.1A Output 2nd Gen Dual Port Fast Charging External Portable Battery Pack Travel Battery Charger for iPhone 5C/5S, iPad mini, Samsung Galaxy S4/S5, Note, Nexus, LG, HTC and Motorola - Retail Pack Includes Flashlight Color Matching USB Ca....Thank you for reading this and for considering my opinions.Lawrence H. Bulk==========Update: December 30, 2014I had put this device away in the fall of 2013 and had not used it since. Yesterday I took it out of its case, turned it on, and discovered that it had actually held most of its charge, supplying enough power to fully charge my Sansa Clip-Zip (which was almost 'flat') as well as my LG Volt cell phone and, after all that charging was finished, three of the four indicator lights still remained lit.I was amazed!This is truly excellent performance and I can now wholeheartedly recommend this Neptor device to you.Thank you again for reading this.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 2, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2FT5G8YXNC92D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00D37M34I#wasThisHelpful","R2FT5G8YXNC92D","A3GVXKCTFN3YDN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3GVXKCTFN3YDN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Back in 2011, I bought an LG BD630 Network Blu-ray Disc Player from Amazon. (At the time it sold for $87.99.) It is a very nice Blu-ray/DVD/CD player but it does not have Wi-Fi capability. It must be connected to the Internet via an ethernet cable.(We have Verizon DSL and use an Actiontec 300 Mbps Wireless-N DSL Modem Router (GT784WN).)Unfortunately I have the player in a room on our second floor and our router is on the first floor. Until now, if I wanted to connect the unit to the Internet (for example, to utilize its Netflix and other Internet services), I had to run a 50-foot cable, not the most convenient (or elegant) solution.This ACTIONTEC 500 Mbps Powerline Ethernet Adapter and 4-Port Hub Kit (PWR514K01) has come to the rescue.It works PERFECTLY.Not only that, but it is extremely easy to set up. I shall go so far as to say that if you can read and comprehend the English language and if you have enough technical acumen to be able to change batteries in a flashlight, you can set this device up.It took longer to unpack it from its box than it did to connect my Blu-ray player! (It will take you longer to read this review than it will to set it up!)It is packed with everything you need in order to connect one device. If you need more than one connected to it, all you need buy are Mediabridge - BLue RJ45 Computer Networking Cat5e Ethernet Patch Cable - (14 Feet) or similar (in whatever length you need). The Hub can handle up to four devices.Supposedly you can also buy additional 4-Port Hubs (the adapter can transmit, over your power lines, to several Hubs) but I have been unable to find any of the Actiontec branded ones here on Amazon; perhaps they will be available at a later date. There are other brands of Hubs but I do not know if they will work with the Actiontec Adapter. In any case, if you wish to use the hub any place in your house (even outdoors if you have an electrical outlet outside), you merely unplug the 4-Port Hub Connector, plug it into whichever outlet you wish, and connect the Ethernet cable to your device.I do not know the speed of transmission but suffice it to say that Netflix HD streaming runs perfectly. I couldn't (and wouldn't!) ask for anything more.The instructions state that neither the Adapter nor the Hub should be plugged into a power strip or anything with surge protection or the product may not work. Well, that may be true in some instances, but, at least in my case, BOTH elements are plugged into power strips which also have surge protection circuits - and everything works perfectly.If all of the above weren't enough, take a look at the price of this device! It's hard to believe that something as totally-well-designed and capable as this can be priced so amazingly low.*Five stars aren't enough. I'd give it 100 stars if I could.Obviously I highly recommend this item.Thank you for reading this review. I hope that it has been of some use to you.Lawrence H.

"We formerly owned a George Foreman grill (model unknown) for many years. Finally its non-stick surface on the plates wore out and, though the grill was still functioning perfectly, to replace those plates would have cost almost as much as buying a new one.So we bought a George Foreman GRP4 Next Grilleration 4-Burger Grill with Removable Plates, White from Amazon on January 12, 2012. We have been using this unit, which is fully satisfactory, until two days ago when we got this new George Foreman GRP2841R 5-Serving Removable Plate Grill with Variable Temperature.I have to tell you - this is BY FAR the best George Foreman grill we have ever owned. Even if its styling is a bit strange (it reminds me of the top of ""David Bowman's"" [Keir Dullea's] space helmet from the film ""2001""), who cares?It cooks well and FAST, much faster than either of our older ones. Using nearly the highest heat setting, my wife cooked four (4) large (though not the thickest) frozen (only partially thawed) hamburger patties to fully-well-done (that's how we like them) in a bit less than twelve (12) minutes! She clocked it. Amazing! She did not pre-heat for the recommended eight minutes; she pre-heated only for about two minutes.And the taste? Practically as good as hamburgers cooked over a charcoal grill outdoors.The drip tray was even greatly improved over the ones on our previous models; it slides and fits in exactly under the unit so that the grease will fall right into it. There's no chance of misalignment.But our burgers seared and cooked so fast that there was hardly any grease at all. This, I am sure, contributed to the exceptional taste.While you'll want to try various heat settings (and they will vary according to what you're cooking), we recommend that, for burgers and the like, you use the highest or near-highest heat setting. I think that will satisfy many people.The plates, top and bottom, remove easily for cleaning and they can be reattached just as easily. The design is near-perfect; maintenance couldn't be more convenient. The two plates and the drip tray can all be washed in a dishwasher. (These items can all be purchased and replaced by the user - but watch out for the prices. These replacement parts do not appear to be offered by Amazon at this time.)Obviously we are keeping our older GRP4 grill as it is still in excellent condition.But we shall now be using this new one - it is so much better.I think the smartest thing George Foreman ever did was to license the use of his name to the company that produces these - and that company has done George Foreman proud. In our opinion the name ""George Foreman"" equates to ""top-quality.""It's too bad that Amazon doesn't allow awarding more than five stars. I'd award it 100 stars if I could! My wife and I give this new George Foreman grill our highest possible recommendation.Thank you for reading this review and for considering my opinions.Lawrence H.

"I have purchased four (4) of these Blu-Ray Player External USB DVD RW Laptop Burner Drives. The price is right and is far below that of any other competitor offering the same quality in my opinion.This player will NOT ""burn"" Blu-rays; it will only read the Blu-ray discs, allowing for playback on your computer (or television if you have the necessary input), but it WILL ""burn"" DVDs or CDs if you so desire.And, of course, it will allow you to archive any of your Blu-rays, DVDs, and/or CDs, creating appropriate computer files for playing and/or storage. I myself play my Blu-ray discs solely from the files I create thus protecting my Blu-ray discs from possible harm.The quality of this machine appears to be high. The power to run the player comes from two of your computer's USB ports (you could also use an AC-to-USB power adapter if you wish).Now I have read some reviews here in which the writers complain of this player not being ""compatible"" with their Windows or Mac computers. Without meaning to be obtuse or annoying, I can only say that that's their problem! I use a GNU/Linux operating system on my computers and ALL FOUR of these players work perfectly with ALL of my computers.If you wish, you can buy one through Amazon making certain that the order is actually fulfilled by Amazon. That way, if you do have an unfortunate problem, you can easily return the unit to Amazon at absolutely no cost to you.Now, as I mentioned, the quality appears to be high. That said, the consistency is not. Let me explain: here are details of all four of my machines as copied from my computer's properties list.Blu-Ray Player External USB DVD RW Laptop Burner DriveNumber 1:Drive InformationOS device name: /dev/sr1Manufacturer: SlimtypeProduct: BD E DS4E1SRevision: EA27Serial number: 908180348936Number 2:Drive InformationOS device name: /dev/sr1Manufacturer: HL-DT-STProduct: BDDVDRW CT21NRevision: 1.00Serial number: K0Z9CG41355Number 3:Drive InformationOS device name: /dev/sr1Manufacturer: HL-DT-STProduct: BDDVDRW CT30PRevision: NR01Serial number: KZ1B4QJ5649Firmware date: 2011-01-27 11:39:Bus encryption flags: 1ANumber 4:Drive InformationOS device name: /dev/sr1Manufacturer: HL-DT-STProduct: BDDVDRW CT30PRevision: NR01Serial number: KV7B1F21731Firmware date: 2010-12-08 15:42:Bus encryption flags: 1AAs you can see, all four are different. Numbers 1 and 2 are completely different and Numbers 3 and 4, though apparently the same actually have different firmware.I bought the Number 1 from TPC Technology and Numbers 2, 3, and 4 from T&J World, all the orders being fulfilled by Amazon.Number 1 is a ""slow"" copier; it never goes above 2.0X speed in copying a Blu-ray. It is very quiet however, far quieter than the LG external Blu-ray drives which I own.Number 2 is equally slow but it is noisier, especially when loading a disc. During the actual copying process, it is quiet.Number 3 is also slow and just as quiet as Number 1.Number 4 appears to be the best of both worlds: it copies fast (over 4.0X though I did not watch all the way through; it may well have speeded up even further) and it is very quiet.If you order, which version will you get?'Who knows? Numbers 2, 3, and 4 all came in the same package from the same dealer!Why did I buy four? I won't answer that completely but suffice it to say that I do not know for how long these units will be available at this price. I believe in getting while the getting is good.I have to tell you that one of my LG Blu-ray drives ""died"" after less than a year. While it is still technically covered under warranty, having read quite a few complaints about LG's service (or lack thereof), I don't hold much hope in getting it repaired.I use an external Blu-ray drive very heavily. I am in the process of archiving every one of my Blu-rays and DVDs. If one or more of these units ""die,"" the pain won't be as bad considering the very low price (the LGs were $99.00+ apiece!).So, in conclusion, I want to say that I am very happy with all four of my new players and I highly recommend them to everyone.Thank you for reading this and for considering my opinions.Lawrence H.

"This Combo Rapid Car Charger + Home Wall Charger + USB Data Charge Sync Cable for Kyocera S2100 is a genuine bargain. For its low price, you get an AC adapter, a DC (car) adapter, and a USB (cable) adapter, all of which terminate in a mini-USB connection.Not only will all three power a Kyocera S2100 cell phone (a basic model), they will power almost ANY item which has a mini-USB port as a power connection. More and more electronic items are featuring that kind of power port. I have tried all three of the included items with my SanDisk Sansa Clip Zip 4GB MP3 Player (Blue) and all worked perfectly with it.The AC adapter has a bright red LED to show that it is functioning; the DC adapter has a large area which glows blue when it is functioning. I know that some people are bothered by bright LED indicators but I myself am not. I would much rather have the LEDs glowing so that I know that my adapters are continuing to function.Both the AC and the DC adapter are very small in size with cords of adequate length (the DC cord is one of those curled types); the USB cord is approximately five feet in length.Is there a ""fly in the ointment?"" Of course! (Isn't there always?) The AC adapter is not UL-listed. I wish it were. But I ordered two of this item and both work perfectly. Obviously I hope that they continue to do so and that there is never a fire-hazard discovered with this AC adapter (there would be none with the DC or USB adapters).I bought mine from CobraCables/CableForge one of the 'alternate' sellers which, though they charge more, offer free shipping. (If you buy from the 'main' dealer which offers a very low price but charges shipping, and if you have a problem, you will only get as a refund the cost of the product, not the shipping, whereas if you buy from a dealer who offers a higher price but free shipping, if there is a problem and you want a refund, you'll get all of your money back.)In the event, I was very satisfied with CobraCables/CableForge's fast shipping as well as with the product itself; I do wish the packaging would have been somewhat more protective but everything arrived (via USPS) in perfect condition. I am so pleased that I just ordered four (4) more of them from the same seller!In my opinion, you just cannot go wrong with this adapter set and I give it my highest recommendation.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 5, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3FZBAJ1CFBWWI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005XBCEPU#wasThisHelpful","R3FZBAJ1CFBWWI","A3GVXKCTFN3YDN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3GVXKCTFN3YDN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am extremely pleased with this Behringer UFO202 Audio Interface. It works exactly as it should and its price is very low for the quality and functionality it supplies.Now there are already 151 Amazon reviews prior to mine and most of them are thoughtful, well-written, and informative. As a matter of fact, it was reading most of those previous reviews which impelled me to buy this device. That said, I want to emphasize something for which many of the reviewers have unjustly, in my opinion, downgraded the product: any resemblance of what is claimed on the box or in the instruction manual that you WILL get, and what you actually DO get, is strictly coincidental.You will get NO discs (when you see the size of the outer box you will realize that a disc wouldn't even fit into it!), NO ""included"" software and, even though in the instruction manual it is claimed that there is a TOSLink output on the unit, there is NOT.So please just forget about any ancillaries promised. You're not going to get them.What you DO get is a superb instrument which allows you to create excellent digital recordings from any source you wish including records. And frankly, in my opinion, that's plenty!Thus, though the labeling on the box and the error(s) in the manual are completely inexcusable (and absolutely should be corrected), the product itself, again in my opinion, is all that matters and this one, at around $40.00, is, I believe, an amazing bargain.The manual states that the interface has a 16-bit converter and samples up to 48 kHz but, in fact, you can (and I did) make 24-bit (or 32-bit) 192 kHz (or even higher) files depending on the software you use.Now if you already own a USB turntable, and all you want to do is to create digital files from only your records (files which you can play on your computer or from which you can create CDs), you do not need this item. But if you don't own such a turntable, and wish to copy tapes as well as LPs, 45s, etc., then I believe that you will be quite satisfied with this device.Its phono section works ONLY with turntables using moving-magnet cartridges. If you have a turntable with a ceramic cartridge, you would use the line-level setting on the interface. (There is a small switch which changes the inputs to ""phono"" - with the appropriate RIAA curve setting - and ""line"" which handles everything else.) If your turntable has a moving-coil cartridge, you would need to insert a pre-preamp between the turntable and the interface.But in most cases, for recording records, all you need do is to plug the RCA outputs from your turntable into the requisite inputs on this unit and switch the unit to phono; you must also attach the ground cable to this interface. Then merely plug in the USB cable to your computer. The cable transmits the sound and also supplies power to the interface (you will see its green LED light up when you plug in the USB cable).The manual and the box state that the unit supports Windows-XP and Windows 2000 operating systems (as well as an older Mac system) but this is incomplete. This interface, having no drivers of its own, will work with ANY computer running ANY operating system as long as that computer is equipped with a USB port.Then use the software of your choice. As I use a GNU/Linux operating system on my computer, I use the Audacity software (which I like very much) but there are any number of other choices available. I believe that there are also many choices available for Windows and Mac computers as well. You may need to do a bit of searching (there are many available on Behringer's site but I believe that you can find more, and more satisfactory ones, just by doing an ordinary search on the Internet) and then you may need to practice with the software of your choice but I'm certain that the results will be as satisfactory to you as they are to me.Please note that I strongly recommend that you try ""free"" software (such as Audacity) first; in my experience, the free software is AT LEAST as good as most ""pay"" ones - and often even better. If you use free software, then the total cost to you is just the price of the unit itself (and any necessary cables you would have to buy if you do not already have them). But of course whether you use free software or software for which you must pay would be your own choice.This unit arrived just a couple of days ago; I have had time to copy only one LP. But the recording turned out perfectly. I had to make one or two ""test"" recordings to find out the proper settings in the Audacity software, but attaching and using the Behringer UFO202 itself was completely straightforward. Almost anyone could do it.My digital copy of my record sounds EXACTLY the same as the LP itself. Perhaps some ""golden-eared"" person MIGHT be able to distinguish between them but, if the test were effected in a double-blind fashion, I'll bet that he/she could not. I certainly can't hear any difference! Note that, as I mentioned above, I made a 24-bit 192 kHz FLAC file from my record.I own several other Behringer products: the Behringer MICROPHONO PP400 Ultra-Compact Phono Preamp, the Behringer UCA202 Audio Interface, the Behringer UCA222 U-Control Ultra-Low Latency 2 In/2 Out USB Audio Interface with Digital Output And Downloadable Software Bundle, and the Behringer HPS3000 Studio Headphones.Some people have ""knocked"" Behringer for poor customer service and I have no doubt about their unfortunate experiences. But I myself have had NO problems whatsoever with any of my Behringer products so I have never had the need to contact Behringer. If you buy their products from Amazon, as I did, and if you were to have a problem, you merely contact Amazon and they will effect an exchange or refund, as you wish (they will even arrange to pick up the product at your home if you desire) - all at no cost to you.But I have found that, with all of my Behringer products (and I own six pair of those headphones), their manufacturing and quality control are absolutely first-rate. So are their designs - and so are their prices!So, in conclusion, I should like to say that, if you wish to easily create digital files from your records and/or tapes, I strongly recommend that you consider this Behringer UFO202 Audio Interface. While you could plug the outputs from a tape deck directly into the microphone input on your computer, the resultant sound files will generally be inferior. And you cannot plug a turntable directly into a microphone input and expect anything good. So, for its low price, this device affords you the opportunity to make the music on your records and tapes available to you in digital format; playing these digital files exclusively ensures that your originals will not be damaged or worn further.Thank you for reading this and for considering my opinions.Lawrence H.

"Please note that this review is primarily for those people whose computers use a GNU/Linux operating system.Without a doubt, this Seagate Slim 500 GB USB 3.0 Portable Hard Drive - Black (STCD500102) is the smallest and slimmest hard drive I have ever gotten. I also got the Seagate Slim 500 GB USB 3.0 Portable Hard Drive for Mac (STCF500102), essentially the same drive, merely formatted differently. This review applies to both.They are less than 4-inches long, about 3-inches wide, and about -inches in depth. That's small!The Windows version has a black aluminum front face, glossy black sides, and a black matte-finish metal back. The Mac version has a silver aluminum front face instead of the black one but the sides and back are the same. Thus the only real difference between them is the styling; if you're a Linux user who is going to reformat a drive, you can pick either of these depending on your color preference (or the price at the time you order). They're both really good-looking!Both appear to be very sturdy and make no noise that I can hear when in use.If you have a computer with USB 3.0 ports, with either of these drives you will get very high transfer speeds, typically far higher than that which can be obtained via USB 2.0.When I receive a drive, the first thing I do is to shake it to see if there are any loose parts (I actually did get such a defective drive once upon a time).There was nothing loose in either, so the next thing I do is to attach one at a time to my computer and reformat the drive to EXT4 (the Linux standard). (With the Windows version, there is only one partition to unmount so reformatting is straightforward. However on the Mac version, there are two partitions, both of which must be unmounted prior to the reformatting.)That partitioning achieved with nothing out of the ordinary, I then transfered some folders/files to each of the drives.That too proceeded uneventfully - and FAST.These drives are as good as any I have ever owned yet are much smaller in physical size. It is amazing to me what can be packed into such a small device!Both come only with a two-year warranty; this is somewhat disappointing as many of my other drives come with three-year warranties. Nonetheless, two years is better than the one year warranty with which some drives are now shipping.I like both of these drive very much and I highly recommend either one of them (or both!) to any GNU/Linux user who needs a backup for his/her folders, files, photos, music, etc.Thank you very much for reading this and for considering my opinions.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 23, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1T0FTH3L3XEX3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BOHNYTW#wasThisHelpful","R1T0FTH3L3XEX3","A3GVXKCTFN3YDN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3GVXKCTFN3YDN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 0:42 MinsThe title says it all - these Behringer HPS3000 Studio Headphones produce very good sound, especially when the price is considered.I'm sure you have read the many negative reviews here, especially those which complain about the longevity of this product. I can sympathize with those people who may have had some problems but I cannot claim to have had any myself.Well, you could say, ""Okay. He bought ONE set and he was lucky; his are good ones.""You could say that - but you'd be wrong.I did not buy one set; I bought SIX sets - and from two different vendors at different times. The last three were purchased from Amazon.You can see all six in my video.All have functioned perfectly from Day 1 and all continue to function perfectly. Most importantly, all have functioned identically, a sign of superb design and quality control. Two of them have been across the country and back.Over the years I have owned many headphone sets (including a very expensive one made by another German company whose name begins with S and ends with R; this set, which lasted about four years, is now a permanent resident of our local landfill).I use headphones extensively. I bought one of these HPS3000s some time ago and I was surprised (actually astounded) by the clarity of sound they produced.These Behringers have sound quality which, in my opinion, is superior to that of those other German headphones, especially in the bass and the crystalline highs produced.It is also superior to most other headphones I have heard, including Sony and Bose. (But I have to say that they are noticeably inferior to the TASCAM TH Series TH-MX2 Studio Headphones which, however, are somewhat more costly - though the difference won't break the bank.)I listen frequently via these headphones to CDs on the Lyrita Recorded Edition label; if you are familiar with that name, you know that they have achieved the finest sound quality yet available on CD (not quite, of course, as good as that available on SACD - but very close). Do you want to try a sampling? Try this: Celebrating 50 Years Devoted To British Music, Set One; if you like that set, then try this one: Celebrating 50 Years Devoted To British Music, Set Two. Not only is the sound quality spectacular, so is the music quality!In my opinion, these Behringer headphones are very good - in terms of sound quality, construction quality, and value for money. Period. That's why I wound up buying a total of six of them. (And yes I have specific uses for all six.) My older headphones, of which I have many, now reside in a box in my basement. (But my new TASCAMS are the ones I shall use when listening seriously via headphones.)As for comfort, I think that is highly subjective. I have found these to be at least as comfortable as any I have owned in the past and really a bit better than most. They are lightweight (though 'clunky' looking) and they cover my ears completely (but they are not noise-canceling). The headband is also very comfortable. Once I put them on, I do not have to adjust them further and I listen generally for three or four hours at a time. But the only way for you to know for sure if they fit you comfortably is to try them. They fit me just fine. (My older headphones are also, for the most part, comfortable.)Obviously I highly recommend these Behringers to you. I also highly recommend that you buy them from Amazon. If by chance you were to receive a defective pair, you could return them to Amazon at absolutely no cost to you. (If you ask, Amazon will schedule a pickup at your home or place of business so you don't even have to take the package to the post office or a different shipping facility.) You can request an exchange or a refund. The choice is yours.But after buying, owning, and extensively using these six pair, I am confident that, if you buy a set, you will have the same experience as I have had. (I should also say that I own several other Behringer products: Behringer UCA202 Audio Interface, Behringer UCA222 U-Control Ultra-Low Latency 2 In/2 Out USB Audio Interface with Digital Output And Downloadable Software Bundle, and Behringer PP400 Ultra-Compact Phono Preamp. I am 100% satisfied with all of them. And, other than as a completely satisfied customer, I have no connection whatsoever with the Behringer company.)I would give these headphones 50 stars if I could, especially when you consider the ridiculously low price asked for them (compare the price to that of any other high-quality set of headphones). I paid far less for my six Behringers than I did for the one expensive set I mentioned above.In conclusion, it is my opinion that, if you want ""prestige"" or ""coolness,"" then you buy Beats by Dr. Dre, Bose, Sennheiser, or some other $300.00+ headphones. However, if all you want is comfort and fine sound quality over many hours, then you buy these.I thank you for reading this, for watching my video, and for considering my opinions.Lawrence H.

" 1:06 MinsI received this Leslie Dame CD-612D Solid Oak Mission Style Multimedia Storage Cabinet, Dark Oak yesterday and my wife and I are thrilled with it. The video will show you how it looks in my room and the amount of storage space it offers (both in the main part of the cabinet as well as in the doors).I admit I ordered it with some trepidation after reading some of the previous reviews here which mentioned shipping damage. But ours arrived in absolutely perfect condition. Its packing is superlative; it has to be because the cabinet, almost completely assembled, is shipped from China to the West Coast and then, in our case, across the country to our home on the East Coast. Frankly, I think shipping damage to this item would be a real rarity.When I say ""almost completely assembled,"" I mean just that. The only things the buyer must do is to remove, with a small Phillips-head screwdriver, two (or four) L-shaped metal attachments which holds two long shelves affixed by the factory for sturdiness in shipping (removing these attachments and placing a shelf on another level may not be necessary, depending upon what you intend to put on it; I only needed to remove two of the L-shaped attachments for one of the shelves to place that shelf on another level), insert the small plastic bolts (four per shelf) into the appropriate holes and then put each shelf into place. The buyer determines where the shelves are placed depending upon the use(s) he/she is contemplating. This can be changed at any time in the future should circumstances warrant.There are five long shelves and ten shorter shelves included; you may or may not need all of them. (There are sixty plastic bolts included; I wish Leslie Dame had included four more ""just in case"" but that is a small 'nit.')This gives you a maximum of 18 spaces in which to store your discs or tapes, 6 short spaces in each of the doors (12 total), and 6 long spaces in the center of the cabinet.In our case, I used all of the shelves (and all of the bolts) because I am going to use the cabinet exclusively for CDs. The bolts were tight going in but this means, of course, that they will not fall out.The instruction sheet is complete and clear. It took me less than an hour to get it completely ready, from the time of arrival, to the time of completion.Now Leslie Dame states that the cabinet will hold 612 CDs. They obviously mean 612 CDs in 612 standard ""jewel box"" cases. However, I own the Arturo Toscanini: The Complete RCA Collection which has 84 CDs and 1 DVD in a box taking up less space than 30 standard CDs (the CDs/DVD in this box are stored in cardboard sleeves) so I shall be able to get many more than 612 CDs into this cabinet.(I also own the Mercury Living Presence Boxed Set as well as several other boxed sets, all of which contain CDs in cardboard sleeves rather than CD ""jewel boxes."") So the ""612"" figure will not apply to me; Leslie Dame's ""Holds 612 CDs, 298 DVDs, or 172 VHS tapes, or any combination"" may or may not apply to you. You may be able to store more too. Certainly you'll store no less than the numbers specified.It is a beautiful piece of furniture made of solid oak (the joins on the doors are even dove-tailed!) and, unlike most vinyl-clad fiberboard cabinets, it will look quite nice in any room of your house.Some people have mentioned, in a somewhat negative fashion, that it is made in China. It is. Would I myself have preferred that it had been Made in USA? Certainly! But I have to say that, no matter where it would be made, in my opinion the quality of construction couldn't be bettered, especially at the price.In conclusion, like most other reviewers here, I am completely pleased with this cabinet and I recommend it to anyone needing a nice media storage center.Thank you for reading this and for watching the video.Lawrence H.

"I received this Belkin SuperSpeed USB 3.0 4-Port Hub (F4U058tt) the other day from Amazon Vine and I am happy with it.I tried it today for the first time, transferring three folders containing a total of 14 GB to three separate external hard drives. The process took just a couple of minutes.I attached the USB cords of the three USB 3.0 drives into slots 1, 2, and 3 on the hub, attached the supplied power cord to the device, plugged in the power cord to an AC socket, attached the supplied USB 3.0 cable to the hub, and finally plugged the other end of the cable into one of my computer's USB 3.0 ports. (I recommend that you make your connections in that same order.)All three drives were recognized instantly. Three blue lights (two to the left and one centered, more or less) came on, showing, I guess, that the unit was powered, connected, and functioning. (There was no instruction manual included with my unit nor is there any mention of these lights on the packaging so I have no true idea of what they stand for; these lights are not shown in any of the pictures.)The unit will handle four external drives and, while I have not tried using it yet with four drives, it worked perfectly well with my three.Now I must tell you that I am using a GNU/Linux operating system (specifically Xubuntu) on my computer so I know that your experience (using Windows or Mac) may not be entirely the same as mine (Linux is faster both in connection time as well as in transfer time), but, as the hub specifically states that it is compatible with Windows 7 (and earlier, back to XP SP3), I expect that there will not be too much difference; ditto for Mac though there is no mention of Mac at all on the packaging. I have read that some people using a MacBook Air have had some problems but note that if you buy the hub from Amazon and are dissatisfied with it, you merely contact Amazon and you can return it at absolutely no cost to you.There was no mention of Linux on the packaging either but, as I stated, it works perfectly with my computer.I see from a few previous reviews that certain people have had some difficulty with the hub; I have read similar reviews complaining of similar problems with other hubs (a couple of which I also own). I can only say that, with one exception (and that was due to extremely poor physical construction in which a USB port on it came completely apart! I threw it out!), I have had no connection or transfer problems with any of my hubs over the years. They have all been reliable. I expect no less from this one.This particular hub is quite small. It comes with a power cable and a USB 3.0 cable, both of adequate length. If these cables are not long enough for your particular installation, extension cords (AC and/or USB) are inexpensive and readily available.I shall be taking it along when my wife and I travel. I know it will come in handy and it will take up little room. It appears to be constructed with integrity.Obviously, if your computer has only USB 2.0 ports, you will not achieve USB 3.0 speeds of transfer, but, if your computer does indeed have at least one USB 3.0 port, and if you are in the market for a USB 3.0 hub, I recommend this one to you.Thank you for reading this and for considering my opinions.Lawrence H.

"I am very pleased with this C2G / Cables to Go 28733 Digital To Analog Audio ConverterDAC Black. This product is a hidden gem among Amazon's audio offerings. Though it's not much to look at and it doesn't have a ""prestigious"" name (the name printed on its case is ""TRULink"" - sounds like something you'd find in an ultra-low-end discount store), you must take into account that physical styling and impressive names have absolutely nothing to do with sound quality - and it's in its sound quality that this device really shines. Wait until you hear what it can produce!While it appears that most of the reviewers of it are using it for TV sound output, I am using it to send computer sound to my stereo system. It is a superb device for use in this type of application. Please note that, if you plan to use it with a television set, it will output stereo sound only, not Dolby Digital or DTS surround sound.It has three inputs: digital optical, digital coaxial (for use with televisions, etc. - HDMI sound output from your television will not work with it) and a USB input (for use in conjunction with a computer). When using it with your television, I believe that you must use the USB power adapter (included) (I have not tried this so I am not sure about this statement) but, when using it to convert computer digital sound to analog (my primary use), no addition power supply is necessary. You merely attach the USB cable (included) to a USB (2.0 or 3.0) port on your computer and then run RCA cables (not included) from the unit to your receiver or amplifier.It can also be used as a high-quality headphone amplifier (the sound coming from any source, optical, coaxial, or USB). The volume control works only with the headphone amp; it has no effect on the output from the RCA jacks.Unlike the Behringer UCA202 Audio Interface or the Behringer UCA222 U-Control Ultra-Low Latency 2 In/2 Out USB Audio Interface with Digital Output And Downloadable Software Bundle, it cannot be used for digital recording though it could, of course, be used for cassette tape - remember that? - recording with your stereo system. Otherwise, it is strictly a playback unit.It does support 24-bit/192 kHz audio (evidently without conversion) and the sound quality obtained from a computer using this device, as opposed to using the headphone-out jack on the computer, is audibly superior.Will it work with your computer? Yes, definitely! It requires no external drivers and, though it's only claimed to work with various Windows distributions, it will in fact work with ANY computer which has USB ports, Windows, MAC, or GNU/Linux (which is what I use).All you need, in addition to the unit itself, is this Cables Unlimited AUD-1605-06 6-Feet Pro A/V Series RCA Audio Cables or this C2G / Cables to Go 3-Feet 3.5mm Male to 2 RCA Type Male Audio Y Cable for iPod-White (depending upon the type of input on your amplifier or amplified computer speakers; other lengths of cable are also available).This DAC carries the usual one-year warranty and, if you buy it from Amazon, you are doubly protected. It seems to be well-built and, though I have had it for only a few days, it appears to be fully satisfactory for the use to which I put it (playing computer sound through my audio system).Is there a fly in the ointment? You bet - it is the accompanying documentation (or lack thereof). Neither the box nor the instruction sheet tells anything about the specifications of this device. For that, you must go to their web site and even that information is not given anywhere on the box or sheet. (See my first comment to this review for the applicable URL.) Frankly, I think that this is unconscionable.But the unit is indeed a simple ""plug-and-play"" device (as long as you know how to adjust sound output from your own computer). It is easy to set up and use and it produces superior sound quality, much better than the sound quality one can obtain from a computer's own audio circuitry via a headphone jack or line output.For listening to internet radio, FLAC (or ALAC) files, mp3s, or even CDs via your computer, this device will afford the best possible sound quality, limited only by the capabilities of your audio equipment.And its price is ""right.""I highly recommend it and I thank you for reading this.Lawrence H. BulkP.S. By the way, I like it so much that I bought a second one for use in my ""second"" audio system.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 2, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2OF7HMH0LEF6C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00007JO2V#wasThisHelpful","R2OF7HMH0LEF6C","A3GVXKCTFN3YDN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3GVXKCTFN3YDN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have read most of the reviews concerning the excellent Behringer UCA222 U-Control Ultra-Low Latency 2 In/2 Out USB Audio Interface with Digital Output And Downloadable Software Bundle and the equally excellent Behringer UCA202 Audio Interface and I have seen several questions asked repeatedly.While I cannot truly add anything to the fine reviews already written, as an owner of both models, I may be able to answer definitively certain of these common questions.1) Will it work with my computer? Yes it will if your computer has USB 2.0 or 3.0 ports. While I believe it will also work with older computers which have only USB 1.1 ports, I have not tried it with such so I cannot comment about that older port (which has not been offered for about ten years now). The USB port supplies all necessary power to these devices; no external power is necessary (nor can external power be applied).2) Will it work with my operating system? Yes it will. My older '202 (purchased several years ago) states it is compatible with Windows XP and Mac. My newer '222 (which I just purchased last week) states it is compatible with Windows XP, Windows 7, and Mac. In actual fact, as it requires no external drivers of any kind, it is compatible with ALL operating systems; I use a GNU/Linux OS (Xubuntu) on my computer and both work perfectly with it.3) Does it come with software? Well, Behringer's instructions state that a free CD is included. It is not. But you can download some software from Behringer's site; this software may or may not work with your computer but this really does not matter. Suitable free software is readily available all over the web. If you use a GNU/Linux OS, you need only enter ""Digital Audio"" into the search box of the Ubuntu Software Center or, preferably, into the Synaptic Package Manager's search box. There you'll find plenty of software which works with Linux (more software than anybody would ever need!).4) Can you monitor sound as it is being recorded? Yes, using headphones, you can, choosing to listen either directly from the USB output or from the RCA inputs; there is a small switch which makes the adjustment between the two.5) Is there a digital output? Yes there is, an optical one. If your equipment has only a coaxial digital input, optical-to-coaxial converters are readily available at low cost (Amazon sells several). Note that the optical output transmits only two-channel sound; there is no provision for Dolby or DTS multi-channel.6) Is there any difference between the two units, the UCA222 and the UCA202? Yes there is. The UCA222 is red in color with a red LED. The UCA202 is silver in color with a green LED. You buy either of these units based on a) price at the time you order one, and b) color preference (if any). THAT'S IT! Color is the ONLY difference between these units. The circuitry is identical and so is the operation and performance.Please note that these are strictly 16-bit / [up to] 48 kHz units. They WILL play back 24-bit 192 kHz files but they will convert them down to 16-bit 48 kHz. Will you hear a difference? That depends upon a) the equipment you're using and b) the sensitivity of your hearing. Remember that, if you're playing CDs or files made from CDs, they are 16-bit 44.1 kHz only so that's all you'll hear regardless of the DAC you use.I use these devices for travel. They are lightweight and robustly built. $30.00 (approximately) is a true bargain for something of this quality. The sound produced is superior to the sound supplied from your computer's headphone output and that improvement can be heard by anybody.I hope that I have touched on some salient points.

"This is a superlative flash drive, certainly the best one I have ever owned.Please note that this review will be of interest primarily to those who use a GNU/Linux operating system and whose computers have USB 3.0 ports. People using Windows or Mac can either read it just for information or can ignore it altogether (except, perhaps, for my first and last sentences; I hope everyone takes note of them!) and I say that without meaning to be disrespectful to anyone.My wife and I are currently using two ZaReason Strata 7330 Laptop Computers, both of which have two USB 3.0 ports (as well as two USB 2.0 ports). We have customized them with additional RAM and have upgraded them to the new Intel Ivy Bridge processors (hers i5-3210, mine i7-3720). Their operating systems are Xubuntu.I received my SanDisk Extreme 32 GB USB 3.0 Flash Drive SDCZ80-032G-X46 today. On the box is stated that it is compatible with Windows XP, Windows Vista, Windows 7, and Mac OS X v10.5+.Well, guess what! To that you can add any GNU/Linux distribution!The drive was recognized instantly via both of the USB 3.0 ports on my computer and functioned perfectly until I unmounted it. It was also instantly recognized (and functioned perfectly) via the USB 2.0 ports on two older computers, one running Ubuntu and the other Linux Mint.The drive comes pre-formatted with FAT32 and, of course, contains some 'bloatware' (software) which I immediately deleted.Then I ran an experiment with it just to determine its capabilities.I have three movies in a folder on my computer, all of which are in MKV format, and the entire folder is 5.4 GB in size.Without changing the format of the drive, I copied this folder to it; the time elapsed was 49 seconds. That's fast (about 110 MB/s).I then deleted the folder, reformatted the drive to the NTFS file format (on computers using a GNU/Linux operating system, reformatting anything is quick and easy) and, after the conversion was completed, I re-copied the folder to the drive. This time the transfer took 69 seconds, still fast, but slower than when the drive was formatted as FAT32. I do not know why NTFS was slower than FAT32.Then I deleted the folder from the drive again (by the way, both times I completely deleted the copied folder using SHIFT + DELETE so it was completely gone from the drive) and reformatted the drive to EXT4, the native Linux file system (to which my computer is also formatted).I then recopied the 5.4 GB folder.This time the operation was completed in 28 seconds. TWENTY-EIGHT SECONDS!! I checked the transfer times carefully (using an 'atomic' clock). There is no mistake (and, with the drive formatted as EXT4, I did the transfer experiment twice just to make sure of the time for transfer! It was the same both times!).You figure out the speed!Suffice it to say that I am absolutely amazed and pleased with this drive. I have always used SanDisk flash drives but this one 'blows out of the water' any I had used previously.By the way, the format to which I had the drive configured did not make any difference in the recognition of the drive on my computer. As I stated above, it was instantly recognized via either of the two USB 3.0 ports and continued to function until I unmounted it.This one is as well-made as any SanDisk drive I have used before (I own five or six of them, the largest previous one being 8 GB). It is sturdy, quite well-made, and features a small blue activity light as well as a key chain attachment. While it is slightly longer than my previous ones, it is nonetheless quite small and the sliding port protects the USB connection (and works very nicely). This 32 GB drive will hold all the information I would ever want to transfer in such a manner, at least for the foreseeable future.Now I cannot tell anyone about the performance of this drive when using Microsoft Windows or the Apple Mac operating systems but I should suspect that, assuming that those computers are equipped with USB 3.0 ports, it will be very fast on those systems too.I shall continue to use my older SanDisk drives (formatted as FAT32) if I want to copy something from someone else's Windows (or Mac) computer and transfer it to my own; EXT4 formatted drives generally do not work on Windows (or Mac) computers whereas FAT32 works on everything and NTFS works on Windows computers.Obviously I am leaving this particular drive formatted as EXT4 as I have several computers, all of which use a GNU/Linux OS and, while none of the others has USB 3.0 ports, nonetheless, drives formatted as EXT4 transfer much faster between Linux devices than do drives formatted any other way.And, just as obviously, I highly, highly, highly recommend this drive to all who can take advantage of its capabilities.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 21, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R11MQGB5ZFY3I6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007YXA5TC#wasThisHelpful","R11MQGB5ZFY3I6","A3GVXKCTFN3YDN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3GVXKCTFN3YDN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I own several AmazonBasics SD cards but this one has, by far, the largest capacity of any of them.It is formatted in the new exFAT file system; not every camera can use that (nor can all cameras handle such a large-capacity SD card) but this card, like all such cards, is easy to reformat to whatever file system you wish. (If, however, your camera can accept an exFAT formatted card, you'll want to use this card as is - I understand that that new file system is superior to most of the the older systems.)As I had a specific need at first, I reformatted mine to the Linux-native file format of EXT4. After I had completed the task at hand, I reformatted it to FAT32.Then I inserted it into my Canon G1 X 14.3 MP CMOS Digital Camera with 4x Wide-Angle Optical Image Stabilized Zoom Lens Full 1080p HD Video and 3.0-inch Vari-Angle LCD in which, as expected, it functioned perfectly. I do not know how many pictures it will actually hold, but it certainly will be a LOT!This card's speed is not quite in the same league as the SanDisk Extreme 64 GB SDXC UHS-I Card 45MB/s (SDSDX-064GB-X46), for example, yet it is certainly fast enough for most practical purposes. It is a Class 10 card.I have been buying AmazonBasics products of all kinds almost since they were introduced and I have had a problem with only one of them - and, even though I had had that product for over a year, Amazon IMMEDIATELY replaced it WITHOUT EVEN REQUIRING ME TO RETURN THE DEFECTIVE ONE!Their SD cards are of top quality and Amazon's support for their own products after the sale (in my case, WELL after the sale) is second-to-none. This card's price is lower than SanDisk's Extreme with only a very slight loss of performance and thus represents good value for money.I highly recommend this AmazonBasics 64 GB Class 10 SDXC UHS-1 Flash Memory Card.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 26, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ZOWX26RCZU2D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007W0XHK6#wasThisHelpful","R1ZOWX26RCZU2D","A3GVXKCTFN3YDN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3GVXKCTFN3YDN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am very impressed with this Seagate Backup Plus 500 GB USB 3.0 Portable External Hard Drive STBU500100 (Black). This is my first Seagate external hard drive. It is easy to use and it functions very well.Specified to work with Microsoft Windows and Apple Mac, it is actually cross-platform and will work well as a storage device with any computer operating system.As is usual these days, as soon as you connect the drive to your computer, it will be recognized and will be operational.It is nicely styled. Its case looks as though it were made of metal but it's actually made from a very good grade of plastic. The top face looks 'brushed,' the sides look 'glossy,' and the bottom face looks 'matte-finished.' It is available in several other colors as well as black.The top portion is actually a removable module. It just pulls right off the rest of the drive. This is the first time I have seen such a feature and it's quite unique. (If I had my 'druthers,' I would wish for a positive lock for the module. Nonetheless, the connection seems sturdy and firm enough and this complaint is a very small one.)This module is connected to the rest of the drive via an internal port and it can be swapped for other modules which feature different types of computer connections (see below).The USB 3.0 port is placed at the top of this module and there is a white LED on the front of module which lights up when the unit is connected. It is, of course, fully backwards-compatible with USB 2.0 (I have not tried it with a USB 1.1 connection).The removable module allows access to the internal port which can connect to different, optionally-purchased modules and these, instead of using USB 3.0, can use the new Thunderbolt or the older FireWire technology should the user wish to use those means of connection. The Seagate GoFlex Thunderbolt Adapter (STAE121) (rather expensive just now) is available as is the Seagate FreeAgent GoFlex Upgrade Cable FireWire 800 - STAE102.This modular design appears to make this drive 'future-proof' as future, not-yet-invented, connections will be able to be used with this drive merely by buying a new module. Whether other manufacturers will adapt this type of technology is a question I cannot answer. And I also cannot say if the internal port connection is a proprietary or a 'universal' type which will be adapted by those other manufacturers. But this type of modular design does seem to me to be quite desirable, especially in view of the fact that this Seagate drive, which has it, costs little, if any, more alone than competing drives which do not have this feature.However, I must say that, even without other modules and/or other means of file transfer, USB 3.0 is VERY fast (transferring FROM a Western Digital USB 3.0 drive TO this one via my computer's two USB 3.0 ports, I got over 85 Mbps speed - that's real-world) and I think that transferring files to and from this one is at least as fast as anyone would currently desire.Otherwise, this hard drive is typical of its breed. It comes with backup and some control software installed, usable only with Windows and Mac, which, as I use a Linux operating system, is of no use to me whatsoever. And from what I have read, it appears that few Windows and Mac users would find this proprietary software useful either. I immediately deleted all of it, leaving an empty drive which, delivered formatted as NTFS, offers 465+ MB of storage space. NTFS is native to Windows but also works perfectly in Linux; nonetheless, I reformatted the drive to EXT4, the native Linux file system. I do not know how well it works with a Mac but if you own a Mac, you can easily reformat this drive to HFS+.Though it's still small enough to easily fit into a man's pocket, it is slightly 'longer' than the Western Digital portable external hard drives I have previously used and does not fit in the AmazonBasics case which I use for those drives. So I bought this equally inexpensive Drive Logic DL-64 Portable EVA Hard Drive Carrying Case Pouch (Black) which holds the drive (plus its 18-inch connection cable) with room to spare. Unusually, this case also has a full-width stretchable pocket on its front which could hold something fairly thin such as business cards, small papers, etc. (maybe even a small, thin MP3 player!). The only thing I do not care for about the case is the fact that the zipper opens from the bottom rather than the top; to me, this is counterintuitive. (But that's a minor 'nit.')Obviously I am using the drive exclusively as a storage device to back up my documents, music, pictures, and videos. I suspect that most people will also wish to use it strictly for that purpose.It operates at 5400 RPM and gets just barely warm in extended use. (I think that most people will not even notice this slight warmth.)Seagate drives have always had a fine reputation and this particular Seagate drive comes with a 2-year warranty (which is typical for this type of product).Prices for external drives have been falling of late from the high levels seen last year (as a result of weather conditions and other natural disasters) and, at least at this time, this one is priced 'right,' especially in view of its new modular technology.I highly recommend it.==================================================================================================================================Update: November 21, 2012Two days ago, courtesy of Amazon Vine, I received another of these drives, this one of 1 TB capacity. It is just as good as the 500 GB drive and, because of the large difference in capacity coupled with the small difference in price, it the one I recommend that you buy.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 6, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R39K5PP7ZA4B6X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00829THSW#wasThisHelpful","R39K5PP7ZA4B6X","A3GVXKCTFN3YDN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3GVXKCTFN3YDN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Courtesy of Amazon Vine, my wife has received two previous-model Remington Hair Dryers (Ac2015 and D3710) in the last couple of years, both of which she liked better than any other brand she had owned before.Yesterday this new model, the Remington D8410 Keratin Therapy Dryer, arrived. While performance of the three Remington models she now owns is about the same, this new one is, due to its superb design, the best of the three.All three of Remington's models feature an 1875W high torque motor along with a ""cool shot"" to set your style, 3 heat and 2 speed settings for styling control, and a removable air filter for easier cleaning. This new one also has an ""exclusive keratin-infused nozzle ring [which] delivers healthier, stronger hair.""Of these three, though she very much liked its hair-drying performance, the model which comes in third place (she gave it four stars) is the Remington D3710 Ceramic Fast Finish Dual Fan Turbo Hair Dryer, 1875 Watts and that is solely due to the design and placement of the operating switches (especially the slide switch for the fan speeds); she found them awkward to use.The model which now comes in second place (and, until this D8410 arrived, the one she had liked better than any other hair dryer she had ever owned) is the Remington Ac2015 Tstudio Salon Collection Pearl Ceramic Hair Dryer, in her opinion positively a 5-star model. Though it is relatively heavy in weight, until now, this has been her daily dryer. She liked it so much that she had me buy another one, to take when traveling, and, sometime later, when Amazon offered it at a ridiculously low price, she had me order another one (just as a spare), so now she has three of them! That's how much she liked that model.When we have traveled anywhere now she takes two of these Ac2015 dryers (and she will continue to do so) - but, now that she has received this D8410 (also a ceramic model), she likes it somewhat more and will use it daily at home. She has awarded it first place.But please note that the standings are very, very close.Now for the nitty-gritty.As I mentioned, she was unhappy with the design and placement of the switches on the D3710 so that model has been relegated back into its box, to be kept strictly for ""emergencies"" (which are not going to happen as she now has so many other Remington hair dryers). There is nothing at all wrong with its hair-drying performance, just its design (her opinion).She did like the switch design of the Ac2015 but, oddly, they work in ""reverse"" - that is, Off is up, Medium fan speed is middle, High fan speed is down. Likewise with the heat settings: Low is up, medium is medium, and High is down.This is not intuitive (it runs counter to everything else we have ever used) though she says she became used to it. (Even unscrewing the air filter is done backwards!) But though this is not truly important, there appears to be no good reason for such a design.However -- this new model has the switches set for intuitive operation. High fan speed is up, medium is medium, and Off is down. Likewise for the heat settings: High is up, medium is medium, and Low is down.In addition, the D8410 has a nice and clever hinged air filter assembly which makes for quick, convenient, and ""you-can't-lose-the-cover"" cleaning. This feature, she says, is better than that on any other hair dryer she's ever owned.All of this just makes sense and she says she's glad that Remington finally came around to arranging the switch position in this logical way and designing a clever and convenient filter access cover.As a bonus, the buttons are shaped really well for her fingers so, all in all, the controls are just perfect, in her opinion.She also says that the new D8410 is noticeably lighter in weight than either the Ac2015 or the D3710 and, when I picked up both the D8410 and the Ac2015 at the same time, guess what! She's right!Though the sound it makes is higher pitched than her two others, this new D8410 is also noticeably quieter (VERY noticeably quieter) than either of those other two previous models; even I could hear that. But she still uses ear plugs when using any hair dryer, even this one.Hair-drying performance with her unit is just slightly better than with her Ac2015s (probably due to sample variations); the drying today went faster and her hair (baby-fine and difficult to style and dry) came out looking good. This may also have been due to the Keratin therapy feature (which, Remington claims, will last the life of the dryer). She was really pleased.It comes with a concentrator (which she uses) and supposedly you can order a ""free"" diffuser using a coupon code packed with the unit. Unfortunately, as of today, that coupon code did not work and we're not going to pursue this as she really has no need for a diffuser. If you do, you may want to contact Remington to find out what's going on. [Please read first Comment.]We have not yet tried one of the Remington diffusers she already has to see if it fits but I believe that it would. The concentrator is interchangeable between the Ac2015 and this D8410; I tried it just to see.Remington hair dryers appear to be made better than other brands she has owned. Her Ac2015, which has been in daily use since October 2010, is definitely built well and is still functioning as it did when new (and, so far, that is longer than any other hair dryer she previously owned, most of which ""died"" after about a year or less). We even took it with us on our cross-country driving trip. Though it is lighter in weight, this new D8410 appears to be constructed with the same integrity.It, like the Ac2015, comes with a four-year warranty. Remington is the only brand that my wife has ever bought which has offered such a long warranty. (Note that the D3710 comes with only a two-year warranty.) While these items are certainly not major investments, it is nice to know that the manufacturer has sufficient confidence in its products such that it can back them for four years.Of course, as with all such products, the bottom line is performance in hair drying and styling. While all three Remington models she owns are exemplary in performance (and any small differences are probably due, as I stated, just to sample variations), according to my wife, this one is very slightly better and, due to its outstanding design, is a pleasure to use. It's positively the one to buy.My wife said to me, after she was finished with her hair this morning, ""It's too bad you can't give this one 10 stars!""Highly recommended!","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 26, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1IPXAJQWMJIUJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007E0FR84#wasThisHelpful","R1IPXAJQWMJIUJ","A3GVXKCTFN3YDN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3GVXKCTFN3YDN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In my opinion, all LCD screens on cameras (and anything else!) should have some protection. Previously I had always purchased screen protectors made by Zagg but they are expensive and a bit tricky to install.While doing some research on other aspects of this camera, I noticed in Amazon's recommendations this 3x Kodak Easyshare M5370 Camera Premium Invisible Clear LCD Screen Protector Cover Guard Shield Protective Film Kit (3 Pieces) and, at a price of only $4.50 for three (3) protectors, I thought, ""What can I lose?""So I ordered them.Let me tell you: they are superb in every way.They are easier to install than Zagg's - they are applied ""dry"" as opposed to Zagg's ""wet"" application. This means that you can use the camera immediately after installing the protector instead of having to wait (according to Zagg's instructions) for 12 - 24 hours (so that their protector can dry out).The quality appears to me to be the same for both this one and the Zagg and, at $1.50 for one of these (you get three, so you have two spares) as opposed to $15.00 for just one Zagg protector, it seem to me that buying this brand is a ""no-brainer.""The seller, Benson Huang, packed the protectors carefully and shipment was quick.I am 100% satisfied with this screen protector and I give it a strong recommendation.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 9, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ETTYSY5HNED6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0073XTHLA#wasThisHelpful","R1ETTYSY5HNED6","A3GVXKCTFN3YDN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3GVXKCTFN3YDN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Unlike most people, I shall not use this device to recharge cell phones or tablet computers. Rather, I am using it to extend the playing time of my SanDisk Sansa Clip Zip 4GB Blue MP3 Player SDMX22-004G-A57B - Blue.Though the Clip Zip does have a long playing time with just its internal battery, my wife and I often use it in our car when traveling long distances. We had an auxiliary jack installed in our car which allows a cord from the Clip Zip's headphone output to be plugged into the auxiliary jack; we can then listen to the Clip Zip's music over our car radio.While driving, we use several other devices which are plugged into a RoadPro RP492 4-in-1 12V Power Outlet with Three 12V Socket and 1 USB Port and which preclude the possibility of using still another 12V adapter to attach to and power the Clip Zip (we already have the maximum number plugged into the RoadPro).However this Verbatim 97927 Portable Micro-USB Power Pack Charger allows us to listen to music for well over an entire day of driving. We keep the Clip-Zip plugged into it which keeps the Clip-Zip in a full state of charge; at the end of the day, we need only recharge this charger (and that takes just an hour or two).As a matter of fact, when we stop for lunch or dinner, we leave the Clip-Zip on (with the music paused) and, when we start driving again, we merely ""unpause"" the Clip-Zip.So far, we have never run out of power, even over a full day's driving. (Note that if this unit were to discharge completely, the Clip-Zip itself has an inherently long running time. I calculate that using this charger along with the Clip-Zip would give us well over 24 hours of listening without actually needing to recharge. Obviously we never use either device that long without recharging, which we always do overnight.)It is so small that two or three would fit into a shirt pocket. It comes with a short cable which serves double duty: if one plugs the micro-USB adapter end into the charging port and the other regular size USB port into either a computer or an AC -> USB power adapter, the unit itself is charged. A red LED next to the plug indicates charging and the LED turns green when charging is complete (the first time I charged it via an AC -> USB charger, it took less than four hours from empty to a full charge).Turning the cord the other way, turning the unit over and plugging the USB end into the unit, a blue LED (again next to the plug) shines immediately indicating the unit is on.  Plugging the micro-USB end into the Clip Zip charges the player, and we can play the Clip Zip while it's charging. That's what we did one time after playing music for several hours with the Clip-Zip alone and the Clip Zip recharged fully pretty fast. I cannot say exactly how long it took (I was driving, after all) but it did not appear to be too long. I did not try recharging the Clip Zip a second time before recharging this Verbatim Power Pack so I do not know how many times it would recharge the Clip Zip before needing recharging itself.Regarding the short cable, its length is perfect for use in our car and, if it's not long enough for you, extension cords are cheap and readily available.Obviously, in addition to being used in a car, it can be used anywhere you'd like. (I wonder if it could be recharged with a solar charger? I guess that's a question for another day.)So, all in all, this is a very satisfying unit, one which does all it claims to do.In addition, it is constructed beautifully and looks as though it is built to last for a long time.Is there a fly in the ointment? You bet! The unit is small, the cable is short, but there is no way to keep them together when storing the unit, not a clip, not a holder, nothing. I do not recommend keeping the cord plugged in when the unit is not in use; the connection could be damaged plus the unit is always activated when the cord is plugged in; this would eventually run the unit down. There should be some means for storing the two items together; they're both necessary at all times.I suppose I can go to a Dollar Store and find some suitable carrying case but I believe that this should be unnecessary. I hope Verbatim (a fine company; I own several of their products) will take what I intend to be constructive criticism into consideration and, in any future model, will incorporate some sort of connection to hold the two items together.We have never owned a product like this before. We like it and recommend it. It will get plenty of use from us!==============================================================================================================================================Update: May 5, 2013We like this unit so much that, after nearly a year's fairly heavy use during which the charger has functioned flawlessly and well, that we decided to buy another one, this one for powering a set of small portable USB-powered amplified speakers (with which our original unit works well). We ordered it from Amazon and it arrived yesterday, Saturday, May 4 (by Fedex: we are members of Amazon Prime). So now we'll be using the original one for our SanDisk Sansa Clip Zip 4GB MP3 Player (Blue) and this new second one for the speakers. We should be able to listen all day, if we wish, without running out of ""juice.""There are some differences between last year's unit and this year's.Last year's had a glossy black plastic case; this year's has a matte black one. This, of course, is unimportant.What IS important is the following: last year's has a single LED on either end (two in total); when charging, the LED is red and when charging is complete, the LED turns green. On the other end, as soon as the USB connector is plugged into the unit, a blue LED activates, showing that the unit is functioning.This year's model is different. The two ports remain on opposite ends but there are no LEDs on these ends. Rather, on the front face, near the logo ""Verbatim,"" are a bank of four hidden LEDs. When charging, one of these LEDs blinks; when charging is complete, all four light steadily (no blinking).When the USB plug is inserted (to charge an external item), you will see a switch which turns on the unit and can also be used to check the state of charge (four LEDs lit means full charge, three, two, one, or none, represent the charge state). Unlike last year's model, the LEDs turn off after a few seconds when the charger is charging an external item; this represents a small savings in power (after all, you do not need to see an LED to know that you're charging something!).I think that, by a VERY small margin, I prefer this year's model, primarily because of the ability to check the charge capacity remaining and because of the fact that the LEDs turn off when charging something.I do have to say that I won't be checking the charge state very often; this unit, like most such units, has no battery ""memory effect"" and thus it can be charged at any time. Using an AC (or DC) power adapter (such as this Maximal Power AC DC USB Universal Dual USB AC/DC Wall and Car Power Adapter Charger for All USB Powered Devices, iPhone, iPod, and iPad), charging takes only four hours or less and that's from a completely discharged unit; if it's partially charged, the charging time is much less. Double the charging time if you're charging via a computer's USB connection.There is no change in my one ""complaint"" - there is still no means of storing or attaching the cable to the unit. I did buy a small case at our local Dollar Store which is satisfactory.All in all, my wife and I remain completely pleased with this charger and we give it our highest recommendation.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 1, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3NO0ET1N3FST8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007MLHRUG#wasThisHelpful","R3NO0ET1N3FST8","A3GVXKCTFN3YDN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3GVXKCTFN3YDN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Previously I had always used Zagg InvisibleShield screen protectors and had always been satisfied with them. But recently I bought a Garmin nvi 40LM 4.3-inch Portable GPS Navigator (US) and I wanted a screen protector for it. Under Amazon's suggestions I saw this 3x Garmin Nuvi 40 40LM 40LT 40LMT 4.3"" GPS Premium Clear LCD Screen Protector Cover Guard Shield Protective Film Kit. Note that that's THREE screen protectors for $4.50 as opposed to Zagg's price of ONE for $14.99.Big difference!I thought I'd try this V-Shield brand. What could I lose? $4.50?The package, from seller Benson Huang, arrived quickly and in good order. I read the installation instructions and noted that, unlike Zagg's which require wetting before application (and then having to wait 12-24 hours for the screen protector to dry before using the GPS), this one is applied dry and the GPS can be used immediately.It went on easily and perfectly. You do have to follow the instructions carefully and make sure that you apply the correct side of the protector to your device. It appears to me to be just as good, if not better, than Zagg's. And, by having three of them, if you do somehow mess up the installation, you have two more with which you can try (or you can use the other two for something else similar in size). Actually, the instructions state that in the event that you do not apply the protector evenly, it is easy to remove and reapply; I did that so I still had two left over. I used one of them to apply to an older similar-sized Garmin GPS which had a Zagg protector which I had applied badly. I removed that old one and replaced it with one of these. Now this GPS too is covered neatly.I should note that while you can often order Zagg's screen protectors by your product's name and model, just as often you cannot (for example, Zagg does not show a screen protector specifically for the nvi 40LM; you must buy a 'generic' 4.3"" one - and it has been my experience that, while these 'generic' ones fit, they do not always fit 'perfectly'). This V-Shield brand DOES allow purchasing by product and the protector, being specifically cut for your product, fits perfectly onto it.I am very pleased with this product. Its quality and fit are top-notch. Its price is right. The seller's service is great. For what more could you ask?P.S. I also ordered, from the same seller, this 3x Kodak Easyshare M5370 Camera Premium Invisible Clear LCD Screen Protector Cover Guard Shield Protective Film Kit (3 Pieces) for my wife's camera. It too has the same attributes as the ones for the Garmin: excellent quality and fit, excellent price, and excellent service by the seller. In my opinion, you just can't go wrong with these items and this seller.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 12, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/ROM583GLXXSH5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007TWK8AE#wasThisHelpful","ROM583GLXXSH5","A3GVXKCTFN3YDN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3GVXKCTFN3YDN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Several weeks ago, my wife read Titanicat (True Stories) to our 4-year-old granddaughter and she was fascinated by the story and the pictures.So, when this book, T is for Titanic: A Titanic Alphabet (Sleeping Bear Alphabets), was offered to us by Amazon Vine, I immediately grabbed it.I read it to the little girl two days ago and I have to tell you - she seemed to be even more fascinated with this one than the previous one. Of course that may be because she now had certain knowledge which influenced her; she had enjoyed the first book so why not this one too? (I am too far away from a 4-year-old mind to know just what goes through them!)The book is arranged in alphabetical order with each letter representing something about the Titanic (some of them, however, seem a bit far-fetched, though this is not objectionable). Each letter has a short poem and a paragraph or two of explanation. I read the poems to her and I merely paraphrased the explanatory material in a way she could (hopefully) understand.I have only one quibble with one of the poems: it seems to me that, in the poem, the watertight doors would seem to prevent the ship from sinking. Obviously they didn't work and I had to explain that to her. But the other poems appear to stand fairly well on their own. (The poem about the little French boys required some additional explanation too.)The pictures are beautiful as is the paper, the printing, and the binding. I am sure that either my wife or I will re-read this book to her many times in the future and I'll bet that, when she herself learns to read, she'll come back to it too. Someone wrote, in another review, that the reviewer feels that the sewn binding will not hold up. I can tell you that I have such a book (printed and bound in exactly the same way, though with an inferior paper stock) and it is well over 60 years old. It has held up perfectly and I see no reason that this one, if given reasonable care, should not do so too.After I finished reading the book to her, I asked my granddaughter if she would like to see a movie about the Titanic some day; she responded with an enthusiastic ""yes!"" So, one of these days, I plan to show her ""A Night to Remember,"" the best (in my opinion) movie about the Titanic and its sinking. But I think we'll wait a bit; that movie (and all Titanic films) may be a bit intense for a 4-year-old. We'll have to see.It is obvious to my wife and me that these two books have certainly whetted our granddaughter's curiosity about this historical event. (I am not THAT far away to know that small children are truly hungry for knowledge!)I highly recommend this book to anyone with a small child; I recommend the ""Titanicat"" book too.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 10, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2T3XD7WD5HCOK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1585361763#wasThisHelpful","R2T3XD7WD5HCOK","A3GVXKCTFN3YDN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3GVXKCTFN3YDN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This Red Balloon Kids' W000182 Butterflies Stainless Steel Time Teacher Watch is particularly beautiful and it is practical as well. Our 4-year-old granddaughter was positively thrilled as soon as we gave it to her.She took one look at the butterflies and she was in Seventh Heaven!Even with our 'aging' eyes, reading the dial is easy; the hour hand and the minute hand are labeled. And, though she cannot yet read, we were able to explain to our granddaughter the difference between the hour hand and the minute hand and we explained to her the function of the second hand.We have not yet had the time to use the teaching material to show her how to tell time but we will certainly do so the next time she visits.Then why only four stars? I can only go by what our granddaughter says: after wearing the watch for a little over an hour, she removed it (all by herself), stating that it was irritating her wrist (she actually said, ""It itches.""). And, sure enough, where the watch had been, her wrist was red in a couple of spots.My wife felt it was the stitching on the otherwise excellent Velcro band that was causing the problem. Later that afternoon, we stopped at a department store to see if it sold replacement children's watch bands but we had no luck. Ditto for trying to find one on Amazon.My wife is pretty good at coming up with creative solutions to problems so we'll see if she can 'fix' this one.Most other people who have reviewed this product have expressed full satisfaction with the Velcro watch band; I am sorry that our granddaughter, at least at this time, would not agree.Nonetheless, I would highly recommend this watch for anyone who wants to surprise and delight a small girl - and who wants to teach her to tell time.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 10, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3GST17P67M1VN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005OVKLX6#wasThisHelpful","R3GST17P67M1VN","A3GVXKCTFN3YDN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3GVXKCTFN3YDN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the first Transcend memory card I have ever owned and I am very happy with it.I have a Fujifilm FinePix T300 14 MP Digital Camera with Fujinon 10x Wide Angle Optical Zoom Lens (Black) in which I have been using a Fujifilm 4 GB SDHC Class 10 Flash Memory Card and a SanDisk 4GB Extreme HD Video SDHC Card Class 6 (Retail Package); these are the only two brands of Flash Memory Cards recommended by Fujifilm.Nonetheless, I decided to try this low-cost memory card and I can tell you that it works perfectly. Though the Fujifilm card is a Class 10 and the SanDisk is Class 6, I have never been able to observe any speed difference in them, either in writing images to the card or in transferring those images from the card to my computer. (Fujifilm recommends Class 4 or better for video with this camera; Class 2 is fine for still pictures.)This Transcend 8 GB High Speed Class 10 UHS Flash Memory Card TS8GSDHC10U1E works no differently than those other two I own.So why buy this one? The price! Take a look at Amazon's price for this 8 GB card as opposed to the prices for those 4 GB ones.I have no means of actually measuring read/write speeds as some other people do. I can only comment on what I observe when I'm taking pictures or transferring them under similar conditions.This Transcend 8 GB card is just as fast as those two others and certainly fills the bill in my camera. Obviously it holds twice as many pictures as those 4 GB ones. Thus I can highly recommend it to you.Thank you for reading this and for considering my opinions.Lawrence H.

"If you own a Canon G1 X 14.1 MP CMOS Digital Camera with 4x Wide-Angle Optical Image Stabilized Zoom Lens Full 1080p HD Video and 3.0-inch Vari-Angle LCD, in all probability, you will want a case for it.Canon makes a SC-DC75 Soft Leather Case which is very expensive and, at least from the pictures I've seen online, not very good-looking.This COSMOS  Brown Leather Case Cover Bag For Canon Powershot G1X Digital Camera DC G1 X + Cosmos cable tie (also available as COSMOS  Black Leather Case Cover Bag For Canon Powershot G1X Digital Camera DC G1 X + Cosmos cable tie) is elegant and inexpensive. (I bought the brown one; my wife said it was the richer looking of the two in her opinion and who am I to argue?)Being designed especially for the G1 X, it is a perfect fit. And it is made of a very nice hard leather, offering good protection.It comes with its own camera strap which can replace Canon's own and the camera itself is held into the case by means of the camera's tripod socket. The case also has its own external tripod socket (which is actually part of the internal screw which holds the camera) so, without removing the camera from the case, you can attach it to a tripod.Plus - and this is a big plus, at least for me - when you keep the camera in this case, you no longer need to use Canon's 'click-on' lens cover if you do not wish to do so. Though I am continuing to use the somewhat annoying (I prefer the older push-on type) lens cover when I'm storing the camera, when I am actually using it I leave the lens cover off; this case affords all the protection necessary.Open the case and you're ready to shoot.I do have two small ""druthers:"" I wish there were some way of accessing the battery and/or the SD card without removing the camera from the case and I wish the case had a hinge in front such that the top could be moved down out of the way when taking pictures in the manner of the 'old-time' drop-front cases (actually you CAN sort of do this with the case but doing so will crease the case and eventually it might crack; also, since there is only one connector on the bottom of the case, the top swings to and fro when the two side connectors are released).However these caveats are quite minor, especially in view of the case's other attributes and I think that they will bother few people.And when you consider the low price asked for this leather case, well, in my opinion, buying one for your Canon PowerShot G1 X makes sense.Thank you for reading this. I hope it has been of some help to you.Lawrence H. Bulk==================================================================================================================================Update: May 4, 2012At the time I bought this case, it was the only one offered by Amazon for the PowerShot G1 X (along with its black version).But now I see that Amazon has quite a few other such cases and, though many look exactly like this one, they are offered at much lower prices.I suggest that anyone interested in a case for his/her Canon PowerShot G1 X investigate all the offerings listed on Amazon and pick the one which seems to offer the best value for money. That's what I would have done had other cases been available at the time.That being said, I remain very satisfied with this one.==================================================================================================================================Update: May 6, 2012I purchased a Lensmate filter adapter and Lensmate's 58mm lens cover (necessary because Canon's lens cap is to small to fit over a 58mm filter or the adapter when either or both are mounted). Both of these items are of excellent quality - and, when both are mounted (even with a filter attached to the adapter), the whole thing still fits perfectly into this Cosmos case.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 26, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1H1XQPGYW1WO3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007JP165M#wasThisHelpful","R1H1XQPGYW1WO3","A3GVXKCTFN3YDN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3GVXKCTFN3YDN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 1:02 MinsThis is not a 'perfect' camera (what is?). It is not the nicest-looking (best styled) compact camera (in my opinion, the best looking are the Fujifilm X100 12.3 MP APS-C CMOS EXR Digital Camera with 23mm Fujinon Lens and 2.8-Inch LCD and the Leica M9 18MP Digital Range Finder Camera (Black, Body Only). Nor is it the most prestigious. And it is definitely NOT a replacement or a substitute for a DSLR camera.If it is not any of these things, then what is it?It is, in my opinion, simply the best designed, the best performing, and the most advanced compact digital camera on the market today and is, again in my opinion, the very finest such camera yet made.Many people, such as myself, do not want an interchangeable-lens camera for various reasons (including the expense, the inconvenience, and necessity to carry about a rather large array of camera equipment).Yet some of those people, including myself, want an advanced, highly capable, camera with a high-quality lens, a large sensor, and the ability to take pictures under many varied conditions (including low-light without flash) and have those pictures turn out exactly the way they'd like. In other words, they want pictures the equal of those produced by most DSLRs - and they (and I) want to be able to achieve this quality 'in-camera' rather than having to use computer software afterwards.There is really no technical reason why such a camera couldn't have been made before but it appears that this one is the first that can actually achieve that goal.As a preamble, I encourage you to read EVERY review of this camera which appears on Amazon, as well as all of the comments thereto. Plus I also suggest that you read reviews on other sites (including the 'professional' reviews). After all, this is a very expensive camera and you want to make certain that you have obtained every bit of information available to you before you buy it.Here on Amazon you will see almost as many 'con' reviews and comments as 'pro' ones.Some writers feel it is too expensive for what you get. Some writers feel it has too many disadvantages, one way or another. Many of the writers, very obviously, do not truly know how to use it. And there are some people who just don't like it.Some reviewers have purchased the camera and returned it after just a short period of ownership. Frankly, I believe that they did not learn to properly use it. This is a very advanced camera and learning it will take a lot of time. A couple of weeks won't do.There are also a few reviewers here who, while praising the camera for its abilities, are nevertheless somewhat negative in tone; these appear to be written by people who own DSLR cameras and are looking for a more convenient alternate to be used at certain times.Unfortunately, it appears to me (and I could be wrong of course) that they want a compact fixed-lens camera which has EXACTLY the same types of design, features, and, especially, controls of their interchangeable-lens camera.It 'ain't' going to happen!I do want to say that all of these people's opinions are, of course, just as valid as mine and are to be respected (and you'll surely want to consider them) - but I disagree with them all.To begin with, this is a very sophisticated and complicated instrument. In order to derive the maximum benefit from its capabilities, you must be very familiar with the technical fundamentals of photography - or be willing to learn them. Otherwise, if you're not going to teach yourself to use it to its maximum advantage, why pay $800.00 for this camera? If you don't want to take the time to learn these things, feeling perhaps that the effort in obtaining this knowledge is too time-consuming for you personally, or if you just want to take ordinary snapshots and don't really need the capabilities of an advanced camera, in my opinion, you could and should buy a much less expensive one which will suit your needs.This camera would definitely not be for you and I say that without meaning to be disrespectful to anyone.If you're still interested, however, I want to tell you right now that this is a VERY long review and, while I do apologize for its length, I hope you will read all of it to understand what I personally like in a camera, why I particularly like and recommend this one, and why I feel that it is worth every penny I paid for it.Ten years ago, I bought a Canon PowerShot G2 4MP Digital Camera w/ 3x Optical Zoom which, at the time, was one of the best cameras available. It had many good features; it had a nice, bright f/2.0 - 2.5 maximum aperture across its 3:1 zoom ratio but it also had some disadvantages. For example, the smallest f-stop was only f/8 - this, to me, was unsatisfactory (I had not seen that particular specification listed anywhere; had I known about that minimum f-stop, I might not have bought the camera!). In addition, the maximum shutter speed was only 1/1000 second and the ISO range was from 50 to only 400. In other words, this camera did not offer a high dynamic range. As a result of these disadvantages, I missed a number of pictures I would have liked to have had. In addition, it had only 4.0 mega-pixels; though high at the time I bought it, today only cell-phones offer that little.Since that time I have been looking for something better but I had no luck until now. Every camera I saw (including other models in the Canon PowerShot G line) had various disadvantages which precluded my consideration of them.I want a fixed-zoom-lens camera with a wide range of ISO settings (the equivalent of slow-to-fast films), the ability to take good, noise-free (""grain-free"") pictures at high ISOs (sensitivities) so I can take low-light pictures without using flash, a relatively fast lens which can also stop down to at least f/16, and the ability to take pictures in a wide range of shooting modes (automatic, manual, etc). In other words, I want a camera which has most of the capabilities of a DSLR but without the need to change lenses.When I read about the Fujifilm X-100, it seemed to be very good but it is clearly out of my price range (as is the Leica - but I can always dream). In addition, though it has a large APS-C-sized sensor (the same as in DSLRs and even larger than the G1 X) and its lens is fast (f/2.0), it is fixed focal length only (no zoom) and it has only a 12.3 mega-pixel sensor (a relatively low figure at its price by today's standards) and, while, if the camera were in my price range, I could accept all of that, most importantly, according to ""Popular Photography's,"" test results, its measured noise figures are mediocre, even at only moderately high ISO settings. I am afraid that that is something I do not want to accept.There are several Sony cameras which have good noise figures at high ISOs but they have too many other disadvantages, at least for me, to consider them. In addition, though I'm sure that this is not representative, I personally know TWO people whose expensive Sony cameras 'died' shortly after the warranty expired - and Sony would do nothing for them. Please note that I'm sure this is an anomaly - I own many Sony products though not cameras - and I have never had problems with any of them; nonetheless, though I'm certain that most Sony camera owners are completely satisfied, these people's experiences has left a sour taste in my mouth for Sony's cameras.The Fujifilm X10 12 MP EXR CMOS Digital Camera with f2.0-f2.8 4x Optical Zoom Lens and 2.8-Inch LCD, which was introduced recently, IS in my price range and, as soon as I saw it, I put it into my Amazon Wish List.However, when ""Popular Photography"" reviewed it in the March 2012 issue and I saw the rather dismal high-ISO noise figures listed for the camera, fast lens or no, I immediately removed it from my Wish List. (I have been reading ""Popular Photography"" for over fifty years now and I have learned to trust their test figures implicitly.)Please note that I am sure that the X10 is a fine camera and will please all who buy it but it does not fulfill my requirements. (However, you should keep in mind that the Fujifilm X10 does cost two hundred dollars less than the Canon G1 X.)I first heard about this new Canon G1 X 14.1 MP CMOS Digital Camera with 4x Wide-Angle Optical Image Stabilized Zoom Lens Full 1080p HD Video and 3.0-inch Vari-Angle LCD in January of this year and last month I received an email from ""Popular Photography"" about their test results (which now appear in the April 2012 issue).As soon as I saw their test results figures (and read the entire review to which the email linked), I immediately pre-ordered the camera from Amazon! This is the first camera in ten years to induce me to part with 'coin of the realm' and buy it.You can find all three of these reviews online at ""Popular Photography's"" site if you wish to read them.Of course, when I ordered the camera, I had no idea whether or not I would really like it. I was taking a chance.But now that I actually have the G1 X, I can only say that I am VERY pleased with it, as pleased as possible.Among its other attributes, its lens stops down to f/16, something I have sorely missed for the past ten years. Do you know the old photographer's trick? On a bright sunny day set the aperture to f/16 and then set the shutter speed to the speed of the 'film' [the ISO rating you have chosen]. Set the focus either to Infinity or to ten feet [depending on the nature of your main subject]. Exposure will be perfect and everything will be sharp. On cloudy days, set the aperture to f/11, and so forth. The wider the aperture, of course, the more critical focusing becomes. (I always recommend 'bracketing' your shots, both for focus and exposure; it's easy to do with this camera, either automatically or, my own preference, manually.)This camera, with its relatively large, relatively fast lens (at the wide angle setting; the range is f/2.8 to f/16), its wide range of shutter speeds (60 seconds to 1/4000 of a second), and its ability to create superb pictures even when using a high ISO setting, thus offers a VERY high dynamic range. This means that you will be able to take pictures in just about any lighting condition (and without using flash if that is your preference, as it is mine) and the pictures will turn out exactly the way you want them.I have uploaded some pictures along with the information about the parameters. Other people have uploaded even better pictures than mine and I hope you will look at all of them. You will see just what this camera can achieve under many varied conditions.I have also uploaded a (rather pathetic - sorry about that) 1-minute video which, bad as it is, does show the image capabilities of this camera under some trying conditions (and, if you see any noise, it is solely due to the fact that I had to compress the original video to conform to Amazon's requirements; there is absolutely NO noise in the original video).And in the still images, I see hardly any 'noise' ('grain') no matter under what conditions I take a picture. While the lens is not as fast as I should like (f/2.8 [moderately fast - but I really wish it were f/2.0] at its wide-angle setting to f/5.8 [very slow - and I really wish it were faster] at its maximum telephoto setting), the fact that you can easily use high ISO settings (the range is ISO 100 to ISO 12,800) with little or no loss of image quality (unlike the Fujifilm models) MORE THAN MAKES UP for the lack of lens brightness (and, as a trade-off, slower lenses can produce sharper pictures as focus is not as critical as it is with fast lenses).In other words, you can use a sensitivity rating of ISO 6400 (and sometimes, depending upon the nature of the subject, even ISO 12,800) with hardly any visible noise in the picture! As far as I know, there is no other compact camera on the market which can achieve that!Why does this camera have this capability while other competitors do not? It is because of the sensor size in it. Its sensor is 1.5 inches (the Fujifilm X-10's sensor s only 2/3 inch), it has 14.1 mega-pixels, plus it has Canon's very advanced design for noise reduction (which, by the way, is user-adjustable). A 1.5 inch sensor is almost the same size as the APS-C-sized sensors used in most DSLR cameras. I believe that no other compact fixed-zoom-lens camera has such a large sensor.Naturally a larger sensor requires a larger (and heavier) lens yet Canon has managed to design the lens to a fairly reasonable size and weight (and the camera's overall weight is also quite reasonable - plus it is well-balanced).This absolutely first-rate lens (there can be no other description for it) has a 4:1 zoom range; this may be an inadequate zoom range for some people (especially those who favor 'superzooms') but note that, everything else being equal, the lower the zoom ratio the sharper the lens (""prime"" lenses being the sharpest of all) and the lower the zoom ratio, the lower the lens distortion. This lens's zoom ratio is certainly adequate for me!And it's the large sensor and the large sharp lens which allow for the truly superb pictures this camera produces.A large sensor coupled with a relatively large lens has another major advantage: the ability to make excellent closeup 'portrait' photos (which allow the main subject to be in sharp focus while the background is blurred). Yes, this can be done with post-processing software but here it can be done in-camera. DSLRs can do this routinely but few compact cameras can. (You can also get the same results using fully manual aperture/shutter settings and manual focus.)As with most other digital cameras, there are various scene settings (Kids & Pets, Fireworks, Sports, etc.) which I have not yet used but which will probably come in handy at various times.Multiple facial recognition (as well as red-eye reduction, both prevention before and fixing after taking a flash picture) is also offered as is blink indication. Regarding flash (which I myself use only rarely and then I use only the built-in flash), the camera does have a 'hot-shoe' so that, with an optional bracket, very sophisticated flash attachments (Canon Speedlights for example) can be used.In addition, the built-in flash can be physically lowered into the body when you're not using it, a nice touch. In the 'P' Program setting, I leave the flash in the 'on' position but with the flash body lowered into the camera so it won't fire. Then, when I occasionally do wish to use flash, all I have to do is to raise the flash body and it's ready to go.Naturally burst shooting is present and it appears to be very sophisticated. Automatic bracketing is another feature and, using the available HDR setting, three images can be combined automatically to allow for a high dynamic range (note that the subject must not move; this is primarily for landscapes or cityscapes).This camera has a myriad of possible adjustments; to obtain maximum benefit from them will frankly require a long learning curve (I have just scratched the surface!).However - and this is a BIG however - right out of the box you can use its Auto setting and probably 95+% of your pictures will come out fine (and they will be of far higher quality than almost all other compact fixed-lens cameras and on a par with any produced by DSLRs). If and when you desire to be a bit more creative (in camera), well you can 'play' with the menu adjustments and set the camera to do what you like. (And you need not worry about messing up the settings: there is a quick Reset All option which sets everything back to factory defaults.)Just as on a DSLR, there are options to take pictures in several ways: fully automatically; aperture-priority (you set the lens opening, the camera decides the shutter speed); shutter-priority (you set the shutter speed and the camera decides the aperture); and full manual (you set everything). (This is what I use most of the time.) Note that the camera will show you ""correct"" settings (what it thinks is correct) and you can reset your settings to what the camera has decided or you can ignore that altogether.This model also features a terrific articulating LCD screen. So did my G2 but its size (about an inch diagonal) and its brightness were severely wanting. Not so with this G1 X; the LCD screen is big and bright and I have to tell you that it is my opinion that an articulating LCD screen is the only way to go. The advantages of having one of these becomes very apparent as you use it. As a matter of fact, I would not, under any circumstances, purchase an expensive camera which did not have one.Do you like to shoot in RAW (or RAW + JPEG) mode? It's easy with this camera (and fast too if you have a fast-writing card) and you do NOT need to use Canon's software to process and edit RAW images. [You can view a picture I took in RAW mode and adjusted via software - both done very quickly - in the uploaded photo section.]Are there any possible disadvantages? Sure there are! Automatic focusing in low-light situations is perhaps very slightly slower than I should like but, in fact, I use manual focus for the most part (I use manual aperture and shutter settings most of the time too) and the auto focus is not nearly as slow as some people suggest; obviously it is much faster in bright conditions but it seems adequately fast in most low-light situations too. I know that some people would rather have the ability to turn a lens ring to manually adjust focus (I would too) but such an option is probably not possible at this time with a lens such as this one. In any case, as I have been manually focusing via a menu option for the last ten years, this is no problem for me. (And outdoors I use the 'trick' I mentioned so I generally do not need to focus the lens at all. This 'trick' can be used for high-speed outdoor sports photography.)I also wish there were a ""Bulb"" setting for long exposures but, unfortunately, this camera does not support that. (Truth to tell, in my well over 50 years of taking pictures, I have used the ""Bulb"" setting only two or three times and that was with 35mm film cameras.)Some people have commented on the fact that the optical viewfinder does not display any information (even about focusing, as in true rangefinder cameras) as well as the fact that, at the wide-angle setting, the necessarily large lens obscures the lower left portion (the lens disappears when setting it to telephoto). Though they are correct, and this is one of the few really valid complaints about this camera, at least for me, this is not too significant: I use the optical viewfinder rarely, only when I am taking pictures outdoors under very bright light (and the 3-inch LCD on this camera is so bright - so far I have used it only at its default brightness, 50% - that it may not even be necessary to use the optical viewfinder as often as I did with my older G2, if at all). Nonetheless, the camera really should have an EVF rather than an optical viewfinder. As we're unlikely to see any more reasonably-priced true rangefinder cameras, I believe that the day of the optical viewfinder has passed.So if an optical viewfinder is of major importance to you, you may wish to look elsewhere. However, the mediocrity of this feature is not enough to sway my opinion or enjoyment of the camera.One disadvantage of this particular large lens and large sensor is that it cannot focus very closely (7 inches is about as close as you can get). If you do a LOT of Macro shooting, and do not wish to buy auxiliary lenses, this may not be the camera for you. I only rarely wish to use Macro so this is not a disadvantage for me personally. [But see my uploaded Macro picture of an Iris flower within the ""View and share related images"" section; if you know what you're doing, you can indeed take ultra-closeups with the G1 X.]I have to say that, though it is acceptable, I generally do not care for a 'press and click on' (or 'center-pinch') type of lens cap, much preferring the old-fashioned kind which just slips on (of course I want a cord attachment; this one has it). The internal mechanism of 'press and click on' types can break if not handled carefully. Just my opinion.And regarding the lens, WHY OH WHY do manufacturers of advanced compact cameras NOT put filter threads within their lenses? Canon makes you buy a Canon FADC58C 58mm Filter Adapter for G1 X which, like the adapter I had to use on my G2, is cumbersome and a plain pain to have to use every time you want to attach a filter. You must remove the lens surround ring (and put it somewhere), attach the filter adapter, and then attach the filter. You can't leave this Canon filter adapter mounted full-time because the lens cap won't work with it. So, when you're done shooting using a filter, you must reverse the procedure by retrieving the surround ring, removing the filter and the filter adapter, and then reattaching the surround ring in order to use the lens cap. This is BRILLIANT(?!?) design! [But please see my May 6 update about an inexpensive and complete remedy for this.]However you can see that these 'disadvantages' are QUITE minor (they could be called 'nit-picking') and have no bearing whatsoever on the quality of the pictures you will get or even the ease of taking them.This Canon has many individual and well-designed physical controls (thus minimizing the necessity for using menu options when actually taking pictures) yet very strangely this model does not offer one additional button (which it should have): it would have been nice had Canon included a white balance button to quickly adjust the setting. But the camera does have an 'assignable' button and I assigned white balance to it (so that takes care of that problem!). And, if a situation requires you to change the assignable button, even temporarily, to something else, that is quick and easy to do.The rest of the controls are, again in my opinion, exemplary in design.Of course, in the final analysis the question is: how good are the pictures? I have to say that, based on my own use of the camera, they are, in a word, SUPERB. If you look at the pictures (and the video) I and others have posted here, you can judge for yourself.Color in the 'standard' setting is positively beautiful, vivid and accurate. And, for certain circumstances, there are many color adjustments available (assuming you are shooting JPEG; if shooting RAW, you adjust the color via your RAW processing program). Black-and-White photos are luminous; I can think of no other word to describe them. Sepia-toned pictures are also very, very beautiful.If one were to try to compare pictures made with this model with similar ones made with much more expensive DSLRs, and one did it 'blind' (in other words he/she did not know which photos were made with which camera), I do not think anyone could distinguish between them. That's how high in quality pictures taken with this camera are.I hope that you have found this somewhat lengthy review to be of some value to you (sorry, there's still some more to go!). I have tried to explain my thought processes in the decision to replace my ten-year-old G2 (which I'm still keeping, however) with this new one (which is a much more advanced, sophisticated, and capable model) and, if your wishes are similar to mine, then I am certain that you will be as pleased with the G1 X as I am.I have a couple of small 'point-and-shoots:' the Fujifilm FinePix T300 14 MP Digital Camera with Fujinon 10x Wide Angle Optical Zoom Lens (Black) and the Kodak Easyshare Touch M5370 16 MP Digital Camera with 5x Optical Zoom, HD Video Capture and 3.0-Inch Capacitive Touchscreen LCD (Silver). For what they are they are nice, and my wife and I take them along wherever we go.But, regarding quality of pictures produced, they're not even in the same ballpark as this Canon model. (I gave them 5-stars each but that is within their category, the only fair way, I think, to rate a product.)And you can, if you wish when you first obtain it, just set this camera to its full Auto setting and it will be as easy and as quick as any of those 'point-and-shoots' and, of course, the pictures will be vastly superior. I suggest that you start off that way and, as you become more familiar with it, you'll want to start trying some of the more advanced features. You will never 'outgrow' this camera. Obviously, if you have someone else take a picture, you would merely set the camera to Auto.And as further proof of ease of use (with the caveat that you know what you're doing!), please note that I took all of the pictures (and the video) after just a couple of hours of 'playing' with the camera and WITHOUT reading the instruction manual. Of course operation is rather straightforward and it's quite similar to that of my PowerShot G2. If you have ever used any advanced compact digital camera (including Superzooms, etc.), you should have no difficulty with this one. If you have never used such a camera, the voluminous (242 page) instruction manual found on the included CD-ROM will answer any and all of your questions about this particular camera.My 10-year old Canon PowerShot G2 featured construction of the absolute highest quality; it is still functioning as it did when new (and it still looks new!). This new Canon PowerShot G1 X appears to be constructed with the same integrity (and its body is made of metal, not plastic).In conclusion, it is my belief that, with this camera, no matter what you do or how ""poor"" a photographer you are (and I'm afraid I'm one of the most mediocre, at least aesthetically-speaking), you just can't help but get really fine pictures, something you can't always say with many other models.If you are in the market for a camera such as this, I recommend that, after you investigate this one carefully, if it appeals to you, just buy it.Is it expensive? It most certainly is! But (assuming you have sufficient financial resources), the question to ask is do you get good value for money? In my opinion, the answer is a most resounding 'yes!'However, if, for some reason, you do not like it, and, if you have bought it from Amazon (something I strongly recommend), you merely contact them and they will arrange it such that you can return the camera at no cost to you (and you'll get a refund quickly!). Just make certain that you have given the camera a fair chance over an appropriately lengthy (as necessary) period of intensive study and experimentation.This camera or even this type of camera (essentially very expensive 'point-and-shoot' cameras, albeit extremely advanced) is not for everyone. It's not even for the majority of people. But I believe that there are enough people who would rather have this type than a DSLR such that Canon will sell a significant number of them. The fact that this camera seems to be in relatively short supply confirms my thoughts.As I stated at the beginning of this review, I and some other people desire an advanced, highly capable, camera with a high-quality fixed-zoom-lens, a large sensor, and the ability to take pictures under many varied conditions (including low-light without flash) and have those pictures turn out exactly as desired (and at the same, or at the very least practically the same, high image quality as those which can be obtained with much more expensive DSLRs). In my opinion, this one is IT!Thus I give this camera my highest possible recommendation and, if you buy one, I hope you like it as much as I do.Thank you for reading all of this (perhaps the ""War and Peace"" of camera reviews?) and for considering my opinions.Lawrence H. Bulk==================================================================================================================================Update: May 6, 2012Back when I bought that PowerShot G2, Canon included a 32 MB 'starter' Compact Flash card. No such luck with this one. Canon included NO card - plus the camera has NO internal memory. That means that you MUST buy a card at the same time you buy the camera; I bought two (I always like backups) SanDisk Extreme Pro 16GB, SDHC, UHS-1 Flash Memory Card SDSDXPA-016G-X46,Black, a very good one - and it writes and reads very fast; the 16 GB size is sufficient for me as I download pictures to my computer (and back them up to external hard drives) at least once a day (and with two cards, I have plenty of capacity).There are some other accessories I recommend that you buy (in addition to an SD card): this Power 2000 PT72 Replacement Recharger for Canon NB-10L Battery or P2K ACD-347 and two (2) Power2000 1200Mah Lithium Battery Replacement For Canon NB-10L Battery (For Canon SX40 HS Camera). (Why two spare batteries? Because, while this camera is not a 'battery hog,' nonetheless, its battery does not last quite as long as I should like. Anyway, that is my recommendation.) Fortunately, neither of these two accessories are expensive.I bought this COSMOS  Brown Leather Case Cover Bag For Canon Powershot G1X Digital Camera DC G1 X + Cosmos cable tie which, at the time, was the only non-OEM case being offered by Amazon. While its price is good, Amazon now has other cases (which look almost the same as mine) for much less money; you'll want to investigate them.==================================================================================================================================Update: June 8, 2014While still an excellent camera, this unit has now been superseded in my estimation by the Fujifilm X-S1 12MP EXR CMOS Digital Camera with Fujinon F2.8 to F5.6 Telephoto Lens and Ultra-Smooth 26x Manual Zoom (24-624mm).Though the Fujifilm does not have nearly as large a sensor nor the ISO range that the Canon does, and thus cannot produce such wonderful low-light high-ISO photographs as can the Canon, overall, at least for the kind of photos I take, it is a far superior camera. Its versatility and ease-of-use make it my ""go-to"" camera. On our last vacation, I did not even bother to take the Canon along, relying completely on the Fujifilm for still pictures. And believe me, the quality of the photos it produced requires no apologies. Having many dedicated settings buttons, as opposed to the Canon's menu-driven ones (buttons are faster and easier to use in the field), and having a very high zoom-ratio lens (of very high quality) as opposed to the limited zoom range on the Canon, trump the Canon's advantages, in my opinion.In addition, the Fujifilm is much less expensive. I strongly suggest that anyone reading this carefully investigate the Fujifilm X-S1 Digital Camera.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 21, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R14WQ5A9PFCARQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006UMM2BW#wasThisHelpful","R14WQ5A9PFCARQ","A3GVXKCTFN3YDN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3GVXKCTFN3YDN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My wife and I were fortunate enough to have seen this new restoration of one of the landmarks of film, Georges Mlis' A TRIP TO THE MOON, at its third presentation last year. That was on September 6, 2011 at the Samuel Goldwyn Theater at the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. And, believe it or not, EVERY SEAT (over 1000!) was taken and there were hundreds of people outside hoping for ""no-show"" seats (I understand there were none!) And this for a 1902 film!This film had not been seen in a color version in over 100 years. For anyone not familiar with it, it is one of the seminal motion pictures and it was, at the time it was produced, one of the longest films yet made (about 15 minutes) and it was certainly one of the most elaborate.Most people have seen the iconic image of the moon being struck in the 'eye' by the rocket and many people have seen the entire film - but never like this!In addition to the color, much more of the left side of the image is now visible and there are two additional scenes which appear in no other edition and have not been seen since the first release of the film.How did they get color in 1902? Each color release print was hand-painted frame by frame!I had the opportunity, after the Academy showing to speak personally with Serge Bromberg of Lobster Films (who restored this film) as well as Tom Burton of Technicolor Restoration Services who handled the 'nitty-gritty' work in preparing the film for exhibition. Their enthusiasm was VERY apparent and VERY contagious. I can tell you that the entire audience was thrilled and amazed.(Tom Burton and his Technicolor team were the people involved with the amazing and wonderful restoration of Wings [Blu-ray] [also available as the DVD Wings] which I also recommend to all.)The A TRIP TO THE MOON film was shown twice that evening along with other newly restored early [c. 1900] films, some, believe it or not, in 3D and color!!! What an evening that was! These films all had to be seen to be believed!One of the remarkable things about the restoration of A TRIP TO THE MOON is the decision to leave the print exactly as it was originally. This particular print, the only color one which survived, was made for a distributor in Spain. Hence, after the projectile is pushed into the 'gun' by the ladies, you will see a flag - and it is NOT the French Tricolor; rather it is the red-yellow-red Spanish flag, which was painted that way for the Spanish audiences. (Serge Bromberg told me that it could have been changed to the Tricolor but, in the interest of the authenticity and integrity of this particular print, the restorers decided to leave it just as it was. I APPLAUD that decision!)So you will see this particular print almost exactly as it was seen in 1902.That evening at the Academy, the film was shown twice, the first time with accompaniment by the music group AIR (the 'official' music for this release), the second time with something much more appropriate: Serge Bromberg reading Georges Mlis' own script.My wife and I were not keen on AIR's music; neither were most of the people to whom we spoke afterwards.Even with AIR's music though, the evening was one of those rare magical events people attend only a few times in their lives. We'll never forget it.Of course, NONE of this would mean anything at all if the film A TRIP TO THE MOON itself were not good. But it is - as its thousands of prints and showings over the years attest. Frankly, not only is the movie a breakthrough in cinema history, it is a great deal of fun. (I wonder if those participating in its creation could have envisioned that people 110 years later would still be watching it and enjoying it?)Do you remember what the Internet was like in its early days? Primitive, sometimes frustrating, but new and exciting and with such promise of what was to come ...That is exactly what this film was to cinema.Thus it is with profound regret that I have to tell you why I am giving this A Trip to the Moon Restored (Limited Edition, Steelbook)  [Blu-ray] only three stars (and why I feel that I'm being generous).AIR's music is even more dreadful than I had remembered it from the Academy showing of September 6, 2011. I'm sure that some (who knows, maybe even most) people will like it but this is MY opinion: it's AWFUL and COMPLETELY inappropriate for this film!AIR's track is the ONLY audio option you have when watching the restored color version. This is unconscionable, again in my opinion.I do not know why ANYONE would have commissioned such a group to write music for this film. I can only assume that someone hoped to attract a 'younger' and 'hip' audience for this film. Perhaps AIR or their recording company helped with the funding of the restoration. But I believe that the thinking behind commissioning and writing this score were severely flawed - such music CANNOT add to the enjoyment of a film such as this one (and the 'hip' kids aren't even going to WATCH this film, much less buy it) - and I believe the fact that this score is the ONLY one available accompanying the restored color version is a disgrace, not at all keeping with the tone of the film.Within the Bonus section, the black-and-white version of the film is presented. There are three audio choices available for that version, any one of which would have been better for accompanying the color version. But we have no choice in that regard.We SHOULD have been given similar audio choices for the color version (including AIR's music for those who want it). Period.What a shame - after all the magnificent, difficult, expensive, and time-consuming restoration work done by Serge Bromberg, Lobster Films, the Groupama Gan Foundation for Cinema, and the Technicolor Foundation for Cinema Heritage - to have released a travesty like this (and I'm referring only to this particular Blu-ray/DVD set).I myself will be watching the color version 'mute,' that is, with the sound turned off or I may record one of the tracks from the B&W version and play that in conjunction with the color version.That's the only way I'll ever watch this again.I must tell you that this set does not, in my opinion, represent good value for money. We get the color version of the film (about 15 minutes), a documentary (quite fascinating, about an hour in length - but I cannot imagine anyone watching it more than two or three times), an interview with AIR, the B&W version mentioned (another 15 minutes), and two other Georges Mlis shorts (both of which were previously released on Flicker Alley's Georges Melies: First Wizard of Cinema 1896-1913 set; together they run about 12 minutes).That's it!The DVD has exactly the same program as the Blu-ray. I cannot understand Flicker Alley's rationale for selling this set in this way.I shouldn't tell you this but, if you want to see the color restoration of A TRIP TO THE MOON, it is easily found, albeit illegally I'm sure, all over the web. And though I certainly do NOT recommend this, you can download it for free if you wish. I normally would not even mention such a thing except for the fact that I am so utterly disappointed with this Blu-ray/DVD set.Please take into consideration that my negative comments apply ONLY to this Blu-ray/DVD release, NOT - repeat NOT - to the magnificent color restoration effected by the people involved. The colors in the restoration are positively breathtaking and seeing this movie in color radically transforms it (at least for me).(Please note that the audio error in the original Blu-ray disc has been corrected, the requested replacement discs have been mailed, and all sets purchased from now on will contain the remastered disc.)Flicker Alley contacted me and said that, if I wished to return the set, they would refund my money (that was very fair of them). I shall not do this (I'll keep my set), mostly out of sympathy with Flicker Alley, a small, very dedicated, company which desires to make significant films of the past available on video for the enjoyment of all.But this is the last time I'll ever pre-order any video release; I shall wait to see other peoples' reviews first!Other reviewers here on Amazon are very positive about this release but obviously I myself cannot and will not recommend that you buy this set - and I am truly, truly sorry to have to write that.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 14, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1BWE69LGIJQKA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006XEH7EO#wasThisHelpful","R1BWE69LGIJQKA","A3GVXKCTFN3YDN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3GVXKCTFN3YDN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As there are already over two hundred prior reviews for this player, I expect few will bother to read mine. Nonetheless, I should like to make a few comments about the BDP-93.I was one of the people who was a beta-tester for this player, having received my first one from Oppo themselves immediately upon its being made available to us testers. I have upgraded my player each and every time a new firmware release (including the beta ones) were introduced. While there were a very few anomalies present when I first got it, these have all been corrected. (I sent some examples of problems to the Oppo technical department and they were VERY responsive to me; they corrected in a short time all the problems I demonstrated to them. At one point I sent them a disc containing some FLAC files with which I was having some trouble. They verified my findings and fixed the problem.)I liked this player so much that, at the beginning of the year, I bought a second one (this time from Amazon). It too functions perfectly (and has also been updated as firmware releases have been made available).Playback of Blu-ray discs (of which I now own four, including Wings [Blu-ray] and Hugo (Three-disc Combo: Blu-ray 3D / Blu-ray / DVD / Digital Copy), which arrived today, is exemplary; ditto for DVDs. The picture quality is just superb. (While the Hugo disc set includes a 3D Blu-ray disc and the Oppo is, of course, 3D capable, I do not, as yet, have a 3D video projector. Maybe someday ...)Playback of CDs and, especially, SACDs is nothing short of fantastic, the best I have ever heard.But I do not use my players primarily for disc playback; rather, they are used as media players. If you are familiar with such players, you know that most of them (the good ones, at least) are VERY expensive and many of them will not play ALL types of music and/or video files and/or discs.This one WILL play all of them, and superbly, and it will do so at a reasonable price. Plus, of course, it plays every kind of 12cm disc introduced thus far.I encode much of my music into the FLAC file format and many of my DVDs and Blu-rays into the MKV (H.264) file format. I keep these files on separate Western Digital My Passport Essential SE 1 TB USB 2.0 Portable External Hard Drive (Midnight Black) external hard drives.While my initial player had some problems with my FLAC files, as mentioned above, there are now absolutely NO problems with any of them. And watching movies in MKV format from a drive is no different in either image or sound quality from watching the original DVD or Blu-ray. (Plus, when watching movies from a Matroska Video file, I do not have to endure all the menus, FBI warnings, previews, etc.)As I stated above, this player can handle any currently-known file format and, at its price, is the lowest-cost such media player of which I'm aware. (It has certainly handled every kind of file I have thrown at it!)Placing my music and movies on hard drives makes keeping them and carrying them about much more convenient and space-efficient. I actually have two drives each for my music and movies; the second one is, of course, a backup ""just in case.""On my movie hard drive, so far, I have well over one hundred feature length films stored (many of them in HD format) - and I can carry the drive containing all of them in my pocket! (And the drive still has plenty of room to spare!)If I were to start playing my music from my music hard drive (mostly FLAC files but also some MP3s) and I started on the first of the month and just let it play without stopping, at the end of the month I still would be nowhere nearly finished! (And this drive too has plenty of additional room.)And that's just what I've encoded so far. Obviously, as I continue to encode music and movies, I shall require more drives (or larger capacity ones) but, as of right now, and for at least the near future, I'm set.My two OPPO BDP-93 Universal Network 3D Blu-ray Disc Players are each connected to separate high-fidelity sound systems (and video projectors) and they have become my primary source for listening and viewing either from discs or, mostly, from hard drives (though I do have to say that SACD discs and, of course, LPs still sound better than FLAC files created from CDs or the CDs themselves).I just plug either my music drive or my movie drive into the Oppo's USB 2.0 input, and I can play away! Even just a few years ago, who would have ever thought ... ?If you are a sound enthusiast as I am and would like to own a media player, there is nothing else even close to its price which will match, much less surpass, the Oppo BDP-93 both in formats accepted (discs and files) as well as in ease of use. (Netflix streaming and some other similar offerings including Pandora [though unfortunately not Amazon Pay-per-view or Amazon Prime] are bonuses.)And while I'm fairly certain that the Oppo BDP-95 Blu Ray DVD Player would sound somewhat better, look at the price differential. Only you could determine if it were worth it to you.Thus I can recommend this BDP-93 as highly as possible. If I could give it 10 stars, I would. And if I could give it 100 stars, I'd give it that!In conclusion, as I stated in my title to these comments, if you want the very best in media players, in my opinion, this is it.I hope that these comments were of some interest to you and I thank you for reading and considering them.Lawrence H.

"Over the years I have read quite a few books about Germany between the wars, such as Before the Deluge: A Portrait of Berlin in the 1920s by Otto Friedrich and Berlin Diary: The Journal of a Foreign Correspondent, 1934-1941 by William L. Shirer. In addition I have read many books about Hitler and the Nazis and World War II, as well as three voluminous (and excellent) biographies (Toland, Fest, and Kershaw) of Hitler himself. Naturally I also read (when I was a junior in high school) The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich: A History of Nazi Germany by Shirer. (It cost $10.00 when first published and it took me a while to save up that much money but I did and I got the book.) In my opinion, it's still the best overall history of Nazi Germany ever written.But these books are, of necessity, generalized and they are primarily concerned with political history, military history, and/or economic history.There have also been some books written from Germans individuals' points of view, such as the two Saul Friedlander books Nazi Germany and the Jews: Volume 1: The Years of Persecution 1933-1939 and The Years of Extermination: Nazi Germany and the Jews, 1939-1945 as well as those by Victor Klemperer I Will Bear Witness: A Diary of the Nazi Years, 1933-1941 and I Will Bear Witness 1942-1945: A Diary of the Nazi Years.But these are told, obviously, from the German (Jewish) point of view. What about the American point of view?While there were many Americans living and working in Germany during the Weimar Republic and after, other than ""Berlin Diary,"" (one man's point of view) I had read no books about these other Americans' varied views about actual life there during the Republic and during its collapse and replacement by the Nazi dictatorship. Recently, Erik Larson wrote an excellent book In the Garden of Beasts: Love, Terror, and an American Family in Hitler's Berlin about the first US Ambassador to Nazi Germany, William Dodd and his family. This book is superb reading material (and I highly recommend it to you) but, concentrating on the Dodd family who came to Germany only in 1933, it does not go into much detail about the rise of Adolf Hitler and the Nazis during the 1920s.Andrew Nagorski's new Hitlerland: American Eyewitnesses to the Nazi Rise to Power is the first book I have ever seen which discusses MANY individual Americans' impressions of this rise and later consolidation. Though the book itself is written with the benefit of hindsight, the quotations from many people - including William L. Shirer, Howard K. Smith, other American correspondents and broadcasters, William Dodd, Truman Smith and his wife, and other American diplomats, many other ""ordinary"" Americans who happened either to be living there or just visiting, and even Ernst 'Putzi' Hanfstaengl and his wife, as well as a few other Nazi ""insiders"" - all of the quotations were written at the time, in other words, WITHOUT the benefit of hindsight.These writings are taken from diaries, articles, and books (both published and unpublished).It is the ""you are there"" feeling which makes this book so valuable. Essentially social history, it shows the day-by-day rise of the Nazis and their attainment and consolidation of power in what had been the most civilized country in the world, as viewed by Americans living there - some in high positions, but mostly ordinary people.I'm certain that nothing like this has ever been written before.None of the above would be of much use to the average reader if the writing itself were mediocre and pedantic. Fortunately, this is NOT the case. Andrew Nagorski is a writer who knows how to tell a story and who knows how to organize the varied (and often contradictory) published and unpublished writings of the actual authors, both their writings at the time as well as their writings after the fact (and sometimes they tried to 'clarify' - that is revise - what they had actually written and thought at the time). His writing is both very interesting and very informative.Some Americans tried to ignore the situation altogether. Some were either ""neutral"" or pro-Nazi. And some were most definitely anti-Nazi. Some started off as one but. through observation and sometimes personal experiences, became the other. But all of their writings are extremely interesting and very valuable.I personally thank Andrew Nagorski for undertaking this monumental effort. I had trouble putting the book down! I think anyone who is interested in this facet of 20th Century history will also find this book to be an excellent resource and good reading.There is a voluminous and useful Notes section as well as an excellent Bibliography.I give this book my highest recommendation.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 4, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RPW8VN6G693H8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=143919100X#wasThisHelpful","RPW8VN6G693H8","A3GVXKCTFN3YDN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3GVXKCTFN3YDN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Until a couple of years ago, my wife and I were the ""buy-one-pot-a-week-at-the-Acme-Supermarket (with an additional $10.00 purchase)"" kind of people. Those pots and pans are of reasonably good quality for the money and they would last a few years (until the next Acme sale when we had to buy replacements for all of them).About two years ago, my wife, needing a new frying pan, and the Acme having no sale just then, saw a Circulon frying pan in a store at a reasonable price. She bought it and was amazed at its quality. Since then, she has bought one or two more Circulon pots and pans and has been VERY satisfied with all of them.Now we have this Circulon Symmetry Chocolate Hard Anodized Nonstick Cookware Set, 11-Piece set. The pots and pans in this set are of much higher quality than those she had purchased individually at stores, as good as those previous ones are. This set is top-of-the-line cookware. You get seven pots/pans and four glass lids. The construction quality of the items in this set are immediately apparent - and it is nothing short of superb. These are heavy pots and pans, much heavier than any we have owned. (Perhaps ""heavy"" is not such a good descriptive word: ""solid"" might be better but they do weigh noticeably more than any of our other ones - and my wife says that that is a good thing; the food will cook faster and more evenly.) We have never in our married life owned a cookware set of such high quality.The older Circulon pots and pans we have purchased are still in first-class condition (after a lot of use over a couple of years) and we believe that those in this set will last even longer, MUCH longer!This set comes with a Limited Lifetime Warranty; you don't get better than that.Circulon claims that the pots and pans in this set are dishwasher-proof. They probably are; my wife says she ""may"" try putting one in the dishwasher to test that claim but I sensed a distinct reluctance on her part to do so.Another claim is that, even though this set features a non-stick surface (a top-of-the-line one to boot), you can use metallic utensils with it. There is NO WAY she's going to try that; we have enough plastic utensils already so she will continue to use those. Why take a chance with such a beautiful set?In any case, even though we may not try those two features of this set, I can say absolutely that this cookware set is the finest we have ever seen and it's even beautiful to look at. The bronze color is really elegant.Convenience features abound, one of which, which my wife pointed out to me last night, is pouring lips on the handle saucepan. How nice! We have never seen that before! Circulon also claims that the exteriors of the pots and pans are non-stick too so cleaning will be easy.Is the set expensive? In absolute terms, you could probably answer yes.BUT - the true question is: Is it expensive for what you get? Based on what we see and based on our previous experience with Circulon pots and pans, I can positively say NO. In fact, at its current price, it is, in both my and my wife's opinion, a bargain!I can tell you that we are now very definitely ""Circulon Pots and Pans"" kind of people. That's our brand!Thank you for reading this. If you need a new cookware set, we VERY highly recommend this one.Lawrence H. BulkP.S. I suppose I should mention that my wife has cooked several meals using her new Circulon pans and nothing stuck on the inside (as would be expected) nor did anything stick on the outside (though she didn't spill much). And the food definitely did cook faster (much faster) and more evenly than it had with our older Acme pans which are much lighter in weight than these new Circulons. She says this new set even appears to cook faster than the older Circulon pans she had purchased previously. In any case, the food came out delicious (as always). My wife is a truly superb cook (among her other wonderful attributes, one of which is putting up with me!) and, though I admit I am highly prejudiced, I believe that she deserves a high-quality set like this Circulon Symmetry one.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 1, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RK25X03XCCHFY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005GYUMY4#wasThisHelpful","RK25X03XCCHFY","A3GVXKCTFN3YDN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3GVXKCTFN3YDN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have quite a few portable devices which require charging or powering via a USB power adapter. (Look around: I'll bet you do too!) Over the past few years, I have purchased a number of USB Power Adapters and, while all are satisfactory in SOME ways, until I received this one, none were fully satisfactory in ALL ways.For example, some adapters will work ONLY via AC power. And others will work ONLY via DC (car) power. When I wished to use the AC ones in my car (or I wish to use the DC ones in my home), I had to plug those adapters into suitable additional adapters. This, of course, makes for a 'clunky' arrangement (especially in a small car such as we have).I really wanted ONE adapter which could work with both types of power - in other words, an ""all-in-one.""Amazon has many such adapters for sale but all that I investigated had some VERY negative comments about their claims vs. actual performance.While investigating, I came across this Maximal Power AC DC USB Universal Dual USB AC/DC Wall and Car Power Adapter Charger for All USB Powered Devices, iPhone, iPod, and iPad; at that time, it had no reviews at all. But, when I saw that Amazon itself was selling it, I decided to take a chance. (If it were no good, Amazon would take it back and they would even pay for the return shipping. But I have found that, in my experience, if Amazon itself sells it, it's good!)Well, while it is the first such ""all-in-one"" adapter I have bought, I can say that its claims are 100% accurate. This single compact adapter will work both in the home as well as in the car.Not only is it an ""all-in-one"" adapter, it also provides plenty of power to charge or power ANY device which requires a USB power supply. It has two USB outputs: one of 2.1 A and the other of 1.0 A.1.0 A is sufficient for most USB-powered devices but 2.1 A is necessary for some. This supplies both. I have used it with my Dell Streak 7 Wi-Fi Tablet using the 2.1 A outlet and, not only did it power the device, it also charged it up very fast, even while I was using the Streak on the internet.It also quickly charges my new SanDisk SDMX22-004G-A57B Sansa Clip Zip 4 GB, Blue using the 1.0 A outlet while it is operating too.I have not yet tried charging/powering two high-powered devices at the same time but, in the real world, I would never do that anyway (especially in a car which is where I'll be using it most of the time). I don't know, but I'd be willing to bet that it could power both the Dell Streak and the SanDisk Clip Zip at the same time. (Maybe some day I might try that just to see, but not right now.)As far as I am concerned, its performance is splendid and exactly as described. Its construction quality appears to be first-rate. It has an unobtrusive yet bright blue LED indicating that the unit is powered and is supplying power. Both its plugs fold conveniently into the body, making for a small unit to carry about (it easily fits into a pocket). In addition, I think its price is reasonable.So, in conclusion, I can say that I am very pleased and fully satisfied with this device. How pleased and satisfied? I just ordered three (3) more of them!Thank you for reading this. I hope it has been of some help to you.Lawrence H.

"This Belkin USB 2.0 4-Port Ultra-Mini Hub (F5U407) is not perfect (what is?) but, especially at its price, it offers excellent performance and value.My situation is somewhat unique.I have an OPPO BDP-93 Universal Network 3D Blu-ray Disc Player which has two USB 2.0 ports, one on the front of the unit and one on the rear. The rear port is used primarily for connection of the Wi-fi antenna (powered via the USB port), necessary if you are, as I am, using Wi-fi for the Oppo's Internet connection. The front connection is primarily for external hard drives used when operating the Oppo as a media center (which is how I use the Oppo most of the time).But I wanted to plug a Western Digital My Book for Mac 1 TB USB 2.0 Desktop External Hard Drive which has its own AC power supply into the rear USB port and leave it there permanently along with the Wi-fi antenna (leaving the front port available for other drives) so I bought this little hub.With both items connected, the hub works perfectly and both of the devices function normally.Now in at least one previous review, I had read that USB 3.0 devices do not work with this hub. I own several Western Digital My Passport Essential SE 1 TB  USB 3.0 Portable External Hard Drive (Black); these units are powered by the USB port.I left my two previous devices connected and I added one of these USB 3.0 drives to the hub.It functioned perfectly; the hub displayed both of my hard drives and the Oppo remained connected to the Internet via the Wi-fi antenna. So, as is evident, two USB-powered devices (the antenna and the drive), along with the AC-powered drive were connected and all of them worked.And a USB 3.0 USB-powered device works perfectly through this hub, at least with my Blu-ray player.Naturally the speed of transfer is only that of USB 2.0; the Oppo's ports are only USB 2.0. But for music and HD video, USB 2.0 is all one needs.Then, just for fun, I connected a second WD My Passport Essential USB 3.0 drive (so I had four devices connected, two USB 2.0 and two USB 3.0, three USB-powered and one AC-powered). This second USB 3.0 drive was initially recognized too but, when I closed it and went back into the Oppo's menu, only the first WD My Passport (3.0) and the WD My Book (2.0) were shown.I turned the Oppo off and then on again and, as before, all three drives were shown but, again as before, when I closed one of the My Passports out, only the two other drives were displayed. (The antenna remained fully functional at all times, as did the AC-powered USB 2.0 drive.)It appears to me that I can connect three items to the Oppo, its Wi-fi antenna, a self-powered USB 2.0 drive, and a USB-powered USB 3.0 drive, and these all work perfectly, but I cannot reliably connect a fourth device (another USB 3.0 USB-powered drive).This is certainly not important for me at all, nor, can I imagine, for anyone else; I tried this just as an experiment (and note that I did not use the front USB port at all). I will be keeping the powered WD My Book (USB 2.0) permanently connected through this hub along with the Wi-fi antenna; when I wish to use one of my WD My Passport USB 3.0 drives, I'll just plug that one into the front USB port (as these are portable, I remove them from the port when they're not in use).I have seen some complaints about the longevity of this product. I cannot comment about this just now as I received mine only yesterday. But Belkin offers a ""Lifetime Warranty"" (though there were no details enclosed in my package). Of course, as it would cost almost as much to mail a defective hub back to Belkin as it would to just buy a new one, I'm pretty sure that few, if any, people will use the warranty.I must say that I have owned another hub (a different brand) for ten years now (it's so old that it's only USB 1.1) and it has always worked perfectly. So I am somewhat confident that this hub will last for a while too (hubs are, as computer accessories go, relatively simple affairs). Please take into account this hub's extremely low price: I'm going to order a couple more of them and even if one (or more) lasts only a year or two, I won't feel that I've been ""taken.""Please note again that I am not using this hub with a computer; I am using it with an Oppo BDP-93 so my situation may or may not apply to you. However I feel sure that my comments would apply when using this hub with any Blu-ray or DVD player which has a USB input.Thus I highly recommend this very inexpensive Belkin USB 2.0 hub.

"I bought this Seiko Women's SUP052 Two Tone Stainless Steel Analog with White Dial Watch for my wife for her birthday (which has not yet arrived). She had seen it in a major department store's advertisement and had shown it to me. But she had no idea that I would actually buy it for her.Of course, prior to purchasing it, I checked here on Amazon. (I ALWAYS do that before I buy ANYTHING!) I'm glad I did. Not only does Amazon offer this watch for MUCH less than that department store's 'sale' price, Amazon is now offering the watch themselves with free shipping (when I bought mine, receiving it on December 15, 2011, Amazon was selling it only through a 'partner' which nonetheless offered excellent service and an excellent price).As my wife does not yet know that I have bought the watch, I have kept it hidden from her. Since it is a solar watch, each day I put it on a windowsill (well out of her sight) so that I can keep the battery fully charged until I give it to her.I have had it for three weeks now - and it keeps perfect time. It has not gained or lost even one minute (there is no second hand). Seiko has always had a good reputation for reliability and this one certainly lives up to that reputation.I can highly recommend this wristwatch to any woman who likes its styling (and to any man who wants to surprise a woman in his life).Thank you for reading this and for considering my opinion.Lawrence H. Bulk==================================================================================================================================Update: February 1, 2012I gave the watch to my wife on her birthday. I had hidden it in our kitchen (in a place where she would never find it) and, the night before, I put out a birthday card for her. She always goes down to the kitchen before I do, and she saw the card, but no present. When I came down and wished her a Happy Birthday, she grumpily said, ""Well I guess that's what I would expect from you - no present.""I had kept the original major department store advertisement and just then I ""accidentally"" found it.I said to her, ""Now why did I keep this?,"" showing her the advertisement which had several watches featured.She replied, ""Because I liked one of the watches.""""Which one?,"" I asked.""I don't remember,"" she replied.I then asked, ""Could it be THIS one?"" as I pulled out the watch from its hiding place and opened its box.I won't tell you what happened next - but I WILL tell you that she was both VERY surprised and VERY pleased.By the way, the watch has STILL not gained nor lost even one minute!","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 7, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2NQVU1NF5LK6N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004JOKZPI#wasThisHelpful","R2NQVU1NF5LK6N","A3GVXKCTFN3YDN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3GVXKCTFN3YDN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This HDMI switch, 5 in, 1 out, with remote control; HDMI certified, Built-in Equalizer, Blue Jeans Cable brand is an excellent unit. It is very well-designed and very well-constructed. It has no on/off switch so it is always powered when plugged in to an AC outlet (I have mine plugged into an external switch so I can manually turn it on or off without unplugging it but I think that for most people this would be unnecessary).The Blue Jeans Cable Company is also excellent, packaging this switcher so beautifully that I can only compare it to the way fine jewelry is packaged.I attached my three (3) HDMI-equipped devices (two Blu-ray players and one Roku) to this switcher (it can accommodate five items) and plugged it into my LG HX350T 720p Front Projector - Black which has only one HDMI input and not only did this switcher recognize which unit was powered, it transmitted both picture and sound to the projector which in turn sent the sound to my amplifier/speakers.I first tried the unit while powering up only one unit at a time and the switcher worked automatically; when I powered up all three together, it was easy to use the included remote control to manually switch between them. (This was only a try-out; obviously most of the time I'll power up only one unit at a time.)Sources can also be changed manually via front panel controls so that use of the remote control is not mandatory.I highly recommend this little HDMI switcher to anyone who needs such an item.

"Though it's certainly not the 'best' silent film ever made, WINGS, a World War I ""war in the air"" movie, is my personal favorite silent film. I have waited a VERY long time for the release of this wonderful new beautifully-tinted restoration - you can order it here: Wings [Blu-ray]. It is the best version ever released to the public and, most likely, the best version which will EVER be released to the public! (A DVD version, containing the same new restoration, is also being offered and it can be ordered here: Wings.) Until now, NO ONE (except someone old enough to have seen it in 1927-1929) has been able to view this film in essentially the manner intended by its creators.I believe that anyone and everyone who has purchased any home video discs for their personal enjoyment should buy this one too - and as soon as possible. This film truly demonstrates Hollywood at its best and shows clearly why Hollywood films matter so much to us. I think WINGS would be the cornerstone of any home movie library.The story is superb, the directing is superb, the acting is superb, and the aerial scenes - well, they are BY FAR the best and most exciting ever done in the entire history of the movies and they are the best that ever WILL be done. They have never been duplicated nor will they ever be. Why do I make such definitive statements about the flying sequences? Because the flying sequences in WINGS are all real - repeat: ALL REAL! And they sure look it! NO ""trickery"" can duplicate ""real!"" Please see below for further details.I first saw the film in 1969 at the George Eastman House in Rochester, NY during the fifth Cinecon (Cinecon is still going strong). We were told that this was the first public showing of the complete film in almost forty years (clips have been used in other Paramount Films, most notably during the beginning of The War of the Worlds (Special Collector's Edition)).Two years later, WINGS was shown at the Paramount Theater in New York City. I still have the original LIFE Magazine review of that showing. (The lines to get in went around the block!)In 1985 Paramount released a LaserDisc edition as well as a VHS tape. Until now, these two versions were the only officially authorized home video releases of WINGS, at least in the U.S.A. These editions featured a beautiful organ score newly composed by that master of silent film accompaniment, the late, great Gaylord Carter. Though originally WINGS was shown in tinted prints, this LaserDisc edition was in black-and-white only and, like all prints I had seen until now, it was made from the print which survived in the Cinmathque Franaise.In 2002-3, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (""AMPAS"") had a retrospective of all Best Picture winners up to that time. The program began with the second winner THE BROADWAY MELODY. AMPAS saved WINGS for last; it was shown two nights - May 15 and May 16, 2003. The Samuel Goldwyn Theater (cap. 1012) was sold out both nights. I know. My wife and I were there, having flown to Los Angeles especially for this showing - and we attended BOTH nights! (Note: WINGS did not actually win for Best Picture; that category was not instituted by the Academy until several years later. SUNRISE won for Best Artistic Achievement; WINGS won for Best Production.)This showing was of what was called a 'partially-restored' print; some tinting was in evidence, but not as much as that for which I had hoped. However it was the first time I had ever seen the film with any of its tints present. (None of the Handschiegl color process effects - see below - had been restored at that time.) This print too was derived from that Cinmathque Franaise print and was essentially a fifth-generation print. However, the music (and the recreated 1927 sound effects) played, with a live orchestra, was the original music which had been used at the first showings of the film. Gillian Anderson, a wonderful musicologist, had recreated the score (which had been arranged by J. S. Zamecnik, using some fairly well-known classical and popular music) and she conducted the orchestra. I had not thought that anything could match Gaylord Carter's score, but this one did, at least in my opinion. (Adrian Johnston had recreated the sound effects; they were so good that it was possible to distinguish the German airplane engines from the 'American' ones.)Recently, on September 6, 2011, the AMPAS had a special program featuring the newly-restored COLOR print of Georges Mlis' A TRIP TO THE MOON (1902). What a fantastic restoration!! (I am anxiously awaiting the release of this movie on home video; it has been announced by Flicker Alley - I have already ordered a copy - for release sometime in March 2012 [Amazon is now offering it here: A Trip to the Moon Restored [Blu-ray]). You can see a couple of very short clips from this new restoration in the movie ""Hugo"" [see it in 3D if possible].) My wife and I attended that program and, afterwards, I had the opportunity to speak with Mr. Tom Burton, head of the preservation department at Technicolor Los Angeles, who had been in charge of that color restoration project. He told me about the forthcoming release of this new Blu-ray (and DVD) edition of WINGS, of which he was also in charge.Mr. Burton told me that he and his team, working with the original tinting requirements (which miraculously survive in the Paramount library), would reproduce ALL of the original tints, including the Handschiegl color process effects (a stencil process used for machine-gun fire and flames from shot-down airplanes), and that this edition will look better than anything seen since WINGS' first release. He also told me (and these are his exact words) that I will be ""blown away by the sound track.""He was right! On both counts!The new Blu-ray and DVD will not feature Ms. Anderson's music reconstruction, however. J. S. Zamecnik's original 1927 score has been re-orchestrated and arranged by Dominik Hauser, another musicologist, along with some piano filler played by Frederick Hodges. In 1927, sound effects (machine guns, airplane engines, etc.) were performed behind the screen. Ben Burtt, a noted (and superb) sound engineer has recreated and augmented these effects for the new restoration.In addition, Gaylord Carter's score will be present on a second audio track (and this is very welcome). When one watches this track, note that the timings are different; this is due to the fact that this track begins immediately with the movie rather than, as on the first track, with the various Paramount logo montage (very beautiful, by the way) and does not include the intermission or the end restoration credits. As far as I can determine, you cannot switch between the audio tracks (at least on the Blu-ray); when you start Play, you must select one 'version' or the other.This film is being released as the first title in Paramount's 100th Anniversary retrospective and it is one of the 'crown jewels' in Paramount's oeuvre. Paramount has tried its best to ensure top quality for this restoration (Paramount claims the film has been restored frame-by-frame!) and, in my opinion, they have succeeded.I ordered my copy on November 15, 2011 immediately upon reading Paramount's press release (obviously sight unseen). This new edition, which I watched in its entirety last night [January 24, 2012] has been at least partially created from a duplicate negative, made from an original then-surviving nitrate print, back in the 1950s, an element not used previously (the original negative and all original nitrate prints are long-gone). In all versions I have seen prior to this one, certain scenes appear badly 'washed out' - this is due to fact that all of them have been derived from a print - and a print is NOT a negative (hence the best that can be derived from such a source is a fourth generation print, and that is if no additional work is done - not the case here). Most of these scenes have been at least somewhat corrected for this new restoration but in the scene near the end of the film where ""Buddy"" Rogers is reading a letter sent to Richard Arlen, there are open areas (where the building was evidently bombed out) in which you can see what's going on outside; this small portion of the scene is still badly 'washed out' and the out-of-the-building view only comes into sharp relief when the scene fades out. But that's the only truly noticeable 'washed out' scene and, as the 'washed-out' portion is only a small part of the background, it does not mar the actual scene in any way. (See below for two other unfortunate but ""unfixable"" flaws.)There is at least one 'cut' in all versions I have seen previously: I have been told that Clara Bow's topless scene has had several seconds removed. These frames supposedly exist (in the print owned by the Library of Congress and possibly some other sources). From what I can see in this new edition, the scene looks to be complete but I'll have to check further with some knowledgeable people. [See March 15, 2012 Update below.] (Not that it matters, but Clara Bow is extremely easy on the eyes! Though her role is relatively small [and, in reality, unimportant], she was cast in this film as box-office insurance. And, as in ALL of her films, her acting is superlative - there is no other word for it. Watch her eyes: they're with what she acted and, in my opinion, she was one of the very finest actresses ever to have made movies.)If you are unfamiliar with WINGS' plot, you could call it simple Hollywood Hokum - but, if it is, well, it's Hollywood Hokum at its very best, due to the superior and sincere acting of ALL of the cast, the magnificence of the cinematography, as well as the exemplary direction of William Wellman. [If you want to read a good book about this film and its director, I highly recommend The Man and His Wings: William A. Wellman and the Making of the First Best Picture written by William Wellman, Jr., his son (whom I had the great pleasure of meeting a couple of years ago).] Basically, the story is about two men in love with the same woman - but of course she loves only one of the men. Naturally there is another woman, the 'girl next door' in love with the man the first woman does not love - but he does not realize that he really loves her instead. When the United States enters WWI, both men join the Army Air Corps, the 'girl next door' joins the Women's Motor Corps, they're all sent 'over there' and --- well, I'll let you guess the rest.Spectacular - and I mean SPECTACULAR - aerial 'dogfight' scenes and some absolutely splendid direction and cinematography (including the first, to my knowledge, big 'moving-boom' scene ever done in the movies) make this a film not only memorable but eminently re-watchable (I myself have seen the film over 100 times - and that's no exaggeration!).When you see the two leading men, Charles ""Buddy"" Rogers and Richard Arlen, up in the air, they REALLY are up in the air! There are no - repeat NO - rear projection or other cinema 'tricks' being used. Both men learned to fly those planes (made of wood and fabric!) and they not only flew them (during their close-up scenes only, of course), they also had to turn on the battery-powered electric camera mounted on the airplane in front of them - and then they had to act while flying the plane! (Read their lips and you'll see some 'interesting' language!) They each logged about 100 flying hours during the making of this film.Most of the formation flying seen was done by U.S. Army pilots (the Army contributed vast amounts of men and matriel without which the film could not have been made).But the other pilots you see up with them in close-ups were Hollywood stunt pilots and they too were actually flying their planes during the filming (obviously!). All of the spectacular flying maneuvers were done by these men (the Army pilots could not have done them, nor were the Army pilots crazy enough to try!). These stunt pilots were some of the very best pilots who have ever lived. What they do in this movie is nothing short of amazing - and they too had to film their own close-up scenes while performing maneuvers which will literally make your jaw drop! For example, one stunt pilot sends his plane into a spiral dive, something which is particularly dangerous. And not only do you see this spiral dive in distant shots, you see it as he, playing ""dead,"" is actually filming himself! There is no doubt about it - he is in a spiral dive! No one in his or her right mind would try this today in one of these old, unstable, and fragile biplanes - but THIS pilot did it for the film and you can see it!Do you think you'll see anything like this again in another movie? Put that thought right out of your head! This sort of thing has never been - and will never be - done again; insurance companies would NEVER allow it. But this is why the flying scenes in WINGS look absolutely real - they are!Frankly, WINGS is a terrific audience pleaser. It's an action/adventure movie which also appeals to women and it's a love story which also appeals to men. In over forty years of watching this film and showing it to many, many friends and acquaintances, I have met only one couple who did not enjoy it (they claim that they do not like 'older' films).This restoration is not 'perfect' - I think that there will never be a 'perfect' restoration of WINGS. Time and, I'm saddened to say, neglect have taken their toll. Essentially, what we are seeing here is a fifth generation print, like that which I saw in 2003. (It may even be further down the chain.) Thus there is an excessive amount of grain present which would have NEVER been seen in 1927, except possibly in the Magnascope sequence; Magnascope was a process in which the screen enlarged to four times its area - twice as wide and twice as high; it surely must have been something to see! Only a very few theaters could accommodate it (see below). This grain is very noticeable on the Blu-ray and I suspect that it will even be very noticeable on the DVD (I have not yet seen the DVD version). However, you will pay attention to it ONLY if you are critically looking for it. (Please note that, having seen this movie as many times as I have, I am quite familiar with it and, frankly, I WAS deliberately looking for flaws in the restoration so I could note them in this review. I can easily see the grain; now that you have been alerted, you may too if you choose to concentrate on it [it is very evident in some scenes, not so much in others, but it is always there] but I want to EMPHASIZE: it does NOT spoil the enjoyment. When you're watching the film for sheer pleasure, it will be easy to ignore.)Also, while there are some scenes filmed deliberately out-of-focus (some may think that's a flaw but it is not), there is at least one scene which looks slightly 'soft' - that is the scene in which El Brendel becomes nauseated and runs to an ambulance truck. I have never spotted this 'softness' before and it may be noticeable on the Blu-ray only because the Blu-ray is so sharp.As Tom Burton states in one of the supplements, we may never again see WINGS as it was on Day 1 in 1927.But this version is VERY close, probably as close as we'll get in any of our lifetimes: if you want an example, you need watch only from timing 00:38:00 to 00:50:45. This 12 minute sequence alone will clearly demonstrate the greatness of the film and the greatness of the restoration. By the way, the Magnascope sequence would have occurred at 00:41:34 to 00:42:25, less than one minute in length. (These timings are for the first video track which contains the new music score and sound effects. The timings are different on the track which contains Gaylord Carter's score.) You will see two intertitles (""On the high sea of heaven"" and ""The enemy!"") which are one-fourth the normal size. These titles would have appeared normal size when shown with Magnascope. Unfortunately, that process will probably never be seen again. Even in the late '20s, only a very few theaters had the capability of accommodating it.The tinting, unlike that on some other prints I have seen on home video, is near perfect; the colors are not overblown and do not reduce sharpness in the image. They only enhance the viewing experience (as they did in 1927).And none - I repeat, NONE - of any visual flaws present (and they are all minor) spoils the enjoyment of the film, not even in the smallest way. Most people will not even notice them. Let me emphasize: any flaws present are ALL minor.As for the sound, it's spectacular. Is it authentic? Definitely not. Being that the sound effects in 1927 were performed ""live"" behind the screen, they would, of necessity, have been much more spare (as they were when I saw the film in 2003). And they certainly would not have been DTS stereo surround! However, we are not watching this film in 1927 - we are watching it today and Ben Burtt wanted to accommodate the sensibilities of today's audiences; I think he has succeeded admirably. Wait until you hear it (hopefully with the volume cranked up!). I also think that if they had had the capability back in 1927, those early sound engineers would have designed the sound similarly to the way Mr. Burtt has done. (As I mentioned, Tom Burton told be that I would be ""blown away"" by the soundtrack: I was!)The sound effects are used only on the first track; the second track, with Gaylord Carter's score, has just the organ music (and it sounds beautiful). So if for some reason the sound effects are not to your liking, you can always view the film with the organ score alone.The three supplements included on the Blu-ray (only one is included on the DVD and it turns out that that's a shame) are all very worthwhile and interesting (unlike most supplements on discs), though I wish someone had discussed the Magnascope process in some detail. Seeing A. C. Lyles in the supplements is always a particular joy for my wife and me. I wish the producers had allowed him to speak at greater length. He knows more about this film (and Paramount Pictures) than any other living person.Do I have any ""druthers?"" Yes. I wish Paramount had given this disc a deluxe packaging treatment (if you want to see great packaging for a Blu-ray/DVD edition, you need only look at certain of the Warner Home Video presentations). They should have made the DVD a 2-disc set so that they could have included all three of the supplements. Paramount does not even include a leaflet, much less a booklet, about the film and I think that such packaging (and printed information) should be standard for significant motion pictures such as this one released to home video. As this is the first disc in their 100th Anniversary Retrospective, I wish Paramount had designed a uniform type of packaging so that purchasers could buy a complete matched set. Wouldn't THAT have been something?I understand that Paramount, Amazon, and even Netflix seriously underestimated the demand for this film and they are now scrambling to replenish their stock. I'm not surprised; whenever WINGS has played anywhere, it's almost always a sell-out (as it was last week at the Academy, and as it was in 2003 - both nights - when my wife and I attended, and as it was in New York when we saw it a couple of years later).So, to sum up, I strongly recommend that ANYONE and EVERYONE who has even the slightest interest in movies (and who has the financial resources to do so) buy this disc - and buy it soon (either the Blu-ray or the DVD). You'll thank me for my recommendation. And at Amazon's price, I feel that it is truly a bargain.Thank you for reading my very lengthy comments. I apologize for the length but I hope that you found them to be somewhat interesting and I truly hope that everything I have written is accurate (if you find any errors of fact, please let me know in a comment).(As a personal aside, I wish that Sam Rubin had lived to see this restoration.)And if you do buy this new edition of Wings [Blu-ray] (or the DVD edition: Wings), I hope you enjoy the film as much as I do.==============================================================================================Update: March 15, 2012The following is just an FYI:As of this writing, my wife and I are attending the CINEFEST 32 in Liverpool, NY and I have spoken with some VERY knowledgeable people (including two people who were involved with preserving and restoring WINGS). These people have informed me that, as I suspected, this edition is NOT 'frame-complete.' Several seconds of Clara Bow's topless scene are not in this print nor are a couple of seconds of the male nudity. I understand that a Chinese ""bootleg"" DVD DOES have Clara Bow's entire nude scene but, of course, that DVD will not be of a restored print (and is B&W only, not the way this film should be seen).It's a pity that Paramount did not choose to make this restoration 'frame-complete' (I have been told several different reasons for the decision but I do not know which reason, if any, is correct).However, and it's a VERY BIG however, the fact is that these few seconds, which do not contribute to the story in any way, are missing do NOT - repeat DO NOT! - detract from the enjoyment of this film by adults and the fact that they are missing may make the film more appropriate for today's children.While I personally would have wished that EVERY FRAME shown in 1927 had been included, I continue to HIGHLY (as highly as possible) value this restoration and release and I STRONGLY recommend this Blu-ray or DVD to anyone and everyone.Thank you again for reading all of this and for considering my opinions.Lawrence H.

"I am quite pleased with this little Kodak micro SD 4 GB Class 2 Flash Memory Card with SD Adapter KSDMI4GBPSBNAA, so much so that I just ordered a second one (it is my opinion that one should always carry a spare data card 'just in case').I use it in my Kodak Easyshare Touch M5370 16 MP Digital Camera with 5x Optical Zoom, HD Video Capture and 3.0-Inch Capacitive Touchscreen LCD (Blue) and it works perfectly. (I have had this camera, an excellent one by the way, for over a month and have used it extensively.)While the Micro-SD card is REALLY tiny in size (and one has to exercise care so that one does not break it or lose it), it is actually quite good. In this particular camera (16 MP), it can hold 749 pictures taken at the largest size (highest quality) or 29 minutes of 720p video (and much more time if taking video at VGA 640x480 resolution). I am amazed that something so small can hold so much.It comes with its own SD adapter so that it is easy and convenient to insert the card into the adapter and then insert the whole thing into computers which have a built-in SD slot (most of them do nowadays) to transfer the pictures.In fact, you can actually use this card in ANY camera which uses either 'regular' SD cards OR Micro SD cards. In the first case, if your camera uses 'regular' SD cards, you place the Micro SD card into the adapter and then insert the entire device into your camera and in the second case, if your camera uses Micro SD cards, you merely just use the Micro SD card itself. This makes for a very useful and versatile card and allows it to be used in ANY camera (or device) which uses any type of SD card.Thus there is nothing else necessary to buy and you can see that the low price for this entire device is comparable to other cards which may not include the adapter. This card is even supplied with a sturdy plastic case which holds both parts securely and conveniently.So for that particular Kodak camera I mentioned as well as for any other camera which takes a Micro SD card (or 'regular' SD cards), I give this one my highest recommendation.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 6, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2WO2OGMNZ8MCB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002CTQ9XO#wasThisHelpful","R2WO2OGMNZ8MCB","A3GVXKCTFN3YDN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3GVXKCTFN3YDN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In my opinion, this Epson WorkForce 845 Wireless Color Printer (C11CB92201) is a fantastic piece of equipment. It prints text documents beautifully - they're clear and sharp - and photographs look positively vibrant with accurate, vivid color.It prints FAST and it is very quiet. And you can load an entire ream of paper (500 sheets) into its two paper cassettes (250 per cassette). Or you could have, say, 4""x6"" photo paper in one cassette and 8.5""x11"" regular paper in the other. This is particularly convenient and is what I have done. That way, when printing, I can just ""pick and choose"" the cassette containing the paper to which I wish to print, there being no need to load and unload a cassette with the desired paper.It can also print two-sided and that feature works perfectly.We have an older Canon MP780 All-in-One which we have upstairs in our den. It's a very nice machine but it is not a wireless one. To print from a computer, we need to physically move the computer into the den and attach it, via USB cable, to this printer (which is, of course, an annoyance).Not so with this new wireless printer. My computer is downstairs (my wife's is in another room) and when I print via this unit, often by the time I get upstairs the document is ready. When I printed a photograph, I did get to the printer before the picture was complete, but it only took a few seconds more for completion. (And it prints FAR faster than does our Canon machine.)Well you might say, ""So what? Lots of wireless printers do the same thing."" And you'd be right. But, at least for me, here is the big difference:Like all printers, the Epson WorkForce 845 is compatible with the Microsoft Windows and Apple Mac computer operating systems. But we do not use either of those; we use Linux (currently I use Xubuntu and my wife uses Linux Mint). There is no mention of Linux in the Epson's documentation.After I ordered the printer from Amazon Vine (on Thursday, November 17, 2011), I went to the OpenPrinting Database which contains Linux drivers for every known compatible printer; I found the Epson WorkForce 845 listed there.I downloaded the driver and installed it to my computer. On Tuesday, November 22, the printer arrived. I unpacked it and set it up in our bedroom (I am keeping the Canon in our den for reasons I shall explain).But I'm afraid I was a bit intimidated about trying to set it up so I just left it there. The next day my wife was at the hair dresser's and I decided to try to configure the printer.Well, setting it up and connecting it to my network was as easy as could be. As soon as I started the configuration, the printer saw my network. All I had to do was to enter the Network Security Key and the toughest part about that was remembering my L...O...N...G network password to enter into the printer's database - but, once entered, the printer connected immediately. (The setup took me about ten minutes.)I then went downstairs and fired up my computer. I went into the Printing menu option, selected Add Printer, selected Network Printer, and there it was! I printed a Test Sheet and, before I could get upstairs, the sheet was printed and it was waiting for me! (The printer setup on my computer took less than two minutes!)In retrospect, I needn't have had any trepidations whatsoever!All that is why I am thrilled with this printer!Obviously, if you use Windows or Mac, you'll have no trouble setting it up. Complete and clear instructions are readily available (in the printed Quick Guide for Windows and online for Mac).But if you use Linux, you need have no fears. It sets up easily and works perfectly (and without reading any instructions at all!). Its touch screen interface is so intuitive that I'm certain that most people will have absolutely no difficulties in setting up and using this printer.Not only can you print from a computer, you can also print photographs directly from data cards (even Compact Flash ones) and you can even do some simple editing such as removing red-eye and/or cropping them via the nice-sized LCD screen (by the way, this is a touch screen LCD: you select the controls right on the LCD!). The LCD control panel tilts out easily if you prefer; this makes seeing the LCD much easier. And you ought to see the quality of the photographs! I had read that Epson printers make the very best quality (and longest-lasting) photos - and, while I can't comment on longevity, I CAN say that the pictures I printed are by far the best I've ever seen from a home printer!Plus you can also print from your Smart Phone or tablet computer (such as my Dell Streak 7 Wi-Fi Tablet. I went into the Android Marketplace and searched for Epson ""apps."" I found two; one is called EPSON Printer Finder and, when I installed it, not only did it immediately find this Epson printer, it also showed that there was a firmware update for it. I activated this update and ran into my bedroom where I keep the printer to see if anything was happening. Sure enough, the printer was upgrading itself (wirelessly, via the internet) and within a few minutes it was done - and everything went as smoothly as could be. The other ""app"" is called EPSON iPrint and is for the actual printing. Of course I downloaded and installed that one too and then printed a web page. It printed (two-sided, by the way, as I had configured) perfectly.I myself cannot use this machine as a FAX machine; its placement in our bedroom is too far away from the telephone connection. That's why I'm keeping our Canon; it is connected to our telephone line (though I do not FAX often - the last time I did was about a year ago).I copied a document with this new Epson machine and it came out looking just great. I have also scanned a photograph (you do NOT need to use a computer in order to scan; appropriate scanning software is incorporated into the unit and you can scan a photo directly to an inserted data card or to your computer via the front USB port). Not only does this all-in-one automatically crop the photo, it renders the colors very vibrantly. (There are selections for the type of document or photo and the quality desired in the machine's menu; these are amazingly easy to use.)But if you DO want to scan a document to your computer, well, it's as easy as can be. My computer's scanning program immediately recognized the machine and the document scanned perfectly.Is there one 'nit?' Of course! I wish this printer had a separate single-sheet paper feed as does our Canon. But that is the ONLY ""druther"" I have - and that is a VERY small 'nit.'I am totally pleased with this Epson model. The manufacturer is even thoughtful enough to pack the four necessary #127 ink cartridges in the package - and they are the high-capacity cartridges! No other printer I have ever purchased came with such high-capacity cartridges.Epson claims that its ink cartridges last much longer than those of competitors and that ink costs are much lower. At this time I cannot comment on this claim one way or the other but it seems to me that Epson's advertising claims appear to be less extravagant than some of its competitors (just my impression) so I believe them.I can't comment on the longevity of this unit; only with the passage of time will I be able to do that. But it is apparent that the printer is constructed with a great deal of integrity. Based on my initial impressions, I should think that this printer will last for a very long time.Obviously, I give this printer the highest recommendation possible and I thank you for reading this review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 25, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1QGF44AYCJTHD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005IVL0RS#wasThisHelpful","R1QGF44AYCJTHD","A3GVXKCTFN3YDN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3GVXKCTFN3YDN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My wife likes this Remington D3710 Ceramic Fast Finish Dual Fan Turbo Hair Dryer, 1875 Watts which we received a few days ago courtesy of Amazon Vine and it probably would be her hair dryer of choice were it not for the fact that she also owns this Remington Ac2015 Tstudio Salon Collection Pearl Ceramic Hair Dryer which she likes even better.The D3710 DOES seem to dry her hair a bit faster than the Ac2015 BUT - and this is important for her - she does not like the on/off switch on the new D3710.As a matter of fact, she detests the switch.She has baby-fine hair and she dries it in sections. She wraps a section around a brush, turns on the hair dryer, dries that section, and then turns off the dryer. She does this repeatedly until her hair is dried.This particular model has a three-position slider switch as opposed to the positive three-position ""push-type"" one on the Ac2015. She does not like slider switches at all; in her experience, such switches, used heavily, wear out quickly. (I tend to agree with her but we cannot - and should not - generalize, at least regarding this particular hair dryer.)She claims that this particular slider switch is awkward for her to use. She says that if someone were to dry their hair in one complete session (not turning the unit on and off continually), that person would probably be completely satisfied.But in her case, she finds this switch to be annoying, hence the deduction of one star. (You may feel totally differently.)So even though this one is slightly faster than the older one, it is the older Ac2015 to which she will be returning. She'll keep this D3710 as a spare.Please consider that her situation may be unique, not comparable to yours.As for the construction and quality of this hair dryer, she says it is first-rate. She also says that she is now a ""Remington Hair Dryer Girl,"" having had nothing but positive experiences with this brand and nothing but disappointment with all other brands she has used previously. She has been using her Ac2015 for over a year now (on a daily basis - she even took it with her on our latest cross-country trip) and it has proven to be totally reliable. I should think that this newer model will be at least as reliable.With the caveat she mentions, she (and I) give this hair dryer a good recommendation.Thank you for reading this. I hope it has been of some help to you.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 25, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R32D3Y0ONAWK5R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0050QLDGY#wasThisHelpful","R32D3Y0ONAWK5R","A3GVXKCTFN3YDN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3GVXKCTFN3YDN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 1:25 Mins==========IMPORTANT UPDATE February 9, 2012: It has just been announced that Kodak is exiting the digital camera business. Please see Comment #7 for further details. Nonetheless, because it is so good, I still highly recommend buying this camera.==========I am very pleased with this little Kodak Easyshare Touch M5370 Digital Camera (Blue) and I am certain than anyone buying one will be just as pleased.Ease of use is very important, in my opinion, in small cameras such as this which are meant for snapshots, both candid and posed. When taking such pictures, the user often does not have the time nor the inclination to play with camera settings. He or she just wants to turn the camera on and take the pictures (or videos) quickly - and have them turn out perfectly.That's what you will achieve with this camera 99% of the time - and that with just using the Smart Capture mode.Turning on is almost instantaneous and turning off is equally quick.You can see from my video that the camera adjusts to scenes with different light levels quickly and unobtrusively. Focus is automatic (of course) and very quick. (When taking video, sound is recorded even when zooming.)Not only do videos turn out perfectly, so do still pictures - and without any extraneous input from the photographer.Just turn it on and fire away.Of course this camera is primarily intended for stills. (I do not know of any way to add a still picture to this review; that's why I attached a video taken with the camera. At least you can see the quality of the images it produces.)(Regarding video, I might mention that, contrary to the printed instruction manual which shows an option of video at 1920 x 1080, and contrary to at least one review here which states that the camera takes 1080p video, it does NOT take video at this level. It has but two options: 720p and VGA video. With a 4 GB Micro-SDHC card, this translates to 29 minutes at 720p and 2 and a half hours at VGA level. My video was taken at 720p.)I very much like the touchscreen controls and I have to admit that I was somewhat apprehensive about them. I needn't have been. They are as easy to use as is possible and, as I indicated, you do not actually have to use them if you don't want to. Your pictures will almost always turn out just the way you want them.The colors produced are vivid and beautiful (as you can see in the video, taken on a Fall afternoon around 3:30 PM). Different color types are available and easily accessed for those who wish to modify the look of pictures; even black-and-white and sepia tone are offered.For those who are more advanced, there are options offered in-camera to crop a picture, adjust its color, and several other things besides. (I have not as yet used these options.) Videos, likewise, can be edited in-camera. These options are really nice to have and can prove very useful to many people. In other words, you can improve your photographic results without the need to buy expensive computer programs and your photographic knowledge can improve without outgrowing the camera.There are also several other settings, including a Program (programmable) setting, for those who wish to exercise more control of their pictures. This Program setting too is extremely easy to use.I REALLY like the facial-recognition feature and the ability to automatically (or manually) 'tag' pictures with the names of people. Not only does this feature allow identification of people when viewing the pictures on the camera's screen, the tags carry over when you download the pictures onto your computer. (I use a Linux viewing program called Gwenview and, when I view a picture tagged via this camera, the name(s) of the people are clearly displayed. I am sure that other image viewing programs available for Windows and Mac will do the same thing.)Now to the nitty-gritty. This camera has a Schneider-KREUZNACH lens which appears to be of good quality (this company has always had a good reputation). It features an optical zoom ratio of 5:1 (equivalent to a 28-140 mm lens on a 35 mm camera) which is adequate for most people and will not require the use of a tripod (as do lenses of large zoom ratios). By the way, if you do use a tripod, you will find that a tripod mount will not interfere with battery/Micro-SD card access.The lens is somewhat slow (f 3.9 - 5.7) which is about the norm for cameras of this class. It is unfortunate that it is not somewhat faster (allowing more light to be registered). With such a small camera and with so many mega-pixels (16) crowded into a tiny sensor, ""noise"" (""grain"" in film image terminology) is inevitable under low-light conditions when pictures are taken without flash. While this ""noise"" is not inordinately obtrusive under normal household illumination, critical viewers will easily be able to spot it.The camera does have several flash options, all easily accessible from the main screen (even in Smart Capture mode); you can set the flash to Auto Flash, Always-on Flash (for use outdoors when you want fill-in flash), Auto-Red-Eye removal (pre-fires a small flash so the subject's pupils contract somewhat), or No Flash at all. (Even with Smart Capture, there are certain things that you yourself will have to ""tell"" the camera what you want.) Using flash will alleviate any ""noise"" problem indoors under low light.While the camera does have a small capacity built-in memory, you will definitely want to buy an optional Micro-SDHC card. I bought this Kodak micro SD 4 GB Class 2 Flash Memory Card with SD Adapter KSDMI4GBPSBNAA. This one is inexpensive and comes complete with an SD adapter, necessary to use to insert the card into most computers which have card readers. (I do not know why Kodak chose to use the Micro SD format which is much less widely used than the ""plain"" SD format; we have a Fujifilm FinePix T300 14 MP Digital Camera with Fujinon 10x Wide Angle Optical Zoom Lens (Black) which is just about the same size as this Kodak and it uses a normal SD card. The Micro-SD size is awfully small, especially for my fingers. But there it is.) 4 GB offers 749 pictures at the maximum quality (much more at lesser quality). That's a lot of pictures!I also bought this Kodak 1972736 Hard Camera Case (Black) from Amazon. (Right now it is selling for $2.99! Other colors are available but they cost $12.99. So I ""settled"" for black!) It is a very nice case offering good protection. It also has room for an extra Micro-SDHC card as well as a spare battery or two.Regarding spare batteries and external chargers: do NOT buy Kodak's offerings. They are too costly. Buy this 2Pcs Battery+Charger for Fuji NP-45 NP-45A instead. Not only do you get an external charger, you get not one but TWO spare batteries. PLEASE NOTE: The NP-45 battery is exactly the same as the Kodak Rechargeable Li-Ion Battery KLIC-7006 used in the camera. Just compare the prices for their battery and their charger.To protect the LCD screen I strongly recommend this 3x Kodak Easyshare M5370 Camera Premium Invisible Clear LCD Screen Protector Cover Guard Shield Protective Film Kit (3 Pieces). It is very inexpensive, it fits perfectly, and it is easy to apply. Plus, in the package, you get three shields; you can use the other two for any other appropriately-sized product you may have.As I use a variant of the Linux computer operating system and Kodak does not support this, I cannot comment on photo sharing. Frankly, I have no interest in that (I do not belong to Facebook, Twitter, or any other social network) but, knowing Kodak, I am sure that their sharing function works well and is easy to use. I'll refer you to other reviews here which may comment about this feature in much greater detail.To sum up, I like this little camera very much. The pictures produced by it are exemplary. No one need ever be embarrassed by their quality. The same applies to the video produced by it. I plan to carry it wherever I go; I have always wanted to do this (there have been several times when I wished I had a camera along when I saw something which would make a nice photo) but, until now, I did not have the means for doing so. (I do not have a ""smart"" cell phone and, in any case, most of the pictures I have seen produced with such cameras do not match the quality of a dedicated camera, at least in my opinion.) So this one will be with me always. It will not replace my ""main"" camera (a much more sophisticated model) but being so small and of such high quality, it may be available when my ""main"" one is not.Obviously I give it a very high recommendation. I thank you for reading this, for watching my video, and for considering my opinions.==========Update: December 6, 2011Courtesy of Amazon Vine, I now own both this  Fujifilm FinePix T300 14 MP Digital Camera with Fujinon 10x Wide Angle Optical Zoom Lens (Black) and this Kodak Easyshare Touch M5370 16 MP Digital Camera with 5x Optical Zoom, HD Video Capture and 3.0-Inch Capacitive Touchscreen LCD (Blue).The Fujifilm camera has many more possible adjustments than does the Kodak plus it has a 10:1 zoom lens as opposed to the Kodak's 5:1 lens but the Kodak is much the easier of the two to use.I have taken some pictures back-to-back with both and, at least in my opinion, pictures taken with both are nearly identical in quality.Since the Kodak is the easier to use, I have given it to my wife and I myself will use the Fujifilm model.But either would make a fine choice and I am very pleased with both of them.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 27, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2R0334BCFJ62T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0056Z0SJM#wasThisHelpful","R2R0334BCFJ62T","A3GVXKCTFN3YDN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3GVXKCTFN3YDN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This StarTech.com VGA2HDMIPRO Professional VGA to HDMI Audio Video Converter with Scaler is an expensive item but, at least in my and my wife's opinion, it is worth every penny.Last year we drove cross-country and visited relatives and friends. We had lots of home videos we wanted to show them but, as we had no means for playing our videos (stored on our netbook computer) on their televisions, all of us had to crowd around a 10-inch netbook screen.This unit to the rescue! I bought it several months ago and, due to inertia (there is no other word), I did not even try it until we arrived at a relative's house (more than half-way across the country) on our second cross-country driving trip.To make a long story short, hooking it up was as easy as could be (most necessary cables are packed with the unit but you will have to buy separately an AmazonBasics High-Speed HDMI Cable (6.5 Feet/2.0 Meters) - Supports Ethernet, 3D, and Audio Return [Newest Standard] or similar which I had done).Operating it is the proverbial piece of cake. Plug it into an AC outlet, attach the outputs from your computer (VGA and audio) to the inputs of this scaler, and finally attach whatever output(s) from the scaler you will use to your television set (in most cases, that will be only an HDMI cable). Menu options are straightforward and easy to adjust.The picture AND sound are carried over the HDMI cable; most newer televisions will support this (all of the ones with HDMI inputs we tried did) but, if the set accepts only the video via HDMI, you can use a TOSLINK (optical) digital sound output or a standard analog 3.5mm output.The picture and sound quality produced were positively first-rate. Believe me, NO ONE will find any cause for complaint! (Picture and sound were perfectly in sync.)The unit is very small in size and it, and the necessary cables (VGA, Analog Audio, TOSLINK, HDMI) and power supply take up little room in your suitcase. (The power supply comes complete with adapters which would allow use in several foreign countries; we did not take these adapters with us.)In addition to playing our videos via this scaler at our friends' houses, we also used it on the road at hotels which had HDMI capability. As well as our home videos on the computer, we also brought along a Western Digital My Passport Essential SE 1 TB USB 3.0/2.0 Ultra Portable External Hard Drive (Black) onto which I had copied thirty or so feature films so we would have something to watch in our hotel rooms (if what their cable channels offered was of little interest to us). In all cases the scaler worked perfectly. (Some of the hotels in which we stayed [especially those on our way out west] still had older analog televisions; at these hotels, we used this PC To TV Video Converter which, contrary to some reviews, worked perfectly also though, of course, the picture was not anywhere nearly as sharp as it was as when we were able to use this digital scaler on a more modern TV.)As I stated, this unit is expensive. And, within a couple of years, it probably won't even be necessary. I anticipate that late in 2012 or at the latest 2013 almost all computers will offer HDMI outputs. At that point, we will be able to connect our computers to any modern television using just one HDMI cable alone.But of course you'd have to buy one of those new computers at that time. In the mean time, if you have need for playing computer video through an HDMI-equipped television set (or projector) with the computer you already have, this unit certainly fills the bill.I am very happy with my little scaler unit and I highly recommend it to anyone who has need for such a product.Thank you for reading my review and for considering my opinions.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 9, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1J1RNJHKUVP1W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001LRKB78#wasThisHelpful","R1J1RNJHKUVP1W","A3GVXKCTFN3YDN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3GVXKCTFN3YDN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My wife and I (especially my wife) are very pleased with this lightweight Hoover Sprint QuickVac Bagless Upright - UH20040.We own several vacuum cleaners; our main ones are Eureka THE BOSS SmartVac Model 4870 Type GZ of which we've owned two units for a couple of years now. They are excellent vacuum cleaners and work very well indeed. Maintenance on them is minimal. They are, however, very heavy and that is the reason we bought two of them: one is for downstairs and one is for upstairs. (They were highly rated in ""Consumer Reports"" and cost about half - $150.00 - of what other comparably highly-rated machines did at the time.)We also own a couple of lightweight 'stick' vacuums: a Eureka Lightweight Easy Clean Upright Vacuum Cleaner and a Bissell FeatherWeight Vacuum, Bagless, 3106B (my wife slightly prefers the Bissell to the Eureka). We use these for light touch-up vacuuming and they are excellent for that purpose.But this new Hoover model almost combines the best of both worlds: it is lightweight (of course not as lightweight as the 'sticks') yet comparable in performance to our 'heavy-weight' Eureka 4870s.It is so easy to put together right out of the box (no instructions are necessary for assembly) and its use is straightforward. It is helpful and desirable, of course, to read the owner's manual but figuring out this unit is almost (but not quite) a 'no-brainer.'There is only one tool included with this machine and that's all you'll need. It is a most ingenious tool, combining a crevice tool and an upholstery tool in one compact unit. It has to be seen to be believed.Everything snaps in place and the machine exudes an air of confidence and of high quality. It has an unusual carry handle which can be used when moving the machine (rather than carrying it awkwardly with the 'main' handle, as is the necessary case with most vacuums).Using it on stairs is very easy, almost as easy as using a cannister vacuum.The power cord has to be wound carefully onto its nesting place otherwise it won't fit properly. But that is easy to do. The power cord's length is adequate for our house, as long or longer than all the other vacuums we own.My wife especially likes the foot-operated on/off switch.On first use, she exclaimed that the suction was amazing. She said she could not believe it. After she finished vacuuming our entire upstairs with it, she asked me what it sold for. I replied that currently Amazon was charging $70.00 and it listed for $80.00. She then stated very firmly, ""That's a bargain!""Obviously, with it being so new for us, I cannot comment at this time on its longevity or ease of maintenance. Should anything untoward develop, I shall report it here.But there is one comment I can make: at least one reviewer here states that, to access the belt, one must remove seven (7) screws. That is, in fact, what the owner's manual states.But, if you look at the bottom of the vacuum, you will see a little chart showing the location of just six (6) screws; that is all that really need be removed. (Not that that makes a whole lot of difference.) I do recommend that you do as we do: remove the screws and put them in an egg carton. That way you are sure not to lose any of them. You will need a moderately long and thin Phillips-head (""crosshead"") screwdriver to remove the screws but this should be easy. Such screwdrivers are readily available (if you don't already have one) at any hardware store (or even a dollar-store). (I have not tried removing the screws: it 'ain't' broke so why should I fix it?)I cannot say, at this time, if this machine will replace our 'big' Eurekas as my wife's main vacuum cleaner, but, so far, she is really enamored of it. (She does most of the vacuuming and she is 'in charge' of what we buy and use in such machines.)As I said at the beginning of this review, both I and my wife are very pleased with this vacuum cleaner. It's offers heavy-duty suction without the 'heavy-duty price' or 'heavy-duty weight.' If you buy one, I believe you will be pleased too.Thank you for reading this review and for considering my opinions.==================================================================================================================================Update: November 11, 2011We've had this vacuum cleaner for a month now and, if anything, my wife likes it even more than when we first received it. Since it arrived, she has used our 'big' Eurekas only once, much preferring to use this Hoover model which she regards as being lighter in weight, easier to maneuver, and superior in deep cleaning our rugs.Plus she says that, of all the vacuum cleaners we have ever owned, bag or bagless, this is by far the easiest and most convenient to clean.And its price is 'right.'","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 3, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/RR8M4FJNOG9K3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004N64GH0#wasThisHelpful","RR8M4FJNOG9K3","A3GVXKCTFN3YDN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3GVXKCTFN3YDN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm going to go out on a limb and say that, in my opinion, this AmazonBasics 32 GB Class 10 SDHC Flash Memory Card is by far the best value in a 32 GB SDHC flash memory card available on the market at the present time.I took the one I received and placed it in my Fujifilm FinePix T300 14 MP Digital Camera with Fujinon 10x Wide Angle Optical Zoom Lens (Black), formatted it, and ""fired away."" The pictures 'wrote' to the card VERY quickly and, while I do not have any means for comparing one card's write/read speed against another (as some reviewers here have done), it seems to me that the speed this card offers is MUCH more than adequate for 'ordinary' camera users, such as myself and my wife.(According to Fujifilm, this camera should use only Fuji's own cards or SanDisk's; no other brands are recommended because Fujifilm has not tested them. Nonetheless, this AmazonBasics card works perfectly.)Class 10 cards, which write much faster than Class 4 or 6 cards, are recommended when taking video. As this camera does take nice video, the use of this new card in the camera will be an advantage. Class 10 speed is, I believe, currently the fastest available speed in a flash memory card.But the main advantage of such a large card is, of course, its capacity: with our camera, the 4 GB SD card we had previously been using can take 573 pictures. This one can take 4576(!) pictures, almost 8 times as many. This, I think, is a real advantage for those who need to take a large number of pictures without transferring them to a computer (situations in which, for one reason or another, such transference is difficult or not possible).Some might say (and they might be correct) that one takes a great chance taking a large number of pictures and leaving them on a card only (without transferring them to a computer); if the card 'goes bad,' you could lose all your pictures.This might be a very real concern.Nonetheless, I think that the concern is mitigated by one essential fact: this card carries the AmazonBasics label. I do not know who makes this card for AmazonBasics, but, if it is like all the other products under that brand which I have purchased, it will be produced with the highest standards of quality. I admit I am prejudiced: I have been buying various products sold under the AmazonBasics label almost since the beginning of the introduction of that brand and I have never been even slightly disappointed with any of them. NEVER! Rather, I have been extremely pleased with the quality AND THE PRICE (consequently the value) of all of them.Which brings me to the price of this card: look at it. You could buy a competing 32 GB SDHC card for about the same money - but it would probably be a Class 4 card. To buy a 32 GB Class 10 card, you are looking at much more money than Amazon charges for this one. This one does not cost much more than 'quality' (name-brand) cards of much lower capacities.So, for the reasons I list above, I highly recommend this flash memory card and I urge anyone interested in such a card to carefully consider this one.I thank you for reading this review and I thank you for considering my opinions.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 3, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1OB2R0DFWCGYT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0058GH2DY#wasThisHelpful","R1OB2R0DFWCGYT","A3GVXKCTFN3YDN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3GVXKCTFN3YDN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It's hard to believe that this 2Pcs Battery+Charger for Fuji NP-45 NP-45A is being sold for so little. Not only can it charge the battery from a standard AC wall socket, it can also charge it in your car with its included DC adapter cable.To add icing to the cake, it ships with two (2) NP-45 batteries.All for less than $9.00!What a fantastic bargain!Now my Fujifilm FinePix T300 14 MP Digital Camera with Fujinon 10x Wide Angle Optical Zoom Lens (Black) came with the NP-45A battery.

It MAY be that the 'A' version runs a bit longer than does the 'regular' version but this is hard to pin down.In any case, if you look at the price of the 'A' version of the battery, you will find that it alone costs MUCH more than does this charger with its two batteries!So why buy just a replacement battery when you can, for far less, get a charger with two batteries?

"The book is very informative. There is a big section in the beginning about all the ingredients, how they interact with each other. There is a detailed description with illustrations of different techniques used for preparing dough, and also why the author likes making up recipes using ratios as opposed to other methods. In recipes, dry ingredients are measured by weight ounces, not volume. Unfortunately, the liquid ingredients are measured by liquid ounces, i.e. volume. I hate volume measurements - how accurate is it when you measure off honey? What about all the honey that gets stick to the cup? I do prefer putting a mixing bowl on the kitchen scale, and weigh everything while adding it to the mix, using Tare function on my scale. So, off to the calculator and conversion tables, again. More precise and less measuring cups to wash. Please, please, authors, write your recipes with weight measurements!Each basic dough recipe is described in detail, with why and how and what to expect and hand drawn illustrations if there is a need for those so reader has the right idea of how to proceed. Then for every basic dough there is a section with recipes using this dough, some savory, some sweet. The variety is great, and there are suggestions for recipe variations, too. For each of the basic dough recipes, author suggest on how to make the dough by hand or using mixer of food processor, if it is possible.

"The ring looks very nice, although the clear cubic zirconia sparkles more than the reddish ones. The red is more like reddish orange color. The workmanship looks good, too, nothing is out of alignment and no snags. Although it looks about the same inner size as my other size 7 rings (17.3 mm diameter as advertised), it is wider, and fits more snug than narrower band rings and it leaves two indentation tracks on the skin, too, because underside is not solid, but hollow, as you can see on the pictures. It is also thicker due to having crystals all around, and it tends to hit the joint on my pinkie finger, which makes it a little uncomfortable at times. So, maybe order larger size if you are unsure.

"Love the dishcloths. They are generous size enough for dishwashing but can be used for drying, too, for general cleaning and for other small jobs.

"The eggplant and sage colors are not as bright as I was hoping, Eggplant is quite too light to be of a real eggplant, sage is almost gray. But the colors do not bleed in the wash. Both kinds of dishtowels are reasonably thick, at least as thick as all of my other microfiber towels. The fabric is very soft, and they absorb a lot of liquid. Good both for washing and for drying (not at the same time, obviously). They do snag on too dry skin, just as other microfiber towels. The edges are serged, and the serging shortens in wash. I can pull them back to shape so they will lay flat, but I do not bother, it is not that bad. I fold them in four and store in a drawer, I like to have a bunch for many different jobs around the kitchen and around the house, too.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R28T0987W65QH0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MXTUX08#wasThisHelpful","R28T0987W65QH0","A397CWU6DM3O5G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A397CWU6DM3O5G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The millet is not of the best kind, so it does not give the very best results, but it is relatively clean with no rocks. I cook it in a rice cooker on brown rice setting with extra water, and often add some milk halfway. Milk and longer cooking time makes it creamier, but not as creamy as other millet varietals produce. The texture is still a bit too rough even after all tricks I could come up with. Anyway, it seems to be the best millet I could reliably find in USA.We mostly use it as a side dish or in soups. Do not forget to wash it before cooking, or you get dirty foam on top. I like smaller packages that can be reclosed after you remove some millet for cooking.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3WEXSNC4MEDO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001QXYZ4M#wasThisHelpful","R3WEXSNC4MEDO","A397CWU6DM3O5G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A397CWU6DM3O5G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It feels heavy and seems like it was made of metal, unlike many other tools that are metal-colored plastic. I choose the tool because there was a height adjustment, but it turned out to be totally useless - the range of adjustment is so small, you have to have extra-thick band for it to fit on its highest setting - they did skimp on the screw height - in goes only halfway through the thickness of the tool, so it was clear that it was shortened for economy, not because of the design requirements.

"The watch is quite large, but is not huge. The clear crystals sparkle gently. It looks beautiful now. The watch has synthetic sapphire window, and it is gold plated stainless steel.

The clasp is very secure, it is actually too tight right now, I have to use quite a lot of force to open it. I hope it loosens up a bit, but no too much, of course. I can remove the watch with only one side of the clasp open, but it is a bit loose on my wrist. The clasp is practically invisible on the band.The watch was set to the correct date and Pacific time.

"The labels are class 2 certified, which means that they tested unprinted, blank labels to see if they wash or peel off from exposure to chemicals or weather. But the printing on the labels may or may not stay under the conditions depending on the printer  and inks you use. They did test those labels with different printers and inks, and you can see the list on their website (it is on the product page in fine print), although the list is awfully short. But if you do use the printers, you will get your printings on labels that can withstand marine environment, too.The labels fell like they are made out of plastic, not paper. There are perforations on the back that let you tear the backing away exposing thin strip of the sticky label, so it is easy to start removing it from there. I liked this feature very much. The quality of the print is quite good, and the print stays on the label, although I did not try to immerse it in ocean water because of the lack thereof.I tried to use the avery website to load my own images so I can print them, but it never worked - the images would not load there, I even tried different browsers to no avail.

The attached cap suggested ease of use and no lost parts, but the neck piece has to be removed for washing and instructions say to store it separately. I guess it is so germs will not grow in there. But it means that it does have a part that might get lost. Half of the reason to have attached cap is gone. That middle piece is also quite hard to unscrew.

"The bed was easy to assemble. It is made up of two narrow beds that you connect, so it is easy to carry upstairs separately, after you get it out of the box. It took only a few minutes to unfold and secure each of the beds, and then connect them with two bolts. There are illustrated instructions for all the steps. They also include brackets for attaching a headboard. We did not use them, though. We did the assembly together, but I am sure I would be able to do it myself with no problems. Putting the heavy mattress on top by myself might be a problem, but it is not the bed's fault, right?  The bed frame has rounded corners, and the corners are covered with plastic shields so you will not bump into metal. It is hard to see on the picture, but the cover has a rubbery strips at the two ends for helping the bed stay in place. The white middle is made of unwoven fabric. The cover fits quite tight around the bed, it is velcroed to the corner shields, and it is the width of the spring box, probably to give it traditional appearance, so you do still see what is underneath the bed, and it is in the way if you want to store anything under the bed because it is so tight. Bed skirt, anyone?Even though the bed is kind of foldable, it does not move or squeak when you climb on it and feels as solid as the old frame plus spring box. No sounds and it feels solid. We put thick spring mattress on it plus memory foam mattress pad, and it works great. It will be harder to move around the room because it does not have any wheels, but seeing we only did it once in the last 10 years to make more room for the crib, it should not be a big problem.

"This is my first Chromebook, and I wasn't sure what it is and how it works. Basically, it has Chrome OS instead of Windows, and you are supposed to do most of the things online. It does not work with usual Windows programs like Office and Photoshop or Firefox, but they do have their own google apps that do most of the things that you would expect, so it should be OK for many people if you only browse internet, check gmail and watch movies. But really, it does not allow any outside programs. Everything is done from Chrome browser, so you can see for yourself what can be done and how it works before buying a Chromebook by using Chrome browser, pretending it is the only thing installed on your computer, and seeing if it is enough for what you need. Maybe not installing a whole bunch of programs is a good thing - think about Windows running fast on a new computer, and slowing down after you load a bunch of software on it.The screen is nice and bright. The keyboard has lights all around keys, they do not shine through letters, but somehow the white letters are clearly seen in the dark. I really miss touchscreen here, but I was pleasantly surprised by the touchpad. It can move the pointer quite fast, and all the gestures with one, two or three finger touches make my life so much easier. Because it is not Windows computer, some of the control work differently, so they included a cheat sheet with shortcuts and useful tips, plus when you start the computer for the first time, there is a tour to learn the tricks. YOu can get to the tour later by clicking on question mark in the lower right corner. The keyboard is a bit different, too - no Windows button, obviously, no CapsLock button - yay. The power button located right next to backspace. It is the second laptop that has this ""feature"" and I just hate it when they do that. At least it does not turn off the computer - to do that you need to hold the button for a while. No F1-F12 buttons, too. No Print Screen, no Home, no End buttons, either. Bare minimum.The sound is good but not great. Loud enough for when you are close, but it is still too quiet for when you are not - I like to bring along a laptop with Netflix running when I am working on household tasks, and do have to bring a speaker with the laptop, the same as with my other laptop. It does sound a bit tinny when it is cranked all the way up.The laptop is quite lightweight for the size, and feels nice to the touch. Top is metal, but bottom is plastic, both textured (stickers will not stick), the touchpad feels textured, too. It gets hot quite soon - about an hour of netflix, and it is too hot to touch. They do have warnings about not touching it for a long periods of time, and using insulation if you plan keeping it on your lap.To sign in, you have to type gmail password. I hate it - mine is long and random to protect my information, and it is a pain to type it. Yes, I learned it by heart now, and you will, too. There is an option to sign in using your android phone - it is unlocked if your phone is unlocked and is within 100 ft. I did sign up for that, but I am not sure I like it - if you leave it on your desk, go to another room and start using your phone, people can get to your laptop and do whatever they want with it, so I would not leave this feature on if I did not trust people near me. It is easy to turn the feature off - go to settings in the lower right corner of your screen, and click on advanced settings on the bottom of the page - look for Smart Lock. You also need to have bluetooth turned on on both devices - another battery drain.Overall, if you do not need anything outside what Chrome can do, it is quite good, fast and nice machine. If you want freedom to use whatever programs you want, choose something else, or prepare to install another OS. This is what I will probably end up doing. I am giving it 4 stars for what it can and cannot do for being a Chromebook, without comparing it to Windows/whatever.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3GHEGYBTU71F4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015806LSQ#wasThisHelpful","R3GHEGYBTU71F4","A397CWU6DM3O5G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A397CWU6DM3O5G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The 8 oz jar is huge. It is supposed to last long, as you only need a little bit each time, so they had to add a whole bunch of chemicals to keep it stable for long time, even after opening. The main ingredient after water is propylene glycol, and the next one is coconut oil, and then the list goes on with glyceryl stearate, mineral oil, stearic acid, cetyl esters,propylene glycol (again?) and a while bunch of other parabens and such. It has vitamin E, too. It says not to use on red or irritated skin, which effectively excluded the use on my face since I have rosacea. I used it on my hands. I didn't get any side effects there. It is a bit hard to spread over the skin, but then it mostly absorbs easily. I would not call it lightweight formula for sure, it is too viscous and feels greasy to the touch. It does make skin softer right away. My jar looks quite different from the one on the product page, but it is the same brand Vitamin World, and the list of ingredients is the same, too.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R11AJ9OOBCRU5X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0043N4BSC#wasThisHelpful","R11AJ9OOBCRU5X","A397CWU6DM3O5G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A397CWU6DM3O5G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The book is very interesting, because it is not only about the recipes (which are good, too), but also about science of preparing meat. It describes in detail what chemical and physical processes happen after an animal was killed, and how to take advantage of it - how to treat each kind of animal to make sure it will yield the best results. Then, there is a big section for each kind of game - birds and animals, with pictures, short description on habitat, looks, what it eats and such. And then, of course, the recipes. There is a lot of different kinds, some only use basic ingredients, and some utilize more exotic and harder to find ones. Most of them quite easy, and then there are quite elaborate, too. Many of the recipes have full color beautiful pictures.

"This is really cute book. My six year old still likes lift the flap books and he was excited about this book. This book is not simply lift the flap - it is a paper action book - the tools can do their appropriate works. For example, a saw moves back and forth, and then you can move the cut piece away. Hammer hits the nail, and nail goes inside the wood piece. You move up a pencil and it marks the cut line.The pages are very thick, but they use a thinner card stock for the moving parts, so I do not think this book is very suitable for two year olds, as the amazon page suggests, they would simply tear the pieces apart in minutes. 4-6 year old is more appropriate age for this book, I think.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R37EFPTDKNQHMQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1027600743#wasThisHelpful","R37EFPTDKNQHMQ","A397CWU6DM3O5G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A397CWU6DM3O5G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have Silhouette Cameo, I love the machine even though it is tricky to use sometimes. I was really curious what new possibilities will be open with the new Curio machine.First of all, it is not a replacement for Cameo, since it can only cut relatively small size materials, but Curio can cut much thicker materials (5 mm vs 8 mil, if I am not mistaken). The large size tray for Curio is going to be 8.5 by 12 inches, twice the size of the regular mat that comes with Curio. Even though the regular tray can be used for cutting 8.5 by 6 inches size designs, you can still insert letter size cardstock in it to make front of the card, for example, and leave the back intact. You do not have to cut the paper to put it through the cutter. It kind of makes up for small size.Curio cutting mat is rigid. With Silhouette I would peel of mat from the paper instead of paper from the mat, and this helped keep paper from curling, it is nearly impossible to do this trick with Curio. The mats along with the spacers attaches to the cutting tray, so it is entirely possible to remove the whole thing, make some adjustments, put it back in, and still cut in the same place, because the mat will be positioned exactly in the same place. That would be especially useful if you found some elements of design did not cut through, you can run it through the machine again and cut properly. That was impossible with Cameo. The mat and spacers attach to the machine with little clips, they do include some extra ones in the box. Hope they will be available for purchase, too, those are quite thin plastic, might break easily, but we will see.The cut and sketch features work on Curio about the same way as on Cameo, except now you need to also use spacers to compensate from media thickness. It cuts and sketches with the same precision as Cameo.Curio does not have the ratchet blade adjustment attached to the body of the machine unlike Cameo, which is a minor annoyance, but they made four tool holders on Curio, which I love. Another nice thing is due to the lack of desk space, I put Curio in front of Cameo, and Curio tray moves just above the Cameo's bed, so I can put them close to each other without fear that the Curio's cutting tray will hit the Cameo. Every inch counts, right?I love twin blade holders, it was fun to sketch a shape with a metallic gel pen and then cut the same shape, which made for the golden edges for the shape. It is much easier to to this with one go. The most important thing is not forget to mark the right tool holders for each step, or you will be getting cut instead of sketch, etc.The only other new thing I was able to try (the other do not have right accessories yet) is embossing. The machine comes with two embossing tips and embossing mat. You can use embossing mat for cutting, too, but it reduces its life. it means you can do cutting and embossing in one go so both your cutting and embossing will align. The bad news is that I was only able to emboss plain copy paper. 67 lb cardstock seems to be too thick for the machine and the images emboss very faintly and I cannot see almost anything on the other side. It has the same 210 gram cutting force, which is much lower than competitor's machines force. (http://smile.amazon.com/dp/B00O1YI3CI/ has 750 g cutting force, for example) I would not expect crispy embossing from Curio, unfortunately. I love doing hand embossing with a hand tool and metal stencils, and my hands always hurt after that, because it takes a lot of force to emboss crispy images on card stock, so I can see how lack of pressure might be problematic. Sorry, Silhouette, I am not going to buy your emboss and score paper for dollar a sheet.There is a score and emboss function, that is made to imitate the look of proper debossing by scoring (cutting very thin layer) and then debossing. It kind of looks like kind of debossing, because it does have sharp edge where the machine scored the paper, but it is still not perfect.That leaves us with yet unexplored stippling, etching and deep cutting, we will see how it works when the tools become available for purchase in a few weeks. Hope it will work, but I am not very optimistic because of the cutting pressure.The software for Curio is the same as for Cameo - Silhouette Studio. There is stippling and embossing parts in the software that will not work until you connect Curio. The software is quite powerful as it is (it is free on the website), or you can upgrade for more features and even purchase a plugin for Corel Draw, and now business edition available, too. I have Designers Edition, and I love all the possibilities, plus the ability to cut .svg files. Of course, the new machine meant new update for the software, and new bugs as well. The good news is that the customer service is answering questions very quickly via email, and there are forums and groups available throughout the net with all kinds of friendly advice and even free designs.Bottom line, for right now, before the etching and deep cut blade has become available, if I didn't have Silhouette, I would not go for Curio. I would have bought one of the more powerful machines, they cost less than Silhouette and Curio combined. If stippling, etching and deep cutting work as they should when they come out, and someone figures out the best settings to make embossing work for regular materials, than Curio might be the right choice in addition to Silhouette.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R28YKV285W45ME/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZOU0W4K#wasThisHelpful","R28YKV285W45ME","A397CWU6DM3O5G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A397CWU6DM3O5G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is well engineered printer. The set up is easy, except for having to type (long) wifi password using old  telephone-style input, where you have to press each button multiple times to scroll to the correct symbol. It connected to my wifi and printed the test page without any problems. The print quality is very good. I like how the whole thing is made - there are indentations on both sides so it is easy to carry the printer, loading cartridges with just one click (you can replace them one by one as needed), all the little details that you usually do not notice, but that make life easier.The printer can print 11x17 inches paper as well as A3 size, which is a little bit larger than 11x17. Both of the sizes can be borderless, too. The large size paper or any other media that you do not want to bend load from the back, and there are two trays in the front - one for regular paper, and the other one for photo paper. It takes 277 or 277XL ink cartridges (there are six of them). Make sure you have some space behind the printer for printing in large sizes. I have it on a rolling cart so the back is easy to reach, but I can move the whole thing away when not in use. The printer itself is large, too, but it is only one inch deeper and three inches wider than XP-820 printer that is for standard size prints. I expected for it to be larger. The 960 has a cable about one foot shorter than the 820 for some reason.The printer makes beautiful photos. I only used Epson brand papers so far, and always got great results.

It is easy to unscrew the top, add water and oil and close it. The controls are a bit confusing, though. There is different color LED light inside, but in no way you can see it unless you look directly down from the top, so I am not sure why is it even here.

We put the carver on a large tray when kids are playing, so the crayon shavings would end up on the try and not on the carpet. They tried to make it as mess free as it can get with shavings collecting inside of the box, and raised edges, but some do find their way on the tray, too. There is exactly enough places to put the carving tiles on the machine. and you have to put them in the design space, too, if you want all of them attached. There are more tiles available for purchase, but there is no place to store them on the machine itself. All the other little attachments can be stored on the machine, too, which is just great.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2UV9EW8RHMRJE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TFWP3GU#wasThisHelpful","R2UV9EW8RHMRJE","A397CWU6DM3O5G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A397CWU6DM3O5G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The curling iron is made of two parts that you are supposed to connect, and you can buy and connect different barrels. Unfortunately, mine broke when I was trying to connect the two pieces. The barrel part that goes inside cracked when I tried to lock it. Now there is a big crack along the part of the barrel that goes inside of the handle. It is all plastic in there, and apparently, it cracks way too easy. I called the company - they hung up after a few minutes of wait. I went online, and was able to write to them from there. It says I will receive a response within two business days, but they are still silent. To get warranty repair or replacement you need to have the serial number which is conveniently located on the outside of the box and nowhere else, so you can inadvertently throw it away and possibly be left without warranty. The website states that for warranty you have to have the silver sticker with the serial number still attached, they do not specify what is it supposed to be attached to, though. The website also states that if your product is going to be replaced under warranty, you should send it to them first (it does not say who will pay for it), and they will mail you another one withing three weeks.  I seriously dislike all this kinds of tricks.Aside from being broken now, the iron looks very attractive. The cable is long and swivels easily so it will not be tangled up with use. To exchange barrels, you most definitely have to wait until the one you were using cools down, which probably means you are not going to use two different barrels to make the same hairdo.","2.0 out of 5 stars","October 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R19Q6QFGDFPR8V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014R3FO92#wasThisHelpful","R19Q6QFGDFPR8V","A397CWU6DM3O5G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A397CWU6DM3O5G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The iron heats up to the highest setting in just one minute. I gather it would be even faster for lower settings. The white outside is all plastic and so is the golden part. The cord is longer than usual, and it is really nice, I didn't realize how restrictive 6 ft cord feels until I tried the T3. The cord also swivels easily so I do not have to worry that it will tangle, and I do not have to fight with tangled up cord. The ceramic area is very smooth and it works perfectly, but it is on the smaller size, about 1 inch by 4 inches, so it is great for shorter hair, but it would be too little for longer hair that needs a lot of work.The iron looks very stylish. They include a heat proof mat, but it is quite small, and black, looks like it is made of dense felt. It looks OK on my very dark brown vanity, but it just not as pretty as the iron itself.I checked out the warranty on the iron, and they say for the warranty the iron has to be purchased from an authorized retailer, and it has to have a silver sticker with the serial number. The problem is that the sticker is located on the box, not on the iron itself, so if you throw the box away you might be in trouble if something goes wrong. It also looks like in case of warranty claim you will have to send the iron to them first before they will evaluate it and decide if they replace it, and it should take 3 weeks. I am not comfortable with this kind of customer care for such an expensive luxury product.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RH5O5T2ERQAY7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014OSNXAW#wasThisHelpful","RH5O5T2ERQAY7","A397CWU6DM3O5G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A397CWU6DM3O5G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The big colorful pieces are made of soft bendable plastic with rounded edges and dull colors. The white cube shaped pieces are made out of hard Lego-like plastic, and have sharp edges. They are cubes with five indentations in them, and one bump to connect to another cube. To add more ways to connect the cubes, they added two tiny connectors, less than half inch in size. Something tells me those would be lost in a flash, which will make it impossible to make some of the projects.The wheels do rotate, although not very well, but all the other rotating pieces hardly do - they do connect with round pieces, but the pieces fit so tightly they do not allow for easy movement. This greatly reduces the play with finished projects - who wants to play with helicopter if the rotors do not spin? The parts require quite an effort to connect with each other or to pull apart.Pieces can be stored in the box, but since they are so large, the finished and even half finished projects will not fit in there.The story in the book is not very inspiring, and does not make too much sense most of the time. The illustrations are the same quality as the artwork on the box, you be the judge. The suggested age is 3-6 years old, but the instructions have multiple pieces added in each step, which makes it highly unlikely for a three year old to be able to follow. Combined with hard to connect pieces it becomes a toy where a parent builds everything, and then kid plays with the result for a minute and walks away.The list price of $45 does seem to be high for this mediocre set. I guess they charge extra for using word ""engineer"". I bet if they added ""STEM"" they could have charged more.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RI0U1MSERLYY1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TF8ZQJS#wasThisHelpful","RI0U1MSERLYY1","A397CWU6DM3O5G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A397CWU6DM3O5G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I received this mat nearly free for the purpose of this review.The mat is quite generous in size, and it is made of thin layer of silicone. It is limp and drapey. This mat is made for lining your work table when dealing with dough. It says right on the mat that it can withstand 230C (about 450F) so it is mostly safe to go in the oven, but it does not have rigid edges as other silicone mats designed specifically for the oven do. It is perfectly fine to line a cookie pan with it, though.The surface of the mat is a bit tacky, and it makes the mat to temporarily adhere to the table so it will not move while you are rolling the dough. I was able to stick it to the wall cabinet, and it stayed there for a few hours before it fell down, this is how sticky it it.

"I gave this board game to my son for his birthday who just turned eight-years old.  It was the first thing he opened and immediately demanded to play it with grandpa (grandpa is always up for a good board game!).  After setting it up, grandpa and grandson were racing to find a path between a number and a symbol.Dominate is one of those very simple games that looks a lot more modern than it really is.  From a distance it looks a bit like Stratego, but its actually more like dominoes.  In essence, you roll two dice (one with a symbol, the other with a number), and then its up to players on each side (who cant see the others slides) to move the pieces around until theres a clear line between the number (1 through 6) and the symbols.The game looks complicated  the paths look like circuits!  but its actually pretty simple.  That doesnt make it easy by any stretch; shifting the tiles around can be frustrating, and my eight-year-old wasnt happy with it.  The challenge is that this is truly a head-to-head game thats timed, so its easy to get frustrated when playing against an adult.  It might be better to try to solve the puzzle in timed trials (vs. playing against another player) just to relieve some of the pressure.There's several randomizing factors at play.  For one, the placement of the tiles by each player is determined by the player -- smart players might try to make lines in the hopes they get lucky -- but the other randomizing factors largely cancel this out.  Then there's the dice, doubling the variance for the shape you need to connect to at one end and the number at the other.Additionally, there's the six shapes (titled ""goal chips"") themselves; the goal chips are also placed randomly at the beginning of the game.  When a player wins, he claims a goal chip.  This creates a bit of an issue with randomization as the game progresses, because you can roll a goal chip on the die that has already been won, in which case you need to roll again.  Not a big deal early in the game, but when there's just two goal chips left this means a lot of rerolling.Its a fun idea, but eight-year-olds might find it a bit frustrating at first and it seems to have limited replay value.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R16KF6C31LFV8C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RQLH25M#wasThisHelpful","R16KF6C31LFV8C","A3PPXVR5J6U2JD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3PPXVR5J6U2JD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My son, who just turned eight, is a big fan of creating his own content  I blame Minecraft  and as a result frequently creates Minecraft comics.  His addiction to Minecraft and video games is considerable, so I suspect he considers creating comics a reasonable substitute when his screen time is limited.  Hes made several page comics on his own before, so this book was a natural next step for him.The kit comes with everything you need, including markers, a cover sheet, and 16 interior pages. Theres a form to ship it all off when youre ready (this may take a while) and advice on how to put it all together.Theres a pretty big age swing for this product (4 to 10 on Amazon, 4 to 8 in the description) and how your childs age will likely determine how they engage with it. The suggested steps to creating the book are a little basic (you mean you write down your ideas? AMAZING!), but thats likely for the younger kids.  On the other hand, my five-year-old daughter is still learning to read and write, so the graphics are more important than the lines on each page (six lines on one-third of each page). The only two completely blank pages are for the front and back.  Theres also the opportunity to include an About the Author section, complete with the kids picture.My son's response to the book was lukewarm. I recommended he and my daughter work together on it, but we'll see if we can get them to focus on it -- maybe dividing up the pages a little at a time with an overarching story where they fill in the blanks.This book reminds me a bit of those customized baseball cards featuring a picture of your child with relevant (often amusing) stats.  Or to put it another way, this is an adorable book as a giftfor someone else.  The thrill of seeing a published book is starting to wear off in this day and age of self-publishing, high-quality printing, and the constant stream of creativity my kids generate every week at school or camp.

"Im a big fan of bagless vacuums. The Dyson we have changed our lives.  So when it was time to buy a vacuum for our basement/garage which is also my man cave and the kids playroom, we bought a cheap bagless vacuum.  It lasted a year. Simply put, any downstairs vacuum is on the front lines of a war against the dirty outside world (the garage door is frequently open). Enter the CH5040.This is a commercial vacuum, so its not out to impress anybody. The first thing you notice is its no-frills appearance; the second is that its basically a cloth bag on a tube. This is why the CH5040 is so light; its got very few solid components. The electronics are entirely located in the handle, which comes separately and you screw into the base.The CH5040 does two things: vacuum loudly and vacuum quietly.  This is a commercial vacuum meant to be used by a cleaning service who doesnt want to disturb the owners, but I find it useful to vacuum around my kids in the playroom who frequently complain about the noise. There wasnt a huge difference in suction power between the two modes, but presumably there has to be some loss of power in quiet mode or I assume Hoover would have just made it quiet all the time.I mentioned that its light and theres a good reason for that. Theres a handle on the back thats not just for hoisting the vacuum, but also lifting it horizontal so you can vacuum steps. You can try to do this with a typical vacuum but 1) they often dont lie nearly flat, 2) theyre way too heavy. I vacuumed the basement steps and this worked very well.There are a few issues with this vacuum holding it back from a full five stars though.  For one, it has a short cord and comes with an extension cord  presumably so that a cleaning person can use an extra-long cord if needed.  The problem is that this means the short plug sticking out of the vacuum frequently comes unplugged under significant pressure. I have several corded outdoor tools and they all come with a little loop to tie the cord so that this doesnt happen.  Its not a huge deal (you can just tie it in a knot, or tie it around the aforementioned handle), but its a design flaw that should have been accounted for.The other issue is that the on/off button is on the handle. Vigorous use virtually guarantees you will shut the CH5040 by accident once or twice. Ad this together with the cord coming loose and if you use this vacuum a lot it makes for a frustrating experience.Additionally, it doesnt have a wand, so this vacuum cant quite get everywhere (being light and liftable makes up for some of those places but not everywhere). And this is still a bagged vacuum, which means at some point you need to replace it.  But given the performance of the bagless vacuum before, Ill take my chances.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1CZZDUBP97EBG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DSSNNGE#wasThisHelpful","R1CZZDUBP97EBG","A3PPXVR5J6U2JD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3PPXVR5J6U2JD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This graphic novel was written by the inimitable Craig Thompson, the multi-award winning artist and writer who churns out massive comic compilations and Space Dumplins is no different. Its a meaty tome filled with drama, adventure, and deep thoughts about our relationship with the environment  even if it happens to be a space environment that involves space logging and space whales.The main protagonist is Violet, a precocious girl whose life is turned upside-down when a space whale eats her school. All this eating causes an epidemic of whale diarrhea and vomit, which creates flooding in the space lanes and emergency evacuations.  Violet is caught between the dueling lifestyles of her lumberjack (spacejack?) father and her high fashion mother. Her parents have very real arguments about class and obligation that are surprisingly serious for a book suitable for all ages.When Violets dad disappears on a secret mission to deal with the space whales, she goes on an adventure to rescue him.  Along the way she enlists an evolved space chicken and an orange thing who claims he is the last of his race.  They form a Star Trek-like triumvirate of impetuous leadership, Spock-like logic, and hot-headed emotion. There are times when Thompson beats you over the head with precisely this point, and there are other times when Violet spouts philosophy that seems totally out of character for her. Also, the space chicken has biblical visions that seem to embrace astrology.Space Dumplins is an odd duck (or odd chicken, if you prefer).  Its gorgeously illustrated, with details that span multiple pages. Its chaotic, and occasionally so messy its not clear who is talking. It also ping pongs between heartfelt emotions and just being gross  I mean, who doesnt love graphic whale vivisection?In the end, this is a book about children reuniting with their parents, be it space whales, space chickens, space orange things, or space girls named Violet.

"This is the beginning of vacation season for our family, so these packing cubes seemed like they might come in handy.  With a family of four, they ended up being a huge help.As you can imagine, packing one suitcase for two adults and two kids gets messy. We try to stay in suites, but this doesn't mitigate the fact that clothes get packed and unpacked inefficiently and sometimes just plain lost. These cubes are an excellent solution to the problem.They're durable, it's easy to see what's inside, and they're very lightweight.  My wife assigned a cube to each of us.  It provided a good limit to what we could put in the suitcase -- if it didn't fit in the cube, it didn't go with us! And with an easy handle and double zippers, it's easy to place and retrieve from luggage.Once we got there the real test began.  We tried to just place each cube in a drawer.  The depth was just a hair too much (to be fair, we really stuffed the cubes), but for a slightly deeper drawer it would work fine.  Then you basically live out of your cube. Alternately, you can use the cube for your dirty laundry and fill it up as your trip progresses.The cubes passed with flying colors, our clothes all stayed in their separate compartments, and nobody lost anything.  High marks for such a simple concept.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3JXQ88X3WFU44/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SXKU5LI#wasThisHelpful","R3JXQ88X3WFU44","A3PPXVR5J6U2JD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3PPXVR5J6U2JD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"First things first: this is a pattern game. You set cards out in a 6 x 6 layout and then turn them over.  Get three different kinds of fish in a row (red, purple, and yellow, who are also all different sizes for easy identification) and you get to squish an opponent's fish.That brings up the second point that parents need to know: this is a Play-doh game. Oh, it's not ""Play-doh"" of course, it's ""safe modeling fun dough,"" but the point being it's a clay modeling game.  That's the good news.  The bad news?  After making your beautiful fish creations, your kids will be smashing them all over the table.Each player gets barely enough clay to sculpt five fish, which sits on a flimsy piece of cardboard. This made a mess. Then whenever a kid gets three in a row, he or she gets to smash some other kid's fish.  This made them mad. Then we had to clean up the mess after the smashing and the inevitable complaining.  This made ME mad.On some visceral level it's fun to smash clay.  But not when it's someone else's clay, who may have spent five minutes putting it together.  The molds don't help -- the art makes it look like the fish are three-dimensional, but they're actually one-sided.  This makes sense; the only way you can efficiently crank out five fish quickly is by placing the clay under the mold and pressing down hard. These one-sided fish do not stand up well, so now you have to do additional sculpting to ensure they have a wide enough base. Mind you, this is work for clay fish that are doomed to be squished anyway.The more I test board games with my children from these board game companies I've never heard of, the more I question if anyone actually tests them with kids.  On the surface, the game seems fun: three-in-a-row plus Play-doh = awesome right? But in reality kids don't like their art projects smashed, and because there's really no rhyme or reason as to which player's fish gets smashed, they can easily gang up on a player.Nice idea in theory, not so great in practice.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R4ZCGGON1KPMU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00S8JGK0Y#wasThisHelpful","R4ZCGGON1KPMU","A3PPXVR5J6U2JD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3PPXVR5J6U2JD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My father is an architect, but I don't have an architectural bone in my body. My son, on the other hand, was drawing his own floor plans at four-years-old, so I thought this would be perfect for him.  What is even better however, is that you can use the tools to plot out building your own Minecraft house.My son, like many seven-year-old boys, is Minecraft-crazy.  He's really enjoys the blueprints and stencils. The stencils cover both larger building views (from the side) as well as a zoomed-in room view, which is where the Minecraft magic happens. The colored pencils and sketchbook are just gravy.That said, the extra stuff (the pencils, the sketch book) are really something you could get anywhere.  For the price, this feels like they're bundling content that's unnecessary.  You're better off providing a kid with a project -- in my case, asking my son to draw out the plans for his various Minecraft houses before he builds them in the game -- and then let their creativity range free.Who knows?  Maybe the boy will follow in his grandfather's steps...although I suspect the state of architecture will likely involve a lot more computer modeling and a lot less line drawing by then.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R22BSFUTMN4J49/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007H0WFKE#wasThisHelpful","R22BSFUTMN4J49","A3PPXVR5J6U2JD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3PPXVR5J6U2JD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As an inexperienced camper, Im learning the hard way about carrying a sleeping bag, the importance of comfortable sleeping material. So far, Ive learned that I 1) do not sleep well on floors (like in Cub Scout sleepovers in museums), and 2) I dont like the restrictive nature of sleeping bags.  I feel like Im being swallowed up by some sleeping bag monster and it freaks me out.This sleeping pad addresses a few concerns.  For one, it doesnt get too warm (which is fine with me) so theres not this weird reflection of your body heat back at you from an inflated cushion.  For another, its light enough that you can carry it easily.  Lugging a sleeping bag alone is aggravating enough, this is a nice compromise between carrying an air bed and one of those awful flat mats that my son seems to have no problem sleeping on.That said, you cant just sleep on this thing without a cover.  You could theoretically sleep on it with just your sleeping bag, but since I kick everywhere thats not an option.  The sleeping mat actually has a use here  put it over this and it provides enough flat surface so you dont have dreams of falling through any of the holes.For the price, youre really paying for the fact that its so lightweight. And it achieves that in spades  at just 12 ounces and packed down to a 6 by 3 size thats about as encumbering as a full water bottle.

"Inspired by my success with giant spiders, I picked up a pack of party favor alligators to fill the role of packs of crocodiles and alligators in my Fifth Edition Dungeons & Dragons game. Crocodiles are large sized, so the Visejaw Crocodile is the nearest approximation at $8 each.  Or you could just buy this 12-pack of crocodiles for eight bucks (including shipping).The crocodiles, which you can buy from Amazon here, come in three poses: crocodile, crocodile with its mouth open, and alligator.  You can tell the difference because the alligator has a pointed snout.Like the giant spiders, you can get 12 of these critters for cheap or pay the same price for just one.

"One of the changes of the Fifth Edition of Dungeons & Dragons is that there is no longer a sliding scale for certain common monsters like monstrous spiders.  They have been returned to their ""giant"" status, and you can't very well have a giant spider that's tiny-sized, can you?  So now the only kind of giant spider is a large-sized spider, which made a lot of miniatures useless. A large monstrous spider miniature retails for $22 with shipping included. But I'm here to tell you that you can have 12 giant spiders for under five bucks.It doesn't help that giant spiders tend to come in packs. For the moment I'm leaving aside the medium-sized wolf spiders because I have plenty of those that fit the bill (specifically, the deathjump spider from D&D miniatures).The answer: party favors. Party favors are surprisingly well-sculpted and colorfully painted.  I ordered them for $4.49 and free shipping thanks to Amazon prime (you can order yours here). What you get is four different types of spiders, three of each: the flat-thorax huntsman spider, the hairy house spider, the smooth black widow spider, and the brown recluse. Mind you, I had to interpret what these spiders were meant to represent by the shape of each sculpt, so this list isn't necessarily accurate.  I based them all first and then painted them according to the type of spider I thought they should represent.Did it work? 12 giant spiders (four types, three each) would normally cost me $264 in D&D miniatures or even Reaper Bones' giant spider at $6 (shipping included).  Not bad for a toy!","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R29VU0FUY2PCPM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002XSH44C#wasThisHelpful","R29VU0FUY2PCPM","A3PPXVR5J6U2JD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3PPXVR5J6U2JD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"My seven-year-old son isn't a big fan of bugs, so I thought this book might be a good opportunity to get him to think of bugs as good guys instead of horrible monsters to be squashed. We read a chapter together each night. The good news is this book is a seat-of-your pants ride that he begged me to keep reading after we finished a chapter.  The bad news is he still hates bugs.In short, Max finds a magical magnifying glass inside an old musty tome his mom bought him at an auction (his mom brings home things from the auction house where she works, like full suits of armor -- she's the coolest mom, ever).  When Max uses the magnifying glass to look at a map in the book, he is transported to Bug Island, a world where he's bug-sized.  He meets emperor scorpion Spike, which is a bit like befriending a great white shark.After determining that Max is not a lizard (the enemy, natch), Spike brings Max to the bug's leader, Barton, an enormous brown beetle. A volcanic eruption has caused a bridge to form between Bug Island and Reptile Island and the bad guys have begun to inviade. It turns out Max's superior brain might just be the edge the bug's need to fight off the dreaded General Komodo and his army.Because this was a review copy the pictures were not all finished, but my kids enjoyed looking at them anyway. Judging by the description the critters in the book are meant to look like the real thing, but some of the bug pictures seem more anthropomorphic than others.Author Jack Patton does a great job of balancing the fear of bugs -- particularly scorpions, tarantulas, and other venomous creepy crawlies -- with their utility.  No bug is cuddly in this book, but they're not bad guys either.  The bugs are divided into combat divisions by type, so the flying bugs have their own regiment, so do the army ants, the hornets, etc.  All of the bugs have entertaining personalities too, particularly the stuttering, shy trapdoor spider.Conversely, the bad guys are often referred to as reptiles when that's clearly not the case.  There are several amphibians in the mix, and Patton seems to remember this a little later when he starts referencing that Reptile Island's troops also included frogs and toads.  Still, that's a minor quibble in an otherwise very engaging battle between micro-fauna.At heart this Battle Bugs delivers on the title's promise: a war story that's light on casualties and big on fun. My five-year-old daughter (who isn't afraid of bugs) enjoyed it too.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1S6YIMTY165GN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0545707412#wasThisHelpful","R1S6YIMTY165GN","A3PPXVR5J6U2JD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3PPXVR5J6U2JD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It all started with Bratz. The trend that had overcome pop-culture, where divas with skinny waists and short skirts became celebrities, finally permeated little girls' toys in the awful monstrosities known as Bratz. The outcry was fast and loud, so the toy makers shifted gears.  Bratz begat Monster High, and Monster High begat Ever After High -- because fantasy versions of barely-there dressed dolls are a little more acceptable. In response, Hasbro ""aged up"" their My Little Pony line -- if Hollywood monsters could be fashionistas, why not ponies? -- with Equestria Girls, which is why we now have Twilight Sparkle in a skirt.To be fair, the two Equestria Girls movies have actually been pretty good.  But what's fascinating is how much Hasbro has touted the success of the Equestria Girls dolls despite the fact that they only have two movies in the entire franchise. It's clear that these dolls -- no matter what we adults think of them -- sell, and they sell well.Twilight Sparkle is indicative of the changes in the line.  The dolls have similar proportions to Bratz: long legs, short arms, tiny waists, big eyes. In Twilight Sparkle's case, this is a costume for a concert, which makes it marginally more acceptable than the Bratz characters who apparently wear their outfits for a night out (or who knows, every day?). Twilight has a similar color scheme to her pony counterpart.  But she also has a rainbow hairpiece that little girls can clip onto their own hair...or clueless dads who forget it's clipped to their back pants pocket... *cough*Anyway, this doll is surprisingly articulated.  She can sit and cross her legs easily, stands reasonably well, and comes with a few additional accessories (shoes, purse, and earrings -- the earrings are barely noticeable). My daughter enjoyed playing with the doll for her birthday, but Twilight Sparkle was no competition for the plush Anna doll she also received as a present.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RUG8FCO7KZT0N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NCZZXMK#wasThisHelpful","RUG8FCO7KZT0N","A3PPXVR5J6U2JD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3PPXVR5J6U2JD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This board game has a lot of things my kids like.  Dogs? Check! A pop-o-matic dice? Check! Checkers? Uh...Check!  By all accounts this should have been a huge hit. But instead it's a muddled mess of poor rules, aggravating game play, and no dogs whatsoever.Let's start with the dogs. This game is ""dog-themed."" Imagine if all the animated movie Lady and the Tramp featured nothing but dog bowls, paw prints, and bones and that's pretty much what you get with this board game. There are pictures of dogs on the box and some in the instructions and that's it.  It's just paw prints on the board, the pieces are dog bowls, and the queens are identified with flimsy foam bones.Speaking of the components, there's three: brown and red dog bowls, a bunch of white bones, and the pop-o-matic. The dog bowls are surprisingly sturdy components, which is totally unnecessary for a game of checkers. The materials should have been spent on creating the queens (Dog Bowl Kings, in this game), which are identified by the bones you place in the bowls.  The bone doesn't even fit all the in the bowl. This rapidly becomes a problem when you move a Dog Bowl King and the bone falls out.Besides the not-a-dog theme, there's two twists in how the game differs from checkers.  There's the pop-o-matic, which features three dice.  These dice have six sides with two possibilities, red bone or brown bone.  Depending on which dice you get, you move your piece and/or your player's piece as well!And now we come to the most confusing and aggravating part of the game: each turn, each player can move any piece on the board. Depending on the die roll, the player may not get to move any of his own pieces and only his opponent's and vice versa.The problem with these two innovations is how they interact with each other.  Early in the game there's not a lot of places to move (non-King dog bowls can only move forward, remember), which means you very quickly run out of options and forfeit your turn.  It also robs player's of agency, frustrating kids who dislike seeing their pieces moved by their opponent and get rapidly confused as to whose turn it is.The popper/""anyone moves"" mechanic would actually be helpful during the final stages of the game, where opponents can circle each other forever as Dog Bowl Kings, but the game specifically prohibits this.Here's my recommendations to improve this game:1) Buy some plastic dogs to replace Dog Bowl Kings.  Everyone will be happy that they finally get to play a dog in a game with dogs plastered all over it. Also, you won't have to worry about losing the tiny bones.2) Don't use the popper until the first person gets a Dog Bowl King, and then apply the ""player controls opponent's piece"" rule to every piece, including the Kings. This helps speed up play rather than slow it down.Or you could just buy a cheap game of checkers, three dice (even is red, odd is brown), the aforementioned plastic dogs, and end up with a better dog-themed checkers game for under $10.","2.0 out of 5 stars","May 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1EZ96BA79CCYD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00A1XA768#wasThisHelpful","R1EZ96BA79CCYD","A3PPXVR5J6U2JD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3PPXVR5J6U2JD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I resisted getting an electric toothbrush for years. Did I really need that hassle? However, my dentist finally talked me into it. It's not like she sells the toothbrushes, and she's the best dentist I've ever had, so I was willing to take her advice. Then it was kismet that this opportunity for an electric toothbrush became available.I use this toothbrush on the sensitive setting because my teeth are ridiculously prone to discomfort from hot and cold. This toothbrush has a lot of the bells and whistles many of them have, such as different settings and a little stutter when it's time to switch sides. My teeth don't exactly feel cleaner than they do after manually brushing (and my dentist warned me of this) but they feel cleaner longer after. My teeth don't feel quite as in need of a good brushing at night as they used to. I think that's probably the best endorsement of an electric toothbrush that I can give.I was concerned about constantly having to plug this toothbrush in, but it goes weeks without needing a recharge. The battery gauge light on the front of the unit lets you know when it's time to recharge. It also comes with a handy case, which keeps the entire works clean and enclosed (because we all know your toothbrush shouldn't be left exposed in the bathroom!). It's easy to change settings on the lighted display.Overall, it's a solid toothbrush that has made the chore of finally switching to an electric toothbrush a bit easier. The multiple settings make it worthwhile for people who have complicated dental problems.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3TC1TEYX6GNXZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QZ67O6G#wasThisHelpful","R3TC1TEYX6GNXZ","A3PPXVR5J6U2JD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3PPXVR5J6U2JD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've been a big fan of GreenWorks since I switched from my old electric lawnmower to a dual-battery GreenWorks mower. Unfortunately here in the northeast it's been difficult to find anything to use it on because the entire outside has been covered in snow.  All of it. All the time.  Did I mention I'm sick of the snow?So it wasn't until the day after the first day of Spring that I had a chance to try this sucker out. And holy cow did it pass with flying colors.I of course didn't read the instructions at all as I assembled the thing.  I assembled it and pressed the button.

"When I first saw ""Night at the Museum"" I thought it was stupid fun. That was eight years ago, if you can believe it, and the trilogy finally comes to a close with this final installment. As the passing of two key cast members demonstrates, the show really is over -- a decidedly adult conclusion to a kid-friendly franchise.Who hasn't thought about museums coming to life? It was only in the past decade, when the special effects could keep up with our imaginations, that the concept was brought to the screen in glorious (and often cheesy) CGI. And who better to shepherd a franchise than Ben Stiller as Larry Daley, channeling his bitter snark into a family-friendly loser who is just trying to raise his kid right.If you watch the first movie again...well, don't, because then you'll start to notice things -- the most egregious being the relentless characterization of Attila the Hun (Patrick Gallagher) as spouting gibberish.  But never you mind, because ""Secret of the Tomb"" is now refined family fare. The third part of the trilogy has filed off the sharp edges so that there's less monkey slapping and more hugging and kissing.To wit, the tablet of Ahkmenrah, responsible for animating all of the exhibits in the Museum of Natural History, is beginning to corrode. During a special exhibition in which the exhibits are ""brought to life"" (unbeknownst to the wealthy guests in attendance, who think they are merely special effects) the animating magic of the tablet goes haywire and the animated creatures go nuts, ruining the museum and leading to Dr. McPhee (Ricky Gervais) getting canned.  The whole party -- literally, the museum's exhibits seem to party every night -- comes to an abrupt end.But fear not! One flashback and some exposition later, we learn that former villain from the first film Cecil Fredericks (Dick Van Dyke, along with Bill Cobbs and recently passed Mickey Rooney ) is the link to the tablet's past. Fredericks directs Larry to the British Museum, where Ahkmenrah's parents (Ben Kingsley and Anjali Jay) hold the secret to restoring the tablet to its former glory.  This is of course an opportunity to animate and explore a whole new museum filled with its own quirks and wonders.As with all of the ""Night at the Museum"" movies, there are always jokes that just go on too long. Rebel Wilson as Tilly, the British security guard equivalent of Larry, spends far too much screen time desperately trying to be funny with nothing to do. There's an awkward thread about fathers and sons -- Larry's son Nicky wants to be a DJ instead of go to college -- that's supposed to parallel later events in the film but doesn't quite succeed.  And Stiller's brand of humor isn't for everybody.But there's some brilliant moments too, filled with action, intrigue, and a lot of coming-of-age hokum. The Neanderthal Laa that was modeled to look like Larry is an inspired joke and Sir Lancelot's (Dan Stevens) epic quest is heart wrenching when his hubris finally comes to grips with reality. Indeed, ""Secret of the Tomb"" embraces death, even if it's only because some gold prop started to corrode.In what can only be described as a bittersweet finale, Robin Williams as Theodore Roosevelt says goodbye to...well, to everything. Adults wept in the theater while kids wondered what the heck was going on. And suddenly what was a trifle of a kids film filled with stories about the wonders of history has become a sharp lesson about letting go of the past.Does this make the film better? Will people watching it years later still feel the same? Probably not.  But for now, in the present, everything is thrown in sharp relief by the last line ever spoken by Robin Williams as a wax figure in the form of Teddy Roosevelt:""Smile, my boy. It's sunrise.""","3.0 out of 5 stars","February 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R25EES6BXQKGG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SSI2IS8#wasThisHelpful","R25EES6BXQKGG","A3PPXVR5J6U2JD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3PPXVR5J6U2JD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It's easy to get jaded if you're a fan of horror films.  We've seen it all before: Slasher kills girl's family, girl meets slasher, slasher dies only to be resurrected in a sequel. ""You're Next"" is a refreshing twist on the tired slasher tropes.The first sign that ""You're Next"" is different is in how director Adam Wingard treats his characters. Five minutes in, we are invited to judge a relationship without understanding what's going on: an older man and a much younger woman having sex.  That early scene communicates volumes. Our camera perspective peering into the bedroom makes their lovemaking look more like violence. The girl is clearly unsatisfied. Padding out of the room while her lover takes a shower, she sets up a five-disc CD player of music on repeat that will be integral to the rest of the film. Then she dies.As our protagonists enter the next scene, driving up to a house nearby ad offhandedly explaining that the double homicide we just witnessed was a professor who left his wife for a college student. Do we feel better about their deaths as a result of their moral transgressions? While that question bounces around, we discover that our protagonists Crispian (A.J. Bowen) and Erin (Sharni Vinson) are in a similar relationship.  Do they deserve to die too?The rest of the film is a running battle between three men in masks wielding crossbows and a WASPy family reunion gone sour.  Erin and Crispian don't know each other that well, and the film cleverly juxtaposes the horrors of navigating a boyfriend's family with a slasher film. There's the frail mother, the overbearing father, the little sister who battles for attention, and the bullying older brother who is jealous of everyone else's happiness.  All of these family members come with their respective spouses, who are equally clueless and disengaged.  All the non-family members (Erin included) also look curiously fake -- Erin and Zee (Wendy Glenn) look like they're wearing wigs. In ""You're Next"" the killers aren't the only ones wearing masks.As the assault progresses, we get an explanation for why the bad guys do what they do, and ""You're Next"" gleefully wallows in the utter depravity of its villains. It throws the sins of the family in stark relief -- they're bad, but they're not murderers. Or are they?Erin certainly is. In a refreshing twist, we discover that Erin is no shrinking violet. She uses survival tactics worthy of any prepper compound.  There's something viscerally satisfying about her increasingly ferocious counterattack as each character's morals (or lack thereof) are brutally unmasked.""You're Next"" is filled with plot holes in service to the genre. Nobody seems to have any guns. The killers can barely see thanks to their ridiculous masks and they refuse to take them off when anonymity is no longer an issue. And the murder plot is flimsy at best. But ""You're Next"" isn't about realism.  It's about really, really hating your family. If you can't find the humor in that, this movie may not be right for you.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1HLZORH7OY27W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00G5GNYY2#wasThisHelpful","R1HLZORH7OY27W","A3PPXVR5J6U2JD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3PPXVR5J6U2JD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Just discovered Beck's fabulous ""Girl"" (I know, it takes me years to discover songs). I've seen a lot of controversy over whether this is a love song, or a serial killer's internal monologue, and a lot of theories in between. Here's what I think:  I saw her, yeah I saw her with her black tongue tied  Round the roses  Fist pounding on a vending machine  Toy diamond ring stuck on her finger  With a noose she can hang from the sun  And put it out with her dark sunglassesThe narrator sees a girl (noticably not a woman) pounding on a vending machine. She has a diamond ring on her finger, which he mocks, calling it a toy. Her marriage, it's clear, is something she's not mature enough to understand. He also feels she's either self-destructive of hopelessly naieve, and that although she wears dark sunglasses (cause she's that cool), she actually has a huge ego. Her ego's big enough that if she were to hang herself, she'd block the sun out. She's obviously into goth-type attitude/attire, as evidenced by her ""black tongue tied"" and ""dark sunglasses."" Judging from the tongue-tied, I'd guess she's a theater major or English major fond of spouting epithets that don't make her sound any smarter.  Walking crooked down the beach  She spits on the sand where their bones are bleaching  And I know I'm gonna steal her eyeAs she walks down the beach in a crooked line, a line that most people walk straight (and thus representative of her winding, indecisive life), she spits. Again, not a nice image for an object of affection, but more importantly she doesn't even know what's she spits on. Alternately, she's too oblivious to notice the bones of the creatures on the beach, as she's so wrapped up in herself.  She doesn't even know what's wrong  And I know I'm gonna make her die  Take her where her soul belongs  And I know I'm gonna steal her eye  Nothing that I wouldn't trySo ""gonna make her die"" -- does that mean Beck wants to kill this poor girl?I doubt it. It's more likely he's going to break her heart. He feels he's a real man, better to bring this girl into a real relationship than the stupid marriage she's locked into. He's been watching her all this time and plans to grab her attention (""steal her eye"") and is quite determined to do it.  Hey, My...girl  Hey, My...girlThe refrain is the real crux of the song, and Beck knows it. On his own site he blurred the lyrics. Sure it sounds like sun-eyed girl. Or cyanide girl. Of course, both are right. Despite her goth attire, the girl is hopelessly naieve (sun-eyed). But she's also hopelessly self-destructive as a result of that toy diamond ring. So if someone's going to kill her foolish spirit, Beck's the one to do it...or at least imagining he could do it.  I saw her, yeah I saw her with her hands tied back  And her rags were burning  Crawling out from a landfilled life  Scrawling her name upon the ceilingWe move forward in time. Now see the girl again. Her hands are tied (literally, she doesn't know what to do now), her clothes are a mess. She's now desperate to prove she has value after the wreck of her marriage (""land-filled life""), as so many of us wish to ""scrawl our names"" -- but she's scrawling it on the ceiling, not the floor. If she's outside, this is a hopelessly futile gesture. If she's inside, it still denotes her naieve outlook of looking up instead of down at the landfill she just crawled out of. Always up and onwards!  Throw a coin in a fountain of dust  White noise, her ears are ringingShe's still taking stupid chances, maybe playing the lottery -- she throws bad money after good by tossing a coin in a fountain, but it's a dusty fountain (traditionally tossing a coin in a fountain is lucky). She's also not listening. She hears white noise instead of any actual advice. So who's next great hope for this hopeless girl? Beck, of course.  Got a ticket for a midnight hanging  Throw a bullet from a freight train leaving  And I know I'm gonna steal her eye  She doesn't even know what's wrong  And I know I'm gonna make her die  Take her where her soul belongs  And I know I'm gonna steal her eye  Nothing that I would not tryThe ultimately irony here is that Beck probably caused the dissolution of her marriage. And now he's going to tell her he's breaking up with her too. He's got a ticket to tell her, and then get the hell out of there fast -- throwing a bullet from a train, which is both fast and lethal (to her hopes and dreams).This is, in my opinion, a rather morose perspective on a relationship; an extremely jaded view on a relatoinship with an immature girl who's trying to be a grown-up but doesn't have the emotional maturity to handle it. And Beck is comforting himself, perhaps, by teaching her an important, painful life lesson that her marriage was never of any value in the first place.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R317FUOCESQUOH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000XO2RKY#wasThisHelpful","R317FUOCESQUOH","A3PPXVR5J6U2JD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3PPXVR5J6U2JD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm always curious about the murky world of young adult fantasy. Ever since Harry Potter burst onto the scene, publishers have been coy about their target audience -- is it for moms?  For pre-teens?  Teenagers?  Rather than limit their choices (and sales), some publishers opt to just say it's for a ""younger audience"" and hope for the best.  A Dragon's Guide to the Care and Feeding of Humans fits into this category -- it seems like it's for kids, but the reading level is quite high and the content is mature enough that it may give some parents pause.The book's central conceit is that dragons who live among us keep humans as pets, although the humans likely think it's the other way around. When Miss Drake's ""pet"" Fluffy dies, the dragon ends up in the care of Fluffy's granddaughter Winnie.  Winnie is a spunky ten-year-old who is fearless and inquisitive. She's the perfect foil for the prim and proper Miss Drake, who would much prefer staying home and sipping tea. Although Miss Drake at first can't stand Winnie (and at a few points, nearly threatens to violently eject her), she eventually becomes more sympathetic as the girl's tale unspools: the death of Winnie's father has left her rudderless and sad.If you suspect that this isn't exactly fun reading material for kids you'd be right. The book starts out with two deaths, but to Laurence Yep's credit, he deals with them in a sensitive way. In fact, the entire book is about this grieving process.  Heavy stuff for ""young readers.""The central conceit that differentiates this book from other ""magicals living in the real world"" disappears early on. A few chapters in, the book abandons the premise of the ""pet"" relationship entirely.  Miss Drake is sensitive to the fact that Winnie might be considered her pet and eventually switches to something of a mother/daughter relationship.The entire book is narrated by Miss Drake, an erudite and learned creature who speaks at a reading level well above most young readers and used a few words that gave me pause. Although it didn't identify the target age group on the book's cover, some web sites list it as 8 to 12. Eight-year-olds are going to have difficulty.But the book's biggest problem is the magical book that Winnie and Miss Drake unveil.  SPOILERS follow.After witnessing a bazaar filled with fantastical creatures, Winnie draws them in a (unbeknownst to her) magical book that causes them to come to life. The remainder of the book is Winnie and Miss Drake working together to recapture them all in Pokemon-like fashion.  But things really take a turn for the dark when we discover that Winnie drew a doppelganger of Miss Drake.There's the usual machinations in which the doppelganger tries to convince Winnie that she's the real deal.  And it turns out the faux Miss Drake will do anything to avoid being returned to the book, including lying about who she really is, pleading for her life, and when that fails, attacking Winnie. Intelligence and wit saves the day when Winnie figures it out.That should be the end of it.  But at the conclusion all the creatures are released from the book by permanently erasing them with a spell. The intelligent, terrified copy of Miss Drake's still in there, and we are faced with a sticky situation.  How was Yep going to handle this, I wondered?  And how would I explain it to my kids, whom I read a chapter to every night?I needn't have worried, because the book skips it entirely. The intelligent doppelganger, who pleaded her case so desperately that Miss Drake was willing to banish her before she attacked Winnie, is simply ignored -- because otherwise we'd have to read what essentially amounts to an execution.Even if it flies over the head of most of its younger audience, it's a fun book to read with an adult.  Miss Drake's narrative is witty and Winnie is a lovable character that doesn't resort to female archetypes. But the book's entire narrative revolves around death and when it comes to actually addressing the subject head on it just ignores it entirely.  In the end, our protagonists have gotten over our respective grief...but I was left with a lingering unease about the one death never mentioned.","3.0 out of 5 stars","February 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R132K6UVKYOL9E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385392281#wasThisHelpful","R132K6UVKYOL9E","A3PPXVR5J6U2JD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3PPXVR5J6U2JD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've heard of Looney Labs' Fluxx card game for years but never had the opportunity to play it until Amazon Vine. We keep trying (and failing) to institute family game night, so this seemed like a great opportunity to test it out.  What I discovered is that Fluxx has a simple set of rules combined the open-ended elements of Magic: The Gathering.  That's how it starts, anyway.Fluxx is a game that reinvents itself every time you play. In Fluxx 5.0 there are four types of cards: New Rules, Actions, Keepers, and Goals.The game begins with just one set of rules: each player draws one card and plays one card.  But that one rule can be massively modified by other New Rule cards, which can tweak how many cards you can draw, how many you can play, how many you can discard, and which players can draw, play, or discard cards.These Rules are how each player attempts to reach a Goal card, of which there is usually only one (""usually"" and ""sometimes"" are required descriptors for any rule of Fluxx, which has no absolutes).  All players strive to reach that Goal, but part of the fun is replacing the Goal with one more favorable to your hand. They can be replaced at any time by another player's Goal cardGoals require a set of Keepers, which are noun-cards with simple illustrations representing something.  Goals usually require a combination of Keepers. Hot Chocolate, for example, might require a chocolate Keeper and a sun Keeper. Sometimes it's just the number of cards in hand, which can vary depending on the Goal.  Keepers are one of the few cards that ""stick"" with a player, but are visible to other players.Finally there are Actions. Actions are cards that affect all the other types. Goals can be eliminated, Keepers can be stolen, and Rules can be tweaked.What makes Fluxx so much fun is that the game is defined by the people playing it. It also becomes rapidly chaotic, particularly with more than a few Rules in play -- I frequently forgot a Rule and was only too happy to use an Action card to remove some of them from play.  Rule creep is probably the biggest challenge for players not accustomed to the ever-shifting landscape of Fluxx.Magic: The Gathering players, who are accustomed to new rules on every card, will find a curious thrill in how the game works. On the one hand, there are a finite number of Rules, Goals, Keepers, and Actions.  On the other, it's the combination of them in play that makes the game so much fun.Players who aren't inclined to go after specific Goals may find the game drags on.  If you don't have a clear strategy, the game can be erratic at best as other players can bloat the game with so many Rules that it becomes difficult to follow.My kids enjoyed it, although my four-year-old found it a bit difficult to follow all the rules (she liked the simple Keeper pictures though). For adult play, it's recommend you play either very sober or very drunk.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RYC8EHUWS41RM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OETKWCE#wasThisHelpful","RYC8EHUWS41RM","A3PPXVR5J6U2JD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3PPXVR5J6U2JD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"At first blush you might think Evan Skolnick's Video Game Storytelling isn't relevant to role-playing games.  I've written at length about the challenges video games face in crafting a good story, something which the nascent industry still struggles with. As a result, video games often repeat the mistakes learned by tabletop board and role-playing games.This is the book I was hoping Tom Bissell's Extra Lives: Why Video Games Matter would be -- an explanation of the flaws in video games and a clear path as to how to fix it.  Skolnick isn't a journalist or ""artiste"" visiting the video game world and espousing his opinions about what's wrong with it; he's a narrative designer in the trenches battling for respect and trying to keep games from completely bombing.  In some ways it's sad this book had to be written at all.The book is divided into two parts, Basic Training and In the Trenches.  After outlining in Basic Training the basics of a three-act structure (Setup, Confrontation, Resolution), Skolnick demonstrates how this narrative concept can be applied to a game's structure. Of particular relevance is his discussion of the Monomyth.The Monomyth was first outlined by Joseph Campbell in The Hero with a Thousand Faces. The archetypes are well known to gamers everywhere: Hero, Herald (who announces the conflict), Mentor, Shapeshifter (a character who changes allegiance at a critical moment), and of course the Villain. There's also the Story Structure, which is familiar to fans of ""Star Wars"" and ""The Matrix"":1. The Ordinary World: An introduction to what passes as ""normal"" in the protagonist's life.2.3. The Call to Adventure: The hero faces the possibility of a quest...4.5. Refusal of the Call: But refuses to do it.6.7. Meeting with the Mentor: He meets a mentor, a character who convinces him to resume the quest.8.9. Crossing the First Threshold: The journey begins and the hero leaves the normalcy of home.10.11. Tests, Allies, Enemies: This is the meat of the adventure -- challenges, fights, puzzles, etc.12.13. Approach to the Inmost Cave: The hero ventures into enemy territory.14.15. The Supreme Ordeal: Things get bad; the hero is sorely tested.16.17. Reward: The hero retrieves the item he needs to be successful, but he's not done yet...18.19. The Road Back: He must return with it, enemies hot on his heels.20.21. Resurrection: This is the moment in every story where things look their worst.22.23. Return with the Elixir: The finale, with everyone getting their just rewards, hero and villain alike.24.Skolnick goes well beyond the Hero's Journey into villain and hero motivations and narrative techniques, like how to not info-dump massive exposition on characters.  There are also critical chapters on dialogue and believability. It's this kind of clear-headed approach to telling a good story that is often lacking in tabletop adventures.The second half of the book covers what most tabletop gamers have long suspected: game designers get no respect.  Or worse, sometimes there's nobody in charge of storytelling at all!I've often spoken about how, bored with a game, my character shifts from following the Monomyth to just murdering everything -- a stark example of ludonarrative dissonance.  Skolnick's frustration with the industry seeps throughout this part of the book as he reinforces the importance of achieving ""ludonarrative harmony,"" the player aligned with the game character's intent.This is an important work, bridging the storytelling we know so well from movies and books with the gaming tropes we've come to mock. It's an excellent reference for any game designer in any medium.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3CPTXUWEJ3XEG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385345828#wasThisHelpful","R3CPTXUWEJ3XEG","A3PPXVR5J6U2JD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3PPXVR5J6U2JD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This cheese grater gets 2 stars because unlike older, flat cheese graters, there is no chance of grating your fingers along with the cheese. However, it is imperfect, and at least the flat graters will store easily in a drawer. \I found it unwieldy in my hand -- the handle was too large for me to easily hold. Only a small amount of cheese can be grated at one time, because it must fit under the lever of the handle and next to the grater.I don't even think it would be helpful for people who have limited movement in their hands, because you must hold the handle tightly in order to get the pressure necessary to grate the cheese. The drum turns, the cheese is grated, but it does not come out of the center. It sticks in there, and I had to use a knife to scoop it out.I did not try this grater with vegetables because I've no intention of keeping it. It might work with items that are softer than vegetables but not as sticky as cheese, and if you grate a lot of a food that fits that description, it might be helpful. I, however, am going to keep looking for something that works more elegantly and doesn't leave me with a sore hand.","2.0 out of 5 stars","January 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2MHFP4R50QP3V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MGLOW8C#wasThisHelpful","R2MHFP4R50QP3V","A3PPXVR5J6U2JD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3PPXVR5J6U2JD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We've finally come to the end we've all been waiting for, the one section of The Hobbit novel that really did merit a movie, ""The Battle of Five Armies."" It's all come down to this: Smaug (Benedict Cumberbatch) seeks revenge for the theft of his treasure by attacking the townsfolk of Laketown. Thorin Oakenshield (Richard Armitage), incumbent king of the dwarves,  succumbs to dragon sickness. And Bilbo Baggins (Martin Freeman) uses the Arkenstone, the crowning jewel of the dwarves, as a bargaining chip between the elves, dwarves, and men.  A dark army is coming to take the dwarven stronghold, and if the free peoples are to survive they will need to put aside their petty grievances and work together. If there was ever a time and place for a spectacle on the big screen, ""The Battle of Five Armies"" is it.Smaug, who was the best part of the second film (SPOILER ALERT) meets his end in this one.  It feels a bit anticlimactic.  Smaug could have just as easily succumbed at the end of the second film, leaving it a more satisfying chapter.  But the showdown between Bard (Luke Evans) and Smaug is thrilling nonetheless as Peter Jackson contrasts family values against that of the rapacious greed.In stark relief is the real and petty grievances that move the various factions to war. Be it Tauriel's (Evangeline Lilly, an elf in real life) love for Kili (Aidan Turner), Legolas Greenleaf's (Orlando Bloom) rebellion against his king Thranduil (Lee Pace), or Gandalf's (Ian McKellen) attempts to convince mortals of the true threat of Sauron, the familiar characters in this prequel to the ""Lord of the Rings"" films all make an appearance.  We witness the terrifying might of Galadriel glimpsed in the later film, Elrond wield a sword, and even Saruman kicks some Nazgul butt. It's a joy to watch these powerful beings who stood around giving advice in the later movies really cut loose in this one.There are also visual flourishes that tie all the films together.  The more humanoid trolls from the first film stand beside the larger trolls of the ""Lord of the Rings."" Goblins and orcs work together. Legolas, Tauriel, and even Radagast (Sylvester McCoy) show up to do battle.  We even get an explanation for what a were-worm is. Purists may be disappointed by how much Jackson veers from the original story, but the choices made to bolster the narrative are easy to forgive.There are two scenes where the film drags, both of them involving a character's mental state.  There's also the awful Alfrid (Ryan Gage), who is a lot like Grima Wormtongue but with no character development and played for laughs.  He's not funny, but it's clear Jackson felt that the tone of the film was so grim it had to be lightened by a cowardly buffoon.The one character who has little to do in this third chapter is the titular Hobbit himself, Bilbo.  J.R.R. Tolkien's narrative didn't thrust hobbits into war until The Lord of the Rings, so Bilbo sits most of the battle out.  His actions have far-reaching effects on the war itself, but mostly Bilbo's there to show how incorruptible hobbits really are. Unlike his dwarven compatriots, Bilbo finds no lure in dragon gold.""The Battle of Five Armies"" isn't perfect, but it's a fitting finale to a six-part franchise.  The real test will be in years to come when future Middle Earth fans view the films collectively.  Will we watch them in chronological order? I look forward to finding out.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2FCFOX0BDUNK9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00R3DODWI#wasThisHelpful","R2FCFOX0BDUNK9","A3PPXVR5J6U2JD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3PPXVR5J6U2JD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This incarnation of the Dungeon Master's Guide (DMG) builds on everything gamers have collectively learned about role-playing games. It's also has an unmistakable shift in tone from a simple rules compendium to an honest assessment of what made D&D what it is today -- and how unique it can be in each DM's hands.The book is divided into three parts: Master of Worlds, Master of Adventures, and Master of Rules. The DMG starts out on the right foot by discussing players rather than rules first, grouping them into acting, exploring, instigating, fighting, optimizing, problem solving, and storytelling. This demarcation is an interesting departure from Ron Edward's Gamist, Narrativist, Simulatonist (GNS) Theory of game design, but the different player types feel right -- and you probably thought of a few just reading the list. Pages 34 return to play styles: hack and slash, immersive storytelling, and something in between. I'm not sure that the two styles are diametrically opposed to each other, but at least the DMG addresses them. There's also tiers of play, ranging from 1-4 (local heroes), 5-10 (heroes of the realm), 11-16 (masters of the realm), and 17-20 (masters of the world). Yes, there are epic rules.Throughout the book is a welcome change in tone, beginning with the title on page 9, ""It's Your World."" There are assumptions and recommendations throughout the book, but there's a definite hands-off approach to every rule that begins with ""this is what we wrote, now you tweak it.""Overall, this is an impressive achievement. While the layout isn't always perfect and those accustomed to Third and Fourth edition might be lost at times, the Fifth Edition does its level best to cover the way DMs today actually play -- not by dictating rules, but by building frameworks for all of us to create our own. The philosophy is best summed up by the comedic blurb in the front of the book:""Disclaimer: Wizards of the Coast does not officially endorse the following tactic, which are guaranteed to maximize your enjoyment as a Dungeon Master. First, always keep a straight face and say OK no matter how ludicrous or doomed the players' plan of action is. Second, no matter what happens, pretend that you intended all along for everything to unfold the way it did. Third, if you're not sure what to do next, feign illness, end the session early, and plot your next move. When all else fails, roll a bunch of dice behind your screen, study them for a moment with a look of deep concern mixed with regret, let loose a heavy sigh, and announce that Tiamat swoops from the sky and attacks.""","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3U06MZZNYG5U5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0786965622#wasThisHelpful","R3U06MZZNYG5U5","A3PPXVR5J6U2JD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3PPXVR5J6U2JD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Headphones are always an interesting choice.  There's some basics you need to cover to make it work, and then everything else is fluff. So let's get the fluff out of the way: the headset is comfortable, fit on my head just fine, and yes the headphones glow. I really don't get the appeal of this -- maybe in competitive gaming it helps distinguish you from your competitors because you can change the colors, which is admittedly cool -- but in a dark room playing a video game, particularly some of the horror video games, this is two flashlights on either side of your head.

I put the set through its paces (with all software settings on ""balance"" mode) using the following: http://www.audiocheck.net/soundtests_headphones.php.Frequency Response: I tested the bass extension and heard it starting at 20 Hz. The treble extension came in at 17 kHz.Dynamic Range: The dynamic range went as low as 60 dBFS (decibels below scale).Quality: This is the first time I encountered anything off with these headphones.  There was some parasitic buzz in my right ear during this test.Driver Matching:  The audio wasn't quite perfect between both sides, and seemed to favor the left ear (I flipped the headphones and confirmed this).Wiring: Passed just fine, but then it better for a new set of headphones of this quality.Binaural: This is the test where the headphones passed with flying colors.  It's the sound of someone knocking.  I took the headphones off and started to answer the door when I realized that this was a test!Because of the concerns with the audio quality and driver matching, it loses a star.

"""Snowpiercer"" is one of those sci-fi films that has a seemingly simple premise rife with symbolism. It doesn't really hold up under prolonged examination, but then ""Snowpiercer"" is more parable than movie.To wit, global warming has frozen the earth, accelerated by the very attempts to halt it. The last of humanity is huddled on a massive, perpetual-motion train known as the Snowpiercer. But even in this closed ecosystem the old class struggles erupt, from the have-nots in the back to the hedonists in the front. Finally fed up with the inhumane treatment and kidnapping of their youngest children, a ragtag band of rebels decide they're going to fight their way to the front of the train and take it over. They include the reluctant leader Curtis Everett (Chris Evans), his gee-whiz second Edgar (Jamie Bell), determined mother Tanya (Octavia Spencer), security specialist and drug addict Namgoong Minsu (Song Kang-ho), and his daughter Yona (Go Ah-sung).The battle takes place car-by-car, one bloody guard at a time. Because director Bong Joon-ho is primarily interested in cinematography, logic holes open up a few cars in. Characters stand around in enemy territory (basically, any car beyond the back few) in slack-jawed awe, villains survive who should be dead, and twists are telegraphed with all the subtlety of a freight train. This is one of those films that's big on concept and short on logic.The biggest problem is that after being betrayed by ""civilians"" who appeared innocent in the very first upper-class car they encounter, our heroes never learn from that lesson -- they act as if what's behind them is never a threat, only what's ahead of them, despite the fact that they leave an entire train's worth of potential enemies behind them. Of course, to do that would rob the film of its forward narrative -- it would turn into a siege rather than a desperate battle of forward attrition -- so director Joon-ho just plunges ahead and hopes you forgive him.The logic fallacies are easy to forgive. What's on film is frequently gorgeous, brutal, and inventive. The snaking nature of a train surrounded by a hostile environment opens up a lot of possibilities for protracted combat. The conclusion is rife with symbolism of clenched fists -- the fist of the worker, the fist of the slave, the fist of the oppressor. It just takes a long, winding path to get there, punctuated by weird choices by characters who frequently appear insane. To be fair, there's a toss-off line that the only people who are still alive on the train ARE insane, but that's a bit of a dodge that robs the entire struggle of its urgency.In the end, ""Snowpiercer"" doesn't have a lot of nice things to say about humanity. This is one of those movies film critics love to applaud for its edginess. It's a highly ambitious concept film that only partially succeeds. But what it does achieve is still worth watching.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R28XISC8EJZLS2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00M7D824O#wasThisHelpful","R28XISC8EJZLS2","A3PPXVR5J6U2JD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3PPXVR5J6U2JD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""The Exam"" is a minimalist single-room film that could easily be a one-act play. When one of the characters name-checks Jean-Paul Sartre's No Exit, we know where this is going.  For those not familiar with Sartre's play, three characters show up in the afterlife expecting to be tortured in hell, only to discover that they are stuck in a room with each other. Hell, they eventually conclude, is other people. Director Stuart Hazeldine flips the script: Hell may be other people, but it's the path to Heaven.Instead of three characters we have eight. They are there to take a test in what can only be described as the world's worst job interview. It starts with some terse instructions from the Invigilator (Colin Salmon) about the rules: 80 minutes, one question, and they are not to talk to the Invigilator (watching on security cameras), the armed guard, spoil their paper, or leave the room. To break any of the rules is to be immediately disqualified and tossed out into the real world, which from the dialogue of the interviewees appears to be an awful place suffering from a pandemic.The film breaks the characters down, ""Reservoir Dogs""-style, into archetypes by color. There's the unctuous soldier/gambler Brown (Jimi Mistry), the icy Blonde (Nathalie Cox), the noble Black (Chukwudi Iwuji), the scheming Brunette (Polyanna McIntosh), the analytical Dark (Adar Beck), the hyper-aggressive alpha male White (Luke Mably), and the unresponsive Deaf (John Lloyd Fillingham). There's a ninth character, the guard (Chris Carey) who is perhaps more important than all of them.  He takes the role of the bellhop in No Exit, a mannequin that seemingly has no purpose but is as much a part of the room as the furniture.Nothing in ""The Exam"" is an accident. Every item on screen is relevant.  Like No Exit, there's a paper knife equivalent that is presumably there for some other purpose but, because of humanity's basest instincts, is ultimately used for violence. ""The Exam"" spins conspiracy theories with glee and allows its interviewees to dive down the rabbit hole.  There's nothing on the sheet, so how do you beat the exam? Does winning constitute beating the abstract concept of the exam itself, or just defeating all the competitors? Do you even have to? Is there even an exam?""The Exam"" is as much nightmare as it is scathing critique of the business world as its cutthroat worst. Or at least, that's how it seems until the very end, when it becomes clear that this is all for a more noble purpose. It is a ""harrowing of hell"" that has a more complete (if less existentialist) ending than Sartre's work. And that's okay.  As a sci-fi film in just one room, it manages to spin more drama out of 80 minutes and eight people than most big-budget movies.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 3, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R13YKJB36K0IJS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0040QYRSQ#wasThisHelpful","R13YKJB36K0IJS","A3PPXVR5J6U2JD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3PPXVR5J6U2JD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We've had a three-in-one printer for some time now that has slowly but surely gotten worse. It's gotten cranky, squeaky, and loud. When this printer showed up on Vine we leaped at the chance to replace it. Our expectations were pretty low -- the Pixma feels cheap.  I didn't even know my wife was installing it until she told me, but to my surprise my laptop had found and installed it without even notifying me. Score one for the new guy.Unfortunately, the Pixma comes with starter printer cartridges, which is a bit like a demo version of the printer. The costs of a printer really are the print cartridges and it shows in this approach. It also at first seemed like there was no means of holding the paper -- out of the box, the paper feed juts out of the front of it, and the paper output flops over -- but it turns out there's a little handle you swivel out that props up the paper.  It feels flimsy and is a curious design decision (seriously, they couldn't just extend the front of the printer to support 8"" by 11"" paper?).The interface is simple and straightforward. This is a good thing if all you want to do is print or scan, but not so much if you want to mess with the printer at its console -- you're much better off doing it from a computer or a mobile device.  This printer does not have an auto-feeder or a memory card slot or a rear paper tray.The Pixma does a few other neat things that are worth noting.  For one, it has a quiet mode. My old Canon got so squeaky that...well, I replaced it with the Pixma, so you can imagine how annoying that is.  The Pixma can be quieter, which is great since it's right next to my wife's desk. It also has an eco-mode which is adjustable. This is a great feature if you're eco-conscious like we are. Finally, the Pixma is basically its own mini-computer since it sits on the wireless server, and it cleverly downloaded and updated its own firmware.Pixma's primary advantage is its mobile access. There are a host of disclaimers, listed on this Amazon page. Read them carefully before you buy, because you may not be able to live with all the choices.  One big one is that while Pixma does print from mobile devices, it requires an app to do so -- there's no magic print button on every app. The app instantly found the printer and set itself up which was great. Not so great: printing documents requires some acrobatics, so at least on iOS pictures are really the only ""one click"" printing solutions for a printer like this. When I went to click ""document print"" it found nothing, and there's no help file to identify what counts as a ""document"" on my very busy iPhone.This is a good first printer and a great gift for someone who only needs to print the occasional document. The mobile accessibility is great but the tradeoff is that the printer is very narrowly focused. If you're a writer and tabletop gamer like me who tends to punish printers by printing large volumes of paper, you might want to look for a higher end printer.  But if you just want to do the occasional print without a lot of fuss, Pixma is a great budget-priced printer.  It's not a workhorse printer, but for most printing needs it should do nicely.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R11ZYF3S29BBO6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MOSGSC0#wasThisHelpful","R11ZYF3S29BBO6","A3PPXVR5J6U2JD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3PPXVR5J6U2JD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My family is well-acquainted with the Man of Action team of writers from their work on the Generator Rex, Ultimate Spider-Man, and Marvel's Avengers Assemble cartoons, so we were excited to see their movie debut with ""Big Hero 6."" My seven-year-old boy was not disappointed.That said, the film isn't quite about what you might think from the trailers. It's not so much ""a boy and his robot"" as it is ""a boy helps form a super-science hero team, one of which happens to be a robot."" ""Big Hero 6"" doesn't refer to a person, it refers to the team of six heroes, all of them powered by cutting-edge sci-fi technology.  One of the powerful and welcome messages that comes through in this film is that the pursuit of science is important, but it is only as good or bad as the person wielding it.Hiro Hamada (Ryan Potter) is a 13-year-old robotics genius who lives with his Aunt Cass (Maya Rudolph) and older brother Tadashi (Daniel Henney).  Hiro is fond of engaging in illegal robot fighting to earn some money, which Tadashi recognizes is the wrong path for a prodigy like his little brother. He encourages Hiro to apply to the robotics lab at Tadashi's university, where the entrance exam is determined by a science competition.  Hiro enters his nanobots.Nanobots are game-changers and the power Hiro demonstrates is both breathtaking and terrifying. It's not long before a fire breaks out at the competition, a tragedy that results in the loss of the nanobots.  Hiro mopes about, listless, until he accidentally stumbles upon Tadashi's crowning achievement: Baymax, an inflatable medical robot dedicated to helping people. You can see where this is going, right?Hiro slowly unravels the mystery behind the fire -- BIG SPOILER 6! It was no accident -- and creates a team of superheroes by retrofitting Baymax and drawing on the collective genius of Tadashi's colleagues.  There's Fed (T.J. Miller) the stoner who likes kaiju movies with a fire-breathing suit to match; Gogo Tomago (Jamie Chung) who uses electromagnetic wheels as skates and weapons; Wasabi (Damon Wayans) who wields laser cutters on his forearms; and Honey Lemon (Genesis Rodriguez) who has a purse-full of sticky goo bombs.The heart of the movie revolves around Baymax. He is a soft, huggable helper spawned from the ideals of Tadashi -- but his armor and weapons are all Hiro's youthful rage. Baymax waffles between these two ideologies throughout the film, but it's ultimately Hiro's choice to be a hero.The superhero tropes don't always make sense (Wasabi's laser hands seem like the worst power) but it's easy to overlook in light of the beautifully rendered, diverse futurescape that is San Fransokyo. It also features a kid who overcomes his challenges with science. My son gave it five stars.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RIIEP9DWQ6ZAA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PC1X70W#wasThisHelpful","RIIEP9DWQ6ZAA","A3PPXVR5J6U2JD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3PPXVR5J6U2JD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As a parent with two children in the house who are very fond of crafts, scissors are rare commodities.  For one, we don't just leave them out so that they can use them -- we have special kid scissors they use for that purpose. For another, the kids frequently require help from an adult, which means I take out the adult-scissors...and then promptly misplace them (or munchkins grab them when I'm not looking).  This has added up to scissors becoming a kind of endangered species in our house. Enter Westcott Titanium-Bonded Scissors.Titanium-bonded sounds like a superpower, and maybe it is amongst scissors. They cut well enough, but they stick a bit.  They're a little bit difficult to open and close. We do a lot of cutting of cardboard (we're still working on creating cardboard armor) and that's broken more than one pair of scissors.  I'm confident that these super-powered scissors can handle the job.

"This sculpt, like the spider swarm, suffers from the same problem: it's too small to stand in as a swarm.  Swarms are ten-foot square in Dungeons & Dragons 3.5, so you'd need four to create a suitable swarm and you unfortunately only get two. The rats are suitably detailed, if a little chaotic -- it can become difficult when painting the swarm as to where one rat's tail ends and another begins.Not a great sculpt and too small to be very useful.","2.0 out of 5 stars","May 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1BVX503G33VGD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00I2F294K#wasThisHelpful","R1BVX503G33VGD","A3PPXVR5J6U2JD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3PPXVR5J6U2JD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The first problem with any swarms in Dungeons & Dragons 3.5 is that they are all ten-feet square. This means that all miniatures that are swarms are not as large as they should be, because 1) the sculptor probably got tired, and 2) it's a solid mass of costly plastic/metal to create the miniature. In short, most miniatures fall far short of being suitable for use in D&D.This spider swarm doesn't deviate from that formula.  As a swarm, it's only 1-inch. But it's filled with cute spiders of all sorts, including one little spider piggybacking on a larger one.  For a spider swarm, it's rather adorable.Not particularly scary, not the right size, but a fun sculpt nonetheless.","2.0 out of 5 stars","May 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R14A78BO142U6O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00I7LDZC4#wasThisHelpful","R14A78BO142U6O","A3PPXVR5J6U2JD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3PPXVR5J6U2JD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The spiders that were included as part of the Reaper Bones Kickstarter were originally part of the Dungeon Vermin set, but they don't look quite the same.  For one, the spiders are not on any sort of base.  This is curious, as these miniatures are one of the few that aren't based in some way -- I glued them to medium-sized 1-inch bases.  For another, the spiders are rearing up with their two forelegs in an aggressive stance, which differs from the placid-looking spiders that are part of the Dungeon Vermin set.

Just about any modern game that's not in an urban area could use a miniature like this.Joke's on us though -- although you might think Tisdale is based off of more recent sheriff archetypes, the sheriff looks a lot like this guy, AKA Boss Hogg.

"If you know the ""Resident Evil"" film franchise then you've already met Bonnie.  Her name is Alice.

After all, what's a zombie apocalypse without a hot cloned babe to start dual-gunning her way through hordes of the undead?Bonnie's loaded for bear, with two blades strapped to her back, shoulder holsters for two pistols, and a submachinegun in each hand.  Her wrists are wrapped in some kind of cloth, and her jeans are cuffed tightly above her knees. She's moving fast too, with one foot off the ground.  And that's where Reaper Bones gets messy.Reaper's Bonesium is awesome for storing miniatures, painting miniatures, and if you're anything like me, frequently dropping miniatures.  What it's not great is providing a strong structural framework for miniatures.  Bonnie's one flimsy leg is not enough to keep her upright, and even if you do manage to straighten her out using the boiling water/freezing cold technique, she's just going to get warped again from rough handling.Bonnie's a decent choice for a zombie game, but not so great in Bonesium.","2.0 out of 5 stars","May 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3NINX5QNF4XT7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FJCWV56#wasThisHelpful","R3NINX5QNF4XT7","A3PPXVR5J6U2JD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3PPXVR5J6U2JD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Do you have a zombie escape plan? If not, you should.  But there's a saying in the apolcayptic survival biz that we use when people run for the obvious weapon established by Ashley J. Williams of ""Evil Dead"": Don't be a Berkeley.  Why?  We'll let TVTropes explain:While cool, there are good reasons the chainsaw is not exactly the first choice among melee weapons in the real world; chainsaws are heavy and hard to swing with any degree of finesse, have poor reach compared to their weight, require fuel or an external power source, make a lot of noise, and will tear through the person wielding them just as cheerfully as the intended victim... Chainsaws are also prone to a phenomenon called ""kickback"" where one tooth of the blade contacts something without cutting it and the resulting shock throws the blade backwards violently, often right at the unfortunate operator's head; obviously, this is all the more likely to happen when they're being used as a weapon. The chain also runs the danger of snapping and whipping the user in the process. Fictional chainsaws also have the ability to start instantly, with one pull of the starter handle, unlike in Real Life where they require several pulls and most models will need to warm up for at least 30 seconds or they'll immediately die when you try to cut something. Most Real Life chainsaws also dull in seconds if they touch anything harder than wood. Finally, running out of fuel or suffering a broken chain or clutch will leave the erstwhile chainsaw maniac holding a big, unwieldy and rather useless club.Worse, it appears Berkeley has not one but TWO perfectly serviceable blades on her person that remain sheathed.  And oh yeah, there's a zombie hand trailing her torn-up pants, which means she ran through zombies to get this chainsaw that is of likely little use. She did think to wear a glove at least, so kudos on her for safety.Julie Guthrie's sculpt unfortunately suffers in the conversion from metal to Bonesium.  The zombie hand is little more than a blob near her foot (I didn't realize what it was until I saw the picture on the Reaper site) and her round face loses all detail to become a vague mask.  Not recommended in Bones format.Fighting zombies?  Don't be a Berkeley.

"We got this set about 5 years ago for our wedding. And while neither my wife or I are really hardcore about cooking at least one piece from this set gets used each day.  Really this is all I can imagine the average person needing in the kitchen, though we did add a matching dutch oven and griddle which aren't used as often. The anodized finish is really nice looking and the handles are comfortable and give a good grip. They just feel solid and good in the hand. The nonstick coating has been great. Vegetables, eggs, stir fry, grilled cheese, tofu, bacon, pancakes and everything we make slides off with little effort. None of the coating has chipped off though we are pretty careful and use nylon tools. Clean up is pretty easy-- it takes about 20 seconds using hot water and a washcloth. I was told not to use soap on them, but I can't imagine it would hurt much. I've read other people put them in the dishwasher but I never have a reason as its much faster to do it by hand.  Also I don't really pay any attention to the red dot. Its supposed to indicate when the pot is heated, and maybe it works great, but I can't recall ever using that feature.

The knives pull out of the block real well and it hasn't gotten all scuffed up.  These are the only knives we own and we use them for everything-- meat, vegetables, opening boxes from amazon, etc. Most of the time we just grab the steak knives, the larger knives are rarely used. They cut everything we need just fine and seem just as sharp as when we first got them.  Considering how much we use them I can't imagine they will ever need sharpening. And we just put them in the dishwasher with the rest of our (stainless) silverwear. Yeah, they do get some small rust spots from time to time. But so does every other metal thing we wash, so when they appear I just wipe it off with a steel wool pad-- takes about 5 seconds to make it look like new.  The only bad thing is the scissors broke in the first year. But it was a cheap plastic one and I bought a much nicer stainless scissors that matches the set for less than $10.

"These were a good update to a 6 head track light strip in my family room.  Previously I'd been running 50 watt halogens which put out the perfect amount of light, but were scorching hot and used 300 watts.  I'd been waiting years to find a decent upgrade and tried a half dozen different CFL/LED bulbs. These were the first ones that I liked.No they don't look exactly like the halogens-- they are not quite as bright or warm. I'd say about 90% brightness, though I may add two more heads to make that up.  The light quality is good but the LEDs are a tiny bit harsher to look at directly and have that faint ""flicker"". I dont know how to explain it, but I wear contacts and can often spot unfiltered LEDs. They seem to have a slight flicker right near the bulb and a more distinct halo.  But my wife and family don't see it, so maybe its just me.  They work with my 20 year old dimmer switch but don't get as dim. Maybe 50% of the full light. The 45 degree beam is narrower than my old bulbs but with a little adjustment they light the room well, just in more distinct zones. (I tried other LED bulbs with 120 degree beams and the light didn't have any range, so I think narrow is better.)  Finally, they do get warm/hot but not skin melting hot and don't heat the whole room by several degrees like before. The white caps don't stick out too far and match my glass shades better than some of the ugly chrome ones available.There were a few compromises, but I can live with them.

"Thankfully I only ordered one of these bulbs to test first, before buying the 20+ others that I need. I cannot get it to work in any kind of recessed or downward facing fixture (I tried many). It sometimes flickers briefly but thats it. It feels loose in the socket though I can't see any obvious flaws or deformity. But even on regular table lamp it will flicker every few minutes and sometimes doesn't turn on with the lamp until I loosen it. Obviously that isn't going to work and I will be returning it.  It could just be a bad bulb but I'm not going to take my chances. The color was OK, but it wasn't quite as bright or warm as I was hoping.  Also be aware the light projects in a rather narrow beam (125 degrees). This is fine for a ceiling fixture but you will not get the same room filling coverage as from an incandescent or CFL.","2.0 out of 5 stars","September 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R14IM466ZKAA5V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008WHBDQI#wasThisHelpful","R14IM466ZKAA5V","AKW1PYZYG538S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AKW1PYZYG538S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I wanted to use this on steel doors at our cottage. So I bought the rollers and brushes that were recommended, pulled the doors off, sanded and prepped and then painted them in the shade on a 70 degree overcast day. The first thing I noticed is the paint was practically as thick as molasses.  Even with the recommended 5% thinning it was thick and sticky and left brush and roller strokes everywhere. And it dries far too quickly, the strokes never get a chance to level themselves out. I was left with a door that looked like it was done in finger paints by 3 year old. So I spent a day stripping them down again and redid them with $6 of generic spray paint to 10 times better results.  Stick to the non door paint for a better result.","1.0 out of 5 stars","August 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1GVPXAFNHG78R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001UE7N4Q#wasThisHelpful","R1GVPXAFNHG78R","AKW1PYZYG538S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AKW1PYZYG538S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"While I like grilled food I've never had the time or energy to get into charcoal or propane. I'd been getting by with a couple indoor panini grills but when I found this on clearance at 25 dollars I had to give it try.  Its actually quite large and solid/heavy. Everything about it feels heavy duty except the grilling surface. It feels a little light weight and you could bend it with your hands, though it has held up fine for me for a year.  I keep the grill stored in the shed and carry it out to use. My Black & Decker WM125 Workmate 125 350-Pound Capacity Portable Work Bench makes a great grill stand-- the wood top gets warm but never damaged. If you put it on a glass or wood table you'll likely want to use something for protection.I plug it in and turn it up to the highest setting. In about 10 minutes it's at 400 degrees. Once the meat goes on the temp drops to around 250 and stays there while grilling. I put 6 burgers on it easily and looked like it would fit 8. There is quite a bit of smoke so I would not recommend using this indoors. The burgers were cooked perfectly in 10 minutes, had nice sear lines and tasted great-- about the same as any ""real"" grilled food I've had. I haven't tried any really thick meat but another review said it wasn't hot enough for steak. Personally I'd expect it to work but it may take a little extra time and effort.Cleanup is pretty easy. The meat tends to stick to the surface so I'll leave it running for about 15 minutes to burn some of it off. The grease has caught fire a few times (but you wouldn't know unless you open it). I wasn't sure if this was safe so I turned it off right away. The grill surface is removable and I spray it off with the hose and use an OXO Good Grips Electric Grill and Panini Press Brush. I sometimes throw it in the dishwasher as well. I never really clean it completely but I don't think its necessary.  The drip pan comes out and I clean it the same way. The only part I'm unsure of is the inside of the main grill itself-- its kind of an angled hopper that directs grease to the drip pan. And since it doesn't have a flame it really never burns off. I haven't cleaned it yet but its quite a mess and it seems like it could smell after a while. I would not recommend storing this inside.Anyway I really can't see why I would need a bigger or better grill for my family of 3. Its just the right size, well constructed and easy to clean up and put away afterwards. We've made chicken, burgers and brats on here and they have all turned out well. I think this would work especially well for anyone who wants a faster easier way to grill or is limited with a small patio or balcony. However its worth looking at completing models as well. I got a really good price on this, but at its full retail there are a number of other electric grill options out there.The Outdoor Great Room CVR20GH Vinyl Cover for Fire Stone's 20-Inch Electric Grills, Black fits great as a cover. Though I see the price has gone up significantly since I bought it. I wouldn't spend more than 10 dollars as there are other covers available.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3QTNDONQNWP3X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0079TOE5C#wasThisHelpful","R3QTNDONQNWP3X","AKW1PYZYG538S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AKW1PYZYG538S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I found the author's blog online and that led me to his book. Despite having lived in Menasha for nearly 40 years I never really knew that much about its formative years. Neighboring Appleton seems to be better documented in that sense. So this was really quite interesting to see how much has changed in 100 or even 50 years. Which is ""a lot"".The book covers 1840s to recent years, with a good amount of information on its founding and the dynamics between the settlers and Native Americans. After that the main focus is on the downtown and Doty Island from about 1880-1930. Which makes sense as that was the heart of the community.It is a black and white picture book so it was a quick read. But every single photograph is accompanied by a lengthy description with dates, addresses and personal stories behind the photo. I finished it in two nights in front of my computer with google maps looking up nearly every location, trying to identify buildings and locations or just fascinated by the changes that can happen in a lifetime. Which is true as my grandmother lived to 98 and the Menasha of her childhood looked nothing like mine.Anyway, this book took a subject that was mildly interesting to me before and turned it into a new hobby for me. Once the weather gets warmer I'm going to go look at these locations firsthand and try to get a better perspective on city I live in. I would love to see a second volume. It could be just more of this, or even some more about the Menasha I remember most from the later 20th century.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1076GM6AVD7YO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0738591785#wasThisHelpful","R1076GM6AVD7YO","AKW1PYZYG538S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AKW1PYZYG538S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Its smaller than the Army mountains I remember-- but to be fair I've grown a lot in the last 35 years. Really its just a hollow plastic shell and its admittedly overpriced. But I think most people realize this and still buy it because its just want they wanted. A good portion of my childhood was spent with plastic soldiers and mountains in the sandbox, and I wanted to relive this with my son. Good for display with little plastic army men, dinosaurs, spacemen, etc. Though its not as useful for actual play. I wish it had more going on in the back-- maybe some shelves to stand figures on or cannon mounts, etc. As it is its just a one sided wonder.

The light quality is nice-- just a hair less warmth than incandescent but seems more aesthetically pleasing.  And they are significantly (though not overpoweringly) brighter. Makes our kitchen look about 25% lighter at night. I haven't gotten the electric bill yet but we are going from 390 watts used to 102. The old light bulbs went out every year at $8 a piece.

"I really this timer but it could be improved on. Its very easy to use and set the time. Just turn the sleeve and squeeze. Out of the box the rotating action was very tight and rough. I used a little white lithium on the separation and now it works much better. (I'd recommend testing whatever lubrication you use on the back first and some will dissolve the plastic.)  We have two of these that we use daily as nap timers and keeping track of baby feeding. The plastic ring is very smooth and I could see how it could be difficult to use with wet or oily hands in the kitchen.

"This seems like a good value replacement for our hammock stand. At first I was surprised because it is listed at 11' feet long yet barely measured 6' when I opened it. I know hammocks stretch out with use, but no matter how i pulled it could only get it 2/3 across our 11' stand. Even our chains were too short so I had to rig up temporary extensions with tie down straps. For the first week it was straight across like a board, but gradually stretched and after a month of daily use it fits without any extensions. The wood looks decent and the rope is fairly soft. But like any cheap rope hammock, if you keep these outside they gradually degrade from sun and rain. Probably good for two summers of regular use.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 5, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1I7E8N6CGSLP8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002Z8L2RK#wasThisHelpful","R1I7E8N6CGSLP8","AKW1PYZYG538S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AKW1PYZYG538S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We started with an eighty-year-old wicker bassinet that was heavy, bulky and we couldn't see the baby.  We wanted something smaller, safer and better looking-- and this was the perfect replacement. The best part is that its very light and portable, even without folding it up. We carry all over the house-- in the living room, kitchen, in the baby crib and in our bed so he can sleep between us at night. It seems comfortable because he falls asleep in it well. I especially like the peace of mind we get from being able to be close to him and see through the mesh sides, and that he can still breath through the fabric.

"We got this because it matched the Honey Bear bedding collection we received as a gift. The mobile is OK, but for the price paid it feels cheap and I'm just not impressed. The listing never states how it is powered, but for thirty some dollars I assumed it would be battery operated with electronic music. Instead it is wind up that only runs for about a minute and half and has a loud twangy music box thats kind of painful to my ears-- not relaxing for putting a child to sleep.  The mobile arm is a couple snapped together pieces of flimsy plastic. There is no way to adjust its height (its too tall for us) and the clamp system does not attach firmly to our crib. It stays in place but has too much wiggle. And while the bears are cute they occasionally fall off when in use unless you rig them. If I'd paid about $15 for this I'd be OK with it. We've bought other really nice baby items in same price range from amazon. As a comparison for only a couple dollars more than this mobile we bought a battery powered swing that has 8 speeds, a timer and several electronic lullabyes that sound much much better.

"I bought 4 of these to use as coin purses in our cars. I'm a guy, so my main criteria was finding something that wasn't leather, or decorative and I could take into a store without embarrassment. These worked OK. I like the look but I hate how the giant name brand tag that was on it. I had to cut each off with a knife and ended up tearing one in the process. Otherwise its small and easy to carry but I find it a bit too small to store change, a couple bills and a credit card. I also wish it opened wider as I have a hard time seeing/getting my fingers in there so I usually dump the change into my hand. The inside is kind messy with large seams just inside the zipper which can get stuck. They are nice looking though if you need a manly coin purse. However I found a cheap camera bag works better.

I've had at least a half dozen digital tire gauges over the years and this is the best one of all. I don't use any of the programmable feature so I can't comment on that. But its a nice solid well-built gauge. The reading are consistent and accurate, the head swivels and the LED light and backlit display are indispensable. Plus its got a hanging hook.

"I bought this to fix a couple broken watches. Its an OK deal for the amount of pieces you get but there is a trade off in quality. The highlights of the kit are the specialized parts: the pin remover, the watch band holder and case opener wrench. Those and the pin punches are really the only reasons worth buying it. Everything else is junk and you're better off with your own small screwdrivers and needle nose pliers.The included screwdrivers, pliers and tweezers were complete junk so I tossed them. The small hammer is a decent idea but has a hard plastic head so its not very essential.In the end I'm not sure how I feel about this. While its cheap quality its also cheap price so I don't feel completely ripped off. I needed it once and probably won't use it again.

"Rear driver side window of my mother's 2000 Buick Lesabre fell down one day and could no longer be rolled up. The dealer estimated at least $400 to fix. So I opened the door panel up and found it was a broken cable on the window regulator (which appears to be a very common problem on Buicks of that time). This piece as an exact fit replacement. While the OEM part alone would have been $150 from the dealer I was able to fix it myself in less than a half hour.If you're looking for instructions on how to do it just search it on google. I found a couple videos on youtube alone, though you could probably do it just fine on common sense alone. A really quick synopsis-- you have to first remove the inner door panel with a putty knife or something, unhook all the switches, have someone hold up the window while you unscrew the glass and old regulator, pull the old one out, toss it, screw this one in, plug the wire in and replace the trim. Quite simple, 30 minutes and over $300 saved. The only tools you'll need are a socket wrench, screwdriver and something to pry off the inner door panel.Another added bonus is the window is now quieter and rolls up down faster than the old one. Looking at the new and old regulator side by side the materials and workman ship are identical, so I would not worry about the quality. You can also buy this piece without the motor but since it was only a few dollars difference I went with the whole thing-- its better than having the motor go out a few months later and replacing it again.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 27, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2GEC2M19O5J5N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000E323BC#wasThisHelpful","R2GEC2M19O5J5N","AKW1PYZYG538S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AKW1PYZYG538S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm happy with this clock but it required some modifications out of the box.I do like that the clock has seconds and the date on it. I have it in the mudroom and its very useful in the morning to be reminded of that (I usually have no idea). Also the seconds are useful to use as visual timer. Some of the colors are pretty dim but I've found that the white setting (blue, green and red combined) is the brightest and easiest to read. Its a very small clock though and if you need glasses its probably not a good choice for the bedside.My main issues are that some of the color combinations aren't very bright and that its difficult to read from different angles. You really need to be straight on with it to be able to see it clearly and the transparent plastic lens over the face just makes it worse. It tends to distort the numbers like a cheap magnifying glass and works much better if you unscrew the clock and take it out. I have my clock at eye level but it was designed work better at viewing from above like on a nightstand. So I also added an adjusting foot (two screws in the bottom back) so I could lift it up.

"Let me start by saying I have a strange obsession with removing all superfluous labels/decals for everything I own. So when I buy something the first thing I do is take of the stickers and tags and get it stripped clean. As such this product was truly made for me!  For years I've gotten by on a combination of solvents (goo gone, WD40, fabric cleaner etc) and razor blade scrapers. But Un Du works better than anything else I've ever tried. I squirt a couple drops directly on the surface, spread it around and let it soak in for minute or two. And then peel it off with a plastic scraper. Its worked great so far on almost everything I've tried. The only issue is a little more thin and runny than some gel cleaner so it works best of flat surfaces.

"I have a strange quirk where I cannot stand superfluous decals/labels/tags being on my things. Shampoo bottles, tools, clothes, you name it-- I've got to strip everything clean. For years I've gotten by with a combination of cleaners (WD40, goo gone, fabric cleaner) fingernails and razor blade scrapers. But These scrapers in combination with Un Du have taken my obsession to a new level! Honestly didn't really need 4 scrapers but it was cheaper than buying the plastic and metal one separately. (And thanks to a second obsession of having everything match I've given the blue and white ones away).They have a lot of flex and don't really feel of the highest quality but they do work great. When used in conjunction with a good cleaner like Un Du they just destroy labels. They won't remove much without a solvent because the sticky adhesive still remains, but they work much better than razor blades and the plastic/metal combination is great for use on different surfaces so you don't get scratches. Eventually the edges will dull and need to be replaced. But after a couple months of use I haven't seen an issue and expect them to last for a while.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 27, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2II2VGBN49TKY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0068QIQVA#wasThisHelpful","R2II2VGBN49TKY","AKW1PYZYG538S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AKW1PYZYG538S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Its difficult to find a good pencil sharpener these days. I've had little luck with wall mount or electric types and strangely the cheapest most simple options seem to work the best. The picture for this sharpener was small and blurry so I wasn't really sure what to expect. Its a small sliver plastic sharpener about the size of a shot glass.  It opens up in the middle (the black stripe on the picture) with a plastic hinge to expose 3 different sized sharpener holes inside. The sharpeners themselves are just cheap plastic ones they have anywhere. But it is nice having a container to collect the shavings. To empty the shavings you just have to pull the silver outer shell off one side-- quite simple.Anyway it does sharpen pencils well and offers variety for different sizes, crayons, etc. I was disappointed that it kind of cheap feeling plastic. From the photo I assumed the sharpener was metal with black plastic grip, but it just smooth plastic with printed dots. That doesn't affect the use, just a perceived quality difference. Also the plastic hinge between the two halves is just a ""bent"" plastic hinge like on a ketchup bottle. It works fine but it feels quite flimsy and I wonder how long it will last before tearing. I would rate it as 'works well but a bit overpriced.'","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 27, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RWEGWL1B4G1V7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001P3LKPK#wasThisHelpful","RWEGWL1B4G1V7","AKW1PYZYG538S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AKW1PYZYG538S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought 4 of these to replace the old scissors around the house. The recycled angle was nice but not the my reason for buying. (I need all my office supplies to match-- so pens, pencils, everything is plain black.) The blades are sharp and it cuts quite nicely, about what you would expect with a Fiskars. I do kind of wish that the handles had rubber padding. While its well shaped, ergonomic and comfortable to hold its not as comfortable for prolonged use as other rubberized scissors I've used. 2 of the scissors worked very nicely out of the box, but the other 2 were very tight and tiring to use. It seems like parts of the blades were touching more than other parts and causing too much friction. I was able to put a little mineral oil on them and that helped. There are better scissors out there. But for my needs and price range these fit the bill well.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 27, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RPWFG8LXPJBN1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002M9EUO4#wasThisHelpful","RPWFG8LXPJBN1","AKW1PYZYG538S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AKW1PYZYG538S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm happy with this. I haven't used it for any heavy duty projects yet but its sturdy and feels like it would be up to the task. Its bit larger than some knives but still comfortable to use in my somewhat smallish hands. The knife body is metal, the bottom lever is plastic and there is rubber padding on the top and bottom (red areas).  The lever blade action is nice but really not a big difference from a traditional top lever knife. The benefit is that its not as easy to trigger while using it. Plus the quick blade change is useful-- press the red button, pull the old blade out, and hit the trigger a couple times and the new blade is securely in place. Sure beats having the unscrew and open the knife each time. The side has a small door that opens up to load new blades in-- very nice.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 27, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R36Q3X0NZNEZZS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004QO9FPC#wasThisHelpful","R36Q3X0NZNEZZS","AKW1PYZYG538S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AKW1PYZYG538S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

That said they were a little more expensive than the typical yellow 12 packs at the store. But they are comfortable, sharpen nicely and the eraser works well.

"Frankly I'm shocked by the positive reviews on these. Remember the erasable pens from the 80s? Well these write worse.At first glance I was pleased-- they felt solid, comfortable, nice grip, contemporary looking. Its when I started writing that sad truth became apparent. The first three pens I tried did not wrete out of the package(s). I had to shake them to get the ink flowing. And once it did the coverage was very spotty-- to the point where I couldn't finish a sentence without having to go back and redraw parts. I thought maybe it was a bad pack but the others were the same.I've been suffering through these for a year now, writing on all different kinds of papers/surfaces and I still get terrible ink flow. Not just disappointing-- about 10% of the words are illegible and I have to scribble on a notepad every 30 seconds to restart the ink.I'm only giving them 2 stars because I at least liked the way the ""feel"".

"I do a lot of Fall raking so I ordered two of these to replace 20 year old wood handled rakes.They arrived unprotected and damaged (nicked poles and warped plastic) but I decided to skip the hassle of returning them. The rakes looked good but were covered in gaudy labels that were impossible to remove. The aluminum pole was noticeably lighter but I prefer wood as raking in Wisconsin is usually done during cold weather and it froze my bare hands. Plus the aluminum had sharp scratches/nicks from shipping that was rough on fingers. And the rake head is flimsy-- it flexes too easily when raking large amounts or wet leaves. Had to rake smaller piles because it feels like it will break at any time. Finally the weak teeth get bent and misaligned and it clogs quite easily.I've been happy with all my Fiskars tools in the past but I regret buying these. Since I spent a lot I'll keep using them but I've had better experiences with the run-of-the-mill plastic rakes available at half the price.

"This was used to fix a unconnected drain (that was *missed* by our home builder) in a basement fiberglass shower... I did not install it, a plumber did. It was his first time using one but said the install was easy, the most difficult part was cutting the old drain out. No leaks or issues I know of. My only complaint is the included cover shows the drain edges-- very minor. We paid less locally but probably only available at plumbing supply stores.

I have no idea how that aspect works but I LOVE that aspect!No more wet stains down the back of the shirt!Don't freak out though when it dries... it gets stiff...and I mean stiff...if it's not folded or rolled up when it dries it literally looks like that old staying ""my shirt is so dirty it stands up on it's own in the corner"" and to use it again, you simply wet the towel again... be sure it is wet before you bend it or anything.... if you bend it when it's dry...it will breakI highly recommend this for anyone that is out in the heat or just needs to stay cool!I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.

"I gotta be honest...we've prolly tried every product there is for flea control and haven't had much luck with any of them reallyIt's to expensive to get a professional to come out and spray so that was never an option.This product actually surprised me and my hubby... I truly expected it to wind up in the trash like every other flea product we have tried.We followed the directions and treated all of our dogs with this.I don't know how this works but it does... our dogs no longer had issues with fleas and ticks (they're outside dogs). Whatever is in this...works and works well.You're prolly wondering why I give this 3 stars...let me tell ya... the price for only 5oz seems high but I haven't done too much price comparison but depending on how long we can make a bottle last...

" 0:39 MinsYEAH BUDDY!I can't tell you how much I love this chopper!To be honest, I had my doubts about it. A manual chopper operated by a pull cord is gonna really chop up my onions and other veggies??? Yes, yes it does...and much better than I ever imagined.I've got an electric chopper that is big and bulky that I hardly ever use it because it's just cumbersome to drag out just to chop some veggies. I prefer knife work than dragging that one out.This chopper is the perfect size for daily use!Cup wise it has a 25oz capacity.I think what makes the difference in this chopper compared to others is the 2 plastic arms that keep whatever it is you're chopping lifted up off the bottom of the bowl and pushed down from the top... it helps ensure that everything ...every piece gets in front of those blades.They aren't kidding when they say 5 pulls and you have chopped veggies for a pico... I chopped up some onions and broccoli and I am so impressed with the size that came out!It's easy to use... cleanup is a breeze... the only thing I wish was different was that there was a way to secure the lid when it was in use...when you were chopping. The lid doesn't lock to the bowl in any way... the only way it stays on in use is if you hold it with your free hand... no biggie but it just seems that a locking lid would have been a good safety feature to haveI received this product for free in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.

"This has a crisp clean peppermint smell which I love.My husbands shoes can knock you on your back! He is in his shoes from 5 am till close 11 pm every day. So believe me when I say he can get some odor going up in those shoes! Especially when you factor in he's out walking in the pasture with the cows and the dogs and chickens etc etcHe has 2 pairs that he wears regularly and I have sprayed this in both pairs. To be honest, it hasn't eliminated the odor completely BUT considering the shoes have had that odor for quite some time.... I wouldn't expect if too. It has though made it much better. I think it helps alot from allowing new odors to develop but doesn't eliminate long standing smells from the past.Best thing I like about this is it works great helping to keep my sheets that won't fit in my cedar chest smelling nice and fresh! (if you use it in that manner be sure to spray test a small area first to make sure it doesn't stain)Works great, priced reasonably!4 Stars!

"I don't know if I just got a poorly mixed bottle or what but this is nothing I would EVER pay for...opening it up and removing the fresh seal I expected (just on the spice list alone) to be smelling a mouthwatering scent of spices.... instead... nothing.I smelled a smidgen of garlic and a dash of cayenne. When I tasted it straight out of the bottle...all you could just about taste was paprika.... which shocked me because the first ingredient on the list is salt.. which I couldn't taste at all.I cook a LOT and make my own seasoning blends and marinades... I make my own jerky and  I'm very well experienced in flavor profiles around my kitchen and THIS seasoning...was nothing i would EVER purchase...or recommend if this is how it's spose to taste.I figured maybe just maybe...the flavor would come out in the cooking ...wishful thinking.

"I'm kinda disappointed in this pressure sprayer.When I opened the box up to take it out... it smelled like chemical fumes. I honestly thought I had gotten a sprayer that had been used before but after careful inspection by my hubby and myself... we realized that wasn't the case.Not sure why this thing smells so STRONGLY fresh out of the box but it does.Even though we both know how to use a pressure sprayer... it'd still be nice if there were instructions included. I get that it's not rocket science but there still needs to be some sort of instructions. With other sprayers we have used...you're not to overfill them...well, I saw nothing on this container to indicate where the maximum fill line is.It's nice that this comes with a pressure relief valve. Thats a nice change from other sprayers.What I don't like... the actual projection of the spray. There's not a direct stream option... you get either a wide mist or a more directed triangle/cone mist.At best, this is good for watering the plants on my front porch...that's itI received this product for free in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.

"It always makes me anxious to open up a box and the first thing I notice is the rampant smell of chemical laden fumes drifting towards my face.I don't know what causes that smell to permeate the air and what is in the compressor to smell that way.It is such a strong smell..it's so off putting. This thing is gonna have to sit outside overnight just to air out.While it's airing out I'm looking over the information on the box and on the included instruction sheet and I'm even more leary now.

After sitting outside overnight...this thing still wreaks of fumes...there is NO way that I would ever store this in my vehicle in case of an emergency... and especially after having my hubby give it a whirl to see how it performed....he said it's worse compressor he has ever used.

"I have mixed feelings about these vitamins.I love that it comes in 3 flavors: cherry, strawberry and orangeI don't like that they aren't what I would actually call a gummy so to speak. The outer portion feels like a gummy BUT once you bite down... it's a completely different texture than what you are expecting.It becomes this mushy, chewy, vitamin that gets stuck ALL over my teeth. Gummies....don't do that. Which is something about these vitamins that I can't stand. I can't stand for stuff sticking to my teeth... that right there will keep me from wanting to order any more.It's because of that, that I wouldn't recommend these.Price wise these are comparable to other vitamins I can find locally. This is a 30 day supply...2 gummies per day.Perhaps the thing that bothers me the most though.... in the listed other ingredients section: the first 3 ingredients are GLUCOSE SYRUP, SUGAR and GLUCOSE--- no wonder these taste kinda like candy... they're full of sugarIt's a shame when vitamins....need sugar.I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.

His nephew Kip, 11 years old, becomes a new and future character in this series.  He's a wise-cracking delinquent, and travels with Jake to an abandoned silver mine beneath the Aspen ski slopes.

"I finished reading this book the day after the 11-13-15 attack by ISIS on several Paris locations.  The story line in this novel is how these attacks are planned and initiated.  It's a gripping story about terrorism out to destroy England. The scourge of Islamic fundamentalism and madness is starting to consume England.  Faisal Aslam, the Master, is there in England to guide and counsel the recruits in the bombings.  His goal is to establish the Islamic State of England.  This novel is definitely an eye-opener.  Author Phillip Strang has seen the troubled world during his telecommunications careers which took him to many countries in the middle-east.  This novel has several sub-plots disclosing Islamic terrorist organizations and how they plan their terrorist attacks, murder, investigations, and dirty politics.  It reads like the true events which has shocked the current assault on Paris.  The novel is very well written, and the story is one we all must read.

"In this wonderful sequel to ""Dinosaurs and Cherry Stems,"" Cindy Layton and Jay De Matteo continue their serious bonding relationship.  In fact, they take the plunge and get married.  They've both been married twice before, going through two divorces each.  Often their reactions come from the 'graveyard' as Cindy calls bad memories.  Unfortunately, she gets a little out of line, in extreme, with her new husband.  They are both in their 50's and have a true love for each other.  But sometimes their actions flare, as those bad memories rise from the graveyard.  Cindy and Jay are two dinosaurs who are really mid-life adolescents.  Manners ... it comes down to manners, to thoroughly enjoy their new lives together.  Another great story by Susan Jean Ricci, written with much humor, but also some great hints as to how to compromise, when to speak, and when not to speak.  As a senior myself, I can relate to such challenges.  The third time around for Cindy and Jay is an adventure!

"This is a very humorous story of Cindy Layton.  She's been twice divorced, the last one leaving her to buy another home (more like a cottage) and having to face her ex-husband, an attorney, also her boss.  Needless to say, she'll not work there long!  She feels like a relic and doubts she can ever establish a new relationship, even on her terms.  This is an hilarious journey taking her to blind dates, as well as internet dating sites.  Nothing offers her hope.  She'd rather stay home in her cave with her dog, Shirley.  But ... one day she receives an e-mail from Jay DeMatteo.  Can she be swayed to take the risk of starting a new relationship at her age?  One reason people like to read is to be entertained.  Susan Jean Ricci knows how to entertain with lots of hilarious scenes, which will make you laugh out loud.  Also, her story contains many thoughts of wisdom.

"Bravo, Bravo!  This author has worked on this story for over 30 years.  Being dyslectic all his life, Author Grant Spradling has had the courage and help to bring this story to fruition.  This story is about racism, homophobia, romantic obsession, and murder. The story opens in 1962, seven years before Stonewall and decades before same-sex marriages have become more recognized as equality.  David Ward and Paul Adams live on the back side of Beacon Hill, in Boston for eight years.  David is a reverend at the Congressional Church.  Coming in late to his office, his secretary tells him Mrs. August Northrup and a police detective are waiting in his office.  Fear seizes him as he wonders if his being gay has been discovered.  Growing up gay always planted fear in his heart as he had frequently been threatened by those who wished to do harm to gays.  But that's not the issue.  Mrs. Northrop's home had been burglarized by a young black boy, Forest Washington.  She wishes David to attend his arraignment and wants to employ the boy.  She reminds the detective after he mutters a derogatory racial remark, ""Bigotry is far greater sin than theft.""  After a while both David and Paul think the other is having relations with another man.  David feels so guilty, but they still love each other. But Dave has been troubled more frequently with frightening dreams which he has shared with Paul. He thus decides to go back to his home town to find out if he can bring closure to these frightening dreams.  He also is on a mission to find out who had killed the town sheriff 25 years ago, which hopefully will bring an end to his nightmares.  This is a fast-paced novel, the characters compelling, and the story is spellbinding.

"This is a fantastic, fast-paced thriller.  It's a well-written story about Samuel Kazdoy, who once owned Corrugated Container Corp., founded in the 1920s. He's old but he still a workaholic.  Violet Belfrey, a busty woman of undetermined age poses nude for Samuel as he has now a new camera.  She had once been a stripper in Jacksonville, Florida.  For her little performance, the old man gifts her the contents of one locked drawer of a file cabinet.  It consists of bundles of legal papers and 'coupons,' redeemable the first of every month at any bank.  Violet wonders what the heck she stuffed into her bag.  It's a lot of money and she guesses there are more coupons in the other cabinet drawers.  She and a friend plan to find out.  Jake Lassiter is Sam Kazdoy's attorney, and he suspects Violet is up to some tricks involving Sam.  He's right, and soon Lassiter will be tracking a killer from Miami to Bimini, then on to Maui.

Highly recommend.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RXTSWHVT3J4CV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004CLYEQ4#wasThisHelpful","RXTSWHVT3J4CV","AX5KL9LWC1TG6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AX5KL9LWC1TG6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"In this suspenseful young children's story, Lee's left ear has ballooned to a size bigger than Lee's head!  Could it be that it was caused while he struggled with his mom during his bath time?  He was being mean, while mama wants him clean!  She finally walks away, tired of getting sopping wet and her son being belligerent.  Lee goes to bed without a goodnight kiss and his unwashed ear begins to itch.  There's nothing better than having an itch to scratch, right?  Wrong!!  This is a funny, delightful rhyming story with very cute simple expressive illustrations.  Cute, cute story.

"Kids really enjoy all the stories of Oliver, the handsome black and white cat, and Jumpy, his friend the kangaroo mom and boy, Joey. ""Letter In A Bottle,"" is about Foxy being naughty and getting into trouble with his mom.  Today he brushes his crumbs under the carpet rather than putting the crumbs in the trash.  This is really funny!  Once in trouble, always in trouble!  The next story is how ""Oliver Meets Jumpy"" for the first time.  It is in the outback and Jumpy is found crying with a broken leg.  We are so happy that Oliver saves her for all the fun adventures they share together.  In ""The Enchanted Forest, "" which is over the hill and across the lake, stands an old castle, crumbly and spooky.  But Oliver, Jumpy, and little Joey have no fear.  They enter the castle, and then go through another door which opens to a big forest with mean looking trees.  The trees share their stories of the witch who turned soldiers into these trees.  Spooky? Yes!  It's a good thing Oliver has his magic wand!  These are the best stories ever, always getting more fun for kids to enjoy the adventures.

"Lisa Shea's romantic stories are very short, and very enjoyable.  But I get the impression that the author rushed to get this published as there are some needed corrections to be made.  Is the man in Emily's quiet life Rich or Ryan?  Does Emily drive a car or a truck?  These overlooked mistakes aside, the story is about Emily and her previous husband meeting up after 10 years of separation, and their two daughters away at college, seeking their own independent lives.  They do not question their last 10 years away from each other and just resume in a close relationship as husband, wife, and parents.  It's a tender story of how tension raising children can sometimes lead to friction, friction to divorce.  But when the nest is empty, a binding relationship still can exist.  It's short, read it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2FJSP9FMVF97H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015NJBD9Y#wasThisHelpful","R2FJSP9FMVF97H","AX5KL9LWC1TG6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AX5KL9LWC1TG6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a story suitable for young adults, one which all should read, as well as adults.  It is set in 19th Century Europe and the author's writing is styled to that time frame.  Anders Christiansen is four years old when his father, a fisherman, returns from the sea on a day in 1816.  He loves his father who thrills him with stories which he loves to hear.  He soon begins sharing his own tales delighting other classmates and teachers as he grows older.  When he is 14 years old, his creative stories become more about people rather than animals and objects.  He starts to observe more people and listening to them as they gather in markets and business places.  Soon he is chosen to attend a university away from home. The professors at the university recognize his valued gift as high quality and seek to promote and guide him to be very successful.  After a year at school, a message is hand-delivered to him which states his father has been lost at sea and his mother is gravely ill.  He's to return home immediately.  Soon his mother dies, and as he returns to college, it's difficult for him to find a rooming house. Very soon, his life changes dramatically, but he has one faithful friend who wishes to help him:  a large white dog.  This is a remarkable tale of survival, compassion, and the struggles in making the most of one's life. This story is written mostly as from a story teller, with little dialog, but it's a remarkable tale for young readers if they are encouraged to take the time to engulf themselves into this meaningful story.  Highly recommend.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RUYU01NL49NKL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZPQ05AO#wasThisHelpful","RUYU01NL49NKL","AX5KL9LWC1TG6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AX5KL9LWC1TG6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I really enjoyed this short story which takes place at Hampton Beach in New Hampshire.  Summer is just about over, colleges are in session, and Molly strolls along the boardwalk.  She is working as a bartender at a rowdy night club.  She runs into Martin sitting at a cafe patio, reading a book.  He's waiting for his sister, Emily, who's an artist and whose birthday is today.  She's a little delayed wanting to finish an oil painting.  So, Molly and Martin decide to go to Plum Island to check out some birds.  This part of the coast is popular for wildlife, including migrating whales.  It's certainly much more peaceful than Boston.  Molly and Martin seem to make a perfect pair; they met three years ago to the day of his sister's birthday celebration.  .As they stroll, a truck parks, a man gets out with a shotgun, and Martin's hackles flare as he recognizes someone who will break the law of this protected nature preserve.  This is a very short story, but very moving and exciting.  This is a series I've enjoyed immensely as Lisa Shea's stories go right to the heart.

"I love the novels of this series written by very creative Paul Levine.  He's an excellent writer, sweeping readers deep into the action, mysteries, and vulnerabilities of Jake Lassiter.  In this potent story, Jake seeks redemption and revenge as years ago had failed to help a runaway girl, Krista Larkin.  He's guilt-driven to punish those who had harmed her. Lassiter was the last to see her after a bar party 18 years ago.  Did Krista just run away to a new life, or was she murdered.  His client is Amy Larkin, older sister to Krista. She winds up in jail charged with First Degree Murder.  Jake's investigation takes him into dangerous webs of prostitution and pornography profiteers such as Charlie Ziegler.  Why does Alex Castiel, the State Attorney, fear his background will be revealed to the public by Jack?  A very compelling story, many twists and turns.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RH9VEHY6R0H9F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007PK92XE#wasThisHelpful","RH9VEHY6R0H9F","AX5KL9LWC1TG6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AX5KL9LWC1TG6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In the author's own words, ""This is a selection of metaphyictional short stories.""  These stories were written to entertain, but one finds they are very thought provoking as to  how we face and live life.  Our minds are constantly spinning like our universe, fully loaded with occasional asteroids. It's like we open our mouth to speak and we just don't know where our comments came from!  Our brains are constantly spinning.  The first story, ""A Day At The Beach"" reminds me of the old TV series, ""The Twilight Zone,"" where one travels through time, then back to boring reality.  A couple of these stories abruptly end as the author lets you devise your own ending.  There is not much to some of these stories, but they do grasp you and are like puzzles you're trying to put together.  Weird? Yes.  Imaginative?  Yes.  Thought provoking? Yes.  Read these stories and let the author know what you think by writing a review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3TRUOUNPOQROE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015GMRYC8#wasThisHelpful","R3TRUOUNPOQROE","AX5KL9LWC1TG6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AX5KL9LWC1TG6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This very interesting and remarkably written historic event happened back on November 4, 1791 in the then Northwest Territory which now are the states of Ohio, Indiana, Wisconsin, and Michigan.  This battle took place during the presidency of George Washington, who was respectful of Native Americans.  Led by Chief Little Turtle of the Miami tribe and Blue Jackett of the Shawnees, they rebelled against General Arthur St. Clair's 1,200 soldiers of which over 900 were killed.  The Native American warriors were encouraged by the British still somewhat officiating in the Northwest Territory.  This was the very first  time the U.S. Army had been defeated which lead to the first congressional investigation in U.S. History.  The defeat of St. Clair was a dress rehearsal for American forces for the War of 1812, the war between U.S. of America against England, Ireland, North American Colonies, and it's Native American allies.  This well written documentary takes you into the time period of 1785-1795 and includes the history of some of the major players who took part in this battle.  It's a chronological account of how and why this battle came to be and the tragic defeat for the U.S. Army.  The author provides an extensive bibliography to reflect the in-depth research of this little known historical event. This is a good reflection of how the Native Americans came together as a confederation, while the U.S. government fumbled for three years after the Revolution.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R284OP8X0B3LG0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016C7B11G#wasThisHelpful","R284OP8X0B3LG0","AX5KL9LWC1TG6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AX5KL9LWC1TG6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book is perfect for young readers.  There is lots of fun, a ghost house, but also historical facts about slavery, the Underground Railroad, and some Connecticut history.  In this exemplary, youthful story, Rusty Larson and his family move into a very old house in Connecticut.  It's called the Barstow House built in 1854 before the Civil War.  There is already an occupant in the old house, who only Rusty will discover.  It's not easy for Rusty to make friends especially having a pet pig called 'Muddles,' and living with a ghost in the house.  This story is mesmerizing, a fantastic read for young readers with a few illustrations/pictures.  It is easy to read, has short chapters, and provides an interesting concept of combining a fun read with learning facts.  It has a few errors not caught by the proofreader/editor, but it's a story to encourage youngsters to read more books.

"Once again, Francois Bissonnette's stories have captured my interest as I enjoy reading them to children, who also enjoy the stories.  The first story, ""The Musician And The Princess,"" is how Albert, the King's musician falls deeply in love with the King's daughter, Sarah.  The King likes Albert but feels he is not skilled enough to protect his daughter from the King's enemies.  So, he challenges Albert by testing him.  He must fight with one of his knights.  Albert accepts the challenge only if the fight is in the forest, at night.  The next story, ""Alicia And The Unicorn,"" Princess Alicia is the daughter of the King of The Rickward Kingdom.  Alicia is a beautiful, happy little girl whose birth is arriving and she'll be seven years old.  She tells her father she wants a queen crown, full of precious gems.  But her father denies her request.  Her second wish is for a unicorn, but where will one be found?  And who will find the unicorn for Alicia?  These are truly wonderful stories, with wonderful photos, which make me smile and the unicorn actually warmed my heart.

"This is a very riveting short story which has a very engaging story line.  It's a very moving, heartfelt story of love ... and how it never dies.  Newly wed Emma Lohan lies in hospital, brain dead, with only the life sustaining equipment keeping her alive.  Emma is only 20 years old, and in only an instant, her future is gone.  Cody White, her young husband, is devastated, but he refuses to allow her to die.  His love is too strong, he cannot go on living without her.  This leads him back to memories of how they met for the first time.  Emma had been no ordinary girl... she was beautiful in Cody's eyes, strong-willed, mischievous, and deserved respect.  He instantly fell in love with her and in his heart and soul knew he'd never walk away from her.  She was a jewel to be treasured.  But hard times come, he wasn't giving his band the support they needed to become famous, but regardless, Emma meant more to him than becoming famous.

"Found:  Eleven rooms in a tunnel, ten bodies, and only one empty grave.  Brandon Fisher has just become an FBI Special Agent working in the Behavioral Analysis Unit.  This is his first investigation under the leadership of experienced supervisor, Jack Harper.  The team of four head to the small town of Salt Lick, Kentucky to examine the burial site.  They believe the empty grave is waiting to be filled by the psychotic serial killer.  The bodies date back in time, two to three decades, except for the last one.  Also, in a hidden basement room, they determined this room is where the killer did his cutting, and mutilation of the victims before death.  The owner of the property, Lance Bingham, has been in jail for a few years for killing two cows (which in Kentucky is a serious crime), and assaulting a man.  The last body found was killed during the time Lance was incarcerated, thus the team surmises that there is another person involved.  Also, FBI research reveals there were 11 more similar killings in Sarasota, Florida.  So far, the evidence links Bingham, but there is the killer's apprentice ... still out there.  Carolyn Arnold is an awesome writer with the characters well defined.  It's very apparent her fantastic alluring novels have been well researched and developed into realistic investigative procedures.

"From popular author J.A. Jance comes another well written story of mystery, loss and heartbreak, military duty and honor.  Seattle investigator J.P. Beaumont is taking some time off to get both his knee joints replaced.  He's dreading this procedure, as his wife Mel Soames is driving in emergency mode to get him there faster than limits allow.  The surgery goes well and he wakes with no pain courtesy of the pain medication.  But he is a bit confused.  His thoughts go back to 1973, his very first detective murder case of Monica Wellington, a young college student found dead and her body dumped into a kitchen oil waste barrel.  Two young boys had found her and the investigation continued for a couple of years without much evidence to identify the murderer.  It's been a cold case for nearly forty years.  He also has thoughts while in recovery of being in the Vietnam War where his life had been saved by a fellow soldier who had lost his life.  Beaumont has some doors still open which he feels must be closed, and he's determined to do it.  A very interesting story, smoothly written with some heart-wrenching and emotional overtones.  It's a very compelling read, and I highly recommend to others.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2HRC231ESIZJC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009NG2DHA#wasThisHelpful","R2HRC231ESIZJC","AX5KL9LWC1TG6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AX5KL9LWC1TG6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the second children's story about Nancie ... a stubborn girl at times which most Nancie's exhibit in real life!  She'll do anything to get out of going to bed when her parents ask her.  She'd much rather play or even help Mom with her chores.  But at four years of age, she still has a lot to learn about handling fragile dishes.  It takes a good mom to set the rules, a lesson which sometimes can be adjusted just by saying, 'Please.'  Illustrations are really cute and children will really relate to this story.

"This is the first novel I've read by this author. In this very suspenseful crime drama, Jack Lassiter, a former NFL line-backer, is now a defense attorney in Miami.  He's contacted by Victoria Lord, of another law firm, Solomon and Lord, about her partner, Steve Solomon.  He needs a defense attorney as he's been arrested for murder of Nicolai Gorev, a suspect of wire fraud and money laundering, as well as racketeering.  Jack Lassiter may have been an attorney for 20 years, but he's more like a sleuth seeking out the answers.  This novel is exceptionally written with twists and turns, lots of action, and I could not put it down.  Author Paul Levine has me hooked and I'll be reading more of his novels, starting with the first book of this series.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2EMV4FIKENGXG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PYZYB3I#wasThisHelpful","R2EMV4FIKENGXG","AX5KL9LWC1TG6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AX5KL9LWC1TG6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is another wonderful children's book which is educational about the sense of touch.  As Shelly, mother rabbit, and her sweet little daughter, Anna, play in the strawberry field, Anna asks her mom, ""How do we use the sense of touch?""  Remember, rabbits have four feet, and each foot can detect feeling, such as wet ground, thorns among plants, and the tasty touch of a ripe strawberry!  Also, one feels a hug, the sun's warmth, the bristles on a toothbrush.  I know mothers can show their children many things to make children aware of the sense of touch, and how one must be very careful with their fingers.  A very simple book to read with very cute illustrations.  Mothers can have a lot of fun with their young children by turning this short story into a game.  A game of touch!  Look for Sagit Cohen's other books about the five senses.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1GQZ57KEEYJBL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011NVAN9M#wasThisHelpful","R1GQZ57KEEYJBL","AX5KL9LWC1TG6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AX5KL9LWC1TG6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Willomena, mostly known as Willa, is a prima-donna type of girl with big dreams.  She wants to be a star ballerina, but her feet are too big and she slips and slides!  She knocks all the beautiful swans down like they were bowling pins.  She's not wanted with that dance group; she runs away in tears into the woods.  While there, she gets some good advice from Tommy Toad, who basically says, ""Don't cry, there's no need to be shy.""

"This story is the sequel to ""Fallen Palm.""  It's been four months since Jesse McDermitt was married...for one day as his wife had been kidnapped, brutally raped and murdered on that day.  Since then Jesse has been in retreat on his small island in the Florida Keys.  Lieutenant Commander Russell ""Deuce"" Livingston Jr. is team leader for a Caribbean terrorist assault team with the Department of Homeland Security. He had previously asked for Jesse's assistance to scatter his father's ashes, but now, he's asking Jesse to join the task force to bring down a major smuggler, Carlos Santiago...the same man who has threatened Carl Trent, a shrimp fisherman, who made one trip for Santiago carrying drugs into the USA.  It's not for him, and now he's put his family in danger.  Jesse will provide sanctuary for Trent's family, and also join the task force to bring down Santiago.

"Having the opportunity to read this book prior to publication, I jumped at the chance as I love the suspenseful mystery stories by Douglas Wickard.  However, this is a totally different story of two people straying from the normal ways of life, wandering through life not knowing who they are.  His dedication, ""ABERRANT is dedicated to all those aberrant souls who felt different, disconnected, unloved or misunderstood because of their sexual preference, With Heartfelt Love, Douglas Wickard."" This story is so very timely with our nation recognizing same sex marriages.  There are yet so many people who don't believe in equality, and that's one of the battles that will continue for a long time in America.  This is an awesome story examining the lives of two males, an old man, Ellery ""Will"" Flynn, and one young man, Chance, who have similar experiences in their childhood. The format is told in both the present and flashes back to the past.  Wickard's story is provocative and written realistically with so much passion and insightfulness.  The dialog is what I have to say is raw, but having read several wonderful books by gay authors it did not sway me from reading this story enthusiastically. I like the generosity of Chance, not thinking of himself but gifting to Will the wonderful feelings of love which he has never incurred until his last days.  I liked the counseling  offered to Chance since they endured the same hardships in their youth.  The premise of the story reveals the difficulty of gay men finding love, long lasting, true love.  Included in this novel is the history of the Stonewall Inn attack by law enforcers on LGBT people in Greenwich Village, New York City, 1969. This set the course of these people to seek equality.  I believe Author Doug Wickard wrote this story with much flamboyance, but also with his heart.  It's a strong, skillful story one that will remain in hearts and minds of those who are not judgmental. This emotional story is spellbinding, very moving, and heart wrenching. It contains erotic scenes and dialog, For Adults Only.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3N8X6J2SJH0KA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XNNBZFK#wasThisHelpful","R3N8X6J2SJH0KA","AX5KL9LWC1TG6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AX5KL9LWC1TG6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a very exciting and captivating story of Sarah Baker who struggles with PTSD due to events which happened to her 12 years earlier.  She changes her life, her name, and feels safe working on the Broken Bar Ranch.  Gage Burton, retired police detective, believes the serial killer, from whom Sarah Baker escaped from, was not the man found guilty and was given the death penalty.  He and his daughter, Tori, take a little vacation to the ranch where he suspects Sarah is located.  Cole McDonough is the son of Myron McDonough, terminally ill owner of the large ranch.  He is not close to Cole, believing he caused the death of his wife and younger son. The real serial killer is back on the hunt for Sarah.

"This is an adorable story about Lily the Goat and her goat friends who are searching for a delightful choir to join.  Do you know what a choir is?  It's a group of people, in this case, animals and birds, who like to sing together to an audience.  But as Lily and her friends sing and dance through the woods, they are unable to be accepted by many choir groups, such as birds, cats, and frogs.  They are shunned and not wanted in their groups.  But, never say never because if one keeps searching, one's goal will be reached.  This is a wonderful, learning story for kids which reflects discrimination and how it can make Lily and her friends sad.  But, because they kept moving forward to their goal, they find acceptance by many species in a stunning choir group.  This rhyming story is well written and the illustrations charming.

"These are great adventure stories for young children, and the illustrations are gorgeous.  Remember Oliver, the handsome and arrogant black and white cat?  Remember his best friend the kangaroo lady, Jumpy, and her little boy Joey?  Well, they are back!  Three more adventures are told here which kids will thoroughly enjoy.  First story, ""The Incredible Train Journey,"" is filled with excitement, and simulates a scary roller coaster ride through tunnels and under the sea.  The second story is ""Hiccup"" which Oliver can't stop... Hiccup, Hiccup!  He has to climb a tall mountain where he's learned a certain bird secretes through feeding her babies a certain nectar to stop and prevent future hiccups.  I wonder if this works on humans!  The third story is ""Fishing,"" which is really fun to do. Oliver takes Joey on a fishing trip. Oliver catches a really big fish which draws their fishing boat around the lake.  Who will win, Oliver or the fish? As always, author Werner Stejskal presents excellently written stories to excite children.

"This is an amazing story of two people finding their love again after 25 years. It's a story of true love, and true love is never lost.  Sam Tatum, divorced for over a year, having two adult children living their lives in England, returns to Smith Mountain Lake with a dark secret he's revealed to no one.  Gabby Hayden, his first love at age 16, still lives there managing the marina and restaurant with her 10-year old adopted daughter.  This remarkable story reveals their hardships, memories, and hard decision making for each major character in this compelling, well written romance.  Inglath Cooper is certainly a master of romance and suspense. When one is drawn into such a story, it's hard not to shed tears, but that is also an indication of the engaging story line.

"The story starts off relatively simple with a girl torn between two worlds; one being ours and the other that of the human-like trolls. Wendys character makes this all complicated quickly and the story remains interesting as her actions are not easy to predict.That said, Wendy was not an easily likable character for me, I think because of her decision making, whether its concerning her family or her troll-family. Wendy aside, I did take a liking to Finn and Rhys. Both seemed to be less emotionally complicated and easier to like.'Switched' keeps to a quick pace and is an entertaining lighter read.

Dax is a man who knows what he wants for his future, including not wanting any distractions from women for the time being.

When the ranch they inherit unexpectedly comes with its own battle to keep, plus one that follows them, they quickly find their hands full.I found Rachel to be a very likeable character, as she is a strong and independent woman with talents of her own as a nurse.

"I was browsing my local health store when the shopkeeper introduced me to this product. I've been on the lookout for alternatives to the caffeine energy drinks I used to buy to keep me going as a self-employed busy mom. I first tried this with just water, but while the taste is a genuine tasty vanilla, the somewhat-sandy texture wasn't very high up my alley. I tried next to mix it with my morning coffee and later with milk, and it was much nicer. It also gives a strong and quick energy kick, particularly in the morning where I used to slug around for hours before becoming awake enough to get things done. I'm too early into using it to comment on whether it helps weight loss as well, but with its ingredients and how it helps curb hunger cravings by giving your body a good dose of the nutrients it needs to run, I can foresee this product helping out a bit there as well. I will have to try out the chocolate flavor next time time I shop.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R171KC5FMTSUJG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FX0DWM0#wasThisHelpful","R171KC5FMTSUJG","A17PM59AUJM00T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17PM59AUJM00T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I wasn't sure I would enjoy this book when I picked it up, but I was in for a wonderful surprise. What starts off as an interesting premise, the life of a young girl during WWII who loves books enough to go out of her way to obtain them, quickly becomes a story that you can't put down. All of the characters are charming and put through heart-wrenching circumstances that accurately reflect how life was in Germany during the war, and I was in tears more often than once. That said, there are certainly some funny and thoroughly memorable things that happen as well, and enough action to keep the story intense and in high-gear. After I finished the book I watched the movie and it too was worth every moment of my attention. This is a keeper for my own kids and grandchildren to read and watch.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2DR3B04FUW18V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000XUBFE2#wasThisHelpful","R2DR3B04FUW18V","A17PM59AUJM00T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17PM59AUJM00T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Not to say that I don't like the Harry Potter series, it's just the way it was implemented into 'Knights' was not in a way that worked for me.

"Amy and Nick are married for five years, but there is not much harmony left. All of a sudden, Amy is missing. And from there, a more and more surprising and devious plot develops, cleverly and elegantly put together by a very talented writer.It is difficult to talk about the plot without risking spoilers. So let's say this: It is not a conventional thriller. There are twists and totally surprising developments, we are getting manipulated and are lied to by both protagonists. It's not only a thriller, the book is also about unconventional truths about love and marriage. Sadly, the ending is a disappointment. Best not to expect too much from it and just enjoy the reading of the novel as such.The book is always straightforward and readable, but maybe there are a few digressions too many. I can't help but feeling that nowadays thriller writers feel the need to expand their books to 600 pages when 400 would have done just as well. That's stupid, because it automatically weakens the suspense.Gillian Flynn really deconstructed love and marriage here a lot, so I have a suggestion for readers who would like to read a (shorter) crime novel which is thrilling, full of dark humor and lets you believe in love again: Heads Off (A Lisa Becker Mystery).","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 25, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R31LW1MMWDP2AQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007ZXK08C#wasThisHelpful","R31LW1MMWDP2AQ","A17PM59AUJM00T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17PM59AUJM00T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

As the world around him falls apart by a zombie disease, he keeps his focus on saving himself and doing what he can for only his friends who have stuck their necks out for him. His character growth from nothing in life to expert in taking on a world of death was believable and engrossing.

"'Tougher Than the Rest' is a memorable western romance set in Arizona in the 1800's. After four kids suffer the tragic loss of their parents, we're taken twelve years into the future where they are grown up and trying to find love and what they want to do for the rest of their lives.Niall came off as really cold most of the time, as he was still recovering from the loss of his wife, Camille, and has the responsibility of keeping his family afloat. Although attracted to Kate, he sees her as an obstacle to putting his life on the financially stable track he intended by marrying a wealthy widow. There is a lot of attraction and tension between these two, as Kate wants Niall close, but he's hard-headed and refuses to change his mind.Shirleen Davies really pulls you into Kate's and Niall's world with these strong main characters and secondary characters. I felt like I was in their world throughout the whole story as well, which is a testimony to great writing.

"I was laughing out loud for a good majority of the time while reading 'Broken Headbone', as what the women go through in this book was both crazy and all around funny.Although a short read, the stories that Ginny Mcmath has assembled together in this book are unforgettable ones of self-reflection after marriage collapses and woes. I found 'Clown Porn' to be the funniest and my favourite of them all in here. Can something good be made out of bad luck? This book will make you believe it can, and since part of the proceeds go to Breast Cancer research, it's a great book to pick up.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 5, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RD7Y17HR97001/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CHB8RG4#wasThisHelpful","RD7Y17HR97001","A17PM59AUJM00T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17PM59AUJM00T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Lee Wilson has created a captivating world where angels are amongst us, as are their fallen dark counterparts who are known as vampires.Daniel and Hannah were a really hot couple, and although their attraction was quick, it is held together by their strong feelings. Their relationship grows on a believable level as Hannah then finds out his secret and herself in the middle of a struggle for power between two supernatural forces.With suspense, romance, new adult angst and a gripping plot, 'The Last Hybrid: Bloodline of Angels' is a great book for paranormal fans and anyone who enjoyed the 'Twilight' series.

"Snow is a Canadian on the other side of the world in Russian vodka country, content to be depressed and miserable for the rest of his life, until an accident puts him into a coma.We're then taken into the past and what has happened to him up to that point with the help of the woman, Magda, who won't give up on him. There is also a danger that is making the workers sick, and as a keeper of the documents for the company, he may be the deciding factor in exposing the threat before it continues on its dangerous course.Magda was an interesting character, and her determination to not give up on Snow and pull him out of his darkness defines her complex character even more. I felt a lot of sympathy for Snow as well, and his past that helped put him where he is now. The conditions that they have to endure are harsh and in many ways unforgiving.

"When I was looking around for an air conditioner for my place, I was disheartened to find that none of the window units would fit in my tiny windows. This one fits comfortably inside and cools down my large rooms fast.

"Even though I skipped three of the seven chapters (didn't need them for class), the book turned out to be a great help. The explanations are good and there are a lot of examples from easy to hard, including some more exotic ones. Certainly a good pick if you struggle with statistics. Plus, you can't argue with the price.However, in my opinion a few of the examples were ""too much"" for a beginner's book, they can make it a tough read. And the illustrations could be better.

"I feel this top runs slightly small.The tag reads "" Wear this piece effortlessly from the studio to the street"" Im not sure about that statement. The built in bra only provides light support. I don't have a large chest but I felt this flattened  rather than flattered. I really like the black blouse overlay. It disguises my tummy well . However it makes the top a bit shapeless. Only because it's a tank I would only wear it on the street if I had a very light jacket or cardigan sweater for coverage. Here are a few other things I have noticed about this garment :* There are 4 layers of fabric in the cup area (5 if you include the removable pads)  They include1) The black mesh overlay 2) The blue fabric liner 3) The front fabric  of the bra 4) The bra liner/ pad holder /pocket / and if you include the removable pad you have # 5 !  Even though this is a tank  I felt extra warm in the garment.* The blue is more of a bright blue rather than a navy. The blue fabric lines the entire top and peaks out on each side of the keyhole racerback.* The blue fabric band at the bottom holds the top in place very well. The blue fabric band has ruching/gathering in three places... Each side and sadly DIRECTLY IN THE MIDDLE on the back.Maybe i'm reaching but it the seam seems to line up with my crack...I don't like even the suggestion of a seam in that spot.* The garment is sewn well. It looks and feels like a quality item.* The small grey Gaiam logo is subtly placed on the back lower left corner ( on the black fabric)Overall, the good out ways the bad !","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RK9P0PEKLOV45/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00U35ARSC#wasThisHelpful","RK9P0PEKLOV45","A3MJYQFHRYLUUB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3MJYQFHRYLUUB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I am not going to lie set up was a  B i T C h and a half. I had to drag out the laptop and use the INCLUDED disc to set this up. If you only have a phone,tablet or a Chromebook you MAY HAVE ISSUES getting this up and running. Adding the ink is a messy job and you will get it on you ...You have been warned ! Once set up it works great ! It produces excellent prints! I love that I can print as much as I want without having to worry about running out of ink. I wish it had screen . Without a screen this is a very basic machine. Even with limited features this is still an excellent printer and the Eco Tank feature is game changing !* If I were spending MY OWN MONEY I would spend the extra cash ( currently only $20.00 extra) to get the next model up ...The  ET-2550 ! The better model has CRUCIAL features that this model is missing!This MODEL THE ET-2500 does NOT :* Does not have a screen.This model is buttons only!* No slot to for your SD card .YOU cannot print pictures from an SD card with this model.* WiFi or USB only ! NO iPrint , NO AirPrint ! Epson has an app that you can download to your android or Apple product. You MUST go into that app to print from a tablet or phone.* No support for CHROMEBOOKS that I could find! I save my work to my google drive then pull it up the Epson app on my iPad and print from there. Yes it works but if you buy the NEXT model up it supports AirPrint and iPrint out the box.There are probably other features that it's missing read ALL of the other reviews and you will see that many mention getting the better model.I also want to mention just in case your new to the EPSON brand of printers that the brand is excellent!

"I ordered the Totes Peggy boots after trying ( and loving ) my mothers pair of Totes boots. I read the reviews here on Amazon and on S H O E B U Y dot com. Many reviews suggested going up a size. They also mentioned that the boots were narrow. I usually wear a size 6 but I ordered a size 7 wide width.  Well, they are too big for me! I should have only went up a half size and stuck with the regular width. I am keeping them because I have no other boots and it's snowing here almost daily. I kindly suggest start by going up only a half size. Maybe order two sizes and keep only the better fitting boot.Quality wise these are just OK. The Totes Peggy is a fully synthetic boot. To my eye they look a little cheap. The style is very basic. The shaft length is perfect for all but the highest of snowfall. These have the zipper down the front making them super easy to get on and off.I have wide calves and I'm still able to tuck in my pants with ease. Warmth wise they are pretty good. Only on the coldest days and when I have walked through snow have I  felt a chill in the toe area. In regular daily wear these are warm, light weight,waterproof ( so far )  and comfortable. The sole is very ""grippy"" on ice.Overall, these are good snow boots.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RM6981XVJ0DIU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006AXZ8MG#wasThisHelpful","RM6981XVJ0DIU","A3MJYQFHRYLUUB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3MJYQFHRYLUUB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This product promises 7 days of volume. It's super easy to use. You apply it in shower after washing and conditioning. They suggest 3- 4 pumps and that you leave it on for 3 to 4 minutes then rinse. The directions state to blow dry and style as desired. When I ordered this product I was NOT aware that it required or suggested blow drying. I don't blow dry my hair as it makes my hair too brittle.I used the product as suggested on the box except I just towel dried my hair. My results have been good. I have thick hair but it's limp and dry. This product gives my hair a fuller,softer look and feel with more movement...Dare I say it has more bounce? I am pretty sure my results would be even better if I were to blow dry.Overall,this is a product worth trying.* It's reasonably priced !* It's non permanent !* It's non damaging !* Safe for color treated hair !","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RE1YNFY6A68W6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00P1NBKSW#wasThisHelpful","RE1YNFY6A68W6","A3MJYQFHRYLUUB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3MJYQFHRYLUUB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have been using this coffeemaker for about a month. I feel I can offer a review of it's performance and features.First and foremost this coffeemaker makes hot delicious coffee!The Black & Decker CM2035B 12 cup Thermal Carafe coffee maker is a large and attractive coffeemaker. This coffeemaker features brushed stainless steel on the operating panel and a brushed stainless steel insulated carafe. It also features chrome trim around the carafe plate. The rest of the coffeemaker is shiny black plastic. This coffeemaker would look especially nice in a kitchen that has stainless steel appliances.I feel this a slightly larger than average coffeemaker. The measurements are as follows:* About 13 inches tall.* About 8  inches wide across front.* Depth is about 9 inches (without accounting for the handle sticking out) because it has a ""fishtail"" piece at the bottom back of the machine.* The cord is about 30 inches long including the plug.***For logo conscious buyers: The Black+Decker ( yes, they use a + ) logo appears 3 times on this machine. Its imprinted in dark grey on the operating panel. It also appears in dark grey on each side of carafe. The logo imprinting is subtle and unobtrusive.Here are some of the best features of this coffeemaker:* Fresh brew timer. The machine displays the time since brewed up to 120 minutes.* The brew basket has a neat little handle that makes it super easy to remove.I also like that the brew basket can only fit in one way.* Sneak a cup feature lets you grab a cup while its still brewing. As long as you replace the carafe before 20 seconds the brew basket will not overflow.* Auto shut off ! Once the brew cycle ends the machines turns off automatically. This is great for forgetful types. I am sure you are already aware but I still want to mention this coffeemaker does NOT have  a hotplate.* The display panel is nice and big and very easy to program. The power button glows bright blue when the machine is operating.* Brew strength selector allows you to customize the flavor of your coffee with 3 different brew strengths regular, Strong and bold. I have only tried the regular but I love having the other options.* The carafe is the standout feature of this machine. Its double walled vacuumed sealed stainless steel. It looks lovely and keeps the coffee hot for a long time. It also features a great spout that does NOT drip. It also has a very wide opening for super easy and efficient cleaning.My only minor quibble is the lid to the carafe is quite finicky. I have carpel tunnel and I find it a bit hard to open. Also, the carafe lid must be perfectly aligned or coffee may run over the lid. The carafe lid is imprinted with a white graphic arrow to help with alignment. The carafe is also imprinted with white locked and unlocked graphics to assist with alignment. I just mention my difficulty with the lid in case others have dexterity issues too.Overall, i'm happy with this coffeemaker. It has an upscale look,exciting features and makes delicious coffee.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RSZC2C5X9X0O1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LU2I3V0#wasThisHelpful","RSZC2C5X9X0O1","A3MJYQFHRYLUUB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3MJYQFHRYLUUB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Oh my! This is a S T R O N G air freshener scent! I like the ""FRESH"" scent,I would describe the scent as fabric softener with a sweet perfumey undertone. I placed this near my F I V E jumbo cat litter boxes!  I am OK ( my five cats seem not to notice )with the strong scent in that area.I would suggest NOT placing this item in a bedroom. Many times in the past I have purchased similar products only to find them to be too weak. Well I got my wish ! Febreze scented oil air freshener is super strong! They promise up to 60 days of freshness...I will update!The unit comes packaged in a teal colored cardboard cradle with a peel back label. I liked how easy it was to open. Upon opening the package you can already smell the scent. When I uncapped the oils to place them in the unit the product dripped on my hands. This is a S T R O N G scent not a bad scent. The unit is larger but appears well made. I was able to plug it into my upper outlet. It does not block my lower outlet. There is a slider switch on the unit to lower or higher the scent intensity. However its poorly placed. You must unplug the unit to access the switch.I give it four stars. My only minor issues was the dripping of the oil onto my hands.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3B3B7FW0PTN3V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PBGPJFE#wasThisHelpful","R3B3B7FW0PTN3V","A3MJYQFHRYLUUB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3MJYQFHRYLUUB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I just got to try the new Unstopables scents line from Febreze. This line features stronger longer lasting scents. I selected the Shimmer scent.  The Shimmer scent is lovely. I would describe it as a feminine,sweet perfumey scent. It's not overwhelming but lingers much longer than traditional Febreze scents.  When the sprayed item or area dries the scent does soften some. I used it on a pair of sequined loafers that can't be washed but needed refreshing. It worked perfectly ! I can see this being great for refreshing coats in between dry cleanings or drapes. Febreze promises 7 days of freshness...I will update.I like the packaging ( i'm a pink lover) but the bottle is black and you can't eyeball how much is left in the container. I like the sprayer but I  do wish it dispensed less product with each squeeze.Overall, I love this new line and the Shimmer scent is fantastic !","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2NYV4MR01DGHO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QEMVC5U#wasThisHelpful","R2NYV4MR01DGHO","A3MJYQFHRYLUUB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3MJYQFHRYLUUB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have two of these nozzles. I was so pleased with mine we bought Mom one. It is the best I have ever used. I use mine primarily to water my garden, including fragile plants. We bought Mom's to knock down pine needles off the roof. Sadly, her city water pressure keeps it from being successful for her roof, based on my house, it would work for that. The quality is excellent and the spray patterns are great. There are sprays for flat horizontal and for vertical.

"This is a great product. Below I have made comments on using it and on putting it down. Here is my synopsis: I have bought time, have non-herbicide weed control, a good walking surface, help amending my soil, and most impotently, I can let my perennial plants grow in without it looking yucky.  I had a 30' x 60' area that is a future cutting garden that I did not have time to cultivate well this year and was watching dreadful weeds overcome the plot. After feedback from posting a question I purchased the cloth. I smoothed out the ground (sloping) as well as I could with a 4 hp tiller and put down a couple of inches of peat. Wow. It is nice to walk on, even though the area is pretty sloped. The peat gives it a cushy feel and the cloth will help the peat lower my very high pH. I was able to plant quite a few seedlings this year and they are thriving. I did cut holes in the cloth that were about 3 to 5 times the size of the plants (most plants about 3-5 inches diameter). This allows the water to seep in and keeps it from being too hot on the plants. I LOVE the brown color. Since the plants I raised from seeds this year are still small, a lot of the cloth shows. It is not offensive. I did discover that you need good, strong ground stakes to keep it down because the fabric is so sturdy. I used Easy Gardener 815 (from Amazon). While I used a 2 pound hammer gently applied, any hammer would do. If start the stake in at an angle so that one side penetrates first it makes it a lot easier. One of the nicest things about it is that once you start your cut with scissors, you can just slide the scissors against the fabric and it cuts. Also, there is a good grain so that it cuts true without wrestling with it to get a straight cut. I was able to put the fabric down, alone, in 20 ft strips at a time in a light wind on a slope. I would not recommend this method but I was able to do it by myself.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZ3KROXEIIH6B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004SI9S9Y#wasThisHelpful","RZ3KROXEIIH6B","A23SE77CDU60SE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23SE77CDU60SE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This could be a plus or a minus depending on your soil. If your plants need an increase in alkalinity, it could be great, if you need acid, not so much. I was very excited to have all these useful trace minerals in my organic garden. Twice I used a drench method, following the directions on the package. Unfortunately, what I did not know until it happened the second time, was that it can raise the pH of your soil. A little research showed that sea water is pH 8.0-8.4. My cucumber and tomatoes, which were at pH 4.5 to 5.2  went to pH 7+ minutes after applying. It was my second application and after figuring out what happened, I realized that it had happened after the first application. I have new soil for raised beds so am monitoring and testing every day. For weeks my pH was 7.0 in nearly every bed and I was confused since I had mixed different nutrition and pH for different beds. I watered a lot and waited to see if the pH would go back down. My logic was because I have a lot of peat in the mix which should have had an effect if I could wash the salt out. After my acid loving plants started to look bad I took drastic measures to lower the pH (vinegar for immediate action with bone meal for slower release). Of course, I added $20 cost to my soil amendment. After the pHs were all in their proper ranges, my garden zoomed back off. I thought, great! It is time to add the second application of SEA-90 and wham, in just a few minutes the pH was back up. I assume my vegetables have benefited from the SEA-90, and I will too since it is probably healthier food, but it has been a battle for me since we need more acid in our soil.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1YBQP5K6IT2L1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HXHH0II#wasThisHelpful","R1YBQP5K6IT2L1","A23SE77CDU60SE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23SE77CDU60SE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"My ""yard"" is almost 300 feet long and 200 feet wide. We generally use xeric methods but when we have dry periods or are trying to start new plants, we use irrigation. I have these hoses in series of 2 100's plus a 50' or 75' and never have any problems with them. They were emptied but stored outside last winter and were just great this spring. One of them got cut by a snow plow but I was able to repair it in a snap using the Gardena hose repair kit.

"Ah, being able to get water where you actually need it. I love these distributors. I have multiple raised beds in my vegetable garden and was having trouble with water distribution across the beds. I had the perennially present problem of a lot of water in the first bed and no water in the last. Using this products valves I have adjusted each hose so that the right amount of water goes to each bed. I can even keep some beds wetter and some dryer. My well has good water pressure so I am irrigating 7 beds at a time. At my bib I have an Orbit timer that has one timed outlet and one for ""regular use."" Below the timer I have a Gardena Y splitter (see Gardena 36938 Garden Hose Y-Valve With Quick Connector) with one 5/8 inch hose going to the center of each cluster of beds. That is the location of this four channel water distributor. From this distributor I have a 1/2"" hose running to each bed. I use the valves to control the amount of water into each bed. Because it is distributed by the device rather than gravity, water gets to all of the beds. As a side comment, the Y splitter gives me the same benefits. The left side of my garden has smaller beds than the right. I send 2/3 of the water to the right four channel distributor and 1/3 to the left.

"I like these pots immensely. Because of their shape I can get 3-5 more pots into a flat than I can round ones. Their plastic is very thin. Usually a pot this thin would be considered disposable but since I am growing seedlings for my own garden, I take care and they are not disposable. I assume they will make it two seasons. I have re-used many of them at this point and they are doing just great.

"I think more than I should about ""where my soil has been"". Consequently, I always wonder when I buy ""organic"" animal compost if the original animals were fed antibiotics. It is pretty easy for me to assume that a company who produces organic compost would not use GMO methods, it is still pretty common for animal producers to use antibiotics like ivermectin. I am grateful for antibiotics, their usefulness in treating illnesses is unmeasurable in my opinion.

"I was very excited to use these in my garden. I found that they are OK but not as exciting as I expected. Their diameter is somewhat stronger than the clip will bear weight-wise. I am training vegetables to grow vertically and these are too big in diameter for early season use when plants are smaller. They will fit stronger stems well but I am concerned that they will be too light-weight for crops if you have strong production.

"I have had several of these and they are all dependable. It is important to note with this particular 3 outlet model you have a timer on only two of the outlets. The third is for manual watering. There is a small lever on the left side that allows you to open the outlet and use it like a regular spigot. I like the feature a lot. The models that have timers on each spigot are baffling to use for a regular hose. I used to solve this problem by putting a Y splitter with shut off valves. What is nice about this one is that you don't end up with the spaghetti of valves and hoses just to get your garden hose to give you water on command. The down side is that you have a trio size with just two timers on it. If I needed two timers, I would definitely get this model over a two outlet timer.

When I am inside of the garden I can see that I am in a fence. Still, the view is nice.

"This story is set in 1676 immediately following King Phillip's War in which the Native Americans of what the English called New England nearly routed the English. While ultimately defeated, King Philip and his army of Native warriors nearly routed the English from the ""New World"". A key part of the story is a captivity narrative written by the character Prudence Cotton. I am married to an historian of this period and he was able to confirm for me the historical accuracy of the story. While the names are changed around, many of the descriptions of the places and encounters between the Native and English people are well described. The historical details are merged from the time frame up to the early 1700s, the book does give a good picture of the time and of the types of events and interactions that might have occurred within a ""Good"" Puritan family. I did not give the book five stars because, while well written, it is not as compelling written as it might be, for example, as compared to ""The Historian"" by Elizabeth Kostova. There are some similarities in one writing characteristic in that both authors select interesting words that are historically correct to the time of the book and not in current common use. Kostova's ability to weave the meaning of the words into the story exceeds Wallace's. Nonetheless, you won't be left wondering what the author meant by the word. All in all a good read but not a high-literature one.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1E8QM9SFHD3BV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00O4FK8D6#wasThisHelpful","R1E8QM9SFHD3BV","A23SE77CDU60SE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23SE77CDU60SE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you are looking for what I think of as a ""point and pick"" field guide, one where you match a photo to a plant, this is not it. However, if you already know or if you are willing to use the information in the book to learn some basic plant morphology (eg leaf shapes, types of roots, petals, etc.) then you can find your way though without truly getting lost. The book depends on the reader's knowledge of the plants to navigate to the correct family of plants and start to narrow down to the specific plant. There are many useful sketches and some photographs but not every entry has a sketch or photo.. It is not a professional-level guide but if you are not interested in taking time to learn about plants and how to use the book you might want to pick a different book. The reason that selected this book is because it includes trees and shrubs, not just flowers as so many books do. I find it is a good companion to the ""point and pick"" plant photo guides.

"I bought these because I needed a lot of 4 inch pots to transplant my seedlings sooner than I expected. This was available and was reasonably cheap. They have been satisfactory. They are middle-thick plastic, not flexible but also not a pot for long-term use. I expect I can use these for transplant pots for several seasons before they wear out. The reason I don't give them more stars is the number and size of the holes in the pot. On the one hand it is nice to have a lot of holes, and ones that go up the side of the pot, to allow water to penetrate from a drip pan below. However, they are also sufficiently large that the germination matter seeps out of the pot leaving a dirty mess on my seed trays. I can clean it up but when I look at the expensive dirt floating in my tray I cannot help but think ""That is enough to germinate more seeds in!""

"This is far nicer than I expected for the price. I was hesitant to order it expecting it would be wobbly and frail based on the price but based on the reviews I took a chance. I am glad I did. It was very easy to set up. Not possible to get things put in the wrong place as long as the poles lengths are sorted. There is only one type of brace and it can only go in one direction. There are three types of poles, short ones that go up, long ones that go across and arched ones that go on the top.  Each pair of braces gets three long poles horizontally and 4 short poles going up to the next level (shelf). The wire shelves have about a 60 degree bend on each side making it sit more securely on the shelf. It was sturdy for my seedlings could be strengthened, as one reviewer suggested, by using zip ties to secure the shelves to the braces. The plastic cover is sturdy. The zipper is well sewn and the ties to attach the plastic tent to the frame are long enough to tie without a struggle. I was able to put the entire shelf, with cover, together in under 15 minutes. My seedlings seem to be happier inside where the temperature has risen to 70 in just two hours from my chilly Springtime-in-the-Rockies 63 degrees house.

I like that they are large because I can just slip my foot in even if they are tied. They are not sturdy enough for serious winter wear. The sole is good but the upper fabric is very flexible offering very little support. When I pull the laces so tight the eyelets meet each other the boot is still loose around my ankle and lower leg. Typically boots are snug in that area on me.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2I1H524B6YX4I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00L898W7U#wasThisHelpful","R2I1H524B6YX4I","A23SE77CDU60SE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23SE77CDU60SE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Yes, Virginia, you can saw a straight line. I do a lot of DIY projects and rely heavily on a jigsaw. I had sadly come to the conclusion that I just could not cut a straight line and would always have to compensate for going off course in the last could of inches. When I got this saw I found that I could cut a straight line. With my old saw (a highly rated but less expensive one) as I neared the end of the cut the blade bent slightly and the cut curved. With the Makita saw the same pressure does not push the saw off course. I am in love with this saw. It has a variable speed adjustment that goes from full steam ahead to a stroke speed about the same as a fast hand saw. The blade sets well into the housing and it is impossible to get it wrong. It does require a tool to change but the tool is housed on the back of the saw. The clear plastic dust housing works very well. I did have to adjust my technique since you cannot see the saw blade itself with the housing down. The guide mark is very clear and I was successful in learning to use it rather than watching the blade. The case it comes in is extremely sturdy. It slips into narrow spaces and will sit upright on its own. I could not be happier although my sander is a bit sad since it is not always in use smoothing out that last couple of inches of bad cut.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2SBO2U97ELM7F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000XULXEO#wasThisHelpful","R2SBO2U97ELM7F","A23SE77CDU60SE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23SE77CDU60SE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I live in Montana and we have cold, snowy winters. It is hard to find a good pair of boots at a moderate price that are weatherproof and actually function as shoes. These boots are great. They are flexible enough that you can actually walk in them and they are thick and insulated enough to really make a difference in cold weather. The instep might be too high for some but I like the support. The height comes from how the boot wraps around the foot, not just the foot bed. My foot feels secure in the shoe. I don't worry if I step into snow whether or not my foot will wobble in the shoe. It won't. The ribbed tread is good. I would prefer a bit more depth and pattern but these seem to work well enough. I have not encountered the classic situation when the ground is slick and your foot slips sideways. In this tread it all runs one way so it might slip more easily than a different design. That said, I do like these boots very much and am really happy to have them.UPDATE: Used these in show shoes to deal with the aftermath of a 3 ft snowfall and my feet stayed warm and dry through several consecutive days of use. If there were 6 stars I would give them 6, the 6th for my toasty dry feet :-).","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2Q02212DJ1WES/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00I5G4ACK#wasThisHelpful","R2Q02212DJ1WES","A23SE77CDU60SE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23SE77CDU60SE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We purchased 8 packages of these at a local box store where they were seriously on sale. Every single package of them flickers. I thought I was seeing things but asked other people if they saw it, without prompting them, and most of the people could see the very slight flicker. It is much less obvious but akin to a florescent light when the bulb is not quite sitting right in the connecter. I really liked the design so I was very sad we could not use them where people were like around the Christmas tree. I saw that other reviewers comment on the same problem and that un-bunching them helped. If you have a lot of lights on the tree it is easy for them to get close together and then the flicker is present again. We ended up using them outside since taking them back was not an option. I liked very much the idea of white or colored lights as some in our family like white and others colored and we could change the color without having to change the tree lights.","1.0 out of 5 stars","December 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQNDZIDDBF4P0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00O15VL9O#wasThisHelpful","RQNDZIDDBF4P0","A23SE77CDU60SE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23SE77CDU60SE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is my third Lucid mattress. Between purchasing the first and second I bought a very expensive name mattress. I think it will wear better across time but it certainly is not 10 times better, even though it cost 10 times more. Knowing what I know now I think I would stick to these mattresses! The one thing that makes me a little crazy and seems typical to memory foam is that the cover and the sheets loose their taunt fit after a night or two due to the soft sided structure of the mattresses. Our Lucid mattresses seem a little more resilient. Given the price I cannot say enough good things about these mattresses.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1WNEGAJWF09VP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00478U79U#wasThisHelpful","R1WNEGAJWF09VP","A23SE77CDU60SE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23SE77CDU60SE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"After nearly a year of sometimes crippling pain and multiple shoe/orthotic combinations I am pain free. This is my third round with plantar fasciitis in the past 25 years so I understand that one product is not perfect for every person but I do like this one. It is different because the back of the orthotic is solid. At first I did not think I would like it but after wearing it a couple of days it and my feet got adjusted to each other and I like the almost solid support from just before the heel through the back of the orthotic. I used it for sports applications as indicated and was thrilled with not only the reduction of pain but at the healing that was taking place. I decided to use it in some of my other sturdier regular shoes and it has performed admirably there too. It is thick so my heels rise up out of less ""sturdy"" shoes and sometimes I have to pick a different shoe or use a different orthotic but this one is a lot more versatile than I expected. It is expensive but worth every penny to me. I am ordering a second pair since I have been carrying my one pair to every shoe I wear--from slippers to day shoes to hiking boots to mud boots.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2VKT8FA0NWEIN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000IRXI7C#wasThisHelpful","R2VKT8FA0NWEIN","A23SE77CDU60SE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23SE77CDU60SE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I put this in the cabinet by the stove that holds things like salt and oil and pan spray, etc. I love it there. It saves my rummaging around looking for things and it keeps me from knocking things over. I give it four rather than three stars since the tiers are a little shallower than I would like. It fits neatly in a 12 inch deep over counter cabinet leaving room for one more row in front of its three tiers. I presume that is why the tier depth is as it is. However, for me, I would like a little more depth to make it easier to grab stuff even if I lost the fourth row in the front.

"I discovered this tea a few years ago on a hiking trip to Scotland. The tea was bracing, delicious and always made a nice clear cup of tea. I brought some home with us and used it guardedly hoping not to run out. I was not sure what made it blended for ""Scottish water"" but enjoyed it as a reminder of our trips to Scotland. I discovered that it is especially blended for hard water. I was delighted to find that I could buy the tea on Amazon and also found that it is especially blended for hard water. We have exceedingly hard water from our well so it is perfect for us. If you like strong tea that develops robust tannins when steeped longer, this is one for you. If you like a lighter tea, you probably won't like it as much. I experimented with a shorter brewing time and it just does not develop the rich flavor of the stronger tea.

"I have used this topcoat and its 30 year ago predecessor on many pieces of furniture. Even though there are toxic issues to deal with, it simply outperforms any water-based product I have used. Compared to water-based products this is a snap to apply. I rag it on and wipe off the excess behind me. I don't have to worry about streaks, bubbles or any other problems common with top-coats. I recently finished almost a whole house full of used and unfinished furniture and used General Finishes products on almost all of it. I tried several other products available from box stores and one specialty store and was frustrated with imperfections to out right errors in my finishes. I sanded them all down and started over with General Finishes stains and this top coat and cannot be happier with the ease of use or the function of the product in use. I have a nice table in our kitchen that has about 10 coats on it.  No worries if someone deposits a jar of jam on it, a little soap and water on a sponge and it is as if nothing happened. Putting 10 coats on is really not that hard when all you have to do is wipe with one rag and follow behind with a clean cloth to take off the excess. It dries relatively fast, a few hours to a day depending on the weather so you can get 1 to 3 coats on in a day. Its viscosity makes it easy to move from the can to the wood since it does not slop or drip easily.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R8PN36TQZ6FV7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JI8Q7DE#wasThisHelpful","R8PN36TQZ6FV7","A23SE77CDU60SE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23SE77CDU60SE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"""Bird Dog, this is Bat-21!"" I remember having seen the movie that was based on this book in the 1980's and ran across this book while browsing here on Amazon and bought it. Glad I did.This is the story of the ordeal Iceal Hambleton, a Lt. Colonel in the USAF, who was navigator of an EB-66 electronic warfare aircraft shot down during the 1972 North Vietnam offensive. Hambleton, the lone survivor of his aircraft, parachuted into the midst of the NVA invasion of the south.The Air Force and Hambleton began a physical and mental battle with the NVA who they had a grudging respect for. For twelve days, the US military both kept the communist Vietnamese from capturing Hambleton and planned a method of getting Hambleton out. Men died in the attempt to rescue Hambleton as jets, prop-driven aircraft as well as helicopters were employed to fight to keep Hambleton from the clutches of the NVA and some were lost in the attempt.As a military history reader, I was impressed by the efficiency of USAF SAR (Search and Rescue) methods. ""Gravel"" was a weapon and technique I had never heard of. The use of ""Sandies"", jets, helicopters and small observation aircraft flown by FACs, or Forward Air Controllers, - even B-52s - all combined to keep the NVA back on their heels while Hambleton made his escape.As a reader of adventure stories, I enjoyed the blood-and-guts story from Hambleton's point-of-view as he endured thirst, hunger, exhaustion and fear  as he had to not only keep himself alive, but travel in the dead of night in an alien environment, surrounded by enemy territory and hundreds of enemy soldiers. All these enemy soldiers had but one task - capture him!This isn't a long book, but it's a good one! the author explains that he had to alter a number of aspects of the story because many of the USAF's techniques are still classified. But, the author weaves a fine tale while changing only the minimum. This is a five star book that I enjoyed immensely.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2JAC9OA9HQIIB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0553255886#wasThisHelpful","R2JAC9OA9HQIIB","A1LVHR5OO45L5V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LVHR5OO45L5V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These wipes are the acme of paper wipes. I have used them in the garage, the car, the truck, the tractor. They are supremely absorbent for a paper product.

At this point, I'd stick with shop towels from a cleaning service. I know these wipes are made from recycled materials, but a good shop towel will last years. I can see including these in a haz-mat spill kit or for similar applications because they are meant to be discarded.

"John McGrath gives us, in ""John Barry: An American Hero in the Age of Sail"", not only a biography, but insight into times and places long past. Anyone who loves a good story, well written will like this book.The author gives us a lot more than a biography. It begins in poverty in Ireland where evidence of John Barry's life is sketchy at best but gives us the spirit of the times and the circumstances that push a young man to the hard life on the sea. John Barry's life is well chronicled in this book including his public and private life, his battles in war and in peace, his struggles with wind and wave, profit and loss, surly crews, enemy ships and his own often ineffectual government.We are introduced to his world: his wives (one died young), his friends and business partners his relationships with his family and in-laws (some of whom were loyalists). He seemed to have a good relationship with Robert Morris, the ""financier of the Revolution"". The book shows the personal side of the man who captained merchantmen and ships of war and provides the reader with a complete view of the man.The meat of the action is his service during the American Revolution where the infant Continental Navy was overmatched by the Royal Navy. Barry showed himself a cunning captain and a fighter. Later in life, he learned to be a good administrator and business man. I liked this book not only for the biographical and military history aspects, but also for learning what life was like on the Philadelphia waterfront, what it took to learn the trade of the sailor and captain, what China and the China trade was like.This is a first-rate book about an American hero that may have been forgotten, but gets his due in this volume.

"I think this is a nice set. Whether ""his and hers"", parent and child or ???, it's a good set of electric toothbrushes.This is not a ""batteries not included"" product. they are not only included, but already installed - a nice touch. There's a replacement brush for each unit. The box says they should be replaced every three months so I think the two replacement brushes increase the value of this set. The brushes themselves are divided into two parts: a spinning brush at the end with a reciprocating brush directly behind it. This does a good job of getting in every nook and cranny.I admit I had to change my brushing technique. I used to brush aggressively with a regular toothbrush, pressing down hard and brushing fast in several different attitudes (horizontally, up-and-down and in a circular motion). This electric unit does the work for you. I had to slow down and let the brush linger on each tooth. The two-part brush head does the work for me. I also had to learn not to press down hard.I found the unit comfortable in the hand, easy to maneuver around in me mouth and easy to use. I did find the on-off switch difficult to engage without looking at it though.Did the ""Truly Radiant"" toothpaste give me a whiter smile in just five days? Sadly, no. In a week? Unfortunately, no. In a fortnight? Again, no. I have tried a number of different toothpastes that advertise whitening properties and none have every worked for me. I can report that we found the spinbrushes very effective, giving a good, efficient brushing and leaving our teeth as clean a feeling, if not more so, than any manual brush. It's a good set and I recommend it with four stars.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1JHD4T169GL78/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010XPSWGA#wasThisHelpful","R1JHD4T169GL78","A1LVHR5OO45L5V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LVHR5OO45L5V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have mixed feelings about this bathroom set. There are plusses and minuses to almost equal degree.Firstly, I like the color of the shower curtain. It replaced a mint green one and the prominent white and yellow combined with the blue-green really brightened up my bath. I really like the padded, blue-green mat. It's a micro fiber and really soaks up the water falling off one's form as one exits the shower. It's nicely padded and very soft on the feet. It has a rubberized bottom and holds water rather than it leaking through. In addition, it seems to dry quickly.Unfortunately, this set (that's the key word here - ""set"") does not come with the inner, water-proof curtain. I think if you're going to sell a set and you're going to swap out everything, you may as well start with a new waterproof, inner curtain too. I didn't like the hooks. They looked very light and flimsy. The wire they're made from is very thin. I could bend then with my fingers, for pete's sake!In short, I liked the colorful, bright curtain, the mat but didn't like the absence of a waterproof curtain and the flimsy, cheap hooks.

"This Amazon Basics Surge protector seems like a good unit that does what it's supposed to do - protect your electric gadgets from power surges.I originally thought the unit felt very lightweight and flimsy. Well, except for the cord - the power cord is thick and heavy-duty. I can tell you that it does what it's supposed to do because I had a power surge. I live in a rural area and the power is sometimes tricky - if a bird lands on a powerline wrong, I lose power! Well, a couple days after I got this, we had a power outage and, when the power came back on, there was a surge.The light is out, meaning the breaker tripped. There was no damage to the gadgets plugged into this surge protector. The only bad thing is that I have to get another surge protector! No, I wouldn't hesitate to get another one of these.

"Clockwork Synergy silicone bands are excellent. Period.Bought two silicone bands for a new watch. The new watch came with a very nice leather band, but leather absorbs sweat - bad consequences follow. Silicone is easy to clean with an alcohol wipe. Not only that, but these bands by Clockwork Synergy are very flexible and comfortable. Additionally, they come with quick-change pins already installed, making it easy to install or remove to give your watch another look.The only thing I didn't love is the shade of green. I would have preferred a darker green or camo (Clockwork Synergy, are you listening?) in the 24mm size band. Well, I knew what I was getting when I ordered it. The other band I bought?

"I have bought Purina chows for many years. As a boy, I remember Purina chows for cattle, sheep, barnyard fowl and the ""checkerboard square"" on the side of the coop silos. Though Purina Cat Chow Indoor formula has been the staple in this house, I thought I would try Purina Beyond Natural for the house felines.I really liked the switch from grains to more meat. Cats are predators and they eat meat. I looked at the ingredients and saw chicken meal, beef fat, and I also saw ""No corn, wheat or soy. No poultry by-product meal. No added artificial colors, flavors or preservatives."" I think this is a better product from the old checkerboard square, but how will the cats like it?The house kitties love it!

"In Adrian Coombs-Hoar's ""Eagles in the Dust"", the author sets himself the task of re-evaluating the battle of Adrianople and it's effects on the Roman Empire. This battle between Germanic Goths and the late Roman Empire has been compared to Cannae as a disaster to the eastern Roman Empire in terms of number of troops lost. But, was it really a disaster for the empire?The author does a good job of ""setting the stage"", explaining the situation in the Roman Empire divided into eastern and western halves and each ruled by it's own emperor. Coombs-Hoar does a good job of showing the fractious nature of the empire in that there were no rules for succession and differing claimants to the throne fought it out, weakening the army and their own state.Likewise, the author does a decent job of showing the forces pushing from the steppes of Eurasia in the form of Huns that pushed Germanic tribes like the Goths west until the ran into the border of the Roman Empire. Likewise, he covers the incursions by ""barbarians"" into the empire and finally the Goths led by Fritigern being allowed to settle within the empire. We also read of the cruel treatment of the Goths by corrupt Roman officials that sparked violence.Where the book falls absolutely flat is in analysis of the battle itself. The author spends one chapter on the battle and most of that is an analysis of the route Emperor took and how many hours it required. The few paragraphs he spends on the battle are simply insufficient for a book focusing on the battle and its effects. The fact that he gives the reader a chapter on his opinion on its long-term effects, a good chapter on Roman armor, weapons and equipment in the late empire period, and a chapter on ""what if's"" does not make up for the almost nonexistent look at the battle itself.This book is only average and I would not recommend it to those looking for insight into this pivotal battle.

"The very first thing I noticed about the Gladiator starter pack was the quality of the components. This Gladiator product is a starter set that can be added to as your needs grow - or just as it is if that's all you need. It's meant to be a system by which you can hang or store items on the wall, whether rakes, screws, axes, or ???I opened the box and pulled out the wall piece and the boxes containing the storage components: three big, heavy-duty hooks, two small hooks and one plastic bin. The hooks are all nicely powder-coated with the biggest hooks having a non-slip neoprene coating that is soft and will grip your tools so as not to slide. They are very well made and finished. They are also very strong with good welds that won't let you (or your tools) down.Installation: Easy! But...WARNING...have all your prep done and tools collected! The battery for my cordless drill needed to be charged and I needed a new battery for my stud finder! You will need: drill (cordless ones are handier, but an AC plug-in drill will do fine), a stud finder, a pencil, tape measure, level and an appropriate drill bit (I used a 3/32 bit).The easy-to-follow instructions say it'll take you about 15 minutes and that's about what it took me. I found the studs on the side wall of the garage with my stud-finder. I recommend one that will also detect AC wiring - you don't want to drill into one of those! Even a rookie can follow the simple directions and get this done in the allotted time (but, remember, don't rush).Now, I'd done something like this using 2x4's and various size hooks (I used bicycle hooks for the bigger tools) and it worked great. But, I have to admit that this Gladiator product looks better and is only a little more expensive when all is said and done compared to my home-made project.This Gladiator Starter Pack is a good product, whether you're buying it as a stand-alone unit or with additional units in mind for the future.

"The Jedi Council have decided on a course of action that was very un-Jedi - assassination. The Separatist war led by Count Dooku and General Grievous is causing so much death and misery that Mace Windu suggests a radical course of action - assign a Jedi master to kill Dooku in the hope the Separatist movement will collapse without their leader. Even stranger, they suggest this Jedi assassin team up with an unlikely partner.I will state at this point that I didn't really like the book. I think there were things that author Christie Golden did right like the action sequences, the tech, the vivid descriptions of differing worlds. But there were a number of things I really didn't like. Some of them were technical, while others involved the plot line.The author makes some technical errors that create a difficult read at times. Worst of all is the ""head hopping"" wherein the author goes from the inner thoughts of one character to the inner thoughts of another character without noting a change in perspective. This is sometimes done in the same paragraph with one sentence following another. Especially in the beginning, it makes it hard to understand exactly who's thinking what.I thought the author used too many ""parallels"" with the main Star Wars story line. I don't want to spoil things for someone who buys this book, but this story has aspects that are almost exactly like Episodes 1-6. I thought it was problematic from a number of angles such as if this happened before, shouldn't the Jedi been more aware of the possibility in another Jedi that could lead to disaster? I also thought - why couldn't the author think of something different than what we've already seen on screen?Probably the worst thing about the book is that is often felt more like a romance novel than anything else - something I really wasn't looking for and didn't want. Not only that, but I thought it was a poorly constructed one! The male character's responses are sometimes rather silly and seemed more like a star-struck teen than an experienced Jedi Master.In balance, I think most Star Wars fans will be disappointed to some degree with the ""parallels"" (and what they should have meant), the overt romance and the technical issues. Although I feel the author did some things right, she did some that didn't appeal to me at all and I can't give it more than three stars.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2IQ6GXNGGMMXY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0345511530#wasThisHelpful","R2IQ6GXNGGMMXY","A1LVHR5OO45L5V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LVHR5OO45L5V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These old Disney films are such treasures! They're exceptionally well written, directed and acted. The color of these films are vibrant and beautiful! Walt Disney always created family-friendly films that had an innocence that has since been lost.This film, Johnny Tremain, is one of Disney's tributes to the founding of the country in the American Revolution. It focuses on Boston in the years immediately before the ""shot heard round the world"" as it involved the fictional character of Johnny Tremain, an apprentice silversmith, caught up in the events of the outbreak of war.Johnny's story is the story of the outbreak of war for the sake of liberty - a concept that made a common man like Johnny the equal of the wealthy noble. James Otis, Sam Adams, Paul Revere and the other leading lights of the Boston ""Sons of Liberty"" make their appearances as Johnny's life parallels that of the rise of a new country founded on liberty and freedom. Events such as the Boston Tea Party and the Battles of Lexington and Concord are played out from the perspective of the young Bostonian.The film isn't like movies of today with their special effects and gritty realism. No, this is a highly stylized, patriotic, perhaps simplistic account of events in a story focusing on the common man. There is an innocence in this film I find refreshing. The British leaders themselves are shown as men of honor doing their duty, dreading bloodshed with the colonists even as the Patriot leaders are men of conviction, willing to sacrifice their very lives for freedom and liberty.I enjoyed this window to a simpler time when Americans loved their country and didn't look for reasons to fault it.

"The George Foreman GFO240S Indoor/Outdoor Electric Grill! It's as good as a charcoal or gas outdoor grill! Well, no, it really isn't.The George Foreman line of electric grills offers a quick, efficient way to cook various meats (I haven't tried fish, but I've tried the usual animals that walk on four legs and chicken) while being relatively (remember that word) easy to clean and drains excess fat away. It does not cook the meat using any kind of flame or charcoal and does not impart that delicious flavor that comes with traditional outdoor grills. If that's important to you, stop reading now. That does not mean you can't get good flavor, though.Looking at this unit, it comes unassembled. Not to worry, it is very easy to assemble with only two screws you will need a screwdriver for. That's it. On the negative side, it's not rock-steady when fully assembled on the pedestal - it's a just a little shaky. The large (240 sq. in.), ridged, heating surface is plenty big for lots of burgers, dogs, steaks, kabobs, fillets, etc. It's about the same size as the traditional size charcoal ""kettle"" grill. One of the things it does very well is even heating across the surface of the heating surface.I have a four-serving GF grill and use it mainly because I'm on an Atkins style diet, heavy in protein - which, for me translates as steaks, ham slices, chicken breasts, pork kabobs, burgers and dogs. The GR line of grills does a good job of cooking quickly and efficiently - even if it adds no taste to the meat. This product, unlike most of the smaller grills in the line, has only one heating surface - just like a ""real"" grill, so you need to turn the meat  over to cook both sides.While cooking, the excess fat will drain into a grease trap under the unit that is easy to reach and can be easily detached to empty. Since this product has a cover, moisture will condense on the underside of the cover. Unfortunately, it will then drip onto the ground (not necessarily a problem) or onto the countertop if used indoors without the pedestal (which IS a problem) and you will have a circular pool of water under the unit. I admit I was surprised by this.How does the food taste? Like cooking it in the oven, unfortunately. I used several marinades on the meat I grilled with the GFO240S. I used Allegro Hickory Smoke Marinade and A-1 NY Steakhouse Marinade I picked up at my local grocer. You may have a favorite or home-made marinade you use. Go for it! That's the key with a GF grill - be resourceful about imparting flavor in the absence of the smoky heat of the charcoal or gas grill.The aftermath: it cooked my top sirloin, flatiron and eye of round steaks as well as can be expected. I will warn you that the cooking surface is a little hotter than I expected based on my smaller GF grill. Lean toward less time per side when looking at the ranges specified on their generally-good cooking guide. For example, if the say 6-8 minutes per side for steaks (well done), lean toward the 6 minutes. It does impart the traditional black lines across the meat because of the ridged cooking surface (which also allows the liquified fat to drain away).Cleaning? Here's where that ""relatively"" comes in. The cooking surface has a non-stick coating which does make it easy to wipe off. Well, the problem is that you cannot immerse the cooking surface while washing it with mild detergent in warm water. For the smaller units that have twin heating surfaces that detach, they can be easily held in one hand above the sink while cleaning. No problem. This unit, however, it too big to be held easily or comfortable while cleaning. I felt like putting it up against a rock in the front yard and hosing it down!To be frank, you can make this work. If you don't want to mess with charcoal or gas or, to have for a backup in case it rains or for winter, this is an option as long as you do a little work to improve the flavor. But, for the most part, I didn't like this GF product that well. It does offer advantages but, the robustness of the unit, the water dripping from the cover, the cleaning problem and the lack of that ""real"" grill taste cause me to give this product three stars.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3D51J733U3GQU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OHRH3HA#wasThisHelpful","R3D51J733U3GQU","A1LVHR5OO45L5V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LVHR5OO45L5V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"How could you go wrong with a trio of Ford measuring tapes? These are pretty good measuring tapes that will give good service...well, two out of three isn't bad.In this package, you get a 26', a 16' and a 10' unit. They're shaped like tires and have a no-slip coating all the way around the edge - like a tire. The belt clips are sufficient, but nothing special. Each has a convenient thumb button to hold the tape in place and lock. In addition, it has a lock underneath the unit - as you draw the tape out from an edge, just push down on it and it holds the tape in place! Works pretty good actually. The tape itself has a nylon coating on it and gives it a matte, non-reflective finish. I thought this was great since many tape measures have a more glossy finish that will reflect sunlight and obscure your vision.I take a star off because I think the 10-footer should be thin and compact enough to fit in a pocket. It's really too big and wide to easily fit in my pocket and the small unit has no advantage over having one of the larger ones. What's up with that? Also, the button on the bottom of the 10-footerwon't engage because of the curve on the bottom of the case. Badly thought out. It's a solid unit, but detracts from it's usefulness by its overall size and poor design.So, you get two measuring tapes that are top-notch and one that is less so.

In this work, author Leonard Gutteridge lays out the story of Decatur's rise to fame and his early death on the ""field of honor"" in a pointless duel neither man wanted.The Author does a decent job of giving the reader the essentials of the life of the naval hero whose name graces many towns, townships and counties in the eastern US. The author gives us a matter-of-fact version of events. Strangely, he seems to focus more on mundane topics than on the battles and ""action"" if you will!The author spends a few pages on his naval battles whether against Barbary pirates or British ships during the War of 1812 as we Americans know it. I found myself wanting to read more about those very battles instead of the wrangling of egos that all-too-often overshadowed what mattered in the early US Navy. The author spends entire chapters on the angry letters that passed between Decatur and his killer, Barron.

"S.C. Gwynne has given us a wonderful story - all of it true. Gwynne gives us the story of a great commander who appeared out of nowhere to shine brightly indeed and then was suddenly gone. This is the story of ""Stonewall"" Jackson.The author writes wonderfully, giving us more than the dates, places, units and battles. The reader learns who this man was, how he lived, how he worshipped, how he loved, his sense of courage and duty. We learn about the poverty of his early life, his big break that sent him to West Point, his courage in combat in the war with Mexico as well as his life in the post-war army. We read about the instructor at VMI who was universally judged not only to be a failure as a teacher, but rather an oddball to boot!Jackson's life before the war and his meteoric rise to fame as a commander is well chronicled. All these things the author gives us. He also gives us a good idea of the man within. Jackson as the devout Christian, the loving husband, the tender and sentimental middle-aged man of his small town. The author does a fine job of setting up the reader for Jackson's appearance on the stage of war.The maneuvers, the marches, the feints as well as the battles are chronicled which shows the reader how Jackson could ""mystify, mislead and surprise"" his enemies. A battle was set up by maneuver and movement beforehand in order to put an enemy in the best position to be defeated. The Confederacy's disadvantages in this war were great as the agricultural South fought the more populous and industrial north. As a matter of fact, the author shows how the Confederate forces were poorly armed, equipped and supplied. Compared to the Union's soldiers, those wearing butternut brown or gray were hungry or ragged most of the time. That they performed as well as they did for as long as they did is tribute to their innate toughness.The reader will note the difference in command between North and South. The author's work makes it quite plain even to the novice that Lincoln's generals were often chosen by their political connections while those in the Confederacy were obviously more competent as warriors. I was struck by the fact that ""Billy Yank"" was usually as brave as ""Johnny Reb"", but often poorly led. I found it odd that, though the Union forces were more numerous and with better weapons and supplies, their commanders were usually more risk averse. On the other hand, Southern commanders such as Jackson were more daring, willing to risk great defeat to achieve great victory.Jackson was a commander who often led from the front, keeping close to the leading edge of battle. At Chancellorsville, Jackson met his end in the fading light in a crossfire between Union and Confederate forces. Here, at the high-tide of the Confederacy, Jackson fell. In one of history's ""what ifs"", men still conjecture on the course of the war is Jackson had not died.This is an excellent book that I cannot find even one criticism in. It is well researched, well written and is an enjoyable read on one of military history's towering figures. I heartily recommend this to Civil War, Military History, American history readers or readers of fine biographies.

"I typically wait a month to review a watch. That way, I have a longer term view and have a better chance of seeing the strengths and weaknesses of a watch. In the case of this Akribos XXIV chronograph, my experience has been mostly good.I'd had this watch on one of my Amazon wish lists for a while before the opportunity arose to get it. I was impressed by the styling of the watch but wondered about the quality. The styling itself is very attractive and this timepiece was obviously meant as a dress watch. The light silver dial is nicely contrasted with cobalt or ""blowtorch"" blue markers with hands a shade darker blue. The reflection of light off the markers especially sets this watch off. There is lume on both dial and hour and minute hands - not great lume, but about what you'd expect on a watch in this price range. The mineral glass crystal is clear and a gentle tap with my fingernail tells me it's not thin.The band is mesh steel - something I don't have on any other watch in my collection - and it is attractive. It is easily adjustable, much more than a bracelet that requires a trip to the jeweler in most instances. I don't baby my watches and wear even dress watches to work in a warehouse. I did replace the mesh band with a silicone band making it easier to clean it of dirt and sweat.The watch itself performed very well and was four seconds fast for the month - very good for a quartz watch. The hands all align and hit the markers squarely. The chrono functions work properly, reset properly and it's accurate. The watch performs well and does what it's supposed to do without problems. The water resistance is 30m. Remember, that's water ""resistance"" and 30m doesn't mean you can dive to a water depth of 30m wearing this. A 30m water resistance essentially means you are covered if you get caught out in a sudden rain or splash some water on it while doing dishes.Perfect? No. For some reason, the designers of this watch decided to have the date represented with a date window (at four o'clock) as well as a dial (at six o'clock). Why do you have two different ways of looking at the same thing? Do they work? Yes. Does this duplication interfere with the function of the watch? No. It's just weird. It's a wasted space that could have been used for a day-of-week dial or a 1/10th second dial. Again, it doesn't hurt anything, it's just a wasted opportunity to include another function.As always, one must consider price in any conversation of watches. At this price, the watch is a good value for the money. It is attractive, accurate and gives the wearer a stopwatch function all at a good price. Despite the date duplication issue, it's a good watch and a good value that I recommend to those looking for a value dress watch with four stars.Added 10/10/2015 - After having this watch a while, one of the things I like is the 30-minute chrono dial. Unlike others I have, the hand on this Akribos's clicks one minute at a time. It's never in between the minute markers. It's on one or another and makes the dial much easier to read - an important point since these subdials are by necessity small.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R17JFG5WDWQHLQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EVPRV4S#wasThisHelpful","R17JFG5WDWQHLQ","A1LVHR5OO45L5V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LVHR5OO45L5V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I keep buying these silicone bands for the watches in my collection and new purchases and they never let me down in terms of quality or functionality.Silicone bands are waterproof, soft and flexible - easy on the arm and don't absorb sweat. There are other makers including some that make striped and colored bands like this one. These from Clockwork Synergy are the best I have found to date and have purchased several over the last 6 months for existing watches in my collection. This band is destined for a new watch I'm purchasing from Amazon.The colors don't bleed. On another manufacturer's bands like this I've bought in the past, the colors tend to bleed so a white looks like a light gray and red looks a little darker when paired with a blue or black stripe. Not the case with these bands. The contrasting colors are bright and vivid. What you see on the Amazon product page is what you get. The hardware is nicely polished stainless steel and certainly not cheap.The band already comes with spring bars or pins installed. Not just any spring bars, they're quick change bars - no tools needed. As soon as you get the old spring bars off, these go on easily - meaning that you can change looks as frequently as you want. The bars themselves are built into the bands so they won't spring away from you while you're trying to take them off/put them on.If you look at the underside of the half that has the holes the buckle pin goes through, the holes aren't just straight through. On the underside, it also has the holes drilled at an angle so the buckle pin just slides right in. That's attention to detail!These are the best silicone bands I've found and I recommend them with five stars.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2VQOIW9H88K4L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GURURGY#wasThisHelpful","R2VQOIW9H88K4L","A1LVHR5OO45L5V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LVHR5OO45L5V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A world where blight is destroying crops and turning the human race into a starving species with no hope of survival doesn't see the miracle that brought ex-astronaut Cooper to a hidden NASA facility.The story itself begins as a quest by a threatened mankind to find another home to replace the dying Earth. Along the way, the explorers face obstacles of time, distance and human frailty. An interesting premise that, as far as I am concerned, fell flat in it's execution. There are people who ""get"" certain types of movies. I am not one who ""gets"" this type. If you liked ""2001: A Space Odyssey"", this may be right up your alley.

"I like the shirt. I like the design. The silk screening appears to be pretty good and should be long-lasting. That part, I like.But...the sizes are waaaaaaaaaay too small! I bought a size XL. I have been wearing XL shirts for a couple years and there is minor variation in shirt sizes. When I received the shirt, I tried it on immediately. Very tight around the middle. This is an XL..extra large! It's almost a tapered fit, for Pete's sake! I didn't return it for exchange because I had plans to go on a diet. I did and lost 15 lbs. Tried it on after that and still too tight!

"This LG G4 is one nice smartphone! It is very sophisticated, very fast, very good looking. There's only a couple things I don't like.I'm new to smartphones and I was surprised how easy this Android os machine was to set up. Basically, all I had to do is take my micro SIM card (if you have a non-smartphone like I had, you may have to go to an ATT retailer to get a new SIM chip) and put it into the slot in this phone. A lot of the setup is intuitive for the benefit of non-enthusiasts like myself. There's still a lot of sophistication for the more savvy user, though. I was able to set it up very easily. I set up my email (I use a gmail account) and social media such as Facebook in moments.The phone has a very nice, large display. The touch screen's sensitivity is just right (at least for me). You can set a number of interesting options - in my case, I choose to have the phone vibrate whenever I launch an app. You can change the volume or sound the results from your touch. As far as the app go, you get a good selefction of basic apps together with a number of ATT apps, including MyATT which I find useful. You have a couple different web browsers, email, calendar/planner, contacts, Google, Gmail, et al.The camera is very good (but not as good as my Canon Power Shot) and it does take better pictures than I expected. The phone has 32 Gig of storage. After taking away a chunk for the os and the apps, you have about 27-28 Gig for your use. Not enough? You can put a micro SD card in it to expand your storage.The power button is on the back, below the camera lenses, with the volume up above and volume down buttons below it. All other controls are on the touchscreen. It works well, is fast, has loads of storage for the average person. What don't I like about it? Well, nothing really. The one thing I don't like is common to all software and hardware today - no manual! Being from an earlier generation, I like to have a manual to read and find all the features. All you get is a little, folded pamphlet.In conclusion, this is a great phone that should serve one well. I recommend this phone with five stars.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3L90ERBAFFF1G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XMGSVKK#wasThisHelpful","R3L90ERBAFFF1G","A1LVHR5OO45L5V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LVHR5OO45L5V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I really like this George Foreman grill! If you want to grill some hamburgers or hot dogs, cook some steaks, kabobs or even a salmon or tuna steak, this will do the job. Not only will it do the job, but it will do it quickly and efficiently.The George Foreman grill (this is the 4-serving size) is essentially a top and bottom heating element covered by non-stick plates. You plug it in at which time a yellow preheat light comes on (the left hand light). Wait about 4-5 minutes and the right-hand light will come on and you are ready. You grasp the handle, lift it, place your meat on the bottom plate and close the cover back down again. There's no timer, so you have to keep track of the cook time. In the couple weeks I've had it, I've used it extensively as I'm on a modified Atkins diet with a lot of protein which translated into steaks, chops, burgers and fish that needed cooking.The guide that comes with it goes over unpacking, setting up, cleaning, cooking (and safety too). It gives you a pretty good idea of cooking times for various types of foods. I found it to be very accurate after a little experimentation - depending upon how you like your meat: rare, medium or well. It cooks meat very efficiently and gives it the classic burn lines we expect from a charcoal or gas grill. Do not expect you'll get the same taste though. Only fire will give you that smoky taste. But, it does a good job for what it is. The grill itself has a sliding hinge so it can accomodate very thick slices of meat. I have cooked inch-thick NY strip steaks with success using this grill.There are a couple things I didn't like, though. The non-stick plates which are held in place by clips and are easily removed cannot be immersed in water and must be washed with warm water. This means they have to be washed separately from your other dishes although you can put them in a dishwasher. The power cord is very short and I found I had to rearrange things on the countertops to accomodate this flaw.On the whole, this is a very good unit and has done everything I needed it to do. Despite some cleaning and power cord issues, I think it is a  very good indoor grill. I recommend this grill with four stars.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3K5IVCVAD8EVT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KDVJLJW#wasThisHelpful","R3K5IVCVAD8EVT","A1LVHR5OO45L5V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LVHR5OO45L5V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Fieseler Fi-156 ""Storch"" - Stork in English - was a German aircraft designed in the mid-1930's as an army liaison aircraft. It served everywhere the German army did and even soldiered on after WWII in the Spanish air force.The book itself is a pictorial and has many fine vintage photos of the Storch in action. You get to see the Storch in the snows of Russia, the deserts of North Africa and everywhere in between. There are some good shots of battle damaged and crashed aircraft as well as shots that give you an idea of the STOL capabilities of this aircraft. There are pictures with auxiliary fuel tanks and bomb racks - obviously only the lightest of bombs. There were fairly good (though not great) line drawings of the aircraft's basic frame, wing construction and canopy.Additionally, there is some good text about the competition to supply the army with this type of aircraft in which the Fieseler design won. There were several manufacturers that tried to win the contract including an autogyro. There's a little about the engine used and also the Storch in postwar use. It's a fairly good book with a lot of good photos, but there were some that were simply filler. So, there you have it. It's a pretty good, though short, pictorial at a reasonable price. I recommend with four stars.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RF3O3W4M2U2H7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=076430299X#wasThisHelpful","RF3O3W4M2U2H7","A1LVHR5OO45L5V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LVHR5OO45L5V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a nice, little hummingbird feeder. It has perches for four birds and holds a decent 16 ounces. It has a bee guard and you fill up the top with water - a feature called a ""moat"" - to keep ants out.I got it and it was easy to disassemble (to get the hook out of the bottom of the feeder) and will be  very easy to clean. As you can imagine, it's made of plastic, but seems very sturdy for all that. The bee guard is a good feature (dang, I hate those yellow jackets!) but it makes the hole deeper for the hummers to get to the nectar.

"This is a very nice, well-made and efficient nail clipper, The plastic body/holder is very comfortable to grasp and makes it much easier to hold and accurately cut the nails.

It's not the best, but it does work. It's made in Japan and seems well finished and works smoothly.The problem? It cost over twenty bucks!

"Gerhard Koop and Klaus-Peter Schmolke have given us a comprehensive record of the Deutschland-class warships of the German Navy before and during WWII. This is an exhaustive record of the German ""pocket battleships"" and covers almost everything.The good thing about this book is the plethora of data of every sort. I was surprised to read about the types of steel used in the armored belt and the rest of the ship - the carbon content, the nickel content, etc. The engines and electric generators are covered. The guns, primary armament, secondary armament, AAA guns, are discussed as well as the mounts. The radar, the range-finding equipment and other combat-related stuff is listed and discussed. The authors briefly give the reader the service life of these ships from construction to  destruction including prewar cruises, combat and even refits.The period photos, line drawings and sketches are numerous and excellent. There are pictures of the weapons, the spotter aircraft, every angle of the ships' exteriors as wel as good pictures of crew members in action and in their daily lives  working, relaxing and at mess. There are so many good things about this volume.The only bad thing about the book - and why it is a four-star instead of five-star book - is that the authors didn't really make it an enjoyable journey. The book is very much a reference work with no attempt to even make the war service of these ships sound interesting. It's a rewarding read, but a very dry one.

"There's very little I can say that hasn't been covered by other reviewers. But, I genuinely enjoyed this movie at a number of levels. It's a good basic story, good sci-fi and visually attractive. I found this prequel to the ""Aliens"" films worth my time.Archeologists Charlie Holloway and Elizabeth Shaw (played by Noomi Rapace and Logan Marshall-Green) see the same celestial representation in ancient representations all over the world - from those carved in stone in ancient Sumer and Egypt to cave paintings in the Scottish Highlands. All these representations hint at ancient visitation by extra-terrestrials. The two convince an aging industrialist to fund an expedition to the place these representations point to in the cosmos in order to find the origins of our species.The expedition includes an android (well played by Michael Fassbender) who, during the long voyage to the planet, becomes a skilled linguist in order to translate any written...or verbal communications they may find. The ship touches down and the team indeed does find a facility created by the ""engineers"" as the extra-terrestrials are called.There are several plot holes and acts that require one to suspend disbelief, but the story itself is about origins and the desire to find one's origins. The science part is reasonably believable and the plot takes a few very interesting twists. The film itself will shock, surprise and give one a shiver at times! The roles are well cast with the exception of one of the supporting characters and the cinematography is very good. I thought it was visually impressive.This is a good film in the ""Aliens"" series that I thought went beyond the usual horror-story-in-space and approached something higher, more sophisticated. I recommend this movie to those interested with four stars.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1GCGTB3Y91BXD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005LAIHXQ#wasThisHelpful","R1GCGTB3Y91BXD","A1LVHR5OO45L5V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LVHR5OO45L5V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I've owned this Tommy Hilfiger watch for a month now and I can tell you that it's a good watch. It's not an outstanding watch by any measure, but it's a good one.Firstly, I think the 42mm case width is an excellent size, fitting virtually any man. It's big enough to fit into the new ""big watch"" style currently in vogue yet not big enough to exclude smaller wristed men like myself. I think the case is very nicely polished on top surfaces while having a brushed finish on the sides. The white dial with the red-white-blue Tommy Hilfiger colors is very nice.The watch movement itself was 15 seconds fast for the month - only average for a quartz watch. The Amazon page doesn't mention the place of manufacture for the movement so that probably means China. The faux, numbered diver bezel does not move and is obviously there purely for ""decoration"" and tends to detract from the watch in my opinion. The second hand is in a nicely contrasting red but does not hit the markers - not even close. I have more expensive watches that don't and cheaper watches that do but, as a watch buyer, I always look for it.The 50 meter water resistance should be sufficient for this casual/dress watch if you get caught out in the rain or splash some water on it while doing dishes. I would not recommend immersing this watch - it's not a diver's watch. The band is certainly sufficient and is comfortable silicone with two keepers, but nothing special. I bought a Navy Blue/Red striped premium silicone band from Clockwork Synergy - 22mm Premium 2 Piece Ss Silicone Striped Navy Blue / Red Interchangeable Replacement Watch Band Strap which looks much nicer to my eyes.It's a good and good-looking watch that has only a few things pulling it down to four stars like an average movement and some poor styling elements.

"There aren't many books focusing on the military vehicles in the background such as the supply trucks, the artillery tractors, the cranes, ambulances, busses, etc. This book hits that spot perfectly for the WWII German Wehrmacht.This book is a pictorial, but don't let that fool you. There's a lot of good info here beginning with the organization of the commissary units of the German army. There are tables of equipment for supply columns of every sort. The book then moves on to the types of trucks employed by the German army. They used trucks by many manufacturers such as Krupp, Daimler Benz, Magirus, MAN, Opel, Ford,...there's even a section on captured vehicles used by the Wehrmacht!Each section, organized around the manufacturer, gives the basics of the trucks the company sold to the German army. The text and captions under each picture give the specs on engine, weight capacity, suspension etc. There are a lot of good photos of each type of truck including manufacturer pics, prewar photos and pictures from wartime. The ""Maultiers"" or mules are covered with their Carden-Lloyd suspensions.This is a good volume running 207 pages in all showing the trucks used by the Wehrmacht.

"Quest for Solomon's Mines was, unfortunately, anything but. This NOVA production tries to make as much as possible out of the mythical ""Solomon's mines"" and really doesn't do a very good job.The fact of the matter is that neither the Bible nor any other ancient chronicle mentions Solomon having ""mines"". This appears to be something invented for fictional stories. The DVD does a decent job of looking at Solomon's generally-accepted time period and does find some mines in Sinai that may have been worked at about this time. There is no evidence that the mines looked at in this video had any connection to King Solomon.The video does a creditable job of looking at ancient mining and metallurgy, talking about the early metals and alloys such as bronze that were important at that time. There was a little about mining of precious metals and the dangers thereof to ancient miners.I have purchased other NOVA productions and found them very interesting and enjoyable.

The size was right on for his age-size so I didn't have any fit problems with the shirt.The shirt itself was a standard-weight cotton tee. I looked it over pretty good and didn't see any bad seams of long threads hanging out. It seemed like a quality shirt with a well-applied graphic. As an aside, always turn these shirts inside-out when washing-drying. I thought this a good shirt for the price and I recommend it with five stars.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1TFHGSBHFB23H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00M9DJ3H2#wasThisHelpful","R1TFHGSBHFB23H","A1LVHR5OO45L5V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LVHR5OO45L5V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This Schiffer title, Krupp At War, highlights Krupp trucks used by the Wehrmacht during WWII. For those unfamiliar with Schiffer, they produce short, pictorials roughly the same size as an Osprey New Vanguard with more period photos and less text. They are usually affordably priced (under $10 most of the time).This book highlights the Krupp ""Protze"" (which means ""limber""), a 6x4 unarmored personnel carrier designed and built from the early 1930's on. These light trucks were utilized to tow light loads and weapons. It also was modified to carry a 20mm AAA gun. They were reasonably effective vehicles for the German army though they were no as effective off-road as a result of not having all-wheel-drive. This book also gives an account of other Krupp trucks used by the Germans.There is sufficient text to give the reader an idea of the suspension, engines, load and towing capacity as well as a brief life-cycle of the trucks involved. These are not in-depth treatments on any subject and only scratch the surface. However, these books are sometimes the only information available on subjects like this. There aren't many books on non-combat vehicles like trucks, unarmored half-tracks, motorcycles etc. and help to fill in gaps in your WWII library.This is a good little book for the price, remembering that it is only a pictorial overview of a subject. I recommend it to those interested with five stars.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R33SR5LCUU7QQT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0887403999#wasThisHelpful","R33SR5LCUU7QQT","A1LVHR5OO45L5V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LVHR5OO45L5V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Got this as a Christmas present for a nephew who likes to shoot his uncle's AK-47 (safely and under adult supervision). The tee is a standard-weight cotton t-shirt. It seemed of good quality with good seams, no errant threads. He's a teen so I bought an adult small size on the advice of his mother. Fit perfectly.The graphic of Mikhail Kalashnikov's design is silk-screened on and seems reasonably sharp and even.

"These are very nice Christmas crackers...as long as you understand all the prizes are nutcrackers! These seem to be very well made. They have all the usual items: a folded, paper crown, a little piece of paper with a joke or riddle and trivia, and a prize. These prizes are all miniature nutcracker ornaments. They seem to be of reasonably high quality and there are enough different styles that everyone has a different nutcracker. If you have more than six people, expect there to be some repeats.We've had Christmas crackers for many years now and these certainly rank with the best we've had.

"This Schiffer title, Arado AR196, is dedicated to the WWII German seaplane used on numerous fronts wherever the German navy was to be found.This book is only 47 pages and only intended to be a brief introduction to the subject. As a pictorial, it serves model makers and WWII aviation buffs. The photos themselves are quite good and offer both factory and military views of the aircraft though there are no color plates. It does include line drawings of the AR196 also.The photos give the reader very good views of the aircraft on the water, on ship and in the air. There are pics of the AR196 on the catapults of the Prinz Eugen and the Gneisenau. One can imagine that the Graf Spee used its AR196 to find victims for its guns! There are also pictures of the AR196 being refueled, maintained, with wings folded, on the catapult, being recovered with the German ""wake"" employed on their ships.This is a good, short pictorial with brief, but effective, text.

"The Perky-Pet 5151 is one big bird feeder! At twenty-three inches tall, this feeder holds plenty of your favorite type of feed - we use black oiler sunflower seeds.The feeder is very sturdy with the bottom feeder-unit and the top cap made of metal. The transparent tube is plastic, but seems thick enough to last quite a while. As you can imagine, it will hold a lot of feed! The only problem is that you will need something substantial to hang if from. A standard ""shepherd's hook"" won't do as the weight will pull it over. I found a steel hanger I could clamp onto the railing of my deck that is set at a 45 degree angle that's sturdy enough to handle the weight.How does it work? Very well as it will hold a lot of seed. There are enough perches for small or big birds. I can't tell you if the ""break away"" feature prevents squirrels from raiding it because I've never seen a squirrel on it.I can say that if you are looking for a sturdy, high-capacity bird feeder, you won't go wrong with this model.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R382MGI0KB26K5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PK3CU3M#wasThisHelpful","R382MGI0KB26K5","A1LVHR5OO45L5V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LVHR5OO45L5V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The ""teen in peril"" genre is a classic; I remember reading the old Lois Duncan books when I was growing up (Killing Mr. Griffin, I Know What You Did Last Summer).  Kelley Armstrong takes on that genre with a fantastic twist:  the bad guys aren't just on the outside.  They're inside as well.Specifically:  Riley Vasquez is a survivor of a terrible trauma - a few months ago the parents she was babysitting for were gunned down on their way out the door, and Rile survived by hiding under the bed with their daughter.  Now she is grappling with PTSD, anxiety, guilt, shame, depression - plus she's still dealing with the death of her cop father eighteen months ago.  She's a bit of a mess, and her mom hopes that the therapy weekend camp with Riley, six other troubled teens, and two counselors,  will make a difference.  The ""camp"" takes place in a huge abandoned warehouse in a bad neighborhood, which seems strange enough.  But just a few hours into the session, armed invaders storm the camp.  The kids are being taken hostage because one of them is the son of a very rich man.  Riley tries to comfort the other teens - she knows from her dad, in the vast majority of hostage situations, no one is harmed.  But things quickly go awry and soon Riley and one other teen, Max, are scrambling through the warehouse, locked in, trying to evade the bad guys and figure out an escape plan.Yes.  Max.  Max is the wild card, for Riley and the reader.  He's one of the other therapy kids - the only one Riley had met before the weekend - and he's got a serious, permanent problem.  I'm not going to say what it is. But suffice it to say, it's a problem that means the demons Max and Riley is facing in the hallways are in many ways not nearly as scary as the demons that Max is facing inside his own brain.This is a great, thrilling read.  As other reviewers have said, there's a lot of plot twists.  Nothing - and no one - is as it seems on the surface.  Many things that seem disconnected are, in fact, all tangled up together.  And through it all is the constant thread of tension driven by Max's nervous grip on reality.  It's a novel about trust - trust in others, and trust in yourself.  It's a novel about bravery - what it means, who has it.  And ultimately, it's a novel about the uncertain future that awaits us all, and how to find a way to have hope and faith when literally nothing is for sure.  I really liked this book.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R39TGI7NCMBE3N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385684754#wasThisHelpful","R39TGI7NCMBE3N","A25TT4IFNXUU2H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A25TT4IFNXUU2H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""The Rest Of Us Just Live Here"" is a story of four college seniors just trying to make it to graduation, four weeks away, without their family imploding - or their high school exploding.  Michael (Mikey), the narrator, is coping with a flare up of his anxiety disorder while watching his sister Melinda continue her fight against anorexia.  Their mom can't be bothered, as she plots a run for Congress, and their father would be a good guy if he were ever sober.  Henna is Melinda's best friend and Mikey's long time crush; Mikey wants to let her know how he feels about her, but the arrival of new kid Nathan is impinging on his game.  And then there's his best friend, the huge gay guy Jared, who has secrets of his own.  Like the fact that his grandmother was a goddess and cats worship him.Oh, and yes, there's also some sort of Ultimate Good vs. Evil battle going on, which is kind of par for the course for this small town, which, like Sunnyvale and Forks, seems to attract evil.  Mikey and his tribe aren't the ones who fight evil - those are the indie kids - they're the bystanders just trying to get through to graduation, and could you guys please not blow up the high school at prom?  (Early in the book, Mikey reflects on the time that the ""indie kids"" fell in love with all the vampires and then killed them.)It's a lot of plot, and it's a big compliment to Patrick Ness that he balances it so gracefully.  The Good vs. Evil battle is presented in the introduction of each chapter, with a brief description of all the Big Things Happening (""Kerouac discovers the Messenger lies to him; he dies, alone"") while the bulk of the chapter talks about what's going on with Mikey, Melinda, Henna and Jared.  It's a sweet conceit, and of course, as the book goes on, the two stories start to become more intwined.  The story that Mr. Ness is telling, of course, is that we're all heroes; and all our lives are important; and all the stakes are life and death.  No matter who we are or how we're described.Sometimes I thought the plot and setup was right on the verge of being too cute or convoluted.  And it's not territory that hasn't been explored before - the Buffyverse spent a lot of time on the ""real people"" and the notion that all lives are meaningful, and you don't need powers to be heroic.  But the characters here are so well drawn (even if they're archetypes, they work), and the writing so fun, that it all works.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2NJACI6IILN9N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062403168#wasThisHelpful","R2NJACI6IILN9N","A25TT4IFNXUU2H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A25TT4IFNXUU2H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In 1959, young couple Nat and Paul Collier move to Idaho Falls, where Paul, a military man, is going to serve as a caretaker of the CR-1 nuclear reactor.  It is the turn of the decade, and the beginning of a new era, but Nat and Paul - and the military families around them - are remnants of an old one.  Paul is assigned to the CR-1 reactor, and it becomes clear that this reactor is a metaphor symbol for Nat and Paul's marriage, and their broader community:  old, out of date, poorly tended, overlooked - and ready to explode.  We begin the novel with a flash forward to 1961, with the marriage in tatters and the reactor melting down; then quickly circle back to 1959, when Nat and Paul have first arrived, and begin the story of how this meltdown - marital and nuclear - came to be.I wasn't sure I was going to like this book. I have a bias against MFA graduates - they often seem to value pretty sentences over powerful stories - and I thought a detailed, fictional examination of a forgotten true story from 1961 might be a little slow.  Here's the news:  I was wrong, and happily so.  While the writing can be a little precious at times, for the most part, this is a great story that rockets along.  By page 15 I was hooked:  we had a great villain, a meaningful conflict, a sense of looming danger and dread, and a terrific, richly realized setting of small town military communities, right before the whole world imploded - figuratively and, if you were in Idaho Falls, literally.The story is told from alternating perspectives: Nat and Paul tell most of the story, but we also hear from Jeannie, the wife of the man tasked with supervising the reactor - the aforementioned villain of the piece.  Jeannie gives us the long-timers' view on life in this military community, where the wives and husbands all play very precise roles, with a carefully structured hierarchy;  Nat is the young wife who has an instinctive wish for a different way of life; and Paul the lifelong outsider who just wants stability, even as he finds the world around him crumbling.I guess it's not necessarily a subtle metaphor - the nuclear reactor melting down as the marriage does, and as the hierarchy does - but it works really well.  This was a great read.  It's not that there are huge plot twists, but more the sense of impending doom, while very well realized characters head towards disaster, and we can see it coming - but we can't make them get out of the way.  I really enjoyed reading it.  I will absolutely read whatever Ms. Brown writes next.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3INGON1DG1MKX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0812997743#wasThisHelpful","R3INGON1DG1MKX","A25TT4IFNXUU2H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A25TT4IFNXUU2H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I picked up this novel hoping it would be another Rosie Project - an offbeat rom com with a smart point of view.  And in many ways, it was.  Mr. Donovan can write and the book flows along, easy to read - which really is a compliment.  An easy read is hard to pull off.  The lead characters - Richard, an aspiring screenwriter so broke he's had to cancel his Netflix subscription, and Elizabeth, a young law associate who works so hard that her colleagues call her ""La Maquina"" - the machine.  Richard and Elizabeth have a contrived non-cute-meet when they are set up by a mysterious benefactor (or is he?) who, through an intermediary, offers them half a million dollars, each, if they will spend two hours together once a week for a full calendar year.  No more information, no apparent connection between the two.  Of course they accept the deal.  And of course complications ensue, both romantic and suspenseful.The extremely contrived nature of the setup was a bit much to swallow. Maybe there's a way to write a scenario like this and have it seem believable, but here, it wasn't.  The Rosie Project had a contrivance at its heart - but the contrivance was rooted in character.  Here, it feels artificial and as the story went along, and the contrivance took more of a role, the book felt less authentic to me.  I wish the author hadn't felt compelled to use it, and had been willing to trust his writing, his comic voice, and his ability to create good characters.  All of those things are present.I still give it four stars - I want to be generous to new writers, and Mr. Donovan can write.  The characters are funny and believable, and I wish we had been able to see them in a more authentic environment.  I'd read his next book.

"The ""literary historical fiction of the little-known side character"" is a new sub-genre all its own - in Aviator's Wife, about the wife of Ernest Hemingway, and the upcoming Swans of Fifth Avenue about the women who surrounded Truman Capote, and in Ms. Cullen's previous book about Edgar Allen Poe's wife, there's a lot of work about the women who lived in the background of the ""stars"" of history.  In this case, the story is of Isabel, Mark Twain's beloved - and eventually discarded - secretary.  The mystery that this book seeks to reveal is: what truly happened to cause the rift?  How did she go from being his closest confidant to the woman he was determined to destroy?  What did she do - or what did she know - that caused him to turn on her so viciously?It's a good mystery.  And there's a number of factors that make it a great topic for a novel.  Mark Twain has always been a fantastic character to write about - colorful, smart, funny, deeply complicated - and all of that comes through here.  Plus, the time that is written about in this novel, near the end of his life, is a little-known period of his life.  Writing about this time allows the writer to explore all kinds of things - the impact his fame has had on him, the impact his choices have had on him, and who he has become at the end of his life.  It's not always a pretty picture.  But it is absolutely compelling.  And Isabel is a worthy counterpoint:  a woman raised to be rich and cultured, who circumstances have forced into a life of service, she is smarter than you think, and more complicated herself.This is the story of how Isabel gets sucked into the late-in-life Samuel Clemens' life, what it does for her - and to her - and who she becomes in the face of adversity.  It's a terrific read, bringing to life a very specific time and place.  I don't want to give away the plot secrets, but it's a read well worth your time.  I haven't read Mrs. Poe but I will read it now.  Well done.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3SO3GHV573EJR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1476758964#wasThisHelpful","R3SO3GHV573EJR","A25TT4IFNXUU2H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A25TT4IFNXUU2H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Steven King has said that people love to read about work.  Melanie Benjamin takes us into the ""work"" of being a high society wife in Manhattan, an elusive ""swan"" in the 1950s: the capturing and catering of husbands, the curating of friendships, the cultivation of one's image and identity, the construction of beauty and style.  Of course, the story is told largely through the eyes of Truman Capote, the ultimate outsider turned insider turned exile.  Truman famously wormed his way into this ultimate elite club in the 1950s, gaining the trust and confidence of such elusive luminaries as William Paley (godfather of CBS), Lee Radziwill, Gloria Vanderbilt and - most of all - Babe Paley, Bill Paley's wife, the loveliest swan of all.  He learned their secrets, he studied their essence - and then he betrayed them all, writing a fabulously mean, gossipy tell-all piece in Esquire magazine.  When the story was published, one of its subjects famously killed herself; one died soon after; and none of them ever forgave or spoke to Truman again.Swans of Fifth Avenue is a behind-the-scenes look at this behind-the-scenes scandal; taking us from Truman's first arrival on the scene, as the original 'gay husband' to society wives, through to his pinnacle of success with the publication of In Cold Blood and his famous Black-and-White ball; and then on to his downfall and destruction.When the book began I thought ""Oh, this is going to be WONDERFUL.""  Ms. Benjamin does a terrific job setting the scene, introducing the swans and Truman, and establishing a juicy, elevated world that you know is destined to fall.  This is a fantastic idea for a novel, with great characters, and it is very well realized.  However, I do feel that in the end, it tries to do too much - and maybe falls a bit short.  The biggest problem might be the scope:  the story is told from alternating points of view; all the different swans, Truman, Bill Paley.  There is so much gossip, so much backstory, so much going on, and after a while, it starts to feel a little bit like we're just on the surface of it all.  I found myself looking forward to finishing the book so I could go online and research what really happened with each of the characters.  Which is a testament to how great the story is, but also that somehow, in the execution, it's just a bit lacking.  I didn't think that Ms. Benjamin had deep insight into any of the characters - we keep darting around from one to the next - and Truman himself, who could have run the show, keeps vanishing at different points.  It's like she didn't know what story she was telling, so she tried to tell all of them; and in so doing, maybe, didn't give them quite the justice they deserved.In the end, this lack of focus and depth kept it from being a great novel for me.  But for anyone who has a passing interest in Manhattan society, Truman Capote, and delicious scandals and gossip, this is a worthy, fun read.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R34Q5JCXJIQPSF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0345528697#wasThisHelpful","R34Q5JCXJIQPSF","A25TT4IFNXUU2H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A25TT4IFNXUU2H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Dominic looks like an ordinary man - a prosecutor, musician, and transplanted Englishman living in Texas.  But he's hollow inside - a man without a conscience or a soul, a man looking for an opportunity to test his own boundaries and see if they even exist.  When a friend tells him about a way to commit the ""perfect crime"", Dominic takes him up on it - and naturally, things go awry.  The story of the novel is about two mysteries:  will Dominic get away with it?  And how hollow is he, really?  Is there any soul in there at all?Other reviews have noted that there are no likable characters in the book; some are bothered by that, others not.  I always find it interesting - sometimes I can't stand a book with no one to root for; other times (as with Gone Girl) it works fine for me.  In this case, I didn't find it too problematic, because the book wasn't asking us to root for Dominic.  We were meant to see, from the inside, what psychopathy (or sociopathy) looks like and feels like.  And on that front, it did a really good job.  I felt like I was living inside a hollow man.  That's a tricky thing to pull off; how can you feel emotions for a character who feels none himself? If so much of why we read is to feel something, then how can we feel something for a character who doesn't?  I guess in some ways an exploration of emptiness is, itself, an emotional experience.  I enjoyed the book.  It did leave me feeling a little hollow, but maybe that was the point.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2UQS5K39STXKU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1633880869#wasThisHelpful","R2UQS5K39STXKU","A25TT4IFNXUU2H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A25TT4IFNXUU2H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Jerry Grey, a famous writer of murder mysteries under a pseudonym, has Alzheimer's and periodically thinks he is a serial killer. As his mind shuffles in and out of lucidity, neither he nor the reader knows what he has imagined and what he has really done. Is Jerry telling the truth? Or lying? What is real and what is a story he made up? Why does he never see his wife, who he loves so much? And if it's all his imagination, why is he carrying an earring matching the one of a girl who was killed?The fun of this book is imagining Stephen King as a killer, since Jerry Grey feels very much like Stephen King, and even sounds a bit like him. We don't know when Jerry is telling the truth, and we're not sure when he knows either.  It's a fun thriller; the Alzheimer's twist goes right to the edge of being annoying, as Jerry constantly slides in and out of sanity, but ultimately Mr. Cleave pulls it off.

"I had a really hard time getting into this book.  It has an opening that didn't work for me:  the aftermath of Caroline Jacobs having said the f-word to one of the other moms at a PTO meeting.  The room is reeling in shock from her having used such language, and the first chapter is reliving what led up to this horrible event, who said what and how finally Caroline erupted in rage, and now life as she knows it is completely undone.  This is the catalyst for the entire book - leading her on a quest of self discovery back to her childhood -  and it just didn't work for me. I myself haven't yelled the f-word in a meeting, but I've been in any number of meetings when other people did, or when people got emotional or lost their tempers (including me!), in meetings with much higher stakes than basically a bake sale brainstorm, and as the catalyst for a narrative, this just didn't work for me.  So I kept reading the beginning, saying ""who cares?"" and then putting it down.But...since I had promised to review the book, I forced myself to keep reading.  And there are good things in the rest of the book.  It's well written, the mother/daughter relationship between Caroline and her daughter is interesting, and her journey back to childhood to figure out why she is so meek and mild gets interesting as it goes.  Ultimately, the story is a bit deeper than the f-word outburst.  But there is also a bit of ""much ado about nothing"" - I don't get why saying the f-word in a PTO meeting is such a big deal, or why her bullying experience in adolescence is so traumatic (we've all been there in our own way).  It's a fun, light read, but it didn't do more than that for me.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1I52M34QE0Q1S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250006309#wasThisHelpful","R1I52M34QE0Q1S","A25TT4IFNXUU2H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A25TT4IFNXUU2H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Rowena's life is indeed at is end... but the killing spree still has a ways to go.  Minutes later, the Cooper family is down to one living member - and as Nell flees from a killer through a vacant wood, I found myself putting the book facedown to catch my breath, and I was only mere pages in.This experience repeated itself throughout the novel:  I was desperate to know what would happen next, the tension was constant and unbearable, but I found myself constantly putting the book down so I could calm down.  Not since The Hunger Games have I read a book that moved so fast, with no break in the action at all.  The book starts out at a sprint and does not slow for 400 pages.  I finished it in less than a day, in just three sittings.The author does a great job setting up characters that we care about, putting them in peril, and constantly tightening the screws.  In addition to Nell racing through the woods, he introduces Chelsea, an English ex-pat who walks past an RV at just the wrong time and finds herself re-enacting Silence of the Lambs; Valerie, the cop who has lost her lover and nearly lost her mind pursuing these serial killers, and who finds herself falling apart just as the pieces of the case start to come together; and a hermit widower, a famous author grieving his wife who suddenly finds himself the only thing standing between Nell and an untimely death.  The story ricochets between these arcs and others, and it's a testament to the strength of the novel that no matter what character you're following, you're completely invested in their story.My only criticism of the book is the ending - the last 50 pages tip over from intense action to near-parody, as different characters get shot, rally, think they're about to die, rally again, crash in helicopters, get shot once more, rise up from the snow, etc.  It almost feels like an SNL parody ending, which is a bit of a shame - but ultimately, while it made the ending less effective, it didn't detract from my overall enjoyment of the book.I will make one other P.S. statement.  This is my first time reading this author (who is being published as a debut author under a pseudonym, an interesting marketing strategy to make an old mid-list writer seem new), and whenever I read an author for the first time, I am a bit nervous - can I trust them?  Are they making me fall in love with characters only so they can kill them all and make some point about how irredeemable life is, or the triumph of evil over good?  This author does kill characters we love.  But I didn't get a sense of darkness or despond from this book.  That's important to me - life doesn't always have a happy ending, but I can't stand authors whose life philosophy is despairing or hopeless.  If you happen to share that viewpoint, then at least in my opinion, this book is still safe to read.  Just make sure that you have set aside enough time once you get sucked in!","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1EHKD265EMDVA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250057345#wasThisHelpful","R1EHKD265EMDVA","A25TT4IFNXUU2H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A25TT4IFNXUU2H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Sophie was barely out of her teens when she started feeling off - run down, achy, with night sweats.  One doctor after another couldn't figure out what was wrong, but everyone was stunned when she was finally diagnosed: a rare cancer that had spread extensively throughout her body.  The survival statistics were grim and suddenly Sophie was looking at more than a year of chemo, extended hospital stays, and a life that seemed to be shutting down just as it was starting to open up.Of course, Sophie survived her disease.  This book was written ten years after the diagnosis, drawn from a combination of the journal she kept at the time, and her reflections now, years later.  I find it a bit difficult to review a book like this, because how can you give a negative review to a young woman's bravery under incredibly difficult circumstances?  So let me be clear, I 'm not reviewing Sophie as a person.  She seems delightful and strong.  And she's a decent writer, also; the book flowed along.But... it didn't really resonate for me.  There are a number of ""I survived my illness"" memoirs on the market, and all writers have to find a way to make theirs stand out.  The angle here is the wigs that Sophie chose:  when she was feeling sickly and weak, she discovered that putting on different wigs gave her different kinds of courage.  One wig made her bold, one was practical, one encouraged her to dance, one made her feel like a sex kitten, etc.  It's a nice idea.  And I like the concept that you can ""put on"" courage when you need it most.  But - that's sort of a good essay; it doesn't really hold up as the frame for an entire book.  And I guess that's my criticism overall.  It feels like a good essay that was fluffed out to manuscript length; literally, especially in the second half of the book, we're just reading pages and pages of journal entries that don't do much more than record ""here's something that happened today and here's how I felt about it.""  By the second half of the book there were no new insights and no new developments, plot-wise.Thankfully and mercifully, Sophie's treatment was successful and without incident - this is a blessing for Sophie as a person, but it removes some story elements from the book.  Late in the book, she introduces a new character - a woman with a terminal diagnosis, who knows from the beginning that she will not survive the disease - and it's possible that this could have been an interesting arc, as Sophie moves towards life and another woman moves away; but this character comes in so late and has such a brief stay, that it feels like another way to make the book longer, as opposed to a meaningful story.  By the end, I was quickly shuffling through pages, as my interest had waned.So - I like Sophie.  I admire her courage and her humor, and she can write well.  But as a work of memoir, this did not resonate as well for me.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R10S4CD93OON5O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250052238#wasThisHelpful","R10S4CD93OON5O","A25TT4IFNXUU2H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A25TT4IFNXUU2H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"On her second night of college, Aspen Matis - a girl so sheltered that her mother literally dressed her every day of her life - was raped by a boy she had just met.  Because she invited him to ""spend the night"" after the rape (the sort of confused reaction that is more understood now than it was then), the college didn't acknowledge the rape.  Not only did they dismiss her claim, but they even moved her rapist into the dorm with her, forcing her to abscond to living in a hotel room that ended up being flooded by sewer waste.  No small surprise that a traumatized Aspen (then known as Debby) decided to flee school.  Always having loved to hike, the writer decides to cover the entire Pacific Coast Trail, from Mexico to Alaska, in hopes of reclaiming her sense of self, and perhaps finding an autonomy and courage that had always eluded her.I am a bit of a junkie for true-life adventure stories, I've read scores of them, from self-published ebooks to the high profile bestsellers, and Girl in the Woods is a solid addition to the field.  While the story itself is not particularly unique (girl has trauma and loses self, girl walks trail, girl finds herself and a husband to boot), Ms. Matis has a natural, easy style to her writing that makes the pages (and the miles) fly past.  I read the first half of the book in one sitting - after picking it up just to look at the first few pages - and finished the whole thing within a day.She brings to life so many aspects of thru-hiking:  the other thru-hikers who become your tribe (whether you like them or not), how you get accustomed to stepping over rattlesnakes as if they were sticks, surviving on parmesan cheese and chocolate frosting from a can, and the glorious experience of ""trail angels"" - such as the locals who left a recliner,  jugs of water and piles of fruit by the trail, for tired hikers to take a break.  You experience the stress of drinking water in which a dead mouse was floating (and drinking it slowly, as if that will make you less likely to get sick), and copying by hand the xeroxed ""water report"" that tells you exactly how to find water in a world that's going dry.  It's a great read.Unlike another reviewer, I did not find Ms. Matis unlikable - I found her deeply human, a young sheltered girl who keeps making mistakes, but in that way, she's like all of us.  And I appreciate her courage to tell the truth, even when she's being foolish.I do wish that the book was a little bit more about her finding her own independence, instead of using the trail to discover that boys do like her, and boys can be good, and here's a boy to marry!  But that's asking her to write a different story, not her own, which is unfair.Bottom line - if you like to read these kinds of books (and who doesn't?), then Girl in the Woods is a good choice.  Enjoy!","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3OUTX2339KHE0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062291068#wasThisHelpful","R3OUTX2339KHE0","A25TT4IFNXUU2H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A25TT4IFNXUU2H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book was sheer fun to read.  I'm a fan of the ""behind the scenes"" novel - the books that go deep into a specific world.  These novels all follow a basic archetype: young person enters a high-stakes arena, learns the ropes, learns the cost of success, and emerges sadder but wiser.  There's been a number of good ones in recent years, in the worlds of  fashion (Devil Wears Prada), finance (Bond Girl), law (Partner Track), political journalism (The List).  It's a great, modern hero's journey archetype, and when it's done well, it's so much fun to read.Well, The Underwriting is done well.  There are some ways in which it follows the template to the letter:  it covers the incredibly high-stakes world of banking, specifically, the process of preparing an IPO for an internet startup.  The frame of the novel is a new location-based dating app, Hook, sort of Facebook meets Match.com, but entirely focused on ""hooking up"" and finding a sex partner, and Hook's path towards going public and possibly making a whole bunch of people a TREMENDOUS amount of money. If you want the bottom line, just know this:  it's a fantastic book, so much fun to read, not high literature, but filled with great characters (heroes and villains), fun plot twists, written with an ease and a snap that makes it fly by, and a (mostly) satisfying conclusion.  That's all you need to know!!  But if you want more perspective, I have a few more things to say...The Underwriting takes on the worlds of Manhattan and Silicon Valley, both old school traditional banking and internet startups.  We go behind the scenes into both of those universes; one of the biggest departures of The Underwriting, though, is instead of telling the story of one hero, The Underwriting takes on a whole cast of characters, with rotating POVs.  So we're not following one hero's journey, we're following more like five or six - and they're not all heroes.  Some of them are decidedly villainous, but what's so lovely, is that they all THINK they're heroes.  We've got Todd, the aspiring Master of The Universe who thinks he has the world on a string and is heading up the new venture deal; Tara, the young woman on the rise, who's working like hell to meet impossible standards but starting to think she might be doing it wrong; Nick, the wannabe who's never been quite good enough but having latched onto Hook, might finally have found the right rocket to ride; Juan, the programmer with a conscience who is stunned to realize he might be set up for riches now; Beau, the son of Big Money, who seems to be just along for the ride; Amanda, the paralegal who might be underestimated by everyone, including herself; Callum, the British high financier who might have a soul somewhere inside him; and on and on.  None of these characters are hugely deep or profound, but they are all a step above two dimensional.  As the book goes on, all that matters is this:  you find yourself rooting for the good guys and rooting against the bad guys.  And Ms. Miller does a great job of stringing you along.Oh, and did I mention, there's also a murder in the middle of this?The ""Hook"" dating app on which the entire plot is built is a great MacGuffin too - a location based dating app that essentially is all about letting you find the closest possible sex partner.  It's skeevy and sleazy and yes, someone ends up dead early on in the novel - possibly related to Hook.  And possibly related to some of the people who work at Hook. So mixed in with all the questions of how the IPO plays out, and the corporate intrigue, is the investigation of the young woman who was killed, and the gradual revelation that it might have something to do with Hook itself.This isn't great literature, sure.  But it's a great read.  My only complaint is an unnecessary extra twist at the end that was meant to be a shocking conclusion, but came across like playing games.  Other than that - so much fun, a great summer read, and I will definitely read Ms. Miller's next book.  Congrats!","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/REVCNRQJU0L1W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0399174850#wasThisHelpful","REVCNRQJU0L1W","A25TT4IFNXUU2H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A25TT4IFNXUU2H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My husband and I started getting back into backpacking a few years ago, and we've been using old gear.  When I had the opportunity to try a new, updated backpack I jumped at it - and will never go back.  This pack was incredible.  It makes me want to go backpacking more often!As others have said, one of my favorite features is the pockets.  I am constantly losing things in my purse, forget a huge backpack, and being able to assign different items to their own compartment, and know I can always find them there, is a huge timesaver.  I'm just over 5'6 and had no issues with fit at all; the waist strap sat perfectly with just a little bit of work and the shoulder straps as well.  I haven't taken this on a multi-day backpacking trip yet, but have used it for hiking and traveling, and it's worked perfectly.It's less heavy, and less rigid, than our old backpacks.  It's possible that for a multi-day hike (like an Outward Bound style trip) that it might not be quite rugged enough.  But on the upside, it is SO much more comfortable, that I'm almost tempted to take it on regular travel, as an alternative to a second suitcase or carryon. It's a little bit like a Goldilocks pack - it's bigger than a daypack, lighter/smaller than an expedition pack, but for regular hiking and traveling, I would say it's just right.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R39CZE08TGNQY0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NFCF2F8#wasThisHelpful","R39CZE08TGNQY0","A25TT4IFNXUU2H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A25TT4IFNXUU2H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Dr. Grace Blades, the survivor of a devastating murder/suicide that killed both parents and led to a long cycle of foster homes, has channeled her horrific past into a productive life as a respected psychologist with a unique gift for helping people overcome traumatic experiences.  But beneath her healthy surface, she is still grappling with demons - the compulsion to put herself in dangerous situations, often with unknown men.  She thinks she has things mostly under control, until one morning a new patient comes into her office - and they both realize that he is the same man she had dangerous sex with the night before.  This is unsettling enough, and becomes even more so when that same man turns up dead the next day, and the police come to Grace, looking for answers.  And as Grace herself begins to investigate, she comes to realize that this man might not be the stranger she thought he was... that in fact, she might have met him for the first time a very long time ago, under very different circumstances than these.This is a nifty setup for a novel, and let me say, there is one thing about this book that is absolutely stellar: Grace herself.  She is one of my favorite characters in a very long time.  The story of her past, which unfolds in alternating chapters with the story of her present, is absolutely compelling.  You root for the young girl who is so terribly abused, who has to figure out how to build a life - and a self - with very little help from anyone else.  When Grace finally begins to find a bit of home, piece by piece, it is so incredibly moving.  Even more so because there's not a traditional happy ending at any point along the way; just a series of small victories and setbacks, hard work and fateful blessings, that are just incredibly moving.  I was riveted to the story of Grace's past, what happened to her and how she got to where she is when the book begins.The part of the book that worked slightly less well for me was the present day mystery/thriller.  The opening paragraph describes the setup, and it's a doozy.  Halfway through the book I would have given it five stars, no question.  But it got a bit bogged down in the present day story.  While the alternating chapters that deal with Grace's past are wonderful all the way through, the chapters that deal with the current mystery fell a bit short for me.  There is one nice reveal, but it's revealed early, and after that, there is very little plot development in the present day.  Grace literally drives around doing little things, and it almost feels like the present day story is biding time waiting for the more interesting backstory to play out.  I found myself starting to skim the present day chapters, getting a bit impatient; but the ""who Grace is and how she got here"" story is riveting all the way through.Bottom line, I definitely recommend this book.  I loved Grace, and rooted for her, and loved hearing her story.  The one downside is it got a bit sluggish about halfway through, in the present day chapters - but that being said, still very worth reading.  I'd read more Grace stories in a heartbeat.(P.S.  I also appreciated that this was a standalone.  I used to like the Alex Delaware novels, but fell behind a long time ago.  It was nice to be able to read something fresh from this author, who I've always enjoyed.)","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3CPBX665GV9FX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0345545311#wasThisHelpful","R3CPBX665GV9FX","A25TT4IFNXUU2H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A25TT4IFNXUU2H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I suspect that more people know the backstory of this manuscript than know about the actual story inside the pages.  The backstory:  book sells for $2 million after an intense auction featuring most of NYC's publishing elite; editors from around the industry describe it as the best thing they've read in years; the author describes it as his attempt to create a novel version of an HBO boxed set; this is the book that is the epitome of the best publishing has to offer.MAN I have been looking forward to reading this since 2013, when the auction was held.  I am such a sucker for big epic novels. I literally shrieked with excitement when I got hold of the manuscript.But...Look, in terms of the book itself, comparisons have been made to DeLillo and Pynchon and David Foster Wallace, and granted, I don't love any of those guys - so maybe this book was not for me right from the start.  And Mr. Hallberg can definitely write.  He has a way of creating a scene where you feel like you are actually right there, almost living it alongside the characters. The ""HBO Box Set"" comparison is apt.  He creates a very precise world of New York City in the 1970s that is so tangible you feel like you're watching it on TV, or in a movie theater, not reading it on a page.  It's seriously impressive.But....In many ways, this book is written like a checklist of ""how to appeal to the stereotypical publishing literary elite.""  It takes place in the 70s. There are rich people who reject their wealth and feel disenfranchised.  There are poor people scraggling for their place in the world.  There are older men having affairs with teenage girls.  There are obscure (fictitious) punk rock bands.  And drugs.  Many drugs.  Most important, everyone takes themselves VERY VERY seriously.  I don't think anyone in this book has a sense of humor.  It all feels like a book written for editors, and for publishing houses, not for readers.  There's craft here, but there's not much passion, or joy.  (I don't mean joy as in Pollyanna happiness.  I mean the sense of joy you get whenever you read a great story that the author is telling with energy and skill.)  And with each page that turned, my heart sank, a little bit.It's one thing to know the backstory of the book - the sale at auction, the huge advance, the industry buzz.  It's another thing to be more than 100 pages into the book and still more interested in how this book was published than in the story itself.  And no matter how long I read, I just couldn't get invested.  It all felt constructed, and forced.  I didn't care about the characters.  I wasn't interested in the story.  I found myself making up excuses to read something else, instead of getting back to this.It was a big disappointment.  I was almost disappointed in myself, for not loving it.  But I finally had to admit, 200 pages in, I just didn't want to keep going.  Like I said, I'm not a fan of DeLillo or Pynchon or David Foster Wallace's fiction (love his essays).  So I might not be the target audience.  And if you love those guys, then give this one a try.  But for me, the story inside the pages was never as good as the backstory, and I finally let it go.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2UN25S3YFR4K7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385353774#wasThisHelpful","R2UN25S3YFR4K7","A25TT4IFNXUU2H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A25TT4IFNXUU2H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There is something really lovable about this book.  Of course, it could be the story - a story so filled with American archetypes that it's hard to believe it's not made up.  It's almost a roster of the classic American narrative, all packaged into one neat story.1.  Rising Up By Your Bootstraps/Triumph of The Underdog.  Jesse Brown is an African American sharecropper's son who grows up tending to his younger brothers, clearing the swimming hole of snakes so they can cool down after a day in the fields, and reading books to better himself.  Through his mother's love and ""devotion"", he lifts himself to become the first African American carrier pilot, fighting for his country.2.  Bravery and Righteousness.  As if we don't know that Tom Hudner is a good guy, he is introduced in the first scene defending the honor of an overweight boy being picked on by bullies; Tom stands up to the bullies when all his friends are too scared, and when the bully backs down to shake his hand, Tom learns an Important Lesson about being willing to help others.  A lesson that (spoiler alert!) will come in handy when Jesse is shot down behind enemy lines.3.  Military Sacrifice.  It's interesting that this story is told about the ""Forgotten War"" - it's true, except for MASH, most people don't tend to think about the Korean War.  This book does a good job of bringing that conflict to life, especially the sacrifice and loss that its soldiers faced.  If nothing else, it is a fair and just reminder of the service these young men gave to their country, and the cruelty of how we have discarded them in history.4.  True Love and Friendship.  At its core, this is a book about relationships, and the ""devotion"" of people to one another.  We see it in the relationship between Jesse and his family, Jesse and his wife Daisy, and most importantly, Jesse and Tom.5.  Civil Rights.  Our treatment of African Americans has been called ""America's original sin,"" and this book does a good job of showing that original sin in a very specific setting: the Korean War, and the servicemen there.  The friendship between the privileged white boy and the sharecropper's son can skirt the line between an archetype and a cliche - if it were a novel, I might find it a bit cliched, but honestly, it's so sincere that I went with it.6.  Survival.  Everyone loves a good survival narrative, me most of all, and this is a good one.  There's the long term survival of growing up poor in the South as a young black man, and the immediate survival of being shot down behind enemy lines.So yes - this book draws on all of those narratives at once, and ultimately it's irresistible.  This isn't to say that it is without flaws.  The writing can be a bit superficial, and the characters two dimensional:  the good guys are fully good, the bad guys are fully bad, it has sort of the flavor of an old time Spaghetti Western, with dialogue to match.  We are introduced to our hero Tom, as I mentioned, when he stands up to bullies, and the dialogue is quite literally along the lines of ""We should do something about this,"" and ""I'm not getting mixed up in this,"" etc.  And we're introduced to Jesse when he stands up to bullies who spit on him from a school bus.  Throughout the book, the dialogue and scenes just feel a bit like reruns of narratives we've heard before.  But - there is no denying their archetypal power, and ultimately, I found it irresistible.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3F3HZY380EBG8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0804176582#wasThisHelpful","R3F3HZY380EBG8","A25TT4IFNXUU2H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A25TT4IFNXUU2H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm not sure why I ordered this book, but I'm glad I did.  It was a delightful little surprise.  The Seven Good Years is a series of very short vignettes that take place in the first seven years of Eigar Keret's sons' life - which also happens to mark the last seven years of his father's life.  Apparently, Mr. Keret is an accomplished fiction writer, but I confess I have not read any of his work before, so I went into this knowing nothing about him.  I came out surprised and touched and won over.  Each essay is very short - one to three pages - and touches on a small moment in time, like the moment of his son's birth that coincided with a terrorist attack, so the hospital staff was distracted tending to attack victims; or a brief reflection on why he enjoys plane travel.  The essays are so short that they feel lightweight, almost effortless; but there is craft and structure behind them, and interspersed throughout these tiny little musings are very big thoughts - about his father's illness and decline, about family responsibilities, about life itself.  But since he's writing about such tiny little moments, in such small snippets, it somehow feels both light and fresh.  The impact sneaks up on you.  This is a great book to read between other, heavier books; it's like sorbet with real nutritional value.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2LLORLSZDOSQE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1594633266#wasThisHelpful","R2LLORLSZDOSQE","A25TT4IFNXUU2H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A25TT4IFNXUU2H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Jen Lancaster is a fascinating case study, from a psychological standpoint  - a deeply flawed but somehow still relatable woman who's chosen to record her life through a series of memoirs. Each memoir claims to have some sort of mission, some sort of self-discovery project attached, but with each book, the mission has become more and more flimsy, until at this point we're essentially just reading Jen's annual diary with a weak framing device.  I can't resist continuing to read her books, out of sheer curiosity to see how she evolves - she's like her own Housewives series, a comparison I think she would enjoy -  but I think my patience might finally have worn out.  Here's why.1.  The bucket list is lazy.  The entire point of this book is a bucket list, and she says the frame is to push herself to try new things.  First up on the agenda:  ride a bicycle.  I thought, well, that's aiming pretty low, in terms of pushing yourself - but she goes even LOWER, by deciding that instead of getting a bicycle, she will get a three-wheeled bike - an adult tricycle.  She tries to mine humor out of this (haha! see the adult woman trying to ride a tricycle and failing!), but it felt like weak humor.  And it's emblematic of the book in general.  These are the items on her bucket list:  take a trip to Rome (i.e. go on vacation), ride a bicycle (which becomes a tricycle because a bicycle is too hard), run a 5K (not a race - just a 5K - which she doesn't actually end up doing because again, too hard), lose some weight.  These are the easiest bucket list items I can imagine, and the minute any of them get hard, she quits:  the bicycle becomes a tricycle, the 5K race becomes a 10K walk with friends, the trip to Rome with a group becomes her own vacation with her husband.  There are SO MANY inspiring books on the market about people actually trying to do hard things, pushing themselves, overcoming obstacles - and none of that is here.  If something is hard, Jen gives up.  Weird lesson.2. The writing is lazy.  Jen's humor has always been right on the edge of ""mean girl"" territory.  When she was an underdog, either because she was poor (Bitter is the New Black) or heavy/insecure (Such A Pretty Fat), her cruel edge could read as a defense mechanism, and was understandable.  But now it just reads as nastiness.  I listened to this on audio book and at one point, she spent literally twenty minutes making fun of a family sitting beside her on an airplane.  It was sort of easy target humor (the dad is stupid, even though he's a neurosurgeon, the kids have sticky lollipop fingers, the skinny mom is obsessed with her phone), and it goes on forever.  It's just - not funny.  The observations are trite, and kind of mean, and don't advance anything.  Her trip to Rome is the ""highlight"" of the book, sort of the center of the narrative, and she spends probably an hour (again, audiobook) describing why she decided to fly first class, the experience of checking her luggage, the annoying people on her flight, what she did during her first class trip,  etc.  When she gets to Rome, it's an extremely ordinary narrative of eating good food and walking and seeing the Vatican - the sort of thing you can read in literally any random travel blog.  Her big insight?  People in Italy can eat Italian food and not get fat because they don't eat too much of it.  And Europeans enjoy their lives and don't rush around as much as Americans.  This is the kind of insight that anyone who has ever read one sentence of any person's trip to Italy will accomplish.  The funny just isn't funny.  At one point, I was listening to the book, and she described American energy as being akin to ""a rapidly deflating balloon careening about"".  I thought, huh, that's a good line.  And IN THE BOOK, her husband said ""Oh, that's a good line,"" and she said, ""Thanks.  Professional writer.""  I sort of laughed, that when she actually had a good line in the book, she had to point it out to us, so we didn't miss it.  It's just the sort of weird self-consciousness that pervades the whole thing.3.  She's smug.  Again - this sounds mean.  I apologize for that, I do.  But it's just my honest reaction.  She spends a weird amount of time lecturing people on bad behavior in the book:  the family on the flight who take up too much time getting to their seats, parents who spend too much time on Instagram and not enough time enjoying their kids, people on social media who are mean to her, etc.  There's a big feeling of ""I am better than everyone else.""  Once upon a time, she had a sort of self-awareness about her flaws that made her somewhat relatable.  But as time has gone by, she seems to be less willing to be self-aware of her own weaknesses, and more intent on exposing those of other people.  I think she has been so rewarded for her mean girl schtick that at this point, she thinks it's delightful, and doesn't even see it when she's being cruel.Which begs the question - why do I keep buying her books, when I've found them lately to be so consistently disappointing?  I guess it's for the same reason I keep watching Housewives shows - there's this weird compulsion that I have to see what happens to her over time.  To see if she learns, if she develops, etc.  But this last book was SO boring, honestly, that maybe it is finally the one that will get me to change the channel.","1.0 out of 5 stars","June 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2M4JTQ0U3BZV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0451471075#wasThisHelpful","R2M4JTQ0U3BZV","A25TT4IFNXUU2H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A25TT4IFNXUU2H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Annie Holleran has known all her life that she has a secret - her Aunt Juna, a woman who fled from town in scandal years ago, is really her mother.  Her father is unknown but, she suspects, might be the man who's buried at the town crossroads, the victim of a public lynching some years back.  As the novel begins, it is the day of Annie's ascension - the day she becomes a woman - and when she goes to the well at night, following town tradition, to look into the water and see the face of her husband, Annie does not see the vision of her future.  But she does find a body; the body of the mother of the lynched man.  And all her family's secrets come bubbling to the surface once again.  Who are Annie's parents, really?  What sins did her Aunt Juna commit? Is Aunt Juna set to return - or was she herself killed, all those years ago?The novel flashes back and forth between Annie's story, set in 1952; and the story of her Aunt Juna and her mother, Sarah, in 1936.  It's a common enough device, and it works here pretty well.  In fact, for me personally, I would say ""pretty well"" about describes the book.  It checks off the boxes of a basic gothic Southern thriller.  Family mystery, good atmospherics, people with secrets, etc.  I guess maybe for me, the shortcoming is that it all just feels a little too ""by the book"" so to speak.  It's well written, but somehow, it didn't for me have a sense of originality or urgency.  It felt like many books I have read before, and will read again. I was skimming about two-thirds of the way through, just cruising to look for the ending resolution, not feeling too invested in the characters.So - if you like gothic suspense novels, then this is a good one.  But for me, just a little bit too ordinary to be memorable.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJSKND5WCQAAX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0525955070#wasThisHelpful","RJSKND5WCQAAX","A25TT4IFNXUU2H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A25TT4IFNXUU2H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The idea of a professor falling for his student, and an ensuing love triangle, is not a new one. And in some ways, this novel doesn't break new ground: after Charlie, a new teacher at a prestigious prep school, falls for a young student but doesn't allow himself to cross that line, ten years pass - and then the student returns; now grown; and Charlie feels he can overcome their past, and even connects her to his charming half brother. But the past is never really past, and neither Holly nor Nick are exactly who Charlie thinks they are.This is an odd book, in some ways. It definitely has a literary style to it, in the writing, which is reflective and careful. But the events often veer towards melodrama, and the setup (as you might be able to tell from the paragraph above) is a bit convoluted.  It feels like a lot of work to deliver a pretty standard scenario. In the end, it's a nice classic execution of the classic boarding school coming of age novel.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RAO2RJHHT9KOU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385531958#wasThisHelpful","RAO2RJHHT9KOU","A25TT4IFNXUU2H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A25TT4IFNXUU2H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A year after getting divorced from an addict and losing a baby (on the same day), Helen decides to take a three-week wilderness adventure course, to reboot her life.  (Maybe Helen read Wild.) She's irritated when her younger brother's best friend Jake announces that he's going to be on the course as well, and reluctantly agrees to road trip cross country with him, to the start of the adventure.  Much to her surprise, she finds herself falling for this much-younger man on the road trip, as he reveals hidden depths.  But a misunderstanding derails their closeness before it gets off the ground, and as the trip begins Helen has instructed Jake to pretend they're strangers.I was expecting this novel to be primarily a survival story, about Helen in the wilderness.  The beginning of the book plays up that this is not an Outward Bound course, but a really dangerous course where people often die.  (That seems unrealistic; no commercial outfitter could survive regularly killing their customers; but I'll suspend disbelief.)  In truth, it's more of a chick lit style romance novel, the story of Helen and Jake, in a wilderness setting.  After all the setup, I was a bit disappointed that there wasn't more of a ""danger"" element in the wilderness; it really was a basic Outward Bound course.  That's not necessarily a complaint, I love Outward Bound, and shoot, Wild didn't depend on Cheryl Strayed being in mortal peril.  It was just a bit of a setup that didn't pay off, and a tiny bit more of a romance read than I was expecting.  But thus endeth my complaints!  This book was just completely delightful to read.  Ms. Center has a terrific sense of humor and the book was genuinely funny.  The story races along like a sailboat under a stiff wind.  Some of the characters are two-dimensional, but others are really not - the trip leader, Beckett, develops nicely; Jake and Helen are strong; and Windy, a gorgeous California blonde studying to become a pet psychologist, makes the third leg of the romantic triangle and fills it out really well.  There's a bit of emotional depth from Windy's study of positive psychology and the neuroscience of practicing happiness, and Helen's journey to try that on herself is really touching and rings true.The last third of the book, possibly, is a bit cliched; I won't give spoilers, but let's just say that Ms. Center has studied romantic comedy conventions.  There's no ""race you to the airport to declare my love"" scene, but most of the other basics are well covered.  :)  But I won't hold that against her.  I loved this read; it was funny and sweet and offered a bit of emotional depth.  I read it in one sitting, late into the night.  Definitely recommended!","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RV2X6FOPSDKCA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250047307#wasThisHelpful","RV2X6FOPSDKCA","A25TT4IFNXUU2H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A25TT4IFNXUU2H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I don't usually read short stories, but I picked this up after seeing it on a list of anticipated books for the year.  I'm so glad I did!  It reads like an extra-smart romantic comedy, with a lot of sharp edges, but still funny and smooth.  Too often, to me at least, short stories read like class writing assignments - more about technique and craft than story, often they feel more like something to be admired than to be enjoyed. And in a short story, it is definitely more difficult to get emotionally invested in a character, or to feel a change.  But these stories resonate.  The leads are mostly a range of young women, with a recurring character who shows up in a number of pieces, who share the fact that they are looking for love and a place to belong, and struggling with it.  There's a woman in an unsatisfying relationship with a long time live-in lover, who wants to leave him at the same time her beloved dog is dying.  There's the woman having an affair with a married man, whose ex wife wants to meet.  There's the girl living with her platonic roommate who wishes - and sometimes pretends - that he were her actual boyfriend.  Each story is specific and insightful.  I enjoyed this very much.  Is it wrong that I now would like her to write a novel?","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R13K6PGQWVKQO2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385353634#wasThisHelpful","R13K6PGQWVKQO2","A25TT4IFNXUU2H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A25TT4IFNXUU2H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Claire is a forty-something mom of a teenager and a three year old.  After an accidental pregnancy that forced her to leave school and struggle through her twenties and thirties as a single mom, she finally has her life on track:  a great new (younger!) husband who adores her, a delightful toddler, and a good relationship with her older daughter - in college herself now - and her mother, who's always been there for her.  But even in the book's first scene, this delightful, hard-earned life is unraveling, because Claire has just found out that not only does she have early-onset Alzheimer's, but the disease is progressing far quicker than anyone ever expected.  She is already having a hard time connecting to Greg, her beloved husband.  And as she struggles with the progression of her disease, she also struggles with how to be a mom to her older daughter, who has a secret of her own, and her younger daughter, who still sees Claire as a really great playmate - but for how long?  And why does she feel strangely drawn to Ryan, the stranger who keeps cropping up in her life at unexpected times, and seems to understand her struggles better than anyone else?This book has received comparisons to JoJo Moyes' ""Me Before You,"" and to Lisa Genova's ""Still Alice.""  The second comparison makes more sense, because it deals with the same core issue - a mid-life woman trying to cope as she watches her sense of self slip away.  I liked this book, but for me, it didn't quite have the emotional authenticity or resonance of Moyes' or Genova's work.  The characters are just a bit two-dimensional, the scenarios just a bit too neat.  The relationships between the three main women - Claire, her daughter Caitlin and her Mom - are well drawn, as are all three characters.  There is something so appealing about good, flawed people trying to take care of each other.  It is in many ways my favorite kind of story.  There are two weaknesses here that keep this book from standing out for me as really special.  First,  the relationship between Claire and Greg, which is supposed to be the heart of the story, is the weakest of all.  We don't know him as well, we don't know what their relationship was really like, so losing it doesn't feel as tragic as it is supposed to.  It also doesn't make much sense that Claire would forget Greg so quickly, and remember everyone else in her life. Second, is the handling of Claire's disease.  It feels a little bit like her disease symptoms come and go based on what the plot needs - whenever Caitlin needs Claire, suddenly Claire ""comes back"" and is fully herself again.  It almost is too sunny a view of the disease; as someone who lived with a loved one who went through a loss of self, I can say that the hardest part is that they don't ""come back"" when you need them most.  To have Claire able to function almost perfectly so often, but then unable to recognize her own husband at the same time, just doesn't feel real to me.And yes, there is a twist in the story, but I both saw it coming and found it unbelievable.  The twist hinges on Claire having a blind spot that there is not a shred of evidence that she really has, and it feels like something the author did so she could say ""Look at my plot twist!""In sum, a sweet story, but lacking in the sort of emotional resonance and authenticity that the really best writers in this genre can deliver.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RCFMXOIY0UATZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0553394126#wasThisHelpful","RCFMXOIY0UATZ","A25TT4IFNXUU2H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A25TT4IFNXUU2H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I admit it, I'm a bit of a junkie for the survival thriller: people lost or people being chased in high mountains, ideally with a storm coming in.  It's one of those genres I will read happily in most circumstances.  This is a really good entry in that genre: four people, a young man plotting suicide and three women on a joy trip, happen upon each other.  We know from the beginning that one of the group does not make it down; the book is being narrated by the young man, Wolf, telling the story to his son years and years later, explaining this great mystery of his past. It's really well done. The adventure scenes are well written, and the shifting relationships between the characters, and within Wolf himself, are also strong. It's a change of pace for Lori Lansen, who has written more traditional ""literary"" works in the past, to dip into this adventure style, but she acquits herself well. I really liked it.One odd note - the publisher compares it to Cheryl Strayed's ""Wild,"" and Krakauer's ""Into the Wild,"" which I found a bit cheesy - those are nonfiction accounts of true survival/spiritual growth stories, and this is, you know, a NOVEL. It's a different beast, so to speak, and the comparison feels a bit disingenuous. But I'm not going to hold it against the book!","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RN0XV4017ZE3W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=147678650X#wasThisHelpful","RN0XV4017ZE3W","A25TT4IFNXUU2H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A25TT4IFNXUU2H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Dana Catrell's neighbor and budding friend, Celia, is found brutally murdered one night.  At first we think Dana is just a good person shocked to see a friend die. But it quickly becomes more than that. Dana is bipolar and possibly off her meds; she can't quite remember what happened earlier that day, except that she remembers Celia calling Dana to her house to show her pictures of Dana's husband having an intimate lunch date with another woman. Why did Celia have those pictures? And, as Dana starts to investigate, why was Celia's number on her husband's phone? What was really going on between them? And what did Dana do about it?The unreliable narrator is a pretty common device since Gone Girl, and at first I regretted choosing yet another domestic unreliable narrator thriller to read. But this was a good one.  The writing is strong and the real device here was the question of Dana's husband: who is he, really? What did he do? So the unreliable narrator, and Dana's mental illness, is just one element that adds to the mystery, which itself is well done. I thought the writing was strong and it was exciting.  More than Gone Girl, it reminded me of the really good thriller from a few years back, Before I Go To Sleep.  Very much recommended and better than most of its peers.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ZLGSUMZXAGIU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062362852#wasThisHelpful","R1ZLGSUMZXAGIU","A25TT4IFNXUU2H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A25TT4IFNXUU2H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Now that she's four years past her breast cancer, Daisy and her husband, Jack, are finally ready to reclaim their lives.  He's about to graduate from veterinary school, she's well into her graduate studies in psychology after delaying school when she was sick, she's happily renovating her fixer upper dream home, and they're even starting to think about a baby.  She barely pays attention to her four year cancer check up - but then the bottom falls out from under her.  The cancer is not only back, it's ""everywhere"" - it's not treatable - and she's going to die soon.So what does she do, in the time she has left?I picked up this book because I saw the comparisons to JoJo Moyes' ""Me Before You,"" which is still one of the best reads I've had in the last several years.  I know there is a lot of ""dying porn"" literature out there - the whole Love Story genre of young women succumbing tragically; I don't actually like this genre so much, but the reviews made me think this one was like Moyes' book, a cut above.It was, and it wasn't.  This is a well written book, and Ms. Oakley has some talent.  I liked Daisy.  But there was a flaw at the premise, and for my taste, the writer ultimately couldn't resolve it.  The core issue here is that when Daisy and Jack first get the news, they go into denial.  That's probably realistic.  But it lasts for a long time - a very, vey long time - and ultimately, reading a book about a couple who are frittering away the last few months they have together just gets frustrating.  There is also a very strange sub-plot where Daisy first becomes determined to find Jack a new mate (I find this really unbelievable; they've been married for just a few years, and he's a handsome young veterinarian; I don't believe that she doesn't think he could find someone on his own) - and then it veers into a question of whether he is cheating on her.The book raises really difficult questions of what do you do when you just have a few months left to live, instead of your whole life - and then doesn't really have the nerve to answer them.  So, here's my final recommendation:  if you like this genre, the beautiful death genre, then pick up this book - it's well written and easy to read.  But if you're looking for a really standout book, or real insight into the hard questions of life and death, for me, those questions aren't really addressed here.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3OAWO6VCTV0YL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1476761663#wasThisHelpful","R3OAWO6VCTV0YL","A25TT4IFNXUU2H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A25TT4IFNXUU2H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Lindy was the lovely neighborhood girl that all the boys - or at least this one boy, in particular - watched as she ran through their modest neighborhood of Baton Rouge, circa 1989.  She had long legs and a Schwinn bicycle, she liked to race the boys, and every night she went to track practice.  She was the magical girl of a magical youth.Until somebody raped her, and the magic stopped forever - for Lindy, for the children of the neighborhood, and for the boy who loved her from a polite distance, who narrates the story...who was one of the four suspects in her rape.My Sunshine Away will get rave reviews and it will deserve them.  It does a beautiful job evoking a very specific time and place - Baton Rouge, Louisiana, from 1989-1992.  You can feel the heat and smell the swamp rising behind the back yard, and hear the cicadas in the growing dark.  And through all the magic of gathering moss, you can feel the sense of dread, emanating most particularly from the Landry's house, the 300 pound, ominous psychiatrist who takes in a series of broken foster children and is himself the boogey man for the local children.I can imagine the book was pitched as To Kill A Mockingbird meets Gone Girl, and if it wasn't, it could have been - a coming of age story of innocence lost, set in a very specific Southern place, but instead of the innocent child narrator Scout, we have a possible Amy or Nick - an unreliable narrator who might be an observant child - and might be a rapist.  It's a great idea for a story, and this is a great writer.  But it didn't quite work all the way for me.  I think because Mr. Walsh wanted to play with the question of ""did he or didn't he do it?"" then we never get to know the protagonist in the same way we knew Scout.  It's a device that is tricky, because if he's innocent, it seems odd that he would write an entire book implicating himself as a possible predator; and if he's guilty, then it changes everything about the story.  For me, the structural requirements of the framing device - that we cannot know the truth until the very end -- keep the story from fully working.  This book is not about a mystery that the narrator himself is learning (as in To Kill A Mockingbird); it's about a secret that the narrator might be keeping.  And after a while it became a bit frustrating, and a bit unbelievable.  So it's not a home run for me.  But this is definitely a writer to watch, and I suspect many people are going to love this book.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1F1875CZ1COG5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0399169520#wasThisHelpful","R1F1875CZ1COG5","A25TT4IFNXUU2H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A25TT4IFNXUU2H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I missed this book earlier this year, but picked it up after seeing it on a number of ""best of year"" lists.  I'm so glad I did!  It's beautifully written, short and poetic and almost like a stream of consciousness - but compulsively readable.  I kept stopping to read sentences out loud to my husband.  I admit, that nine times out of ten I won't like a book like this - I like narrative, and story; and this book is mostly impressions and ruminations, as a wife thinks back about her marriage.  But for some reason this book was incredibly easy to read and captivating.

"Annie Black is living the good life in San Francisco - a successful husband, a teenaged son and two younger daughters, an interesting career as a lighting designer. But as the book begins, we learn that it has all unraveled on her - her son was involved in life threatening automobile accident, his life hanging in the balance, and somehow Annie's past is responsible. The book is written as a letter, a confession, to her son, as she tries to explain what happened in her time as a young adult  in London so many years ago, and how that year in London has echoed through to his life today.There is much to like about this book - the milieu of London and San Francisco are well set up, and the writing is clean and tight; and the dilemma of past wrongs destroying your present is a universal one. But I couldn't connect with this book as I wanted to. For me, the characters didn't really pop - I didn't care enough about Annie to care what happened to her; her husband was very underdeveloped, and the son whose life is in the balance is not really a character either. I also thought that the whole framework - present day to past, teasing out the mystery - was so slow as to get frustrating.

"This review is tricky to write.  I will just share my impressions, in order, as I used it.1.  Why is the key pocket BEHIND the phone pocket, instead of in the sleeve?  The way this works, the extra pocket (for keys, sports gels, etc.) is behind the phone pocket.  Meaning once you have tucked your stuff in there, you can't get at it again without taking the whole thing off.  This is still a bad design, I think, BUT it didn't bother me when I used it.  I thought it would make the armband uncomfortable, with the phone pressing against my key pressing into my arm.  It didn't.  HOWEVER, it did mean that you can't get into the extra pocket, so it's not a place you can put sports gels, etc.  Boo.  (Seriously, why didn't they put it on the armband alongside?  This makes no sense to me.  None at all.)2.  Man, this is tight.  I had to really wriggle my phone to get it in there, take it out of its case, etc.  I saw some reviewers say they worried about the phone breaking, and I can see that.  It actually made me kind of nervous to have my car key jammed so hard up against the phone and everything pushed to the breaking point.  But it worked fine, once in there.3. Hm.  Why isn't there a hole for my headphones?  There's a little flap at the top, which is meant to go down over both the phone and the back pocket, but without a hole for the headphone jack, the flap just sort of sits there, half open.  Meaning there is nothing to keep the phone and (more important) the key behind the phone from popping out.  Maybe that's why they had to make it so tight?  Why didn't they put a hole in the top for the headphones?  Why doesn't it seal?  This is weird.4. The phone actually works well through the sleeve.  Of all the sports armbands I've used, this is the best in terms of being able to operate the phone while it's in the sleeve.  Bonus points!!5.  The sleeve was comfortable to wear, stayed in place throughout, and nothing came out.  Excellent!Okay.  So the bottom line - I had three big reservations right up front, where I saw design flaws.  But it worked fine, in use.  I remain puzzled about the design decisions - after all this experience in the marketplace, why in the world would you advertise ""a pocket for your keys and sports gels"" but then put those things where you can't reach them?  Why would you make the fit so tight as to have people nervous about breaking their phones?  And why not create a slot for the headphones?  Weird. So if those problems don't bother you, especially if you feel like your phone fits in there okay, then I say this is a fine product.  But I also believe there will be better ones on the market.Update: After using it a few more times, the one other concern I have is about the key in the extra pocket. On my last few runs, I have had to push the key back down as it started to ride up and out of the pocket over the course of the run - and since there is no sealed top (see point 3 above), there was nothing to keep it in place. So I have to remember to watch the key and tuck it back in, which I don't like.  Otherwise it continues to work fine.","3.0 out of 5 stars","December 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RAAXYBP7VG5VF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00O08PX78#wasThisHelpful","RAAXYBP7VG5VF","A25TT4IFNXUU2H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A25TT4IFNXUU2H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book claims to offer a comprehensive behind-the-scenes look at the Sound of Music - from the origins of the real Von Trapp family, to the making of the movie, the marketing of the movie, and what has happened since.  It's written primarily from the point of view of the director, Robert Wise, and the writer of the movie, Ernest Lehman.  I love ""behind the scenes"" books and I love Sound of Music, so I expected to love this book.  But ultimately, I thought - eh.  Here's why.1.  There's not much new information here.  The main backstories - about Christopher Plummer hating his role on set, the critics' tearing it apart, the differences between the real Von Trapps and the movie Von Trapps, the casting of Julie Andrews -- all of that has been extensively covered before.  It honestly felt like this book was less new information and more old quotes and interviews repurposed for this book.  Think of a superfan going through all his old collection of Sound of Music memorabilia, and putting it together into one master file.  That's this book.  Now if you haven't read much about Sound of Music before, this might be new to you, and you might like having it all in one place.  If so, definitely get this book.2.  The new information is not as interesting.  This book spends a great deal of time with the below-the-line makers of the movie - the cinematographer, production designer, costume designer, etc.  I suspect this was to give something that hadn't been covered before.  But it wasn't that interesting, really - sort of like reading a bunch of Wikipedia entries for people who worked on the movie.  There isn't any true insight behind the scenes, even for those people.3. The sourcing is strange.  There's very little direct quotes for attribution, and honestly, it does make the book feel kind of amateurish - less like a genuine behind the scenes exploration or work of journalism, and more like a really detailed Wikipedia page written by a dedicated fan. It's fine to read, but just not that special.  I almost wonder how much original research was done for this book.4.  The good gossip has already been written about before.  Probably my favorite Sound of Music read was Charmian Carr's book Forever Liesl, which told the behind the scenes of the movie from her perspective.  Much of the good stuff from this book was found first there.  If you want a good, fun ""what was it like to be part of Sound of Music,"" read her book.5.  The analysis is fine, but kind of obvious.  Like, yes, Sound of Music is so popular because it gives us a sense of faith and family, and reassures us that life can be good in difficult times.  I think I knew that already.Ultimately, if you don't know much about Sound of Music other than seeing the movie, and you want to read it all in one place, this book isn't bad.  It's easy to read and obviously written by someone who loved the show.  But if you're looking for something original, or insightful, this isn't that book.","3.0 out of 5 stars","December 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R275Y0NVPG9XTH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250064465#wasThisHelpful","R275Y0NVPG9XTH","A25TT4IFNXUU2H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A25TT4IFNXUU2H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"At the age of 26-ish, Lena Dunham was the writer, director, producer and star of her own TV show, after having written, directed and starred in a well-reviewed independent film.  Like her or hate her, that's impressive. Yet when she gets the opportunity to tell her story, in her own words, this is what she talks about:- Why she gets naked in front of the camera- Her eating habits, including detailed food diaries- Her weird obsession with her sister- Her relationship with her therapists- Extensive depiction of her sex life, her sexual experiences, and yes, the rape-not-rape, Barry-not-Barry incidentThis is what she does NOT write about in this book:- How she developed her writing voice, how she learned to write- How she came to create her first film- How she pitched her show.- How she creates her show, how the show works, anything at all about the show OTHER THAN the experience of being naked- What it was like to create Tiny Furniture (I'm not sure the movie is ever mentioned)- How she became a director- How she developed her working relationships (none of her colleagues or costars are even IN this book)In Mindy Kaling's book (WHICH I LOVED), she writes extensively about how she became good at comedy, how hard she worked, the jobs she took before becoming successful, the little steps along the way that made her successful, and a huge, long, detailed section on what it was like to be part of building The Office. All of it hysterical, and filled with tiny, revealing details while keeping her private life private. Tina Fey did the same thing.  So did Amy Poehler.  So did Neil Patrick Harris, for that matter.  All of these people wrote their books understanding that we want to know - how did you get where you are?  How did it work for you?Lena apparently isn't interested in any of that - nothing about her work, nothing about her craft or developing it.  She writes ONLY about the most ""shocking"" parts of her life.  It's absolutely stunning to me, how many press conferences and interviews she gives in which she complains that no one wants to hear about her craft, and they only want to talk about her nudity, and that topic has been done to death - but then in her book, when it's her choice and her voice, she does the same thing.  She does have a way with words; she clearly can tell a story.  But for all of that, I've never gotten into Girls, and I was really disappointed with this book.  I wanted to hear how a young woman, at the age of 26, developed her craft and her voice to the point where she was writing, directing and starring in her own show.  I wanted to hear what it was like to run a set, to hire actors, to fight for your vision in an industry that doesn't encourage such things in young women (and what it was like to find people who support you, as she obviously did, as Amy, Tina, Mindy and Neil all did).  None of that is in this book.  Instead, she seems to go out of her way to write ONLY about things that will be shocking and ""offensive"" - going for shock value and reaction, rather than inspiring or exciting us. This book was written only to get attention and to maximize the ""shock value"" of her life.  Fine, that's her right to choose to write that kind of book, but then don't be shocked when you get negative attention and people are offended.  I have read Tina Fey, Mindy Kaling and Amy Poehler's books again and again, relishing their wisdom, their insight, their humor, and getting inspired by their accomplishments.  I will never touch this book again.","1.0 out of 5 stars","December 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RFAMW7IGDXDF6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HTMC42E#wasThisHelpful","RFAMW7IGDXDF6","A25TT4IFNXUU2H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A25TT4IFNXUU2H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Books arent recipes, not the best ones anyway, but Emma Hoopers whimsical debut, Etta and Otto and Russell and James is filled with delightful ingredients.  A charming premise: equipped only with some chocolate, her good boots and, yes, a rifle, eighty two-year old Etta sets off on a two-thousand mile walk across Canada to fulfill her dream of seeing the sea; a slate of winsome, irascible characters (including a talking coyote); and a lovingly rendered sense of place.  For me, thats an irresistible mix and I set off with Etta on her journey fully expecting to relish this book.I did not but if there is any fault here, it lies with me.  When it comes to narrative, I am a traditionalist.  I like books with a beginning, a middle and an end.  Emma Hooper tells this story more impressionistically, changing locations and time periods so freely I sometimes was not sure where I was, or when.  I wanted to walk along with Etta on her journey across her homeland, to see what she saw, to share in her relationships, to experience her conflicts and savor her triumphs.  Instead I often felt lost.(On a related note, I dont love the trend of writing dialogue without quotation marks.  Why make the readers job harder?  Whats gained by that?)In fairness, Emma Hooper did not set out to tell just one tale, but four, the story of Etta and Otto and Russell and James, and their shared journey through life.  If you are a reader who does not mind deviating from the map, I suspect you will love taking this journey with them.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2778VLEKZ34K5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1476755671#wasThisHelpful","R2778VLEKZ34K5","A25TT4IFNXUU2H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A25TT4IFNXUU2H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I got this book because I absolutely loved ""What Alice Forgot"" by Liane Moriarty, and this seemed very similar - a woman wakes up and finds that the last five years of her life have been rewritten. In Moriarty's book, Alice did not remember her life and everyone else did. In this book, Rachel remembers a life that no one else does - the last five years have just disappeared.Ms. Atkins does a really good job setting up the conflict and characters. Right from the beginning she introduces the main characters and their relationships in a way that draws you in - the rich boyfriend who might be bad news, the platonic best guy friend she's known since childhood - sure, a little cliche, but still effective. And that's how I would describe the book as well. I read a lot of these sort of female-suspense-thrillers and sometimes they can blend together. After reading too many stale ones in a row, I had taken a break, and this was a bit of a re-entry into the genre. I would put this in the upper third grouping of books like this.  It doesn't have the emotional resonance or narrative thrust of Liane Moriarty (my favorite writer in this category), but it's clean and well written. You care about the characters and the plot moves strong and confident, like a fast flowing river. After so many of these books where nothing happens, or where it runs out of steam at the end, it was nice to read one that was so confident and forceful throughout. I will definitely read her again and hope that she continues to develop.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3N2XPCBUWGN41/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0804178526#wasThisHelpful","R3N2XPCBUWGN41","A25TT4IFNXUU2H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A25TT4IFNXUU2H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've been reading the shopaholic series for decades and what is there to say? If you have read them before, then you know just what you're getting: featherweight, wish fulfillment chick lit.  I enjoy them because they're fun. And Ms. Kinsella writes with energy and genuine wit, which makes the books enjoyable. They're repetitive, sure, and somewhat forgettable (I can't even see what I missed in the books I skipped) but the characters and situations are fun.

"I had ambivalent feelings to David Nicholls' previous book, One Day - the unexpected ending was a pretty devastating blow.  As I was reading through this one, at first I thought I was reading a pretty ordinary, if well-written and humorous, depiction of a marriage. But once again, Mr. Nicholls was hiding an ace in his hand and he played it at just the right time.It's interesting how he lulls you into thinking you are reading a normal story of a disintegrating marriage and a last-chance family tour through Europe; just as with One Day, you thought you were reading a traditional romantic comedy.  Douglas is a somewhat hapless (or is he?) scientist, long married to the perfect (or is she?) Connie, a woman just slightly out of his league.  They have a son, Albie, who is sour in what seems at first to be a normal adolescent way, and a passing, painful reference to a daughter, died in infancy long ago.  Douglas is stunned when Connie asks for a divorce, and as he trails on a last family trip through Europe, the reader (that would be me) is lulled into thinking that this is a pretty ordinary story.  I started to lag about 85 pages in (it took me a while to go from page 76 to about page 100), and I might have stopped but for two factors:  the short, one-page chapters are easy to read, and sort of propel you along.  And the reviews were so good that I wanted to hang in there.So I did.  And yes - Mr. Nicholls was heading somewhere specific, somewhere unexpected.  I won't give anything away here, except to say that once again, as in his previous novel, I felt a bit upended by where the narrative took me.  So if you're reading this and wondering where it's going, trust the author.  He's got a destination firmly in mind.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1FU358HS17R95/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062365584#wasThisHelpful","R1FU358HS17R95","A25TT4IFNXUU2H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A25TT4IFNXUU2H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am a running-gear junkie. I own arm bands, fuel belts, camelbaks, handheld water bottles. I'm always searching for that elusive perfect running tool that will carry water, my phone, (ideally) some sports beans, won't slow me down or feel awkward.Spoiler alert: this isn't that.I thought that this might be a useful option. In theory, here's what I like about a handheld that includes phone and water: nothing bouncing on your waist. Everything easy to reach and see. (Phone armbands are frustrating for me because I can't see my pace without stopping and twisting the band around.) Both in one hand, so one hand is still free.And yes, those benefits do apply to this product. I will probably use it sometimes, but not as often as I'd hoped. Here are the downsides: an 8 oz water bottle is pretty small. That's good, because it's not too heavy, but it also honestly isn't much water for a long run. If I'm going 75 minutes or less I don't really need water, and if I go more than 90 minutes, I need more than 8 oz.  (my other handheld is 12 oz, and my waist belts hold two 10 oz bottles.) I guess this would be a good option for a 90 minute run.The other downside is that the phone plus water bottle is actually kind of awkward to set up. Getting the phone in place (I used an iPhone 5) requires some wriggling, and the earphones don't line up, so it does take some work to get the earbud in the phone and through the hole in the case. Then once it's in, you can't easily get it out, so it's in for the duration.  The water bottle slides in and out fine, with a nice flat back that makes it snug against the phone. I will say that filling it, both times so far, I've ended up with a wet cover on the phone - not a wet phone, but it makes me a bit nervous that so much water got on the sleeve itself.Other good things - it's comfortable on the hand (although I wish it had a thumb strap instead of just sliding across my palm), and the touchscreen on the phone works well through the cover, which has been a problem on other covers I've used.So - bottom line - I will use it sometimes, but probably not too often. The small size of the water bottle and the awkwardness of the phone fit make it not as useful as I would have hoped.  The search continues!","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2QLDSU55ZBXV3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MBEVKNO#wasThisHelpful","R2QLDSU55ZBXV3","A25TT4IFNXUU2H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A25TT4IFNXUU2H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Ten months into their marriage, Don and Rosie are living in New York City.  If you read the Rosie Project (and you really must, before reading this one - it's a better book, and important backstory), then you know that Don is a uniquely socially awkward man, not technically diagnosed with Aspergers (and he hates that term), but someone who interprets all of life with his brain.  He's an assistant professor at Columbia, and she's in medical school.  He is happily adjusting his routines to new married life, but when Rosie tells him she is pregnant, all hell breaks loose.I guess the easiest way to review this book is this: it's like every sequel to every book or movie ever, except maybe Godfather 2.  It doesn't have the magical spark of the original, it feels a bit like a retread, the characters have faded somewhat --- but if you loved the people, you'll be glad enough to see them.  And yes, some of the humor was definitely funny. Don has a unique way of seeing the world.However, for me, Don's personality felt a bit more like schtick this time, less authentic. Rosie was much more of a cliche - the anxious pregnant woman - and I honestly forgot why they had fallen in love and were so perfect together. I absolutely loved the Rosie Project, and handed it out to everyone I know. With this one, I will say, ""if you loved Rosie Project, sure, why not?""

"I love this book.  What else is there to say?  Florence is a terrific character - quite literally, a bit of a character, a kind of grouchy, funny, smart woman who is ""a bit of a pain in the neck.""  She has that kind of terrific older-literary-New-York-City life that you see in Woody Allen movies, an intellectual writer with a complicated family.  She thinks she knows what the next stage of her life has in store for her.  She's wrong.  In good ways and bad ones.This book is incredibly easy to read, with short chapters and incredibly clean prose.  It feels like it's simply written, but I know how much work there is to make writing like this feel easy.  Brian Morton has always done a good job with older characters (I loved Starting Out In The Evening, which is still the best title for a novel about falling in love for the first time when older that I've ever heard), and this is his best book. (It reminds me of the work of Reynolds Price, especially his novel Kate Vaiden.) Florence has gotten some press, and some awards.  I hope it gets more.  I would love to see him become a breakthrough star.  He so deserves it.  This is the kind of book that is in danger of not always getting published - no obvious genre niche, not a young hip writer, not a flashy or timely topic - but it also the kind of book that reminds me of the joys of reading.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1QC6W7YD8U865/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0544309863#wasThisHelpful","R1QC6W7YD8U865","A25TT4IFNXUU2H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A25TT4IFNXUU2H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This was an easy read, like drinking a vanilla latte on a cool afternoon. It's the story of two women living in a rich New York suburb: Charlotte, the bored mother in the unhappy marriage, and Allison, the artist who was widowed ten years ago. The women become friends when Allison moves to town, but when Allison starts to become close with Charlotte's husband and sister as well, then their bonds start to fray.This book was easy to read, and a perfectly fine rendition of women's fiction, if nothing special. I thought the bored rich housewife milieu was well portrayed, and the choice to make Charlotte not always likable was a good one. But some of the psychology was off: it's assumed that no one would find it odd, for instance, that an estranged husband is having private dinners with his wife's new friend; and one character is presented one way for the first 75% of the book and then given a sudden and dramatic transformation that makes little sense. In the end, a good quick read, even if I doubt I will remember it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3RYMWT0YY3JCN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0451419456#wasThisHelpful","R3RYMWT0YY3JCN","A25TT4IFNXUU2H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A25TT4IFNXUU2H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"After barely surviving the loss of her boyfriend the previous semester, Jam has been sent away to the Wooden Barn, a small private school in New England that's a halfway house between a psychiatric hospital and real life.  Her fellow students are all broken in some way, and Jam can barely bring herself to even attend classes, not even the Special Topics class to which she has been mysteriously accepted - without ever applying - a secretive class that is taught only occasionally, to select students.  There are five students in this semester's class, all of whom are reeling from their own recent tragedies: the gorgeous dancer, the superstar stud who's lost his way, the girl in the wheelchair, the boy with the hoodie.. and Jam. Their teacher, Mrs. Q, gives them each a journal to write in. And suddenly, in the writing, each student finds that the thing they lost is returned to them.  Each student revels and is brought back to life as they find their grief erased, their lost loves returned - but as the semester progresses, each student knows: when the semester is over, when the journals end, the loss will return. And will they be able to recover, to survive their grief, this time for good?I read this book in one day, in two sittings. It is a simple and clean story and it races forward with barely a wasted word, ratcheting up the tension with a surgeon's precision. The characters hover between archetype and stereotype a bit, but I didn't mind. Think of this as Breakfast Club meets the Bell Jar; five delinquents brought together for a brief interlude from the real world, hoping in that time to find a way to emerge from their bell jar of depression, loss and grief.  It's a very well told story with universal themes and a nice new way to tell them.It's not a perfect book - Ms. Wolitzer places a lot of weight on the mysterious day when Jam lost her love forever; the real story, revealed at the end, was a surprise, but in my mind, didn't quite hold up. I will day there's a twist, and an interesting one, which I didn't see coming. I wish I could discuss this book with a group; there's a lot going on here.  And if the ending didn't quite hold up, that's okay with me.

"This is a good, if not extraordinary, upscale ghost story. It combines elements of old style gothic reads like DuMaurier with the modern twist of a Lovely Bones: troubled families, a house with secrets, a young boy coming of age.  In terms of style and scope it reminded me of Searles' ""Help for the Haunted""  --- much better written than the average piece of genre ghost fiction, but lacking a bit in narrative drive.

"I am in awe of this writer.  Reading this book is like anthropology itself; it seems less written than witnessed, as if Ms. King somehow transported herself back to New Guinea in the years between the wars, and carefully recorded all that she found there. Most of the novel is narrated in the voice of Andrew Bankson, a young, unhappy anthropologist who, after a somewhat half-hearted suicide attempt fails, meets up with he married team of Fen and Nell - Fen a somewhat surly Australian who doesn't seem to like his wife very much, and Nell, the brilliant, interesting anthropologist.  The bidding relationship between Nell and Bankson is brilliantly told, primarily through long conversations where they share their experiences in the field. You can see them both coming to life before your eyes - and as they head deeper into th field, in search of a new tribe for Nell and Fen to study, you can sense disaster looming ever closer.  The writing is brilliant; I kept interrupting my husband to read passages out loud; the story is original and fascinating; and the narrative is pure adrenaline. My one complaint is just as other reviewers said - at about 250 pages, I wish it had gone on twice as long. I loved this world and did not want to leave it.

"There have been a lot of reviews talking about plot and the overall writing quality, so I'm going to talk about one concern I had going into this book:  is it too dark?  That was the most common criticism I saw of the book, and I don't necessarily like grim reads (life is grim enough), so I was hesitant.  But here's where I came out:  nope, not too grim.Yes.  There is a darkness to the book.  How can there not be?  It takes place in a desolate, dying town in Montana during the end of the Carter years.  It involves groups of people who are ostracized from mainstream, affluent America:  the poor, the disenfranchised, and the desperate.  In many ways, I thought that was what the book was about:  what happens to good people, and not good people, in desperate circumstances.Yet, I didn't find the book hopeless.  Good people, like Pete the social worker, try to make a positive impact.  There is love and friendship, even if it doesn't turn out well.  Even the ""worst"" people have three dimensions to them.Ultimately, I really admired this book.  It wasn't easy to read.  I think of it as being like a really fine Scotch.  It has a strong taste.  You have to sip it, not swallow.  Every sentence was precise and crafted with a lot of care, but unlike a lot of ""MFA Fiction,"" Fourth of July Creek also has a really strong narrative and storyline.  If you like light, easy reads only, then I wouldn't recommend this book.  If you want happy endings without compromise, I wouldn't recommend this book.  But if you want a gorgeously written novel that brings to life an often overlooked world and people, if you want truly fine writing wrapped around a compelling story, then here you go.  I will definitely be tracking Smith Henderson's work into the future.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R396Z6CMI59SC3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062286447#wasThisHelpful","R396Z6CMI59SC3","A25TT4IFNXUU2H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A25TT4IFNXUU2H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Emily Shepard is a rebellious, hard-headed adolescent girl with behavioral issues.  She is also a highly empathetic, lonely, brave and loving young woman struggling to survive after her world literally blows apart. Orphaned in a nuclear plant explosion that her father may have caused, she has fled from the hatred and judgment of her old life, and finds herself adrift.  Befriending a young foster boy named Cameron could finally offer the connection back to life that Emily desperately needs - but it could also be the start of her final undoing.  Emily tells us her story in short narrative snippets, bouncing back and forth in time; the style could be disjointed but Emily's voice is so clear and each scene so vivid that it's easy to follow.  A compelling story about a brave girl in impossible circumstances.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RXJ04QNFY3OAZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385534833#wasThisHelpful","RXJ04QNFY3OAZ","A25TT4IFNXUU2H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A25TT4IFNXUU2H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This review is hard to write because the source of the novel is secrets and so much of the joy of it is finding them out for yourself. So, with no spoilers, let's just say this. Madeline is a hot headed, feisty, funny 40-year-old mom who hates her first husband and his hippy wife, and is NOT happy to find them sharing her youngest daughters new kindergarten class. Jane is a sweet single Mom with an adorable angelic boy named Ziggy, who is very sweet and hopefully NOT a bullying psychopath. Celeste is a gorgeous Mom of two twin boys, perfect boys, and Celeste is serenely leading a perfectly privileged life. The three women are united by chance on orientation day of kindergarten. By the end of the day, they have made a set of enemies. And by the end of the term, one of these women may have committed murder. But who was killed? And why? You'll have to read to find out.Lianne Moriarty is the master of the narrative hook, and she shows it here. We know from the start of the book that there has been a murder at the kindergarten's Trivia Night, and the novel is interspersed with testimony from minor characters giving their reactions to the murder, talking to the police, as Ms. Moriarty unwraps what happened to lead to the killing. Her thesis, of course, is that everyone has secrets - and what happens when we try desperately to keep them, and what happens when we start to share them, is the engine that drives this story.  There's a simple tension in desperately hoping that your favorite characters are neither the victim nor the villain - because we do not know who died or who killed - and a deeper tension in wanting to know how each mom's story will play out.  The author is brilliant at weaving together lots of different stories towards a shared climax, and there are quite enough twists along the way to keep you surprised. The final one-two punch of a reveal was VERY well done.Simply put: love the book, love the author, perfect summer read.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2GSS2HC498UGF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0399167064#wasThisHelpful","R2GSS2HC498UGF","A25TT4IFNXUU2H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A25TT4IFNXUU2H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"North of Siberia, there is a chain of uninhibited, frozen islands: Jeannette, Henrietta, and Bennett. This chain is known as the DeLong islands, after George Washington DeLong. This is the story of how those islands were discovered, why they got that name...and at what price.George DeLong was a young navy captain who became entranced with the Arctic on a disastrous voyage with the Juniata, during the years when all the world was inspired by the race to the North Pole.  He became determined to find his own ship, and take his own quest.  His path intersected with two incredible characters of the time.  First was James Bennett, the profligate millionaire playboy newspaper owner who once terrified New York City by inventing and publishing a story about escaped Central Park Zoo animals going on a killing spree, and whose engagement to a society girl was cancelled by her horrified family when he peed into their grand piano at a high society party.  Bennett, a lover of spectacle, liked inventing news more than reporting it - and became enchanted with the idea of sending his own party out to find the North Pole. Second was August Petermann, a world famous cartographer who rarely left his living room, had never traveled, but somehow had fashioned himself as one of the global authorities on the geography of the North Pole. Petermann was convinced that just past the polar ice pack was an open Polar Sea, with its own glorious continent, and he convinced Bennett to fund the search for it - and Bennett hired DeLong to do so.  What happens from there is as grand and terrible as you might expect, to quote the book's sub title.There have been lots of polar exploration stories, and I doubt any of them will ever touch one of the first, Lansing's Endurance and its story of Shackleton. There was a leanness to that story - a total focus on adventure - that this book is missing. Entranced by the characters of Bennett and Petermann - who, did I mention, also has suicidal tendencies? - Mr. Sides spends the first 150 pages of the book not on the ice, but with the founder and the cartographer who inspired its launch. They are great characters and I enjoyed reading about them, but it served to divide the book a bit, losing its focus.Once on the ice, Mr. Sides also does a great job with the characters on the boat - stalwart DeLong, recently married and desperately in love with his wife; Danenhower, the navigator, who had once been insitutionalized and whose ability to handle the journey is in question; Collins, whose love for newfangled gadgets like Edison's electric lights could be the boat's savior or his own undoing; etc. Theres even an extended cameo from famed naturalist John Muir. But the best character, by far, is Melville, the young engineer/mechanic who is related to Herman, nudged whose energy, resilience, intelligence and ingenuity just might be the one thing that saves them all in the end.Once the USS Jeanette becomes locked in ice, what drove a lot of the tension for me was the question: will DeLong make it home to his wife?  Mr. Sides sets up their romance well, and intersperses their ice journey with letters Emma writes to her husband, for the years of his absence. Seeing her hope become genuine, then forced, then with desperation creeping in, is genuinely touching and you can't help rooting for their reunion.Does it come? Well, I won't give that away.  But the story is very well told. I think Mr. Sides is better with characters than he is with narrative tension; the book moved like the boat itself, gradually through deep ice, lots of time to enjoy the view, but not the right vehicle for going fast. Until the last 100 pages, the story was pretty slow.  There was 150 pages of prep time, then another 150 pages of early journey and ""trapped in ice"". The energy of the characters - rather than action - kept me going.  It picked up at the end as the situation got more desperate, as the boat was finally crushed by ice and DeLong, Melville and the gang fought desperately to find their way to civilization from thousands of miles away.  A great story, very well told.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R8JOJ4XUHMN5D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385535376#wasThisHelpful","R8JOJ4XUHMN5D","A25TT4IFNXUU2H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A25TT4IFNXUU2H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I read a review that described this book as a ""slow moving Gothic thriller"" and I can back that up - with just a bit too much on the""slow moving"" bit.  It started off strong, with the classic boarding school set up:  the shy bookish poor girl connecting with the rich spoiled girl, drawn into their family, only to discover A Big Family Secret.  It does read a bit in the style of Wuthering Heights or Jane Eyre, which is fun - the family compound where most of the action takes place sets up a nice, specific setting; and the clues to Bad Things are sweetly old fashioned - locks on all the doors, crazy spinster aunties, things hidden in the attic.  For the first 100 pages, even though it was slow, I read with optimism, expecting that it would start to pick up.  But it didn't, at least not soon enough or quickly enough to hold my interest.  I started skimming around page 150, getting impatient, and eventually petered out.  I gave it my best shot, and there were things to like about the book.  But ultimately, I was a fish that the author hooked but couldn't reel in.  She just lost me.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1WX0OHBRGSRN2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0804138567#wasThisHelpful","R1WX0OHBRGSRN2","A25TT4IFNXUU2H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A25TT4IFNXUU2H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Secret Life of Violet Grant tells the story of Vivian, a modern girl right at the edge of the modern age, 1964, a budding journalist (a bit of a cliche, but okay) who receives a suitcase that was lost by her mysterious great-aunt Violet - WHO?!? - just before the outbreak of World War I.  The story is told in alternating chapters between Vivian, as she tries to solve the mystery of Violet and struggles with her romantic entanglement with the handsome Dr. Paul, a pediatric surgeon who might be too good to be true; and Violet, a female scientist in an age when women did not do such things, who has found herself married to a monster and looking for a way out.  But did that way out include murder?  And whatever happened to Violet and her secret lover, who is also not what he seems?There's a certain kind of book that used to be a staple of reading - the juicy saga.  They're often rooted in the past, with a strong and diverse set of characters, some near-soapy romantic elements, a bit of mystery or intrigue to drive the story forward, and a certain richness that elevates them above the traditional straight romance novel.  I LOVE these books and wish there were more like them still being written.  Kate Morton has been writing those books lately - Forgotten Garden and Secret Keeper are great examples - and now I can add Beatriz Williams to the list.  She's been on my radar for a while, but the Secret Life of Violet Grant is the first one of hers I've read.  Now I'm psyched to go back and read her previous two.  Based on this one, she just writes your basic great, old-fashioned story.  So simple in theory, but not often executed as well as this.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R362QUO5FV7TB7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0399162178#wasThisHelpful","R362QUO5FV7TB7","A25TT4IFNXUU2H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A25TT4IFNXUU2H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Marley is a teenaged girl painfully aware of how ordinary she is - a bit overweight, ""funny but not too funny,"" friends but no good ones, possibly a good writer but nothing special. She has a troubled relationship with her father and a loving, if distant relationship with her mother. A few years ago she was sent to a psychiatrist for an unknown crisis, but everyone thinks she's better now. No one is paying her much mind. Until she runs.  Now everyone is looking for her, most of all her father.  Only her mother - the one person who loved Marley the most - seems hesitant to fling herself into the search, though it's nearly destroying her.Interestingly, the book answers the question ""where did Marley go?"" almost instantly, as both Marley and her mother Rachel narrate the book in alternating chapters.  This is a nice concept because it shows us why kids run, even ""good"" kids - and more than that, how kids delude themselves into believing the wrong people, and how runaway plans can unravel. I found the Marley bits of the book really compelling, as she slowly (too slowly) starts to realize what she has gotten herself into.  The Rachel parts of the book were weaker; too much fretting and waiting and stewing. It's hard to sympathize with a Mom who is so passive at a time like this, and Rachel's story dragged for me. But as a look into mother daughter relationships, and an exploration of the dangers of running for a better life, I thought it was strong. It did remind me a lot of Reconstructing Amelia. I liked the Amelia characters better; but this book had the advantage of letting us hope for a happy ending for Marley, which drove the narrative forward.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R15XJLVTYUA30F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062305840#wasThisHelpful","R15XJLVTYUA30F","A25TT4IFNXUU2H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A25TT4IFNXUU2H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Given the reviews, both here and elsewhere, I thought I would like this book more.  There are three sort of interlocking plots about Clarissa, an admin at a college in England, and men who may be bad men.  There's the stalker Rafe, with whom she spent one night and who is now haunting her.  There's the court case she's currently serving as a juror on, about a hooker who was gang raped by some bad men, and in whose story Clarissa finds uncomfortable parallels.  And there's Charlie, another juror on the case, with whom Clarissa is starting up a new possible relationship even as things with Rafe escalate.  None of these stories were particularly entrancing - and Clarissa herself is pretty ordinary as a lead character -- but I kept reading in hopes they would intersect in some interesting way at the end, with a twist or something to make these seemingly ordinary plot lines more interesting.  To my mind, that didn't really happen.  In fact, I thought it had a fairly ordinary ending, one you might find in a basic horror movie.  If you enjoy women-in-peril or women-being-stalked stories, and you want to read one set in England, that's well written, then pick this one up.  If you're looking for something more interesting than that, there's better choices out there.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2019UBH5NVJAB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062297600#wasThisHelpful","R2019UBH5NVJAB","A25TT4IFNXUU2H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A25TT4IFNXUU2H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Peter Heller has given me everything I look for, everything I need, when I read fiction.  A vividly drawn cast of credible characters, a beautifully rendered sense of place (in this case, a place I happen to love, the American Southwest) and enough plot to keep the pages turning, all told in an agreeable voice.  Any book that delivers these essentials will always get four stars from me.But this is not a four star book.  Heller also follows Stephen Kings market-tested counsel and offers his readers an insiders glimpse of not one but two unique worlds: the passion and practice of an artist and the passion and practice of a fly fisherman. In this case, these worlds are joined in one person, Jim Stegner, painter, father, lover, and angler, a man whose talent is rivaled, driven and threatened by his demons.I will not give away plot points here but bad things happen, some of them to good but flawed people, some of them to bad people, some of them caused by people who want to be good but arent, really, at least not completely, but who are lucky enough to be loved, anyway.  Which is to say Peter Heller has not merely written a remarkable piece of fiction.  He has produced a work of art.  Five stars, hands down.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2DF9X896QBF3I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385352093#wasThisHelpful","R2DF9X896QBF3I","A25TT4IFNXUU2H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A25TT4IFNXUU2H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Her boyfriend just dumped her and she can't stop crying, even though her family's nickname for him was ""lady legs."" She is barely paying any attention to the stupid doctor's appointment she has to check off her list - until the doctor tells her, first, ""don't kill the messenger"" and second, ""you're going blind."" She doesn't have ten years left to live - but she does have ten years left to see.It's not that what happens afterwards is surprising: there is sorrow, and denial, and a rash of bad decisions, and bumping into things. Lots of bumping into things.  Ultimately there is true love, of many kinds, and courage, and acceptance. It's not the facts of the story that are surprising, but Nicole is a wonderful person with whom to spend some time. She is hysterically funny, first off.  She is self-deprecating and NOT self-pitying. She doesn't always handle her problems well, but she is relatable and engaging. The way she comes to terms with her hardships - and the way she ultimately realizes that everyone has hardships; blindness is hers - is poignant and feels authentic and earned.

"Eileen Leary wants things. She grows up in a poor neighborhood with alcoholic, well-intentioned parents and she wants more. She marries a brilliant, kind scientist, and she wants more. A bigger house, a better standing, a child... Eileen wants. But instead, Eileen is about to find that instead of getting more, she is about to suffer a great loss, a loss that will last a lifetime.Many reviews - including the Publishers's Weekly blurb - spoil the ""loss"" and I wish they hadn't. Finding out why Eileen's family is unraveling is a central question of the book, and the great mystery of the middle third. I think I would have enjoyed it more not knowing.  Also, this is not a book with plot to spare.  This is a 640 page novel that reads like a poem, and I mean that in good ways and possibly in bad ones.  The sentences are gorgeous and beautifully crafted. There were three chapters that were so profound I literally turned back and read them again as soon as I had finished the first time. The book is emotionally insightful into the three principal characters of Eileen, her husband Ed, and their later-in-life son Connell. Most of the book is told from Eileen's point of view, although Connell gets a voice starting about halfway through. I wept at the end. It does feel that you have witnessed a life go by.That being said: this was not my personal favorite kind of book. The publisher compares it to Olive Kitteridge, or an Alice McDermott novel. Fair comparisons - meditations on often neglected women. But those books were 300 pages. This one is 640, with very little story to show for it. It could have been much shorter, in my opinion.  I'm more of a Dickens or Donna Tartt reader: I like my big sprawling novels to have big sprawling stories to go with them. This book doles out plot very slowly, measured like medicine, a spoonful at a time. Very little happens (which is why I wish the one big development were not spoiled; there aren't others). I'm the reader who hated Middlemarch, and this book is more of a Middlemarch than a Dickens book, in terms of style: poetic and thoughtful. So I can fully recommend it for its craft and skill and emotional acuity. But if you read for story, this might not be the first book you would choose.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3439S6GCXSJQI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=147675666X#wasThisHelpful","R3439S6GCXSJQI","A25TT4IFNXUU2H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A25TT4IFNXUU2H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Henry and Beth are happily married, he a farmer, she a mom, raising two young kids.  They'll probably always get by but it will probably never be easy.  They live in a small town, fighting a way of life that's sagging. The excitement in their life comes when their childhood friend comes to town; Lee, the rock star, marrying the Hollywood actress; Lee, the poet and good guy: Lee, who has everything the world thinks you could want but somewhere inside him, who wants what Henry and Beth has... and might be tempted to take it, if he gets a chance.This is a beautifully written book.  I felt like I knew the town of Little Wing, and the people are very crisply drawn - Henry and Beth and Lee and their friend Ronny, the rodeo clown with a head injury; and Kip, the businessman with a shaky moral compass.  Like small town life itself, it's a bit slow, like the river that meanders through town on a hot day.  I don't think I would say the book is surprising, or urgent.  I started skimming a bit at the end, when it became evident where everything was going, the same way you try to hurry up your boat at the end of a long float trip, you're ready to be done and on to the next thing.

And this book delivered, for certain.  The characters are precise and well developed. It definitely reminded me of Winter's Bone (the movie) and Justified - almost too dark and grim, but the writing is beautiful and there is just the faintest promise of hope at the end.

"I'm always interested in books that present a behind-the-scenes look at the publishing industry, and I always like a good thriller, so this book was right up my alley.  It took a few tries to get into it - the first few chapters were a bit cumbersome - but once I got going, I sped right through it.  The Accident stars Isabel, a literary agent with a sad past who receives an anonymous submission to a life changing manuscript: an expose of a powerful media magnate, submitted by an anonymous author.  The story is told from multiple points of view of different characters who interact with the book in the course of a day:  a down-on-his luck editor whose fortunes might change with this expose, a publisher about to lose his family business, an assistant on the rise, a producer, a rights negotiator, a CIA-type secret agent determined to prevent the book's release, and yes, the mysterious author himself.  All exciting and well done.  I give it four stars, not five, for a few reasons.  One, it didn't really stand out for me - other than the fun behind-the-scenes-of-publishing, it wasn't that different from the regular good thriller.  I could guess the plot twists in advance, and the biggest one of all was telegraphed, I thought, miles ahead of time.  Also, there are so MANY characters, that most of them are not as well developed as they could have been.  And the CIA element seemed shoehorned in - as if the stakes wouldn't be high enough unless the entire government were brought in; at some point, one character says that even the PRESIDENT might be trying to kill people to keep the book from being published, and that just was too much for me.  As if the author didn't trust us to be invested unless the Whole Free World was at stake.  And that never paid off.  But that being said - a fun read, well written, and particularly good if you're a book publishing junky.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R32EIU86Q0WBLS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385348452#wasThisHelpful","R32EIU86Q0WBLS","A25TT4IFNXUU2H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A25TT4IFNXUU2H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This decades-long saga of three women begins when Grace, a timid young Chinese woman fleeing an abusive father, arrives in San Francisco with vague dreams of becoming a dancer at the World's Fair. She knows nothing of Hw to survive in the big city; fortunately she is quickly befriended by Helen, the daughter of a Chinatown magnate; and the two of them meet Ruby, a feisty young woman willing to do anything to get ahead. Of the three young girls, two find jobs dancing - and they all form a complicated, shifting, lifelong bond as secrets are hidden and revealed, tragedies unfold, hearts are broken and someone commits the deepest betrayal of all.Lisa See is carving out a great career, writing one strong book after another. She specializes in writing about Chinese women in the recent or distant historical past.  I still think Snow Flower is her best work; the story she was telling there was more unique than this one, another novel about women at home during WW2. Of course, the unique story of the Chinese and Japanese communities during this time makes this book more original, but it still felt just a bit expected. There is a boy, friendships betrayed, all well told but all just the slightest bit done before.  Plus, Ms See covers so much ground and so many characters that some elements of the story - the internment camps, for instance - are not as well developed. And the ending is a bit too neat, as one person ""explains it all"" just as the book comes to a close. That said, a great read, and definitely recommended.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1VMQPUDIYX700/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=081299289X#wasThisHelpful","R1VMQPUDIYX700","A25TT4IFNXUU2H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A25TT4IFNXUU2H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Frank has a problem.  He recently had some incident happen to him - a car crash that was possibly a bit more than that.  He's lost his entire memory; he knows that he is a ""terms and conditions"" lawyer, the kind of guy who specializes in fine print, but he seems to have lost the big picture.  His wife is treading lightly around him, anxious and nervous and eager to please.  His brother and boss acts like everything is fine.  But is it?  As Frank tries to rebuild his life, he starts to sense that everything is not as it seems.  And that the people around him might be hiding some pretty big terms and conditions of their own.I liked this book, but not as much as I wanted to.  Frank's voice was funny, and the sense of place - a London corporate law firm - was really well established.  It took quite a while for the characters to come into focus; by the end, there are a few people we definitely like and some people we definitely don't, but I read for a long time without getting invested in anyone.  The revelation was not that surprising (or original), and the ending was wrapped up very quickly.  The biggest point of difference with this book was its format:  it is written like a law contract, filled with footnotes and footnotes to footnotes.  I love books that play with format, but in this case, it was quite literally difficult to read:  the gimmick is that footnote fonts keep getting smaller and that as a terms and conditions lawyer, Frank has learned to hide the most important facts in the smallest print.  But that gets in the way of reading this book - I quite literally struggled to read some of the fonts, as each footnote got progressively smaller in size.  It started to seem like a gimmick that was driven the story, instead of helping to tell the story.Mostly, in a comic novel like this, it's all about the voice.  And in this case, I thought it had its funny moments - Frank and his two brothers were popping by the end, with a neat dynamic -- but it wasn't as funny as some of the other comic novels I've read recently.  So, if you're looking for a fun read about corporate law, set in London, that gets better as it goes along, then check it out.  But maybe bring a magnifying glass.  :)","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2W7WQQJU2B7XO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1620406438#wasThisHelpful","R2W7WQQJU2B7XO","A25TT4IFNXUU2H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A25TT4IFNXUU2H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In the book ""A Beautiful Mind,"" about the mathematician John Nash who struggled with schizophrenia, a friend said to him, when visiting him in the asylum, ""You're a brilliant mathematician.  How can you possibly think that you are really hearing voices?"" And John said, ""Well, those are the same voices that gave me all my best ideas about math.""  It's always been fascinating to me, the idea that our demons and our angels, our illness and our inspiration, can come from the same place - and what does that mean?  What I Had Before I Had You is an exploration of that question through the eyes of one family, over many generations:  a family that is struggling (secretly, in denial as much as possible) with the toll and turmoil of mental illness.I won't recount the plot, because many others have done that before.  But this novel did a wonderful job exploring that experience from the inside: the fear and frustration and the constant lurking presence of the disease, like sharks in the water.  It colors everything in life, and even if you try to ignore it (as the main character did) or deny it, the disease will take its toll.  And yet it can be hard to ""treat"" the illness because mental illness cannot be separated from the individual in the same way that cancer or heart disease can.  It's all wrapped up in your identity, and the toll of the disease on a family - to the point where it all unravels, in a thrilling story -- is very well told.  I ripped through this book quickly (it reminded me of early Kaye Gibbons, herself an author living with bipolar disorder) and I will definitely seek out more works from Ms. Cornwell in the future.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R28I832VK0BJ7K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062237845#wasThisHelpful","R28I832VK0BJ7K","A25TT4IFNXUU2H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A25TT4IFNXUU2H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Eve is a typical suburban Mom who on the surface is living a very ordinary life: married to a good man from whom she is drifting apart, mothering a teenage girl whose secrets might be ordinary - or might be serious - but mostly, Eve's a mom raising a son who will die in just a few years; a son who is poisoned by sunlight and whose death warrant was signed years ago. So this family lives by the ticking of a clock; the daily tick of sunrise and the bigger tick of a life winding down when it's supposed to be starting up. Eve thinks her life couldn't get harder. But one day, in the space of a text message, Eve's fragile life takes another fatal blow. And as her community reels from its impact, we start to explore all the secrets that everyone is keeping - and what price they will pay for those secrets.Sounds like a great book doesn't it? And I wish I could rate this book higher - I don't like leaving critical reviews, especially for young authors, and I look for the best. But for me, after a nice setup and a good catalyzing event, the book slowed down to a crawl. It was as if the writer had thought of a great premise and created a compelling community, but then didn't know where to go. The plot is a waiting game, and reading becomes a waiting game as well, as all the characters passively wait for their secrets to be revealed. No one in the book does anything, really; days just unfold while we wait for something to happen. This is the second book I've read lately with this problem (""You Should Have Known"" is the other) and it's a bad trend! Thrillers or mysteries in which the main characters are defined by their passive avoidance and denial of their circumstances do not make for good reads. And also as with You Should Have Known, there are no real plot twists: a set up, an event, 300 pages of waiting, and the end. Just not fun to read.Looking for the positive, I can see why this book was published -- nice setup and premise, nice first twist, decently written -- and I can see why some people would enjoy it.  Mothers might be able to imagine themselves in this situation, and think how far they would go to protect their own children. It might have extra resonance for a mom. But for me, it felt flat and I was restless as I read along, frustrated with the slow pace and what felt like an ordinary, predictable course to resolution.","2.0 out of 5 stars","April 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RG3LI862XC8EK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0345535243#wasThisHelpful","RG3LI862XC8EK","A25TT4IFNXUU2H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A25TT4IFNXUU2H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Toni and her boyfriend Ryan have just been released from prison after serving 15 years for murdering her sister - a crime they did not commit. After trying hard to come to terms with her rage for the injustice of her sentence, and the betrayal of everyone from her life before, Toni mostly wants her life back, but discovers it's not that simple. She might be technically free, but the real killers are still out there. They know she has the truth. They tried to take her life from her years ago, and they're not about to let her have it back.Here's the best thing I can say about this book: I didn't want to do anything else while I was reading it. The setup is compelling, and the book has that kind of infuriating tension that comes when a character - in this case Toni - is dealing with a huge injustice and things keep going against her. You just want to race to the end to make sure it comes out okay.I also liked this book MUCH better than the earlier reviewers. I read a lot in this genre, and this one is a notch above. My favorites in this category are Lisa Gardner and Harlan Coben. For most of this book, Chevy Stevens hits that standard.  The premise is compelling and she tightens the screws until you can't stand the suspense. So it is a solid four stars and for those who like this kind of book, I really think you'll like this one.That said, it's not perfect. The bad guys are predictable and two dimensional; the tension comes not from ""who done it"" but ""why"" and ""how will they get caught.""  Under those criteria, I thought it was a little lacking in payoff. The vast majority of the book is spent in setup, and the payoff is pretty abrupt and lacking in the sort of twists and excitement that the best in the field can deliver.  So it's not perfect, but it was a great weekend read, and recommended for fans of this kind of book, for certain.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RW27DMDOHOED5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250034604#wasThisHelpful","RW27DMDOHOED5","A25TT4IFNXUU2H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A25TT4IFNXUU2H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The concept of the unreliable narrator - and especially the unreliable narrator spouse - has been getting quite a workout lately, with Gone Girl kicking off a major sub-gene of literary thriller around this concept.  Headmaster's Wife is an above average entry in this sweepstakes: the first half of the novel is the headmaster, being interrogated by the police after picked up naked in Central Park, telling the story of what got him there. We know he is confessing to a crime - but what crime is it? We also suspect he is not telling the truth - so what is his real crime? As he confesses to an escalating series of sins (which I will not spoil here), we become more convinced that he is not telling us the full story. The first half of the book closes with a whopper of a reveal that I confess I did not anticipate in full; the second half of the book re-tells the same story, from a different perspective, with the assumption that this time we are getting the truth.I deliberately did not set out too many details in the description above because honestly, the way the novel is structured, to even reveal the names of major characters and their identities, is to spoil some of the surprises.The book was short and quick to read; it was cleanly structured and the author (himself the founder of a small liberal arts school in New England) knows the prep school setting intimately. There's a great sense of time and place. In the end, I was left just a bit disappointed: some of the characters who were most interesting never came into full view, and the device of recounting the entire story through memories gave it a sense of being a bit removed - like watching a party through a window, instead of being let in the door.  I just never felt fully connected.  But it was a lovely read with some nice surprises and twists along the way.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1KVA2VIGKGEEF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250038944#wasThisHelpful","R1KVA2VIGKGEEF","A25TT4IFNXUU2H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A25TT4IFNXUU2H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I won't revisit plot here, since I'm late to the game with this review. But I can speak as someone who read his prior book, and offer a comparison.I read A Land More Kind Than Home with huge expectations - the Cormac McCarthy/To Kill a Mockingbird comparisons were irresistible - and was a bit disappointed. That book felt a bit self conscious to me: the author trying too hard to hit on the classic ""literary South"" archetypes. So my expectations were a bit tempered with this one and hey! I liked it much better. Maybe Mr. Cash was more confident, or had less to prove, but this book just felt more relaxed to me somehow.  The themes are similar - young children and the parents who fail them, set in the hardscrabble South, where redemption and despair are in a constant dance.  But this book is more tightly plotted; whereas Land More Kind Than Home spent a lot of its time in portent and promises of events to come, like a guy trying to impress you on a first date, this book is more simple and benefits from it: Mr. Cash simply tells the story and trusts the story. I think he is going to write a Great American Novel one day, and I'm enjoying watching him work his way up to it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2H1TQUIR5J2EG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062088254#wasThisHelpful","R2H1TQUIR5J2EG","A25TT4IFNXUU2H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A25TT4IFNXUU2H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Seriously.  I really loved this book.  From the very beginning, when Fanny is setting out across the ocean with her kids for some unknown reason, all the way through.  It's an incredibly generous work - generous with story (many things happen, which after reading too many passive books lately I am very grateful for!), generous with its characters (they're all interesting and well developed, even the bad guys, even the minor characters), generous with language - it's just lovely and sumptuous.  She does a terrific job of making you feel like you are there:  from the waiting platform in Belgium to France, the Samoan Islands, etc.  The theme of ""unknown woman behind famous man"" can seem a bit overdone lately (I know Ms. Horan is credited with starting it), but Fanny and RLS are such well developed characters that you don't care.  A terrific read.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1FYHOYDIF9M0B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0345516532#wasThisHelpful","R1FYHOYDIF9M0B","A25TT4IFNXUU2H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A25TT4IFNXUU2H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was so primed to love this book.  And there are things to like a lot about it.  It's a great premise -- Grace is a successful Manhattan psychologist with the perfect life and perfect husband writes a book criticizing women for not following their instincts in love, only to find out days before publication that her own husband, and her own life, are not what she thought at all.  In fact, nothing is as she thought at all: her instincts about everyone around her, from her best friend to her own husband, have been proven to be very truly wrong.Great premise, right?  And there's great writing in here, especially in the very clear depiction of the upper-middle-class Manhattan lifestyle, its perks and its perils.  But... I kept waiting for it to really get started.  And it never does.  This is a strangely passive book.  For one thing, all the interesting action takes place offstage: the murders, the murder investigation, the gossiping about Grace and her family, the gradual unraveling of the truth - all offstage.  Her husband, the ultimate villain of the piece, does not make an appearance - not in the present day, not even in flashbacks.  That's an incredibly strange choice, like having a Shakespearean drama where the villain is never seen.  We don't even see very basic conflicts such as Grace's circle turning on her.  Literally, Grace spends the vast majority of the book in denial of what is going on, just going about her life; and then when she realizes what happens, she flees town, never to return. It's a strangely passive book where almost everything interesting takes place in a different room from the one where the story is being told.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ULFXIGZ2FGZO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1455599492#wasThisHelpful","R1ULFXIGZ2FGZO","A25TT4IFNXUU2H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A25TT4IFNXUU2H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I picked this book up on a whim, after hearing about it on People.com, and it was just a delightful, unexpected treat, like a box of See's Candy left at the door.  It's the true story of Patience Bloom (how can this be her real name? but it is!), intellectual by day, secret lover of romance novels by night, who eventually finds her true calling as an editor at Harlequin - and finds the difference (and similarities) between romance love and real love.  Ms. Bloom's voice is easy and breezy but with a bit of an edge; she's humorous, but mostly at her own expense; she paints a vivid picture of growing up the daughter of incredibly smart parents and an overachieving brother, struggling to find her own way in the world, and, yes, to find real love and a true calling.  Her love for romance novels is a recurring theme, taking her through dark times in her life, and eventually leading her to her true calling: as an editor at Harlequin.  There is a bit of darkness in the book - a traumatic event from her 20s that is gradually unfurled, and a sad relationship with her distant father -- which makes it more real, and more textured.  I spent time in NYC in my 20s, and this book made me want to move back there.  While I don't love romance novels, I DO love reading, and I could relate to that part SO MUCH - the way books help us to escape our life, but also give us hope for it.  And the behind the scenes world at Harlequin was fascinating to me.  Honestly,  the book was just sheer fun:  I read it in one day, and didn't want to do anything else until I finished it.  I bought a copy for a friend in the hospital, promising it would cheer her up.  It will you, too!","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3DWQ1X08L2S95/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DMCW29U#wasThisHelpful","R3DWQ1X08L2S95","A25TT4IFNXUU2H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A25TT4IFNXUU2H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Penn Cage's beloved father, Tom - Atticus Finch with a medical license - stands accused of murdering his old nurse, Viola Turner, an African American woman who has just returned to Natchez after fleeing from the murdering Double Eagles (a terrorist group who didn't think the KKK was extreme enough) during the 1960s.  Did Tom kill Viola?  If so, was it a mercy killing (she was dying of cancer), or something else?  What was Tom's relationship with Viola back in the 60s?  Did he father her son, Lincoln?  And how does all of this connect to a series of murders, beginning in the 1960s and stretching to the present day?  What is the truth - and how much is Penn willing to sacrifice to find it?I am a hard core Greg Iles fan, and I have been waiting for this book since the minute I finished Devil's Punchbowl in 2009.  That book ended on a cliffhanger, as Tom suffered a sudden heart attack and begged Penn to come to his side immediately, so Tom could reveal a long held secret.  Greg promised the follow up novel would follow within the year.  Flash forward five years - and a behind the scenes saga that itself could have been a novel itself, including his father's death, a near-fatal automobile crash for the author, a change in publishers - and finally, here it is. Natchez Burning is quite a high wire act:  it's both picking up a story that the author has been writing since Quiet Game, and starting a new trilogy that is supposed to take him to the next level, after a long absence. Possibly NO book could have lived up to the expectations placed on this one, by me, or by the new publishers, or the author himself.  And the weight of the expectations shows, as I will discuss.But first:  there is a phenomenal story in here - and a fantastic writer is telling it. SO much of this book lived up to my expectations.  It truly is epic in scope and ambition, and the stories that Greg Iles is telling are exciting, interesting, with great characters, terrific villains, lots of mystery, moral questions...all the good stuff.  When I finished the book, I handed it over to my husband and definitely encouraged him to read it, and I encourage others to read it as well.  It is just the kind of novel that I wish was being published all the time.But - it drags.  There's no other way to say it.  This book could have been at least 200 pages shorter and not lost a thing.  Other reviewers have noted it's a slow read, and it kind of is.  There are two very specific problems - one is minor, one is more frustrating.  The minor problem is repetition.  I noted that Tom Cage is ""Atticus Finch with a medical license"" - that's a great character summary.  It's probably in the book six times.  Tom describes himself that way; his son thinks of him that way on several occasions; other characters think of him that way.  This happens throughout the book - the core character issues are repeated over and over.  Penn's fiancee Caitlin is struggling with her own ambition versus her moral code.  She thinks about this struggle and reminds us of this struggle over and over and over and over.  Yes, we get it!!  You are struggling!!  I am not exaggerating when I say that there is probably a good 50 pages worth of content that is repeating the same character dilemmas over and over, as if we might not ""get it"" without the repetition.The second problem, and the more frustrating one to my mind, is that of ambition.  Greg Iles (and his publishers) want us to know this is an epic American novel.  (I think it may well be.)  So, literally, in the course of the novel, the characters repeatedly TELL US that this is an epic American story.  One scene after another of characters saying to each other, ""Do you have any idea how big this is?  Do you have any idea how deep this goes?  Do you have any idea how powerful (this villain) is?""  The novel tries to cover American history from the 1960s to the present day, trying to link MLK and RFK and JFK and Katrina and slavery and J Edgar Hoover and American corporate and political corruption and investigative journalism and the history of the FBI - which is hard enough - but Iles is constantly interrupting his own story to make the point that this is a BIG STORY.  At one point, about 70% of the way through the novel, just as the momentum is really getting underway, there is a three page chapter where nothing happens except one of the main characters takes a moment to ruminate on HOW IMPORTANT this whole story is.  I'm not kidding when I say that there is probably another 50 pages of text that is devoted just to different characters talking about the epicness of the story that we are reading.  I found myself getting really frustrated with that and it ultimately affected my enjoyment of the book, hence four stars instead of five.My honest hope is that, now that the five-year-monkey is off his back, and the first novel of the trilogy is out, Greg Iles will be able to relax into just telling this story, and trusting the story.  It's a great one.  I really do think it has the potential to be an American epic, and I look forward to the next one.  Hope it's not five years away!(One other note - I was nervous about another cliffhanger ending, so for those who might share that concern - it wasn't too bad.  Yes, there was a cliffhanger, and it was bizarrely similar to the Devil's Punchbowl cliffhanger.  But enough was resolved that it felt fair, and I am not too traumatized waiting for the second book.  :)","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R76EKDJC0TG7K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062311077#wasThisHelpful","R76EKDJC0TG7K","A25TT4IFNXUU2H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A25TT4IFNXUU2H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I live in the Southeastern United States very close to the Tennessee River (a quarter mile at best), and there is a creek that flows into it across the street from my house.  No matter what the local street or parks department does with regards to mosquito control, we are going to have mosquitoes in my neighborhood.  I, also, have ADHD, even being 65, and with ADHD one usually has something that they hate, and for me, it is the itching from mosquito bites.Over the years, I have learned a lot about mosquitoes, and I'll get to that later, but let's talk about REPEL Sportsmen Dry Aerosol Spray.  I try not to use a lot of mosquito spray.  Namely, because it seems you have to use sprays with a higher amount of DEET to keep the mosquitoes away, and I'm concerned about the sprays I have been using (Off and Cutter sprays).  It seems when I use them, and their spray gets close to my Casio watches, and their plastic bands, the plastic gets ""gummy,"" and I've even had the writing on one of the watches wipe completely off when I wiped the excess spray off of the watch.  I tried wearing long sleeve shirts and just spraying the shirts, but I still got stung.About three years ago, I visited a friend who has terrible allergies.  He's allergic to medicines, to foods, to odors.  Before I could visit, I had to wash all the clothes I was going to be wear down at his place, in the country no less, and bathe in a Hunters Soap Scent-A-Way 32 oz. Deodorizing Liquid Soap  for several days before I came.  When I got down there, it wasn't but a few minutes after sundown that I noticed something different.  The mosquitoes weren't attacking me.  I asked him if he did anything knowing I hate having mosquito bites.  He said he didn't, it was from my clothes not having any heavy scents that attracted the mosquitoes.  While the mosquitoes later that night did attack me, it was not like anything like back home.  When I got back home, I continued to use the soap, and it helps. There is nothing like talking to a neighbor, and you've put a little mosquito spray on, and additionally have not ""scents"" that attract the mosquitoes. Usually, it is the second night you're talking with them, and they are swatting at any and everything, and you are not having any issues, that you tell them your secret.With regards to REPEL's Sportsmen Dry Spray, it doesn't really spray on ""dry,"" but the spray isn't quite as ""greasy"" as the other sprays I have used (both aerosols or out of a spray bottle).  Testing REPEL's Dry Aerosol Spray by spraying it on my Casio watch Casio Men's PAW1500-1V ""Pathfinder"" Multi-Function Digital Watch did not make my watch's plastic band or resin case have a ""gummy"" feeling like the other sprays, and the spray was easier to wipe off, afterwards, also.  I would highly recommend it for use.  The odor level is a lot less than the other sprays, and it seems, so far, to last for most of the day. I say ""so far"" because this year our weather decided to give us these last three weeks: snow for one week; ice storms for the second week; and rain this last week.  So, I haven't been out there in the yard as much as I normally would be t this time of year.  I did use it while washing the cars one night, in between rains, and I did not get bit.  With the DEET level at 25, that should hold off most bugsAround our neighborhood, mosquitoes tend to start coming-out of the ""woodwork,"" to speak, when the temperature goes higher than 65 degrees Fahrenheit.  This last year though, I noticed a new mosquito in the neighborhood.  I saw a couple of Asian Tiger Mosquitoes.  Supposively, they carry several diseases, and maybe a new one that will affect us called the ""Chikungunya Virus,"" that will affect one's bones and joints.If you hate mosquitoes, like I do, you have probably done all the things to limit their finding a ""home"" at your home: eliminating standing water, if you use mulch, or marble like I do, be sure there are no low places within your flower beds where water can collect under the mulch or rocks and breed mosquitoes.  Clean your gutters, or get those teflon-coated gutter guards that keep your gutters from having anything get into them and stopping them up.  Make sure all potted plants can drain any excess water from rain within a couple of hours.  Also, I found if you use a garden hose mosquito spray, be sure to spray the shady side of tree trunks, especially oak ones or any trees with thick bark.  Mosquitoes in our area, then to spend their days resting on these trunks.Like I said earlier, I am concerned about using a strong DEET spray, but I also know it is about the only thing that can work these days.  REPEL's Sportsmen Dry Aerosol Spray has shown me it is easier to use without damaging the plastic and resins on my watch, so I will be using it mainly in the early morning and late evening when mosquitoes tend to come-out to ""feed.""  By doing do, I will at least limit my use of the DEET 25 spray.  I gave this product 4 out of 5 stars, mainly not because it didn't work, but that it suggested it was ""Dry"" and wasn't.

"Recently, my television/Internet service was redone to make everything pass through WiFi.  Originally, about three-and-a-half years ago, I left the satellite television hook-up and went with AT&T's U-verse set-up of using WiFi for televisions (5) and Internet within the house.  The first installation had fiber optic coming into the house, then a hardwire between a downstairs modem and an upstairs modem.  I piggy-backed on it to provide an extra layer of WiFi using Apple's Airport Extreme downstairs and Apple's Airport Express upstairs because it gave me greater control of the WiFi, and it was faster.When the tech guy replaced the hard wire between a new upstairs and downstairs modem, he told me that I should expect to see higher data transfer speeds.  I'm not from Missouri, but I bit my lip, and didn't say, ""Show me.""  He did a good job, and the TV signal was even stronger, so I accepted it; however, the downloads of data were noticeably slower.  Not cable modem slower when all the kids in the neighborhood come home from school, but about a third slower (9 Mbps versus 15Mbps).So, when I got a chance to test NETGEAR's N300 Wi-Fi Router, I jumped at the chance.  Over the last 15 years, I used several different Wi-Fi Routers (NETGEAR, Belkin, and about 7 years ago I went with Apple Airport Extreme and Apple Airport Express), this NETGEAR N300 was the easiest to set-up.  Actually, after thinking back on all the different ones I've set-up, this one was almost ""fun,"" and by that, I mean I just followed the five short steps on the instructions, and that was it.  No tweaking at all!  Those were:  1) Unplug the modem's power (it was just out of the box... already done), 2) Connect your modem by attaching a cable to the router's Internet port (I used a CAT5 I had to do this), 3) Power on the router with the adapter, 4) Connect a computer using Ethernet cable (I used the short CAT5 included to do this), 5) Log-in to the router (it said I should see NETGEAR's Genie display, I didn't, so I entered the URL www.routerlogin.net, and it found the N300 and connected it after I entered the password that was on the bottom of the N300).  You can, also, use WiFi to connect using the WiFi network name and password from the bottom on the N300.After doing this, I took the N300 and used the short CAT5 that was included to connect it to U-verse's WiFi.With my computer (Apple MacBook Pro) I downloaded the Genie app, and I was able to compare the signals of using my U-verse WiFi, the two Apple modems and the NETGEAR N300.  With up to 8 different computers and phones being used within my two story house, the signals can vary from moment-to-moment, but the signal strength of the NETGEAR was stronger (-13 dBm) versus U-verses (-39 dBm and -37 dBM).  The Apple units being the oldest were -59 dBM and -61 dBm.While I was upstairs in my bedroom, I went into VUDU and tested the download speed for movies, which I watch a lot, and while no one else was on their computers I got:  NETGEAR Download 17.70 Mbps Upload 1.82, U-Verse downstairs (the main WiFi) Download 15.51 Mbps Upload 1.79 Mbps, U-verse (upstairs extender) 14.08 Mbps Download 1.81 Mbps Upload.It may seem odd that the NETGEAR hooked-up to  U-Verse's WiFi modem would give me faster speeds, but five years ago, or maybe even longer than that, when I went with AT&T's satellite (DTV) and WiFi package the Apple Airports hooked-up to their WiFi modems were faster then, too.Besides the easy installation and faster speeds, I like three things about the NETGEAR N300:  1) the Genie.  It tells you about all your WiFi networks, 2) The ability to control use and times of use for computers and phones in your WiFi network (so your children won't be using the WiFi all the time for their games, and 3) It's price.  While I would imagine the new version of Apple's Airport Extreme would be a lot faster than the older Apple Extremes I am using, they cost about 6+ times more.I could not find anything about NETGEAR's N300 to complain about, and I can only recommend it.  I am very pleased that I have it as an extra layer of WiFi in my set-up as I feel the network is safer and, also, faster.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1VL7CN8D2OK0T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MRVJYEI#wasThisHelpful","R1VL7CN8D2OK0T","A969VLBBX8LQ7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A969VLBBX8LQ7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"For the past year I have been taking cabinet making/carpentry courses at my local community college, so when I saw I had a chance to review under Amazon's Vine Program a tape-measure, which is something I use probably 30-40 times a day in class, I jumped at the opportunity.Overall, I give this tape measure only two stars.  One star is the lowest you can give a reviewed product, and I give it an extra star because it is heavy-duty.  Compared with the other tape measures out there, it is accurate, but please be advised that none of the markings on the tape measure less than an inch are marked.  Like most tape measures, the first 12 inches are divided into 32nds.  Additionally, it has a sliding tip, so the tape can be pushed against a piece you are measuring or attached around an end piece and still give an accurate measurement.  The tape is of a non-reflective, glare resistant, silver/grey color with black markings.  These are the positive points about this tape measure.On the negative side, the idea about having a graphite ""lead"" that slides-in at the opening area so as to mark a distance the tape is from the end is a good idea. If you enlarge the picture of the tape measure, you will see on the front side of the tape measure a red spring mechanism. You pull-up on it and lock it into place while you push one of the thin leads through a hole at the top.  Once you push the lead piece down, you release the red spring mechanism, and this keeps constant pressure pushing down on the lead.  The lead rubs against a scored metal wheel that rolls as you move the tape measure sideways across whatever you are wanting to mark.For example, let's say you need to cut a 4 foot x 8 foot piece of plywood in half (making two 4 x 4 pieces). The way you would use this to mark where you cut it would be for you to  pull the tape measure out four feet, less a little because the line where the lead will mark is located inside from the edge of the tape measure where the tape rolls up into the container.  At first, I thought one moved the tape measure sideways across the lumber leaving a solid line, but doing so, you actually only put down a semi-solid line (more about this later), and this causes you to use up the whole the lead piece in 9-12 inches.  So, I'm thinking, to save lead, you make a slight mark at one edge; then, a slight mark in the middle of the plywood; and, finally, a mark at the other edge.  Then, you take a straight edge and connect those three marks.  Next you do your sawing. Otherwise, you would use at least four of the pieces of leads to make a four foot line across the plywood.As for the ""mark"" the lead puts down, it is barely visible at times, and I ended-up having to press hard on the wood to get it to leave down a consistent mark, which if you are using soft wood or plywood, leaves a scored mark on the wood.  This isn't too bad of a mark by itself, but if I just wanted to go by a marked embedded by the metal scored wheel, I'd forget about using the lead.As for the package that claims you can make ""1000+ Marks Per Load?""  Forget it.  In actuality, to do so must mean each mark must be like the tip of a pencil mark because after moving the tape measure sideways 10 inches, and leaving a faint pencil mark for those 10 inches, the lead is used up.  It is quicker and easier to use a traditional tape measure to do the marking, and a heavy-duty tape measure would cost about one-half the cost of the QuickDraw.Quite frankly, I don't know how this product is getting all the positive reviews (sometimes one can click on the reviewer and you find-out the only item they've ever reviewed on here is the one they are giving the ""great"" review about, which makes you wonder, sometimes not), but I'll leave that up to others to figure-out.Over the years I have mainly used a Stanley 25 foot Powerlock tape measure Stanley 33-425 Powerlock 25-Foot by 1-Inch Measuring Tape - Original, and I have even, on occasion, used Stanley's Fax Max, if I was needing it to have to stretch quite a distance Stanley 33-725 25-Feet FatMax Tape Measure, but when I started my cabinet making class 14 months ago, I noticed the Komelon 25 foot Tape Measure with the sliding, magnetic end Komelon 7125 Monster MagGrip 25-Foot Measuring Tape with Magnetic End.  Since I was going to be in a cabinet making class of 20 people, I thought it's ugly green color might help me keep it from ""walking off,"" if you know what I mean.  So far so good.  I've used it thousands of times, dropped it way too many times, and it's still working fine, and its magnetic tip, while something I only use a couple of times a month, is useful to have, especially in the big box store's lumber area where they use metal stands for the lumber.  I can affix the tape measure tip against the metal end of the lumber stand, and then stretch the tape lengthwise to measure odd pieces to see exactly how long they are.Additionally, with my tape measure, I have it securely clipped to my belt and sometimes bib overalls pocket using a MagnoGrip 002-290 Tape Measure Holder MagnoGrip 002-290 Quick Snap Magnetic Tape Measure Holder.  This allows me to reach down, without looking, and bring-up my tape measure in a second, unlike if I had used the belt clip or the Tape Measure Holder I had previously used since the 1970's Custom Leathercraft 464 16-30 Top Grain Measuring Tape Holder. There have been a couple of times I absentmindedly didn't return the tape to the magnets, and the tape measure dropped, and I wish I'd gotten the MagnoGrip 002-320, MagnoGrip 002-320 Quick Snap Magnetic Tape Measure Holder, but I have found this holder to be a quick way to access ones tape measure, and speed is counts with most employers, and teachers.When one does these reviews for Amazon through their Vine Program, you always hope that the product is a great one; however, in this instance, I cannot recommend it.  I do hope I've given you enough alternatives, though.","2.0 out of 5 stars","February 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RE1AF8MAPWVNV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00P14T90W#wasThisHelpful","RE1AF8MAPWVNV","A969VLBBX8LQ7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A969VLBBX8LQ7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There are two general types of cases for the iPhone 6 Plus: the padded wrap-around clip-case, like the Otterbox, that sometimes has a belt clip, and the Folio.  With the increase in size of the iPhone 6 Plus, the Folio-type, like this Belkin, makes more sense because it protects the iPhone, especially when it is dropped, and offers the user the ability to prop it up on its side to use and view.The Belkin case holder is curved and wraps around the edges of the iPhone, and by doing so, holds it securely.  The case has a cover that is magnetized, and when dropped, I found, would close and protect the iPhone.  A lot was made initially about the iPhone 6 Plus bending when it first came-out. While I didn't notice this as being a problem unless you put it in your back pocket and sat on it, the Belkin case gives the phone additional support.Overall, I thought the case looked very smart and business-like, although with the phone getting this large, it is more difficult to pocket it in ones trousers, but fits nicely in ones inside suit/sport coat pocket or front coat pocket.To me, this case is very good protection for ones iPhone 6 Plus.  It is not a total protection as you will still need to put a protective sheet over the screen to keep that from getting accidentally scratched, that's why I gave it four stars, but overall it is stylish and does the job if one is careful with it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RD9866XIO90ON/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NM9OCBO#wasThisHelpful","RD9866XIO90ON","A969VLBBX8LQ7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A969VLBBX8LQ7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"David Pogue has been putting together ""Missing"" manuals ever since, well, the manuals started going missing.  For some folks, these missing manuals were 'all right,' as they only looked at the manual as a last resort, and I have to admit, I was one of those, but as I get older, I find more and more folks asking me for advice on how to do things with their electronic devices and computers, that I neither want to do, nor even care about knowing they can be done, but wish I knew just to get my friends off my back.  David Pogue's manual's serve the purpose of being able to answer their questions, and occasionally mine, quickly and efficiently.  While similar in theory to the ""Step-by-Step"" series Microsoft started years ago as a means of, well, making more money, Pogue's books always seemed to cost less and have just the right number of words needed in order to communicate how a task was done.Even better, I see that this manual has color screen prints.  Having read through it, and researched several problems I, and others, encountered, I found the solutions easy to follow, and I found them, which is better than some books that seem to only lightly touch on the most obvious issues one might have.I highly recommend iPhone: The Missing Manual.

"In ALFRED HITCHCOCK: THE MAN WHO KNEW TOO MUCH, Michael Woods has penned an interesting short, 120+ pages, book on Hitchcock.  Unlike some books on the great director that often explore his quirks to the extent that you almost hate to go see another of his movies, this one is less thorough, but more enjoyable.

"I enjoyed Patricia Cornwell's latest Scarpetta novel, FLESH AND BLOOD.  It was fun to be reunited with old friends like Marino, Kay and Lucy.  From the beginning, each one of them has the feeling that something isn't quite right, but being crime fighters, they must have proof.  They can't go on their gut feelings.Marion ""knows"" that the sniper killing in Kay's neighborhood is related to the ones in New Jersey; Kay ""knows"" that Lucy has a problem with her partner, but isn't ready to talk, yet, or ""spill the Boston beans.""  Lucy ""knows"" that someone has been in her computer, but that cannot happen since Lucy is the top computer/crime prevention guru in the country.As Lucy traces strange E-mail messages and Tweets, the connections between all of these odd events seem to be connected on one way or another to Kay and cases at the Cambridge Forensic Center.  Benton has been working with Lucy on the computer traces and thinks someone is sabotaging Lucy's network.As the novel progresses, Cornwell, the author, feeds us the pieces of the puzzle, and we begin to put the coincidences together for the complete picture.  If you are a Scarpetta fan, you will be racking your brain for someone from a previous book to blame for all the problems.The ending isn't quite as exciting as the fight at the Crystal Carbon2 plant freezing room in THE BONE BED, but I would rate it in the top third of all the books.FLESH AND BLOOD: A SCARPETTA NOVEL  was delightful reading that I would gladly recommend to all her fans.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1FD4N0UDUDN8Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062325345#wasThisHelpful","R1FD4N0UDUDN8Q","A969VLBBX8LQ7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A969VLBBX8LQ7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"As a replacement battery, the LENMAR Replacement Battery for Samsung Galaxy S5 is very good.  In testing this one, while streaming video, music, posting on Facebook, I got between 14 and 15 hours of continued use the three times I used it (14.1, 15.0, 14.6 hours).  With the OEM (Original Equipment Manufacturer) battery, I got 17-18 hours use (17.2, 17.5 and 17.9) .  I know, sometimes, it is difficult finding the exact original battery, so this would make a great substitute.One thing I noticed, though, is that while Samsung has a list price of $29.99, you can find it here on Amazon, in Non-Retail Packaging for much less, Samsung OEM 2800 mAh Standard Battery for Samsung Galaxy S5 - Non-Retail Packaging - Black, but be wary as those do not seem to come with any warranty, and the LENMAR has a one-year warranty, which makes me think something might be amiss for OEM lower priced items, like gray market merchandise.  While I have no knowledge of this, you may want to research anything you buy further before purchasing.Another thing, though, the OEM battery clearly states ""This battery is equipped with an NFC antenna, allowing your handset to communicate with other devices and accessories equipped with NFC technology.""  Neither the lower priced Non-Retail battery, listed above, nor the LENMAR say they have NFC capability, even though the product number for Non-Retail is the same as for the Retail model.  I hope I didn't make this more confusing than it needs to be, but, to me, NFC is something good to have as it allows payments from your phone, printing directly to printers, and other capabilities.All-in-all, for it's price, and with its one-year warranty, the LENMAR Replacement Battery for Samsung Galaxy S5 is a good buy if NFC capabilities is not a priority for you.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2WN75E2C898TL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KQ038AS#wasThisHelpful","R2WN75E2C898TL","A969VLBBX8LQ7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A969VLBBX8LQ7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Have you ever bought someone something, and you seem to get ""stuck"" with solving all the problems they have with it afterwards?  Seven years ago, I bought my step-daughter a Honda Element, EX version.  Along the roof rack, skirts below the doors, along the front fenders and bumper and rear fender and bumper are heavy black vinyl areas.  Over the years, I've used Armour All-type liquids and even tire-black stuff to keep it looking ""newish.""  Most work for around three weeks before the vinyl starts fading back to the soft black, almost dark gray color.Turtle Wax Premium Trim Coating Kit is not like any of those products.  If you have ever had a diesel vehicle and changed the oil yourself, you know what a mess that is, with the oil changing from a rich, thick oil, to a black, thin liquid that discolors your skin wherever it touches you.  This Turtle Wax Premium Trim Coating is very much like that thin liquid your diesel oil becomes.To put it on, you use a  rectangular sponge applicator, much like that provided to re-blacken your tires.  Do yourself a favor, and buy yourself a thick pair of kitchen gloves to apply the liquid, it just might keep it off your hands, but forget those ""gloves"" Turtle Wax provides with the product.  Getting the dirty liquid off your hands afterwards will take some Goop or scrubing with Lava soap.  I sprayed some WD-40 on my hands, and it seemed to help, if you have an adversion to getting your hands dirty.  I would especially recommend you spray the WD-40 underneath your nails, as those areas were the hardest to clean.Turtle Wax recommends you cut the applicator sponge in half if you want to be meticulous in your application of the coating, but I found if you take the ""black"" watery liquid and run it around the sponge just inside the outside edge, it allows you to apply the coating right-up-to-the edge of the vinyl plastic.I have only had the coating on the trim for a week, and only time will tell if one can go ""up to a year"" before reapplying, so I'll be updating this review later, but the coating does it's job.  It does ""rub"" off the first couple of days, but after it initially dries, it looses any shine, but it retains a dark, black hue that reminds you of how the vehicle looked when you first bought it.On the Element, there is a lot of trim to coat.  For me, it took about 1/3rd of the bottle to coat everything.  If it lasts six months or longer, I would say it is worth the cost and the effort.  Hopefully, by the time a reapplication of the coating is needed, my stepdaughter will desire to do this by herself.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1JS4U0FZ03GCW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IOBSZJK#wasThisHelpful","R1JS4U0FZ03GCW","A969VLBBX8LQ7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A969VLBBX8LQ7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As someone who had to endure waking-up at all hours in the past to listen to ""Just a Minute"" over the shortwave, WELCOME TO JUST A MINUTE! A CELEBRATION OF BRITAIN'S BEST-LOVED RADIO COMEDY is a utterly delightful book that provides fans with a complete and thorough history of the program.  Unfortunately, in 2005 or so, the BBC decided to stop broadcasting the show over shortwave, and one was forced to listen to it, when available, by a computer.  While this was disappointing, as you didn't get the feeling of listening to it as it was being broadcast,If you have ever listened to the broadcast, or are just a fan of British humor, you will enjoy reading about the show, as it gives a rich history of how the BBC has evolved over the years.Nicholas Parsons begins by telling the development of the concept of the show by Ian Messiter from a previous show Mr. Messiter developed titled ""One Minute Please!""No part in the development of the show is spared as we are given whole sections of the BBC's style-type guide, called ""The Little Green Book,"" in-house reviews of those first programs, and the thoughts behind the ""tweaking"" of the program as it is changed to its current format. The reader learns why changes were made, and the book truly gives one insight into the creative process at the BBC, which for me was fascinating.Included in the book are whole sections discussing the panelist's thoughts on the program and throughout are pages in which most of the panelists who have appeared on the show are discussed, with many of their appearances on the program detailed in word-for-word exchanges. Years ago, I found somewhere on the Internet a site devoted to episodes of ""Just a Minute"" listed as mp3 files. Playing those individual audio program files as I read the exchanges in the book added another dimension to my reading.  Another way I have found to listen to the show is through a phone app called TuneIn Radio.  One just searches for ""Just a Minute,"" and it plays non-stop.The book progresses on a linear time-line through the 47 years, with each decade in which the program has been broadcast being a separate section. Each decade includes a remembrance written by one of the panelists, and I found each of these fascinating.In the preface Mr. Parsons writes, ""These are the people, who throughout 47 years and counting, have propelled ""Just a Minute"" forward with panache and style,"" it is clearly evident that it is his panache and style that has made ""Just a Minute"" the comedic institution it is.(Just a minor disclosure. In the UK version of this book, on page 428, there is a ""George McAdams"" referenced. That is me. I still am upset that one must have a computer or telephone to listen to ""Just a Minute,"" and it is no longer on shortwave, even though shortwave broadcasts to the States have been curtailed, also, but life goes on.)","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 3, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3K8ECTVWD138X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1782112472#wasThisHelpful","R3K8ECTVWD138X","A969VLBBX8LQ7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A969VLBBX8LQ7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The Eureka is a heavy vacuum and isn't self-powered, but it does a good job getting the carpets clean. It's hand attachment has given us more problems than it is worth.  My wife has complaints about both vacuums, so I jumped at the chance to test this Hoover Windtunnel 3 Pro.  When I tested the Kirby against the Eureka, I would use one, and then vacuum again with the other.  The Eureka showed it picked-up dirt and dust that the Kirby left, but it was a pain to push around.The Hoover Windtunnel 3 Pro has four rug settings and a hardwood setting.  The first thing I noticed is it's very light.  I was concerned that it might not get up as much dirt and lint from the You can activate the brush feature or not for all settings.  When you have it set to the hardwood floor setting, it does a good job getting-up 95% of the dirt and dust, and you get the rest by running over the area from one side of the room to the other, instead of up-and-down.  On thin carpets, it is not difficult to push the Hoover without the brushes turning.  If you have the brushes turning, you actually need to have the brush height set to 3 or 4, out of 4, to have the vacuum pull the vacuum, and you just have to guide it.  With it set at 1 or 2, you have to exert more to get the vacuum going, and it pulls you across the carpet.  Pulling it back isn't difficult.The Hoover had many of the same features that the Eureka has, but you could tell more forethought went into it.  The Eureka hand head would often clog-up  and have long hair tangle-up the brush.  It had a way of opening it up, but it was easy to put it back together wrong.  The Hoover has easy to snap open head and it was easy to remove any long hairs.  The Hoover Windtunnel also had a ""lock"" mechanism on the hose that kept it in place, which I found better than most vacuums.On the negative side, I noticed when you had the brush height set to 3 or 4, there was an odor that seems like the belts are slipping.  Even after a number of days use, this was as odor that you would still have, and it took a while to dissipate after you finished vacuuming.  After three months of using this vacuum, the odor is no longer present.  Besides the power brush hand attachment, the Hoover only comes with a crevice tool that is more of a crevice ""pointer,"" instead of the universal crevice tool most vacuums have come with since the 1950's, and what I thought was the world's smallest brush attachment.  It was pathetic.As for the value of being bagless. I liked seeing the dust come into the dirt chamber.  I found it pretty easy to clean; however, there is additional care needed for the user, so I'm thinking what you gained, you lost something else.  After three months of use, I found the ""bagless"" feature not as enduring.  In fact, it make cleaning the chamber-out thoroughly almost a necessity.  You can take the chamber off, rinse it out, then let it dry overnight, and its not too bad.  Since it is bagless, you have a HEPA filter, which needs to be backflushed every four thorough vacuuming of the house.I do find myself using the Hoover more because of its light weight.  Would I buy this vacuum if I needed one?  No, although I liked some of its features.  I would look at another Hoover with more advanced features because we tend to keep vacuums for 10-20 years, if not longer.  If it was easier to clean and had a better attachment, I would have given the Hoover Windtunnel 3 Pro five stars rating.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2G9QXLANCQII6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EEJUH56#wasThisHelpful","R2G9QXLANCQII6","A969VLBBX8LQ7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A969VLBBX8LQ7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Bear with me on this review because I have been dealing with protector shields for almost 12 years.  I have been using smartphones since the early 2000's, starting with the Samsung SCH-i730, followed by an AT&T Tilt, a Samsung Jack 2, iPhones 3, 4, and 4S.  From the very beginning I had trouble with the screens needing protection, and I started using the clear plastic shields one could buy for your photo iPods to keep the screens from getting scratched.  Most of those you cut with scissors to a fairly ""close"" size, and they adhered with an adhesive that was thick and gummy.  The plastic was thicker than that of the MIcra Digital Anti-Glare Screen Protector, which was nice because you could poke it quite a bit without it getting scratched.  On the negative side, if you got any bubbles under the plastic, you had to work the plastic for several days to get all the bubbles out, and even then, somehow they reappeared.With my iPods, I started buying Otterbox cases to protect them from the beginning, and when I went to the iPhones, I continued to buy their Defender cases, OtterBox Defender Series Case and Holster for iPhone 4/4S  - Retail Packaging - Black, but I found I had a new problem.  The Otterbox case had its own plastic shield, which initially seemed nice, but given that the case wasn't waterproof, it only offered a little help, at least, until the areas where your favorite apps were picked-up scratches on their shield.What I have done, now, has been to remove Otterbox's plastic shield, after it's one year warranty has expired, and placed my own screen protector.  In the past I had to find one that fit, and I ran into a problem.  If the shield was too thick, it was harder to swipe and punch-in your selection or choice.  It seems that the thickness reduced the conductivity of your finger pressure for swiping and double punching.  If the plastic was too thin, it streaked or scratched easier.I have used several different brands of screen protectors, and when I saw I could test the Micra Digital Anti-Glare Screen Protector for my iPhone 4S, I jumped at the chance.  I found these protectors to be cut exactly the size you need; I found them to reduce the glare more than some of the other screen protectors and much better than just the Otterbox by itself.This year I went back to school to take cabinet making, and having to place stripes and other templates exactly right on furniture, I found these screen protectors easy to install. I, also, found the picture instructions included with the protectors lacking, so I will expand them below to make it, hopefully, easier to install.1) Start with a clean surface on your phone, no matter whatever type of phone you are using.  If there are any smudges on your iPhone, you will have to deal with smudges after installation. Use a clean, cotton, lint-free cloth like you'd use on your furniture for dusting to get it smudge-free.  Do not spray anything like Windex that has ammonia on it.  If your phone is so grimy you need to use a glass cleaner, use an ammonia-free cleaner by first putting just a little on your cloth, and then apply it to the GLASS surfaces. DO NOT APPLY any of it to your switch or volume buttons.2)  Next, take one of the screen protectors, and without removing the thin plastic shield that go over the sticky side of the protector, practice curling it up like it shows on the very inadequate picture instructions supplied with the protectors. Place the phone on a surface that will not scratch the surface of the phone, yet, it will not allow the phone easily to slide about.  I know that sounds impossible, but this will help.  Just curl-up the protector a couple of times, press it down on an invisible line that goes up-and-down the center of the from from the bottom to the top.  I used the ""Home"" button at the bottom as your guide because it is easier to center it there.  One time, I actually placed the index finger tip of my other hand on the ""Home"" button, and held the protector down as I moved it up to the top of the phone, but it only worked easily one time for me.3)  Once you are comfortable after a couple of test runs, peel off the thin plastic that covers the sticky side of the screen protector.  If you run your finger up the middle of the curved protector, then, press the protector down from the middle to the outside of the protector, most of your bubbles will vanish.I found these screen shields did help reduce glare.  Adjust the brightness of your screen to where you can see it best in the type of light you view your phone's screen the most. Remember, though, the brighter you have the screen, the more battery energy you will be using.I recommend these screen protectors.  You may have to change them every-so-often, but given their responsiveness to your touch, I cannot find much about them not to recommend.Two other tricks for iPhones and, actually any phones.  First, my stepdaughter has issues with getting electronic stuff wet.  Start saving those silica packets that often come in medicine bottles and put them aside in an air-proof bottle.  If they drop their phone or iPod in water, first dry it off ASAP] if it has a battery you can remove, remove it; next place it in a Zip-Lock freezer bag along with all the silica packets you have; leave it for at least 12 hours if barely gotten wet, longer if it got really soaked.  I revived several electronic devices, iPods, a Samsung Jack, etc. by doing this.  I did not immediately give them back the device they almost ruined.  I went let them have several days of doing without to help teach them the severity of their carelessness.  Second, with the iPhone 4, she started having problems with the On-Off switch at the top not working.  It was only after it stopped working, did she tell me about it.  I was able to restore it using a contact cleaner like Hosa Cable D5S6 Deoxit Contact Cleaner Spray that I bought from Radio Shack, and you can get here at Amazon.  Had she told me she was having a problem with it when it first occurred, the cleaner could have fixed it immediately.  Since she didn't, It took working with it for a couple of days.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 3, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R24QA1O6LFEHA9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KQT0Q68#wasThisHelpful","R24QA1O6LFEHA9","A969VLBBX8LQ7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A969VLBBX8LQ7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When I first saw Kernel Season's Bacon Cheddar Popcorn Seasoning flavor available on our grocery shelf, I passed.  This past year I decided to give it a try and found it an excellent topping for a baked or microwaved potato or even as an addition to sour cream, regular or low-fat, to make a tasty dip.As with all Kernel Season's products, I have found after a couple of weeks they tend to ""clump-up.""  No matter if you use something (ice pick or knife) to break the seasoning up, again, it tends to have lost some of its zest.  Bacon Cheddar actually ""clumps"" up faster, but if after opening the seasoning, you put it in the refrigerator, you will find it keeps fresh longer, which is, I guess, what they may have meant when they said ""store in a cool, dry place.""","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1KL5UDOFFIL3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0083PWO3K#wasThisHelpful","R1KL5UDOFFIL3","A969VLBBX8LQ7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A969VLBBX8LQ7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"MLB Slammin' Sluggers Baseball Game is just that, a game for ""slamming sluggers.""  I am old enough to remember the metal baseball game we played as kids in the late 1950's, and this one is so much better.  The game requires a certain amount of skill from the person who fields both the pitcher and fielders, and the person doing the hitting.  The player controlling the pitching, can guess which way the batter will hit the ball based on how fast they pitch the metal ball towards the batter. With a magnetic field between the pitcher's mound and home plate, the ball, if pitched slow enough, the metal ball can curve, but throw the metal ball too slow, and it might never reach the batter.  For me, hitting with the batter's bat was harder than I thought it would be, but once you get into a groove, it does get easier.The game is fun for adults with children tendencies, and children older than 8 or so because the plastic players show they've got to be handled with care, or the pegs on the bottoms of the player's feet will lose their grooves and the players will start falling over.  Children younger 7 and younger might not be able to handle the plastic players careful enough to avoid breaking something.While one could find a number of things to complain about with this game, the major one for me was the lack of instructions on putting everything together.  So, keep the box handy, you are going to need it.  The instructions on playing the game are just a tad better, but eventually you'll be able to figure it out.Would I buy this game for my children or other children, ""Yes,"" if they were into baseball. If they aren't into baseball, this game will not get them excited about baseball, and I wouldn't.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R33QXACJ4VNQHY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IZ604TS#wasThisHelpful","R33QXACJ4VNQHY","A969VLBBX8LQ7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A969VLBBX8LQ7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the third D-Link Wi-Fi camera I have reviewed for Amazon, and the most complicated of the three.  The other two I have reviewed are the D-Link Wireless and D-Link HD Pan and Tilt.Like the other two the Baby Cam has natural and infrared lighting settings and an iPhone app that fairly easy to set-up, but like the other two it lacks instructions to tell you what the heck you can do with it.  While the other two camera basically just gave you a picture of what was happening on the other end, the Baby Cam, with its music, two way conversation and other settings, needs give you more info.  I can understand why it doesn't, because like most ""apps,"" instructions are only good until the next update of the app.  However, it sure does make life difficult, especially, if you had an issue with your settings, and you have to do a ""reinstall.""  For this reason, I am uploading a number of pictures that show the various settings as of September 1, 2014.  Other than those, pictures, though, here are some comments on the installation:If you have used D-Line cameras before, and the ""D-Link Lite"" app, you cannot use the same D-Link account for the ""Baby Cam.""  It was only after I got almost through the install because this became apparent.  If you do not have a D-Link account already active, the normal installation instructions are almost foolproof.  For an iPhone, the instructions will take you through setting-up a Wi-Fi link between the camera and your Baby Cam's Wi-Fi, be sure to look past the blank pages and get the passcode and MAC address on the little folder they provide.  You don't need the MAC address at first, but you may need to use it if the app doesn't work.  If you do have a D-Link account already, you need to be prepared with a different E-mail address to set-up a separate D-Link account.  This is because the Baby Cam shares so much more information.  On the down side, some Wi-Fi out in the general public areas, like restaurants, hospitals, etc., might not be fast enough to support the interchange of data with the Baby Cam.After you have linked the phone with the Baby Cam, it will have you link your Baby Cam with your Wi-Fi network, so you can view your Baby Cam's picture away from your home or the proximity of the Baby Cam.The installation, I've installed this camera 6 or 7 times, is generally correct, and it will give you settings that will work; however, if the settings get screwed-up, save yourself some time and just ""reset the default"" settings.  Any adjustment you do, isn't really shown that you've achieved it.  Several times, I kept making adjustments, and I had no idea if I had adjusted anything.  If you do have a reinstall, do not be alarmed if you do not have to reenter your passcode, as it seems to have kept this, no matter if you perform a ""hard"" reset or not.In summation, if you already have a D-Link camera or a D-Link account, you will have to establish a different account, using a different E-mail address when you install the Baby Cam, and just follow the iPhone's app instructions.  They tend to be fine.  If your play with the settings, don't try to reverse your adjustments, because you cannot tell if they settings worked or not.  Just reset camera to ""Default Settings,"" and give it another shot.  I will post pictures with notes over the next two days.  Do I like the Baby Cam, ""Yes,"" even though I do not have any children.  I plan to use mine to communicate with my wife while she's using her computer at home.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RYT5A9ZWCOBW2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JUQSH5U#wasThisHelpful","RYT5A9ZWCOBW2","A969VLBBX8LQ7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A969VLBBX8LQ7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Thinkware's F550 Dashboard Camera is an excellent piece of equipment.  Solidly made, it attaches to the front windshield behind the rearview mirror easily with its easy-on, easy-off slide clip.  I was concerned that it might interfere with the reception of my AM/FM radio, but I couldn't hear any interference as the power cable is quite thick, and my radio seemed to pick-up the same stations.  I did not like the way you had to run the power cord from the power plug around the windshield.  Quite frankly, in the car it looks a little tacky, but after a while you forget it is there.They supply you with 16 GB micro-size memory card for use with the camera and a larger SD size shell for inserting the micro card for reading in most computers.  Along with this micro memory card is a little ""reader"" for getting the micro card in and out, that, I guess, is useful if you are clumsy with your hands, and you have big fingers. I didn't need it, but I could see where someone might.When you are installing the Dashboard Camera, it seems like it is going in backwards, but that's because one is attaching it to the slope of the windshield with the bulk of the camera to the side of the lens.  You want to attached the mount first to the camera and then both to the windshield because it is easier to handle them.  After first cleaning the inside of my windshield, I made two ""x's"" with a dry marker to show where I wanted the bottom corners to be, THEN I took the protective tape from the back of the mount and attached the adhesive side of the mount to the windshield.  In my windshield, I have a built-in antennae for AM/FM reception, so I had to make sure the camera was attached in a manner where the wires for the antennae were not obstructing the view of the camera lens.  The buttons to turn on the unit and adjust the volume of microphone and speaker are separated by a manual record button that is a totally different size button, which is very helpful so you don't press the wrong one because it is almost impossible to tell what button is for what from more than 2 feet away.  The camera rotates easily, yet, it is clearly notched so that it will not rotate on its own.  If your vehicle sometimes handles a heavy load and you have weak rear springs, you may need to adjust the camera angle when you have a heavy load.I haven't done anything that has automatically turned-on the unit, but I will try to post something that shows what the picture will look like.  Given that the unit turns itself on when there is a jarring movement, we'll just have to wait and see if it does.  You might want to make a mental note about what to say or not say if you are in an accident, since it will record sound, too.Overall, if I lived in a city environment where it could be expected that I would be in an accident, I would probably have one of these, but off-hand, I think these are best mounted in business vehicles, especially if you have a driver who has already had an accident.  I will say that having this unit in my car along with my radar detector, my vehicle is beginning to take on the appearance of an unmarked police unit.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R38RT7CIT9DXAV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JPCK39M#wasThisHelpful","R38RT7CIT9DXAV","A969VLBBX8LQ7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A969VLBBX8LQ7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"When I look for Anti-Virus protection in a business application, I look for three main qualities:  1)  It has to provide great Anti-Virus Protection and update itself regularly., 2)  It has to let me monitor the other computers; telling me the others on the system are running their preventative maintenance programs regularly, and 3) Provide answers to me when there is a problem.I have been using Norton's 360 (PC) and Internet Security (Mac) for my computers for several years, using the Multi-Device package in which you can protect up to 5 PCs, Macs or Android devices.  I thought, with my 8 computers, this Small Business version would be a good package to review, since it seemed so similar to what I was doing now.  Unfortunately, downloading the program for a Mac proved to be a problem, as the instal program would download as a zip. It would next expand, only never to be found.  I kept getting the message that it could not download the support packages, ""check your Internet connect and try again later.""  (I uploaded this message as a customer image).I thought I might have an issue with my still having Internet Security on the Mac, so I deleted Internet Security, after all a fellow reviewer stated installing this version removed their current version and install this one.  That wasn't the issue as I continued to received the same ""cannot download the support packages...""  So, I tried to reinstall my former ""Multi-Device"" software only to be informed that the Operating System I use, Maverick, which is the latest version, is not supported by my previously used software, even though it has only been installed for 10 months.Historically, I tend to restore my computer every-so-often to get rid of all the clutter, and that includes reinstalling my Norton's, but this time when I reinstalled it using the same Key, it used another of my licenses.Something tells me Norton's is having problems with Apple's updated Operating System, and I cannot recommend this package if you use Macs, like I do.It would be helpful if Norton could post some detailed installation instructions, but given that the ""support packages"" aren't being installed, I guess we're sort of floating out there on our own.  BTW, Norton has updated how your account information is shown.  It used to show your first installation, the number of installs you had from that package, and clicking on a link would list those installs, and how many installs you had left.  Now, you have to click on ""Renew"" to get your computer installations and their install dates (you won't be renewed automatically if your automatic renewal switch isn't turned-on, though).Windows Vista made me an Apple customer, if more companies follow Norton's approach, I may have to change and go back to using Windows.  Given that 75% of my computers are Apple products, I cannot recommend this to Apple users.UPDATE (September 4, 2014):  I still have had problems installing the this software on Apple computers; however, when Norton's 360 Multi-Device began expiring on my other computers, you could use the ""Product Key"" to install this program.  When you did so, it uninstalled Norton's 360 and installed Norton's Anti-Virus, which is not quite the same complete program.  During the install of Norton's Anti-Virus, the account I set-up for its installation showed two previous attempts (an Apple and a PC installation attempt) to install it just using the instructions provided by the Norton's Small Business package had installed, even though they hadn't, thus leaving this 10 device package only usable on 8 computers even using this workaround.  Two days after I uninstalled Norton's 360 and installed Norton Small Business 0 10 Device, a box popped-up and asked me to name this computer.  Then, another box asked me to Set-up Norton Management.  When I used the account E-mail address and password I used to establish the Norton account for this installation, which was different from my other Norton Account, it told me this account does not include an N360 subscription.  I'm thinking this problem goes deeper than just a problem with Macs. I'll check on the Window's installations and see what happened.","2.0 out of 5 stars","July 31, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1BX3Y8W2SO4YL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JZNHU88#wasThisHelpful","R1BX3Y8W2SO4YL","A969VLBBX8LQ7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A969VLBBX8LQ7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have a number of tool sets, mainly because they are usually reasonably priced when sold as a set and have the tools I need to take care of most ""fix-it"" jobs around the house.  When I say I have a number of tool sets, I have three (Allied, Channel Lock, and Crescent). Of the three, I usually grabbed the Allied set when someone says, ""I need you to fix my ___ ,"" and I'm not sure which tools I will need.  I grab it because it has a little bit of everything, unfortunately, it has issues, which is why I chose to review Stanley's 210-piece Mixed Tool Set.First off, the Stanley Tool Set has a case unlike any I've ever seen.  With a ""turn it this way it's lock, this way it's open"" lock on the front of the case.  Gone are the clips that Allied and Crescent used to hold their case together, of which one of the four clips has fallen-off on each of those two sets.  This lock works, even when dropped from a three-foot height, which is about where one would be carrying it when taking it somewhere.  When those clips come undone, the case springs open and your nicely arranged tools get scattered.Opening the case, you see there is a place for everything, and everything is in its place.  The Stanley folks obviously looked at other tool cases before designing theirs because the means of holding-in the pieces isn't just to ""snap"" them into place, but, in the instance of the sockets, you have a ""bulge"" that sticks up on the bottom of the socket holder that makes your sockets held-in on three sides.  This reduces the chances your sockets will pop-out.  When I opened-up the case the first time the only tools displaced from their places were two screwdrivers, and I'm sure the USPS put the case through a challenging test before I received it.  Additional testing showed only one of the screwdrivers and the drywall cutter prone to being knocked loose by rough handling of the case.The second thing I noticed is that it has a good selection of tools.  For whatever reason, the other tool sets seemed to leave out one tool or another: would you believe that the Crescent set was the only one of the three that didn't have an adjustable ""Crescent"" wrench included?  There are sets of both standard and mm size hex wrenches, and they are enclosed in a thick plastic pouch designed to hold them.  Another thing is the Stanley tool set appears to have their Stanley tools in it.  Most of them are stamped with their product number.  So, you're getting Stanley quality, even if it is made in China.The third thing I noticed was the Stanley set had three ratchets (1/2. 1/4 and 1/8 inch sizes), where most only had two (Crescent had three).  That said, I did feel that Stanley should have had two additional pieces in their set: it did not have a 1/4 to 1/8th inch socket adapter, and it only had one 1/4 inch four-inch extension, but maybe that's just because of the type of fix-it jobs I do.  On the positive side, more times than not, I've needed that small ratchet for working in tight places than the longer extension, and I'm glad Stanley has it.On the negative side, I noticed the ""spinner,"" that's the drive nut screwdriver-type driver, had to take an adapter to connect the drive nuts and while I realize you could use a ratchet somehow to duplicate it in some cases, although driving bits would be difficult.  That said, just remember: while the holder for the adapter is rigid, you want to be sure not to misplace it.On the description of the contents of the Tool Kit, it lists four ratchets, but there are only three ratchets provided.  I checked with Stanley Customer Service (800-262-2161), and they said it must be a typo of some sorts as only three are in it.On the positive side, the Stanley Tool Kit does have a 6-inch Adjustable Wrench, a 16-foot tape, a no nonsense pair of needle-nose pliers, 8 wrenches and a nice mix of both standard and mm size sockets.  Customer Service reminded me to tell you that all of the contents, except for the case, have a life-time warranty.  For socket replacement warranties, you can call them.  For hand tool replacement, just E-mail them (google for the address).As for me, now that I have STANLEY'S 210-Piece MIXED TOOL SET, I'm going to take my 1/4 to 1/8-inch adapter and 1/4-inch four inch extension from my Allied set, put it in a Ziplock sandwich bag where the hex wrenches are stored, and sell my old tool kits ""As Is"" the next time I have a yard sale.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R26QLCKVFYVB90/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JN3FGA4#wasThisHelpful","R26QLCKVFYVB90","A969VLBBX8LQ7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A969VLBBX8LQ7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When one has children, or even people we mentor, we look for ways in which we can positively influence their lives and keep them on the positive track towards improving their lives.  Let's face it, life is not getting any easier, and as I look back on my 60 plus years, I sometimes see the problem may seem to be the same, but the solutions, or steps needed for a solution, are more demand and complex.  Knowledge of almost everything is replicating itself faster than we can keep up with it.  In NOTHING CHANGES UNTIL YOU DO, Mike Robbins uses what in the 1970's we would have called a ""Zen"" approach to look inwardly at solving life's problems in a way so that when we analyze and solve our problems, we'll do so in a way that will help us not repeat them.In addressing problems he and others have faced, Mr. Robbins pulls no punches, unlike some authors who seemingly have never made any mistakes, or at least admitted to making any mistakes.  Robbins addresses how it is easy for us to think we can go through life mistake free, but let's face it, if you ever stick your neck out, you will sometimes get it chopped off.  How one recovers is, in essence, this book, and in explaining this, through personal examples, he adds a layer of human compassion we should always try to maintain for ourselves and others.As I read it, I couldn't help but think of my father, who passed away almost 20 years ago.  Sometimes I think to myself, what I wouldn't give just to have one more week, even one more day, with my father to milk him for the wisdom that I know he had to achieve to get to his place in life.  With NOTHING CHANGES UNTIL YOU DO, I found the closest thing, so far, to duplicating some of that wisdom.  There were times in reading this book I felt my eyes swell-up, I found it that moving.  Other times, I smiled, as I came across something he learned that I had.All-in-all, I found this an excellent book to help anyone find themselves and develop their abilities to deal with life.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3PP6HK18YHANU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1401944558#wasThisHelpful","R3PP6HK18YHANU","A969VLBBX8LQ7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A969VLBBX8LQ7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As the author, Talayah Stovall, states, LIGHT BULB MOMENTS are those times in ones life when you are doing something, or trying to figure something out, when, suddenly, an idea comes to mind that give you an idea.  In her book, she goes through how she thought of different ideas or solutions to situations she encountered.  Some of these were serious situations, some minor in nature, but all showed how we should use them in solving problems we encounter, or may encounter, in our lives.I liked Ms. Stovall writing style and found her to be a gifted writer; however, I wish she had taken what were mostly vignettes or anecdotes and shown the reader how one builds on them to solve a problem.  An example of this is the story about how her grandfather, as he got older kept wanting to return to his Arkansas roots, and would try to break out of the house and start walking to Arkansas, 800 miles away.  After they had locked all the doors to the house and gates from the yard, grandfather found he could put two blocks, one on their side of the fence, the other on their neighbor's side of the fence, and using those, he could easily climb over the fence and make his escape.  Where did he find the blocks?  Well, they were in his neighbor's yard, and to get those blocks,  he went over the fence and brought back one to put it in their yard.  With this story, her point was how, sometimes, the ""blocks"" that keep us from achieving our goals are sometimes already accomplished, but we are too focused on a result, rather than the steps to achieve our goal.  This is a commendable lesson, but I wish she had taken this thought further and said something like, ""When we look to achieve a goal, we must first think of the steps needed, and decide if they are obtainable; next we need to...etc.""There are some ""Light Bulb Moments"" where she does this, but for me, they were too few and, as they say, too far between.  All-in-all, it is not a bad book; it is just that it could have been a better one, and for that, I've given it just four stars.  People who like her writing, will enjoy this book.  Others, like me, may wish she had expanded her premise further.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2DVKSLH8R1Z34/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1401943926#wasThisHelpful","R2DVKSLH8R1Z34","A969VLBBX8LQ7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A969VLBBX8LQ7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Sofia is a about a little girl, a commoner, until her mom marries the king and ... She's whisked off to the castle where she learns that looking like a princess is more difficult than it seems, and thus is the back story of Princess Sofia, featured on Disney Junior Channel.With Sophia the First's Royal Prep Character Collection, you get a very durable plastic collection of the young majesties of the Royal Prep (Princesses Maya, Jun, Clio, Hildegard, Vivian and Amber, along with Prince James), their fairy headmistresses (Flora, Fauna and Merryweather), and Mimimus the horse, Clover the Rabbit, and Crackle the Dragon.  A total of 13 friends.This collection, the most extensive one sold, will give your child and their friends hours of fun as they are able to build upon the television series into new adventures that are only limited by your child's, and her friends', imagination. Through the interactions of the characters, and extension of Sofia's television stories, children learn how to interact with each other.The actual pieces are flexible and highly detailed.  Like most small toys, I would not recommend you buy this if your child and their friends is under the age of three or haven't learned not to put toys in their mouths.  Of all the characters in the collection, Clover the Rabbit is the smallest.  If your child follows the Princess Sofia series, this collection is a great way to start their collection, as it provides Sofia and her friends, and you avoid ""piece meal"" purchases that often end up costing more.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RMI7AR4VWJW15/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IVP13NO#wasThisHelpful","RMI7AR4VWJW15","A969VLBBX8LQ7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A969VLBBX8LQ7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"With Marvel's ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" movie just around the corner, you knew there was going to be some serious marketing of toys.  While I was confused about the ""raccoon"" shown in the previews, my younger friends have assured me Rocket Raccoon was the ""real deal,"" and this action figure lives up to all its advertised to be.This is a fun toy, and while I won't say exactly how old I am, I had fun, and the kids I know had fun, too.  I tried to post a video that shows Rocket in action, but only photos can be uploaded, and I'm not quite ready to start posing video reviews.If there's anything I might say about the toy is that when it ""blasts"" away at its target and talks in a ""mean"" voice way, it really shakes.  The toy does balance, but most of the guys held it with one hand, while pressing the weapon making him talk (no profanity or even rough language, just rough sounding).The toy held-up well, but I wonder how it would do if I dropped it a lot.

"UPDATED:  Our family has used Kernel Season's seasonings on our popcorn for 7 or 8 years, and we were mainly a Nacho Cheddar family, but one day, while at the concessions counter at the theater, my stepdaughter asked if I was going to get any seasoning for the popcorn, and I took out my 2.85 oz. bottle of Nacho Cheddar.  Two guys behind the counter said, ""Wow, you've come prepared!""  Then, one suggested I try White Cheddar seasoning, and the other agreed, so we tried it.As expected, Kernel Season's White Cheddar was much milder in flavor, but it was noticeable enhancement to our popcorn, and we all like it.  I especially like how it did not seem to compete with the flavor of the Coke I was drinking when I went from eating popcorn to drinking Coke.  I still like ""Nacho Cheddar"" the best, but ""White Cheddar"" comes in a very close second.I would warn you, though, this is an 8.5 ounce bottle, and it is about three times larger than the one you find in your grocery store, so if you don't use it often, or live in a place with high humidity, be prepared for it to harden before you get anywhere near finishing the bottle.  Once it hardens, even if you break it up again with an ice pick, it won't have the same mellow flavor.Update:  One aspect about using Kernel Season's products is that after a couple of weeks they tend to ""clump-up.""  No matter if you use something (ice pick or knife) to break the seasoning up, again, it tends to have lost some of its zest.  If, after opening the seasoning you put it in the refrigerator, you will find it keeps fresh longer, which is, I guess, what they may have meant when they said ""store in a cool, dry place.""","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RNNG9V21JGV39/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00H727M96#wasThisHelpful","RNNG9V21JGV39","A969VLBBX8LQ7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A969VLBBX8LQ7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"UPDATED:  Our family has been using Kernel Season's seasoning for 7 or 8 years, and of the different flavors (White Cheddar, Ranch, Caramel, Bacon and Cheddar Cheese and the Garlic one) we like the Nacho Cheddar one the best.  Before the movie theaters started selling it at the concession stands, we would sneak into the theater some to sprinkle on our popcorn at the movies.  Nacho Cheddar's flavor is lively, without spoiling the flavor of ones soft drink.  With the name ""Nacho Cheddar, you'd think it would have a strong ""Mexican food"" type flavor, but it is just a hint of spice in it, with most of the flavor being ""cheddar.""

"One of the nicer aspects of the Internet is that we often come into contact with someone from the other side of the world, and we get to know them, without sometimes knowing them.  Such was the case of one of Sam Smith's band members, whom I have exchanged correspondence with via an iPhone app for almost two years.  After a while, I got this note from him last year asking me, ""Did you see me on the ""Grams"" the other night?'  At first I was puzzled, and after a exchange or two, I found-out he was in the band that played with Adele when she was on the Grammy Awards.  A month or so later, I saw him, again, with her when she sang on the Oscars, and was awarded the Oscar for ""Skyfall,"" the theme from the latest James Bond movie.Last fall, or so, he started telling me about Sam Smith, and how Sam was such an exceptional singer. In December 2013,  I received a video link to the album trailer for ""In the Lonely Hour,"" (Sam Smith - In The Lonely Hour (Album Trailer)) which sent me to YouTube where I saw an exceptional, though short, two minute video of Sam singing and recording the songs.  This fellow is an exceptional talent, with a voice that is as clear and resonate as any you have ever heard.  Since then, I've been aware of his playing in venues all over Europe, but I was truly surprised when his USA tour sold-out in days, and he was mostly playing large venues of more than 2,000!Given that I had seen him perform on videos songs such as ""Nirvana"" at Abbey Road, and ""Lay Me Down"" (Live) at Mercury Lounge, I halfway knew what to expect when I received the CD on the day it was released; however, I wondered if his strong stage presence would translate over to strictly audio.  After listening several times to each track, I can see where this debut album is going to be one that everyone will be remembering for many years to come.What is so nice about it is that Sam's voice isn't one of those ""one trick ponies"" that you get tired on hearing after a couple of plays  There is enough variety between the soulful tunes like ""Stay with Me"" and ""Make it to Me,"" to the dance-like rhythms of ""Money on my Mind"" and ""La La La,"" to almost demand repeated replays just to hear him hit a certain note or two.If there is one major theme of ""In the Lonely Hour,"" it is the lover's angst and pain heard in the words and voice as he sings ""Leave Your Lover,"" ""I'm Not the Only One,"" ""Like I Can,"" and ""Life Support.""  Before hearing this album, for me, there was only one genuine sad moment in a movie or record that could always tug at my heartstrings, and that was the scene at the end of the movie ""Casablanca,"" where Rick is saying good-bye to Ilsa.  For me, this record has become the one to listen to when I think of a love I lost, or one that never quite got going, or one, well, that just hurt.  Sam Smith has somehow, without knowing me, captured the pains I have felt.  And while not all of the feelings, at the time they occurred, were good feelings, I've learned over time that they are to be cherished as much as the pleasant one, because they show you not only the depths you sometime have reached in your life; they, also, show you how you've rebounded and are actually stronger for having gone through them.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1W1V3MXAZJZPB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00H3GZMIE#wasThisHelpful","R1W1V3MXAZJZPB","A969VLBBX8LQ7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A969VLBBX8LQ7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"UPDATED: I love popcorn, and have experimented popping it and doctoring it up for variety.  One trick I used back in the 1980's was sprinkling some Hidden Valley Ranch Dressing Mix.

Kernal Season's Ranch Seasoning has a ""ranch"" flavor that is mild enough not to overpower your senses, and it left a pleasant after taste in ones mouth.I have used various Kernel Season's seasonings for at least six, maybe more, years, and I found their latest updated container easy to use.  Over the years, I have found the seasoning, if you don't use it regularly, will start clumping, but that might be more my living in an area that has high humidity.  I have used at least five different flavors (Nacho, White Cheddar, Ranch, Carmel, and Butter) over the years, and Kernel Season's Ranch Seasoning is one of my favorites.  I did find it not as tasty when I drank Coca-Cola, as it seemed to flavors conflicted with each other, but this could just be my individual taste buds kicking it.

"I have a nice size home that was built in the middle 1970's that has limestone on the bottom story and with heavy-gauge grey siding outside the second story, that I have been cleaning every so often, especially the gable end on the north side of the house.I enjoy experimenting with processes, and have used various methods and products to clean the siding over the 14 years I have owned the house.  Before I tell you about this product, let me stated what I've used before to clean the siding on my house.  I started with just spraying the housed with brass nozzle Gilmour Solid Brass Water Jet Nozzle 06BJ, but I found after four to six months, I had to spray the house off, again.  So, I used a pressure washer, and that seemed to keep the house, mainly the north side mold-free for 8 months.  Windex once had a cleaner you could attach to your hose and spray on the siding, but it kept the siding clean only as long as the pressure washer, and you had to use a pressure washer to get it really clean before your first application if you wanted it to work best, so it had no benefit.  When I told the guy at the hardware store about my experiments, he told me I should be using a product like Jomax  Zinsser - Jomax House Cleaner & Mildew Killer Jomax Mildew Cleaner 1 Gal.: 647-60101 - jomax mildew cleaner 1 gal..  Applying Jomax by using a tank sprayer and spraying a mixture of bleach, water and Jomax on the siding and using the brass nozzle on the hose to rinse it off gave me a year-and-a-half to two years of mold-free siding before I had to use it, again, and that's reapplying when it just started having that ""grey"" powder on the siding, not full-fledged mold.Given my history, when I saw Amazon was letting us test KRUD KUTTER HS01 GREEN PRESSURE WASHING CONCENTRATE HOUSING AND SIDING CLEANER, I thought I'd try in out.  While the proof in a siding cleaner will come in how long it keeps my siding clean and mold-free (I will update this review to show how long it lasted or if any issues developed), I was not very impressed with it from the ""get-go"" because the instructions mentioned putting it into a siphon-type sprayer, which I didn't have, but it sounded like it was similar to their KRUD KUTTER HOUSE WASH hose attachment KRUD KUTTER HW32H House Wash, 32-Ounce.  Adding it to ones pressure washer, I have a Simpson 3200, Simpson PS3228-S PowerShot 3200 PSI 2.8 GPM Honda GX200 Engine Gas Pressure Washer and spraying was easy enough.  KRUD KUTTER had similar instructions as the Jomax: spray nearby bushes with water to protect them from overspray, spray area with water first, spray the area with the KRUD KUTTER, wait three to five minutes and rinse.Since it uses no bleach, it had less odor than the Jomax, but because just using a pressure washer would clean the siding itself, I couldn't tell if the KRUD CUTTER did a better job.  Cost-wise, I had to use more KRUD KUTTER than I expected to use.  Living down south near a cheek and a river, this summer will be a good test of this product, which I will report later, but based on what I have encountered using it this time, I am sticking with my Jomax for now.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 31, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2M13SWI4545L4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005FMZ4WM#wasThisHelpful","R2M13SWI4545L4","A969VLBBX8LQ7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A969VLBBX8LQ7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Thirteen years ago, I had Lasik corrective eye surgery which gave me 20-20 distance vision.  At the time, I, also, got a pair of  prescription glasses for reading, which since then has been replaced many times over with simple readers.  After retiring, I decided I wanted to learn to work with wood, so I am taking a cabinet making class at the local community college, where we are required to wear safety glasses when working in the shop.Soon I found my work was being slowed down by having to change to my ""readers"" every time I needed to read something or work on something up close.  I had found 3M's safety glasses to be a good fit for work with sidewalk trimmers, etc., and I even wore them in the shop.  So, I gave these a shot, choosing the 2.0 magnification because I wanted to be able to look at things clearly, yet, not have to hold things too close to my face.These safety glasses are terrific!  And, after using them for over two months, I have found them to be comfortable with the soft rubber cushions across the top of the glasses and behind the ears; I have actually found them to be clear as my ""glass"" readers, if not clearer;  and, they stay attached to the padded cord I use to hang them around my neck.If I wouldn't get weird looks, I'd wear them all the time, but you know being married, I can't always do what I'd like to do.Since my ""glass"" readers tend to last only a month at best, I bought a second pair, but even though I've lost one pair of ""glass"" readers and broken a second pair of ""glass"" readers since I've have been using these safety glasses, my safety glasses are as good as the day I bought them.

"In the world of shaving, it tends to come down to Schick and Gillette to develop better razors.  Over the years, I have tested the two brands on almost a weekly basis, but when I saw the Amazon Vine program offering several Schick razors for testing, I offered my stepdaughter, a 30-something who has temporarily, I hope, been residing at home a chance to be a tester.  This might seem a little different, but several years ago, when she and I were shopping together, and I needed a new razor, I ended-up buying her, at her request, the Schick Quartro Trimmer Schick Quattro Trimmer for Women.  Since I saw she still had the other razor in her shower, I asked if she might want to test one of the newer Schick razors for women.  She jumped at the chance.First of all, she liked the soft green color.  It didn't stick-out mounted on her bone-colored tub enclosure, but it was different enough that she could easily find it if any leftover soap got in her eyes.  She said it wasn't heavy, but it wasn't so lightweight that you could nick yourself.  She said the soft rubber handle was easy to grip and control, and made it easier to shave places like the back of ones legs.  The skin guards, or whatever you'd call the extra soft rubber around the razor blades, did not drag when using regular body soap.  Overall, she found it to be a great razor, with only one grip, and let me tell you, if she can complain about something, she will.  The bracket for holding the razor to the wall of the shower, with a suction cup, that came with her razor wasn't the easiest thing to put the razor in, but that is really rather trivial, as she found the razor the easiest she has ever used, especially shaving under her arms. She said the cushioned head prevented nicks, and the handle was designed to make it easy to manipulate all shaving areas.The proof of the test came when I found her previous Shick Quartro shaver in the bathroom trash can.  Don't tell her, but I tested the shaver for closeness by shaving one-half of my face with it and the other-half with a Schick Hydro 5 Power Razon Schick Hydro 5 Power Select Razor, and after a day, I found the side shaved with her Schick Hydro Silk Sensitive Razor had less noticeable stubble.  And, thus ends, what I hope will be the last women's razor test I will ever do with my stepdaughter.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1KDC52V29U3K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HT6E2JI#wasThisHelpful","R1KDC52V29U3K","A969VLBBX8LQ7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A969VLBBX8LQ7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The Hot Wheels Workshop Track Builder Starter Set is a great center piece for any Hot Wheels set-up as you can have five cars start from the central tower.One aspect about the ""Starter Set"" is that it is a starter set, and you need to purchase some other Hot Wheels Builder Stunts and accessories to get full enjoyment of the set-up.  This is probably why Mattel sent with the Starter Set a number of Builder Stunt set-ups for me to try.  Of the ones they included in addition to the TRack Builder Starter Set,  the Hot Wheels Track Builder Deluxe Quick Kick Loop Stunt Set  and Hot Wheels Track Builder Crossroad Crash Stunt Pack seemed to generate the most excitement when added to this set-up.  So, plan on spending around $50-60 more if you don't already have some Hot Wheels cars and accessories.  BTW, one reviewer mentioned there were 5 cars included in his set. In the one I had, and it was sealed tight, there was only one car included.The set-up takes-up a fair amount of space so allow at least a 5 x 7 foot area for it.  The track is easy to set-up, but it is far more difficult to break-down, but this is good, because you don't have to worry about it coming apart like these tracks did when I was growing-up.  Be sure to allow your youngsters additional time to put these tracks away.  You should, also, have an 8 gallon plastic container to store the pieces because there is no way you will be able to get all the pieces back into the box after taking them out.Overall, it's a great set and reasonably priced for what you get.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2C1ODSODKLDPQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FAQVY5E#wasThisHelpful","R2C1ODSODKLDPQ","A969VLBBX8LQ7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A969VLBBX8LQ7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Without a doubt, this is one remarkable book.  As a former contract officer who handled over 1200 kitchen and bathroom renovations, a public administrator who has overseen the human resources for agencies that had from 8 to over 80 employees, and as someone who is currently learning to build kitchen cabinets and bathroom vanities, I cannot think of anything this book does not address with regards to starting and running a kitchen and bath renovation or installation business.  I know this is a very strong statement to make, and as a former public administrator, I learned to never use the words ""always, never or anything"" in describing anything because just as soon as you do, something comes along and bites you on the posterior, but in this case, I have met an instance where the word ""anything"" can be used, and I won't lose any sleep at night.KITCHEN AND BATH BUSINESS AND PROJECT MANAGEMENT, WITH WEBSITE addresses the following, and this is not a complete list:The how's and why's of starting a business, from do you have the creativity, the energy or the finances to do it, to do you have the temperament to deal with the customers.  This is all written about in detailed articles and expansive questionnaires.What kind of staff and employees do you need and what will be their roles.  How to develop job descriptions, how to hire, and how to develop your staff and employees.How to get the word about your company ""out there,"" whether it be advertising, web presence, word of mouth, collaboration with other contractors, etc.How to set-up your inventory, keep tabs of inventory and determine your cost basis.How to estimate jobs and deal with potential customer's expectations, and not make promises you cannot keep.How to design installations, install cabinets, conduct inspections of installations (including what problems to look for during those inspections, and how to address those problems) and deal with customer complaints.How to turn completed jobs into future jobs.Oh, and how to be run a safe operation and what one must do to comply with OSHA.There is plenty of information in this manual for anyone starting or running any business, much less a kitchen and bath business.  I noticed that the companion book Kitchen & Bath Residential Construction and Systems (NKBA Professional Resource Library) is also available, and while I haven't read it, I would imagine it would be excellent, too.  I cannot recommend this book any higher than I am doing so here.

"So you find yourself, maybe like I did, upset with Windows and buying a Mac.  I did so several years ago, when Vista was their Operation System (O/S), and my first Apple O/S was Tiger.  Since then, I've faithfully updated my Apple O/S through Leopard, Snow Leopard, Lion, Mountain Lion and, now, Maverick.  Suddenly, in looking at the tasks I used to do, there seems to be new steps that I'm not aware of, and just a glance at iTunes shows Apple's done a number on it where it doesn't look anything like it ever did.  As it turns out, the changes have been steadily coming, and I was contently doing the things I always did, for the most part, not realizing Apple's world has passed me by.TEACH YOURSELF VISUALLY OS X MAVERICKS is an excellent book it that it takes one through each step of the process in doing something.  It is, almost, impossible to not do it correctly.  I say ""impossible"" because I'm sure I'll get impatient and jump a step in anticipation, but the steps are there, and they are easy to follow.This book is also for you if are one who has just bought your first Apple Mac and need someone holding your hands through the process.  It is not a book to tell you how to do everything, but it will get you more than started on using a Mac to its full potential.  Realizing just how behind I am, I have bought a second book, OS X Mavericks on Demand, by Steve Johnson, as a companion piece, and I read them side-by-side as I learn how to do tasks, whether for the first time or a refresher course.  This is not a trouble-shooting book, as those then to be more technical, and have less pictures.  This is a book on how to maximize the updated features that have come with Maverick and the iLife and iWork programs.If you are giving someone their first Mac, or are like myself, slightly behind in your Apple skills, this is a very good book to buy, and you will find you will reach for it first before any other book on Maverick.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RPS8BH7C8HVUL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1118683234#wasThisHelpful","RPS8BH7C8HVUL","A969VLBBX8LQ7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A969VLBBX8LQ7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The title of Galadrielle Allman's biography of her father, Duane Allman, is taken from Scott Boyer's song ""Please Be With Me,"" which was recorded by the group Cowboy, with Duane Allman providing the slide guitar accompaniment, is so appropriate for this book of remembrances that chronicle the mostly ups, and a few downs, of the genius of Duane Allman.  For anyone who has ever heard the silky tones of what his slide guitar sounds like, you soon begin to realize that at some point in his life, the gods of music touched Duane's heart and fingers, and they freed musical tones to be channeled through to a guitar for the rest of the world to hear and be in awe.This is an extraordinary book, and one immediately recognizes it will be one as Galadrielle Allman begins it with these first sentences:  ""My father is killed in the first paragraph of every article ever written about him.  His life story is told backwards, always beginning at the end: in the road, his motorcycle down, his body broken. People linger over the wreckage as if it says something meaningful about his life.""Galadrielle was two years old when her father died, and while one may ask, how can a two year old write a biography about someone she could not have possibly remembered much about, you soon realize she does have her memories, and more importantly, she has chronicled her father's life from others remembrances to give an almost ""no holes barred"" recount of her father's life.  As you read her book, she recounts circumstances in Duane's life that went into making him the musical artist he was, whether it be how he took time to visit and write an injured friend or how attending a military prep helped in his developing as a band leader.The book details the shock Galadrielle feels when she learns she is not Duane's only child, a secret she learns from someone who was writing a book about the band.  While Galadrielle's words detail the hurt she felt at first when she first learns of her half-sister, she, also, expresses a sadness for her after she learns her half-sister was born deaf because her mother contracted rubella during her pregnancy, as she writes, referring to the memories she has of her father versus those her half-sister never had, ""Stranger still, all I have of him, which never felt like enough to satisfy my need for him--the stories I have gathered, the relationships with our extended family, and even my name--suddenly feels like a great wealth of riches that she does not share, and I feel ashamed of that.  Most of all, I am wounded by the thought that she cannot hear his music.""As one reads through PLEASE BE WITH ME, one gets a true feeling of what it is like developing a band, and just how difficult it was.  There is very little of Duane's life that isn't documented in this book: from the birth of Galadrielle to her parents break-up, from Duane's lifting spirit, to sometimes dark moods.  With regards to the Duane's collaboration with other artists, such as Boz Scaggs, Delaney & Bonnie, Eric Clapton, et. al., she recounts the how those came about, and how that collaboration made their music better.If there is a weakness in this book, it is that the stories are just that, and at times the stories seem to run together, but for the most part, the book, when Galadrielle is writing strictly from her feelings, you feel a certain poetry expressed in her sentences, for example, her description of Macon, Georgia, is, ""Macon is beautiful in the spring, white magnolia blossoms hanging heavily in the trees, fallen pink cherry petals swirling on the cobblestone streets, and new grass growing in so green it hurts to look right at it.""  Having been raised in the South, I immediately recognize her description, having seen it in so many Southern cities.I began this book by referring to the song, ""Please Be with Me,"" that was written by Scott Boyer and sung by the group Cowboy.  If you ever wondered just what it was about Duane Allman's playing that added to a song, do a search on YouTube, first of ""please be with me duane allman,"" and then of ""please be with me eric clapton,"" and note the differences in the way the music was played.  This is not a knock on Eric Clapton, for I view him as one of the greatest guitarists there ever was, but a comparison of the two song reveals the gifts Duane Allman brought to the songs he played on.  Also, speaking of Eric Clapton, if you ever get a chance, listen to the jams that Eric Clapton and Duane Allman on the extended version of the album ""Layla and other Assorted Love Songs"" by Derek and the Dominos.  Those recordings will show you how two great guitarists can feed off of each other.During this past year, the documentary ""Muscle Shoals"" was released, and this book provides wonderful stories about the recording sessions Duane had at FAME Studios In Muscle Shoals and Muscle Shoals Sound Studios in Sheffield.  Being a resident of the Shoals area, I knew some of these stories, and I am glad to read of other stories I hadn't heard before.  Which brings me to two personal remembrances of Duane Allman.  The first being the only time I ever heard the Allman Brothers play live.At the time, I was attending school at the University of Alabama in Birmingham, UAB, and I was on the Entertainment Committee at the school.  It seemed there was a promoter that the Allman Brothers owed a concert, but he couldn't find a place to stage it, and he proposed having the Entertainment Committee sponsor it.  This was in 1970, just before ""Idlewild South,"" a name for a cabin they used back then.  The Entertainment Committee rented the Oporto National Guard Armory near Eastwood Mall in Birmingham, and we were treated to three-and-a-half hours of great music as they played all of the tunes from their first album, ""The Allman Brothers,"" plus all of their upcoming album, ""Idlewild South."" The band was on a stage elevated five or so feet off of the concrete floor of the armory, and the band, with its two drummers, two lead guitarists, bass player and Greg Allman's massive B3 Hammond and amplifiers, took-up a third of the back wall.  The place was packed, with only the local Fire Marshall stopping the people wanting to pay their $7.00 to get in to hear them.  The band played so tight, yet they, also, seemed to be jamming at times, that before we knew it, it was 11:30, and the Fire Marshall literally turned on the house lights and made everyone start leaving, or I think, we'd have been there for a couple of more hours, as the band seemed to be feeding off of the positive energy of the crowd.My second remembrance isn't really a remembrance, rather it was an experience I had while taking a tour of the Hard Rock Cafe's Vault in London, England.  My wife and I are very proud of the musical heritage of ""The Shoals,"" as most everyone calls the area in which we live, and as we went through the tour, we started telling stories about some of the artists who had recorded at the old Muscle Shoals Sound Studio on 3614 Jackson Highway, Duane, Bob Dylan, Lynyrd Skynyrd, etc.  It wasn't long before we had as many folks listening to us talk as the tour guide had.  So, he walks up to me carry this Fender Strat, and says to me, ""Here, this is the Strat Duane Allman played on for the tune ""Layla"" with Derrick and the Dominos.  It's number 19, you play it while I give the tour,"" and with that, I held this really sweet instrument whose strings played so perfectly up and down the fret board.  It was an experience I will never forget.This book isn't for everyone, I know, but for those who love Duane Allman's music, who want to know what the Allman Brothers Band went through in their development, or even a large part of what the music scene was like during the late 1960's and early 1970's, Galadrielle Allman's PLEASE BE WITH ME: A SONG FOR MY FATHER, DUANE ALLMAN will be a book you will enjoy reading.NOTE: This review was based upon an advanced copy I received through Amazon's Vine Program.  It is anticipated that the book will be available for purchase in early March 2014.  There could be some changes in the book when it is finally published, but, if there are, it is expected that those will probably be minor.  I was asked how I received an advance copy, and I replied:As a member of Amazon's ""Vine Program,"" Vine reviewers receive an E-mail of products Amazon thinks we would like to review. Usually, the items they notify us are of items similar to what we have shown an interest in or have reviewed in the past. A week after we receive the first E-mail, we receive a second one listing all the products people in the program have not chosen. Most of the books I have reviewed have just been published or are on the verge of being published. Ms. Allman's biography of her father, Duane, was offered to Vine members almost two months before it is being published. It is a ""pre-published proof,"" which means it may still be edited some, but for the most part, only minor grammatical corrections will be made to it before it is published.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3DXJPHQ8MPWRZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1400068940#wasThisHelpful","R3DXJPHQ8MPWRZ","A969VLBBX8LQ7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A969VLBBX8LQ7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"There is something deeply human about wanting to be close to the physical remains of a loved one.  Unfortunately, modern warfare has evolved so that some of the dead are so physically mangled that they are no longer identifiable.  As a result, grieving families do not have an individual grave they can connect with their loved one.  After the Great War, the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier arose as a symbolic touchstone for a grieving nation to connect with the missing and unidentifiable casualties of the War.  The ""Unknown Solider"" movement with its concurrent rituals began in England and France and soon spread throughout the world.  These Tombs continue to resonate into the Twenty First Century.Please note that ""The Unknown Soldier"" was written for a middle school audience.  This book works really well for its intended audience.  If you are looking for a more sophisticated approach, you will have to look elsewhere.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1F4YN7ZC0RZZ8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=043993558X#wasThisHelpful","R1F4YN7ZC0RZZ8","AQDJTEIDUKK5B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQDJTEIDUKK5B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"John Pohl makes a very good argument for reading his book in the very first paragraph.  He notes, "" Traditionally, Late Medeival European History focuses on the Hundred Years War, followed by England's War of the Roses and the Swiss Wars against Burgundy and the Empire.  Attention shifts to Spain only after 1492, with the fall of Granada and the first explorations and conquests in the Americas.  This may leave the reader with a sense of astonishment that seemingly from nowhere the 'Catholic Monarchs' Fernando and Isabel were able to lay the foundation for the world's first global empire.""  That introductory paragraph nails it.  Why were the Spanish able to create an immense global empire in such short order?With Osprey, you never know what you are going to get.  The quality of their book's authors range from bumbling enthusiasts to pedantic professors and every once in a while you will find an author who can really write.  Fortunately, ""Armies of Castille and Aragon"" is one of Osprey's better endeavors.  Professor John Pohl cannot only write clear prose but also has the gift of simplifying complex history.  In a short forty seven pages, Pohl beautifully answers the question he posits in the introductory paragraph.  This short book was a joy to read and I highly recommend it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3C7MB66XGT6FH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1472804198#wasThisHelpful","R3C7MB66XGT6FH","AQDJTEIDUKK5B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQDJTEIDUKK5B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I would recommend the audio cd only for people with prior study of the Peloponnesian War.  This is an ancient text and without the proper background, it will be difficult to listen to because so many of the references are obscure.  The best overall study of the Peloponnesian War is Donald Kagan's book.  He dedicated his career to the deep study of this conflict and his book is a modern masterpiece.  Reading Kagan is great preparation for taking on Thucydides.  I would next recommend ""The Landmark Edition of Thucydides"".  It is by far the best edition to read.  Its many footnotes and scholarly essays are absolutely first rate.  Listening to Thucydides is a pleasure with the right preparation.

"If your primary interest is in learning the history of the Peloponnesian War, I would recommend Donald Kagan's masterful book on the subject.  Kagan dedicated his career to the study of the war and his book is a modern masterpiece.  I had the good fortune to read Kagan before reading the ""The Landmark Thucydides.""  It made the whole experience much more enjoyable.  I understood what was going on and did not have to spend so much time with the Landmark footnotes.If you want to take the big leap and take on Thucydides, the Landmark Edition is a must.  While not as strong as Kagan, the introduction and scholar essays are first class and go a long way to making Thucydides approachable to the modern reader.  However, what takes The Landmark Edition to another level is the footnotes and maps.  If you have the patience and take the time to really study the text, you can really develop a deep understanding of Thucydides.Finally, Robert Strassler is a real hero.  Let us hope that he is able to produce more Landmark Editions.  In my book, Strassler has covered himself with glory and has done the reading public a great service.

"Steven Pressfield has carved himself a place as a genre writer of historical fiction set in the ancient world.  ""The Afghan Campaign"" follows the travails of an ordinary soldier during Alexander the Great's conquest of Afghanistan.  Pressfield's conceit is that warfare in Afghanistan has not changed in over two thousand years.  ""The Afghan Campaign"" is a genre novel and as such works beautifully.  The modern reader learns a little history, follows an exciting plot and is reinforced in the widely held view that Afghanistan is an especially wild and barbarous place.  ""The Afghan Campaign"" is not great literature but succeeds within the constraints of its genre.  My wife has her Chick Lit and this type of genre book is my equivalent guilty pleasure.  Recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R6RLK7LEABON9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0767922387#wasThisHelpful","R6RLK7LEABON9","AQDJTEIDUKK5B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQDJTEIDUKK5B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Claudio Linati (1790-1832) was an Italian painter and lithographer who moved to Mexico in 1825.  He is best known for his book ""Costumes Civils, militaires et religieux du Mexico published in Belgium in 1828.  The book is a collection of lithographs and descriptions produced by Linati in the mid 1820's.  The lithographs are fascinating because they show ever day life in the years immediately following the War of Independence from Spain.  Linati's wonderfully detailed images show a wide variety of races, social classes and professions.""Trajes Civiles, Militares Y Religiosos de Mexico"" is a Spanish language 1957 reprint of the original 1828 edition.  This book is a nearly sixty year old and was a high quality publication for its time.  This is a well produced book and will be of great interest for all those interested in the material culture of the early Mexican Republic.  I cannot wait until Linati's book is once again published with Twenty First Century production values.

"Soon after war was declared against Germany, Jose de la Luz Saenz volunteered to join the U.S. Army.  Saenz was a teacher and family man from South Texas.  He volunteered instead of waiting to be drafted because he wanted to show his patriotism and commitment to the country of his birth.  During the Great War, Saenz kept a diary which he published in Spanish in1933.Saenz' diary can be read on many different levels.  At its core, Saenz' diary is a chronicle of his life as a front line American soldier fighting in the trenches of France.  As an educated school teacher, Private Saenz was given the opportunity to work in his battalion's headquarters unit where he  served as a French language translator.  Although he was in a support unit, Saenz was up close to the fighting and experienced war in all of its random brutality.  Jose de la Luz Saenz was a good writer and did a solid job of recounting his wartime experiences. The Great War produced many great first person narratives.  As a diary, Saenz' work is good but not great.The real value of Saenz' diary is as a political text.  In 1917, Saenz was a member of Texas' very small Mexican American middle class.  At that time, living conditions for Mexicans and Mexican Americans were especially difficult.  The society was openly racist and very violent.  Saenz saw military service during war as the catalyst that would change how Mexican people were treated in Texas.  Taking up arms in service of the United States was a political action which would allow veterans and their families to assert that they were United States citizens with all the corresponding rights.  These political themes run throughout Saenz' diary and that is what makes it such an interesting book.The Great War changed conditions for Mexican Americans in Texas.  It was Saenz and his generation of middle class war veterans who would go on to start the League of United Latin American Citizens.  This organization was the first statewide Mexican American political organization in Texas.  It would soon grow into other states and begin the fight for Mexican American civil rights.  With Saenz' diary, the reader can read about the seeds that led to these changes.  This is fascinating book and I highly recommend it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2D2SO4MWDVW5V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1623491142#wasThisHelpful","R2D2SO4MWDVW5V","AQDJTEIDUKK5B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQDJTEIDUKK5B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"By their very nature, bande desinee albums are visually rich.  I purchase them for their striking  images and not necessarily for their stories.  Fortunately, Pierre Veys' story is as strong as it can be within the constraints of the genre.  But what makes this album are the beautifully detailed images of the illustrator Carlos Puerta.  His images have a photorealistic quality to them that I found very pleasing.  His coloring of the images is also first rate.  This is the first Carlos Puerta  bande desinee that I have read.

"""The Great War-The Persuasive Power of Photography"" was published in conjunction with a 2014 show at the National Gallery of Canada.  The purpose of the book is to present a broad survey of Great War photography.  To do this, the author developed broad categories into which photos could be placed.  These categories range from personal portraits and amateur photo albums to more mundane categories like propaganda photos, unit portraits and battlefield reconnaissance.  There is also an interesting section on French stereoscopic photography. The intent of this book is to cast a very wide net.  The images that accompany the text are fascinating in their ordinariness.  The curators of this exhibit valued breadth over the beauty of the individual images.  As a reviewer, I have a definite bias towards the humanistic depiction of war.  I look for images that reveal the humanity of the subjects.  I did not give this book five stars because too many of the images are quotidian in nature.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/REK8JYZM4C31X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=8874396783#wasThisHelpful","REK8JYZM4C31X","AQDJTEIDUKK5B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQDJTEIDUKK5B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Osprey Publishing has a problem with quality control.  When you purchase an Osprey book, you never know whether you are getting a small gem or a dry desiccated dud.  I am pleased to report that ""Pylos and Sphacteria"" is one of those little gems.  I am currently reading Thucydides and have just finished the section on the Spartan disaster at Pylos.  Even with the help of the beautifully detailed Robert Strassler edition, many of the details of the battle were not clear to me.Like many Osprey authors, William Shepherd loves his subject.  With a sure hand, he reconstructs this 2,400 year old battle.  His photographs of Pylos and Sphacteria bring the story to life in a way the written word cannot do.  In addition, the veteran illustrator Peter Dennis lends his formidable skills to this endeavor.  I only hope Shepherd took advantage of his trip to Pylos to write a future Osprey campaign book on the battle of Navarino Bay.

"Over the years, I have read a number of Inspector Maiget novels.  Whenever I pick up a new Maigret novel, I know that it will be a great read.  Most will be five stars and the disappointing ones will be four stars. Georges Simenon had a successful formula and his readers knew that he could deliver that trademark formula novel after mystery novel.  One of the pleasures of ""The Late Monsieur Gallet"" (1931) is that it is Simenon's third Maigret novel.  It is a pleasure to see Jules Maigret near the start of his career.

"John D. Clare's ""Living History"" series is one best history series for children that I have ever come across.  Clare's approach is to find re-enactors and use them to illustrate his texts.  The re-enactors take their hobbies seriously and their attention to period detail is extraordinary.  This is the type of series that could only have been produced in England.  They have the historical buildings that they can use as backdrops for the re-enactors.  This marriage of strong written text and great period photos cannot be beat.

"""The Italian Renaissance"" is part of the Living History Series.  This series marries a well written text with detailed photographs of period re-enactors.  The quality of the photos are absolutely first rate.  A great deal of time and expense was spent in recreating images of the Italian Renaissance.  This emphasis on recreating past history allows the reader to step back in time and imagine themselves in the photos.An earlier reviewer claims an anti-Catholic bias in the text.  I think this is unfair.  The Roman Papacy reached both great heights and lows during the Renaissance.  But note, this book covers much more than the Roman Catholic church.  There are great sections on the arts and science of the time.  I have read a lot of history books with my children and the ""The Italian Renaissance"" is one of the best books that we have read.

"""The Stanford Law Chronicles"" was a must purchase for me.  Like the author, I am a Mexican American graduate of Stanford Law School.  I finished only a few years ahead of him and know many of the people of whom he writes.  My wife is even mentioned in the book.  It is from this close vantage that I review this book.As a tenured sociology professor with a strong activist commitment to social justice, Alfredo Mirande was not a typical first year Stanford law student.  Not only was he much older but Mirande was a lot more accomplished that the typical twenty four year old law student.  From the very beginning, Mirande viewed himself as a participant observer in the law school experience.  This informed distance made his experience different from that of the average student.As a sociologist, Mirande was interested in  how Stanford Law School formed students to enter into America's legal and business elites.  Throughout his three years at Stanford, Mirande was both an insider and an outsider.  By joining the law review and clerking for a judge, Mirande followed the path of an ambitious law student.  Yet at the same time,  his formation as an activist Chicano professor would never allow him to fully embrace that experience.  Like many other students, Mirande felt that combination of alienation and boredom which is so typical of the law school experience.The value of ""The Stanford Law Chronicles"" can be seen in at least two levels.  First, as a sociological study on the formation of American elites.  Second and I think more importantly, ""The Stanford Law Chronicles"" is a rare autobiography from a Mexican American intellectual.  There are many books on the formation of elites but Mexican American autobiographies are scarce.  Alfredo Mirande is a gifted writer and it is as an autobiography that ""The Stanford Law Chronicles"" will be read in coming years.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R372PMN879U1WF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0268022844#wasThisHelpful","R372PMN879U1WF","AQDJTEIDUKK5B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQDJTEIDUKK5B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Born in 1913 in the Department of Cuzco, Julio Benavente Diaz was the greatest charangista of his generation.  He became a school teacher and spent long periods of time in the remote villages of his region where he collected old Quechua songs and melodies.  He was typical of the Latin American musicians/intellectuals of the post-war years who sought to make folk music respectable to the middle and professional classes.  They did this by taking rural music and transforming it something that represented the spirit of the nation and its people.""Peru-Perou: Charango & Songs from Cuzco"" was recorded in Paris in 1985.  This was towards to the end of Julio Benavente Diaz' career.  The album consists of just him and his charango.  There is no folklorico group backing him up.

""Les Chevaliers Teutoniques"" is a photo history of the medieval Teutonic religious order.  Many of the photos were taken at the surviving Teutonic castles in Poland.  From an architectural point of view, these photos go beyond the post card images that are usually presented of the castles.  Of more interest are the photos of medieval re-enactors.

"Over the last century, thousands of books and articles have been written about the beginning of the Great War.  Many of those books center on playing the blame game.  They focus on one country and compile dossiers of evidence to support their argument that one country or another shares the greatest responsibility for starting the war.  Christopher Clark escapes this trope by concentrating on ""how"" the war began as opposed to ""why"" it began.  By concentrating on the discrete acts that led to war he avoids the trap of laying responsibility on any one person or country.  Ultimately, I think this is a wiser approach in trying to understand the origins of this catastrophe.

"Arguably, Tyler Hicks is the greatest photojournalist of his generation.  Like all the greats, Hicks is a person of great personal bravery combined with a strong artistic vision.  ""Histories are Mirrors"" begins with the destruction of the Trade Towers and follows the response through the invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq.  During those three years, Hicks was everywhere and was able to flow freely between friends and foes.  Like all the great photojournalists, Hicks was always very close to the action and consequently able to document the horrors of war at its most intimate and terrifying.  By necessity, all of HIck's photos are in color.  Although many of the images are beautifully composed the fact they are in color also robs them of their ability to one become truly iconic.  There is something about black and white photography that raises war photography to a higher level.  But having said that, there is no doubt that ""Histories are Mirrors"" is a great book.

"I think I am typical of the people who read Osprey books.  I have a college degree and have been reading military history for many years.  I am interested in Byzantine history but by no means am I an academic familiar with the Byzantine and Saljuk politics of the Eleventh Century.  To tell that story for an Osprey audience a great deal of explanation is needed.  The greatest problem with ""Manzikert 1071"" is that Nicolle loses track of his intended audience.  He predisposes that his audience has more knowledge than we do.  In turn, I found Nicolle's book to be obscure and not especially enjoyable to read.  If this were not bad enough, Christa Hook's illustrations are not up to the usual high Osprey standards.  Not recommended.","3.0 out of 5 stars","December 27, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R29YI5QOBC44QI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1780965036#wasThisHelpful","R29YI5QOBC44QI","AQDJTEIDUKK5B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQDJTEIDUKK5B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have reading about World War II for over forty years.  in my mind, it is a black and white war.  Therefore, it is always shocking to see color photos of the conflict.  Color photos have a way of making that time come alive for me.  ""Britain at War in Colour"" is a novelty book.  It is interesting to see the photos and the descriptions that go with them.

"The best thing about this book are the illustrations by John James.  His richly detailed drawings are a delight.  His images are able to draw both child and adult into the story of Jerusalem's Temple.  The history of Herod's construction of the Temple up to its destruction by the Romans is a complicated story. Jacqueline Morley wrote this book for elementary school age children and therefore had to reduce a complex story down to a level that a young child can grasp.I would recommend Peter Connolly's ""The Holy Land"" for more mature readers.  Like John James, Peter Connolly is a gifted illustrator.  However, Connolly's style is aimed at more sophisticated audience.  Connolly's ""The Holy Land"" does a good job of tracking the story of the Temple as it was related by the Judeo/Roman historian Titus Flavius Josephus.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 18, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R13CPN43FHBI6Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0872266532#wasThisHelpful","R13CPN43FHBI6Y","AQDJTEIDUKK5B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQDJTEIDUKK5B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Peter Connolly wrote ancient history books for both children and adults.  Well a precocious middle schooler can read the ""The Holy Land"" I am not sure that a young person would necessarily enjoy the book.  ""The Holy Land"" closely tracks the ""Jewish War"" written by Romano/Jewish historian Titus Flavius Josephus.  This book chronicles the rise of Herod and concludes with the destruction of Temple in Jerusalem.  It is an important but nevertheless intricate story that many younger children may find too complex.  Nevertheless, the younger reader will enjoy Peter Connolly's beautifully detailed illustrations.However, as an adult, ""The Holy Land"" is a great book.  I have never read Josephus and Connolly's book has whetted my appetite to give it a shot.  The ""Holy Land"" does a wonderful job of putting Jesus Christ in his historical context.Finally, there are two other versions of this book with different titles.

"The editors of this book had a great idea in mining the National Archives for interesting photos of the Vietnam War.  Each branch of the US Military had combat photographers who literally shot millions of photos during the War.  From such a large body of work, the editors should have been able to find more high quality photographs.  I would estimate 15% of the photos are high quality images of the conflict  The rest are rather mundane shots.  The ordinariness of these photos illustrates the difference between the high quality work of professional photojournalists and the average work of young combat photographers.  Finally, the book was printed on low quality paper and the photos are not well cropped or printed.  All and all, this book is a disappointment.

"First the bad news.  This audio cd version of ""Good Soldier Svejk"" is an abridgement.  Usually, I hate abridgements because editors cut out so much that I find it difficult to follow the story line.  Fortunately, the episodic nature of ""The Good Soldier Svejk"" lends itself to an abridgement. However, what really makes this audio cd is David Horovitch's narration.  He is a classically trained British actor who can easily avail himself of Great Britain's many regional and class accents.  This wide array of accents fits perfectly into Svejk's ethnically diverse Austro-Hungarian Empire.  ""The Good Soldier Svejk"" is a work of comic genius.  Fortunately, David Horovitch has the timing and comic talent to bring Svejk's world alive.

"The Associated Press sent its first reporters to Vietnam soon after the French military returned to the country in 1945.  During the next thirty years what started out as a distant colonial war grew into the principle military struggle of the Cold War.  The whole time, the Associated Press was on the ground writing stories and taking photos.  To do this, the AP hired and cultivated the best photojournalists of the era.""Vietnam: The Real War"" is a photographic history of the conflict.  Most of the photos come from AP's archive but when necessary the editors have included photos from non-AP sources.  The text lightly covers the history of the war.  Its real strength is telling the stories of the AP photographers and journalists.  These are the stories of the intrepid journalists who brought the war to the world's newspapers and magazines.The ""Golden Age"" of photographic journalism is often seen as having taken place during the Spanish Civil War and Second World War.  A whole cottage industry has arisen to chronicle the works of the great Magnum photographers, Robert Capa, David Seymour and George Rodgers.  The photographic history of the  Korean and Vietnam wars have never generated the same interest among historians and authors.  Perhaps this is because of our nation's more troubled relationship with these conflicts.  Neither the Korean nor the Vietnam War were ever considered ""Good Wars"" fought by a ""Greatest Generation.""It is unfortunate that the great photojournalists of the Vietnam War never received the recognition they were due.  ""Vietnam: The Read War"" is a collection of extraordinary photographs that move way beyond merely documenting the horrors of war.  There are beautifully composed images that leave the world of illustration and  enter the realm of fine art.  Those images say as much about the insanity of war as any work by Goya.  This is a great book that will be enjoyed by people interested in both history and photography.

"I have spent years searching out and reading ancient history books to my children.  The Usborne Greek and Roman histories are the best single volume histories of their respective periods.  What makes the Usborne books so good is that they jam a lot of information into their relatively thick books.  The print is small and the accompanying illustrations are really well done.

"When P.G. Wodehouse created the Jeeves and Wooster characters he knew he had a winning combination.  ""Jeeves and the Mating Season"" is like every other book in the series.  They all follow the same successful formula.  There is plenty of hijinks and mad cap humor. Looking back over the decades, all of the books have for me blended into one pleasant haze.  I have discovered that listening to a Jeeves and Wooster book is better than reading it.  I know there is some dispute but I believe Jonathan is the best narrator for the series.  He has the great character voices and a fantastic sense of comic timing.  For timing, I would put him up there with Jack Benny. With Jonathon Cecil narrating, the plot becomes unimportant.  The whole series has become a nice blur and Cecil's narration is that extra touch that brings me back year after year.

"For many years, I have been a fan of the Alan Furst/Eric Ambler approach to World War Two thriller/spy novels.  Their approach is to tell the story of ordinary people working in the obscure corners where spies practice their craft.  I enjoy seeing how the ""small people"" react to the calamitous events of their day.  Phillip Kerr takes a very different approach.  He places his hero Bernie Gunther at big events (Katyn Woods Massacre) where he intereacts with real people (Goebbels).  Kerr does not have a problem with throwing in a beautiful woman for Gunther's love interest and some creepy Nazis and Soviets as the bad guys.  Kerr boldly takes the maximalist approach to writing a World War Two thriller. Half way through the novel, I thought there was no way that Kerr can pull this off.  There is just too much going on.  To my surprise, he did pull it off.  ""A Man Without Breath"" is a big, sprawling and thoroughly enjoyable book.  I am not sure that it will be a classic like ""A Coffin for Dimitrios"" or ""Red Gold"" but it is a good read.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 8, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R16TEDO7G744TD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0399160795#wasThisHelpful","R16TEDO7G744TD","AQDJTEIDUKK5B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQDJTEIDUKK5B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The scholarship that took place at Library at Alexandria is one of those accomplishments that encompasses both the Greek and Roman civilizations. The scientific advances of the ancient world are often times inadequately addressed in the histories written for children.  ""The Library of Alexandria"" does a great job of explaining the scientific breakthroughs of individual ancient scholars.  This perspective adds to the usual tales of emperors and conquerors that so dominate the study of ancient history.  What keeps me from giving this book five stars are the mundane illustrations that acccompany the book.

"""The Insurgents"" is a book about ideas and how armies adapt and learn.  When countries go to war, they go to war with the armies and doctrines they have been forged over many years.  However, wars are dynamic by their very nature.  Sometimes, a nation's war strategy may start out well but over time the war can go in other directions and there may be a need for a course correction.  ""The Insurgents"" is the story of how the United States military became a learning institution and found new strategies and tactics to deal with the realities on the ground.Fred Kaplan tells the story of this course correction through the lense of David Patraeus and the group of intellectuals he assembled around him.  General Patraeus was the key American commander of the Iraqi War and the adoption of counter-insurgency doctrine the most important development of the war.  The final judgement as to the effectiveness and importance of the counter-insurgency doctrine will be made in the coming years.  ""The Insurgents"" is one of the first volleys in what will become a historical debate.As a first draft of history, ""The Insurgents"" is a success. Fred Kaplan understands the value of ideas and the role they play in the shaping of wars.  I have been reading military history for forty years and this is the first book that spends more time on soldier's academic pedigrees than it does on descriptions of combat.  If this book has a weakness, it is in Kaplan's focus on the shaping of doctrine as oppossed to the implementation of doctrine.  My sense is that future historians will spend more time in determing whether or not the counter-insurgency strategy actually worked.  These future historians will leave the world of ideas and examine the gritty details of how counter-insurgency doctrine actually worked.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 1, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3AVZ5L2CTYENR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1451642636#wasThisHelpful","R3AVZ5L2CTYENR","AQDJTEIDUKK5B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQDJTEIDUKK5B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

His beautifully detailed illustrations brought medieval construction techniques to life. As an adult, I still love Macaulay's work but as a children's book, it can only carry you so far. Malcolm Hislop's ""How to Buid a Cathedral"" takes medieval construction to a much higher level.  Hislop uses scores of richly detailed illustrations to explain the building technologies of the Middle Ages.

Her father has just died and she is all alone in a small Nebraska pioneer settlement.  How will the protagonist survive and move forward?  All the classic elements of an adventure story.  What takes this story into the realm of historical fiction is its 1880's Nebraska setting.  Although I am no historical expert on pioneer life, the details felt right.

"Peter Connolly (1935-2012)wrote and illustrated many books on the ancient world.  A few of his books were written for adults but most of them were geared towards the young adult market.  His greatest gifts were as an illustrator and experimental archaeologist. Connolly was fascinated with the material culture of the ancient world.  His great contribution was in taking degraded archaeological findings and re-animating them through his illustrations.  Connolly's richly detailed illustrations brought ancient history to life.""The Greek Armies"" is divided into two sections.  On the top of most pages is a condensed narrative of the Persian Wars, Peloponnesian War and Alexander's conquest of the Persian Empire.  The bottom parts of the page focus on the material culture and technologies of the Greek armies.  It is in this bottom section of the page that Peter Connolly's genius really shines.  ""The Greek Armies"" has beautifully rendered illustations of such ordinary things has helmets, shields, spears, triremes, catapults and siege engines.I read this book to my ten year old son because he has a budding interest in ancient history.

"The end of the Roman Republic is a story that has fascinated people for over two thousand years.  Most contemporary histories focus on the struggle between the two ""great men"" of the era, Caesar and Pompey.  Cicero, Cato, Hortensus, Crassus and Cataline are usually just supporting actors in their struggle.  Goodman and Soni hit upon a great idea in shifting the focus by placing Cato at the center of their narrative.  The value of placing Cato at the center is that his contribution to creating the crisis becomes clearer.""Rome's Last Citizen"" is great example of high quality popular history geared towards the reading public.  It is well written and thought provoking.  Some of the negative reviews of this book place too high a burden on Goodman and Soni.  They judge a popular history by the standards one uses to judge an academic history.

"Roger Lancelyn Green had a great idea in creating a meta-world where all of the great Greek heroes interact as contemporaries.  This idea works because the ancient Greeks saw their heroes as living in an organic ""Heroic Age"".  It is a compelling idea but it is poorly executed.  This book fails because Lancelyn Green must jam in all of the heroes and their many adventures into a short children's book.  Jason, Perseus, Theseus and Heracles deserve their own books in which their many adventures can be properly told.  These ancient stories are foundational texts for Western Literature.

"I grew up in Colorado in the 1970's.  I loved local history but I could find very little published about the Mexican contribution to the settlement of the State.  I knew this history had to exist but that it would take effort to find it.  Fortunately, in the last forty years a number of excellent books have been published that have explored the contributions of the Spanish and Mexicans to the settlement of Colorado.In the late 1850's, Mariano Medina (born Taos in 1812) a former trapper and mountain guide settled on the banks of the Big Thompson River.  Medina was the first non-Indian to settle in what is today Loveland, Colorado.  He built a toll bridge and trading post.  Medina was a good businessman and became one of the wealthiest citizens of the area.  What really made Medina stand out was his colorful character.  A good friend of Kit Carson and other well known mountain men, Medina was a local legend.

"It is a special kid who is interested in the intricacies of Greek Hoplite warfare.  If you are like me and happen to have one, ""The Greek Hoplite"" by Martin Windrow is a must purchase.  It is well written and the illustrations are first rate.  A good used copy can be picked up for under ten dollars.  If you like this book, Martin Windrow produced a number of good books in the ""Soldier Through the Ages"" series.  My guess is if your child likes Greek Hoplite, he will also be interested in Roman legionaires, Vikings and Medievil knights.  Highly recommended!","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 14, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1EIV0ECVAG2UI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0531037800#wasThisHelpful","R1EIV0ECVAG2UI","AQDJTEIDUKK5B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQDJTEIDUKK5B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As children move towards middle school, there are fewer beautifully illustrated history books.  The emphasis moves from teaching through images to more written word narratives.  I think this is too bad.  Images are powerful and help children place themsevles into historical events.""The Greeks"" by Roy Burrell is a general history of ancient Greece aimed at children ages 10-14.  Burrell is a competent writer with a good command of the history of ancient Greece.  However, what really makes this book are the beautiful illustrations by Peter Connolly.  Until his death in 2012, Peter Connolly was the foremost illustrator of the ancient world.  Connolly had a love of ancient material culture.  His passion was taking archaeological finds and through illustration bringing them back to their original forms.  I have spent years tracking down used Peter Connolly books.  His illustrations are a great way for childrens and adults to place themselves into the past.

"In the Nineteenth Century, France was at the center of the Western architectural world.  The best architects and artists travelled and studied in France.  The most fortunate ones were able to study at the Ecole des Beaux Arts.  When they returned home, they brought back with them French architectural styles.  Beaux-Art influenced buildings can be found from New York to Buenos Aires.""Architecture in France 1800-1900"" is a broad based survey of the architecture produced during this period.  What makes this book such a joy is that Bertrand Lemoine chronicles a wide variety of building types.  His interests extend beyond the major public buildings to more obscure buildings such as factories and park pavillions.  The scope and range of his interests is truly impressive. Fortunately, his text is well translated and is easy to follow.  Having finished this book, I only wished that it had been longer.  A comprehensive survey of French Nineteenth Century buildings would require numerous volumes.  Until such a work is published, ""Architecture in France 1800-1900"" is the book to own.  Highly recommended!","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 24, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2MGX7XOPA2I43/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0810940906#wasThisHelpful","R2MGX7XOPA2I43","AQDJTEIDUKK5B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQDJTEIDUKK5B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I started this book because I was interested in learning about how the writings of Ancient world were recovered and used to inspire the Renaissance.  Exploring Epicurean philosophy was less important.  I thoroughly enjoyed Greenblatt's description of how the Roman texts were recovered.  But to my surprise, I found Greenblatt's take on the spread of Epirucrean philosophy to be the more interesting of the two subjects.  I'm not sure whether ""De rerum natura"" was as influential as Greenblatt makes it out to be.  Neverhtless, Lucretius' poem feels very modern and from today's vantage point, the work still seems fresh and relevant.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 22, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2Z0H5X8EUYEZJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0393064476#wasThisHelpful","R2Z0H5X8EUYEZJ","AQDJTEIDUKK5B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQDJTEIDUKK5B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In the 1980's, Giovanni Caselli produced a series of short historical vignettes for children entitled ""The Everyday Life Series"".  Each well illustrated book examines the daily life of ordinary people through the ages. It was a series aimed towards young children of 7-10 years of age. I have read number of these books to my children and we have enjoyed them all.""A Boston Trader"" tells of the visit of two farm children to their uncle's prosperous home in Boston.  Their uncle is a rich merchant in the Boston of 1730's.  They have an opportunity to explore Boston's busy port and watch the preparations for an important ball.  The story is well written and the illustrations are well done.

"Carl Rochling and Richard Knotel were two of the finest illustrators of the Nineteenth Century.  They specialized in historical scenes.  In the late 1890's, they collaborated on two illustrated biographies, ""Der Alte Fritz"" and ""Die Konigin Luise"".  Fortunately, ""Der Alte Fritz"" has been republished a few times.  It is a great book and can be purchased at a reasonable price.  However, I am not aware of any reprints of ""Die Konigin Luise"".  If you are interested in this book, you will probably have to purchase the 1896 original.  If you can afford it, ""Die Konigin Luise"" is a great find.  The book's fifty illustrations of Queen Luise's life are absolutely first rate.  She was a Prussian hero from the Napoleonic Wars and the great love the German people had for her is reflected in these beautifully crafted illustrations.

"Wow, this book has allowed me to put so many things into perspective. First off we lie and we do it so often that we don't even realize we are doing it anymore. We lie to our friends, family members and co workers ALL THE TIME! We do it to fit in and to be more accepted by others it's a natural defense mechanism. We want to be liked and we want to make a good impression and when we don't feel, ""Good Enough,"" we lie... This book has taught me to understand my self worth, to recognize the lies I say to others to feel better about myself, and lastly to understand in my core that I am not defined by any of it! I am whole and perfect as I am without the need to saturate my spirit with who I should be and what I should be doing. A lie is mere clothes that we wear and we are not define by any of it!

"Strengths: Awesome plot, quick read, beautiful illustrations, great references to the original book, hilarious characters, snappy dialogue, hidden references for political junkies.Weaknesses: Slow start, could use more about Pinocchios wife, overly sentimental at times, simplistic view of congress.Great book! Kind of a sequel to The Adventures of Pinocchio, this takes place in modern day America and picks up with an adult Pinocchio working for a company called The Kronos Group, a powerful D.C. lobby firm headed by a Jack Abramoff-type character, Charles Stevens. Pinocchio is married, has a young son, and lives near his father, Geppepto, who is portrayed as a doddering old man with one foot in the grave. It seems that Pinocchio has forgotten that he was once a puppet, and he resents Geppeptos telling stories about his youth to his son, Albero. Otherwise, Pinocchio is shown as a true innocent who doesn't fully understand Washington, or politics in general for that matter.The book is told from the perspective of a newspaper reporter, Max Wiggs, who wrote an article that accidentally launched Pinocchio to fame by playing up his absolute honesty. Later, its alluded to that Pinocchio cant lie, and the reason it isnt revealed until midway through the book in a hilarious way. Pinocchio, his head swimming with thoughts of fame and power, becomes disenfranchised from his family, even going so far as to throw Geppepto into a nursing home (The Weeping Pines Retirement Center Ha!). But slowly, Pinocchio starts to realize that Geppepto may have been telling the truth when he learns that he can talk to animals and trees. Everything comes crashing down when he tells a complete lie while giving testimony to congress and he transforms into a puppet once again. Panicked, he sets out to cure himself and learns he has to find a fairy and a cricket, only to learn the fairy is an ugly, womanizing, drunken old man, and the talking cricket is a slimy cockroach with thousands of children.At this point, the book takes an unexpected turn, going from a somewhat predictable story about a good man corrupted by power to something else altogether. Reading the last half is like watching an action movie  well paced, exciting, and with a really unexpected twist at the end.The writing is super strong, with memorable witticisms that remind me of Oscar Wildes short stories. That being said, the pacing could be better. The first hundred pages or so, while funny, is slow. But once Pinocchio becomes a puppet again, the story just takes off. The book is dripping with subtext and carries a lot of themes  parenthood, marriage, even Greek mythology (and for us political junkies, the author loads up the story with easter eggs that I think the average reader wont get - look for the plaque on the secretarys desk). The animal characters, in my opinion, are actually representations of humanity. They are cruel, racist, fearful, in other words, the worst of us. The remind me of the barnyard in George Orwells Animal Farm, another great satirical work.I do wish I could have learned more about Pinocchios wife. In the end, she remains a somewhat flat character. Overall, however, the characters are very true to life, the dialogue is fun, and the book is an enjoyable quick read.I had trouble with this review because, honestly, there is just so much going on in this book. Somehow, the author has managed to build a rich, colorful, new world out of characters weve all known for years. This book is something entirely new, and I hope a lot of readers enjoy it! Well done!","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R4973AZRDYWUJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014728WNS#wasThisHelpful","R4973AZRDYWUJ","A1YNUATTJS5FCM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1YNUATTJS5FCM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I bought this book after reading an article about it being awarded Editor's Choice from the Historical Novel Society. At under a buck I figured it was worth a shot, and if it wasn't that great, I still had an award winning book on my Kindle to pretend I read. Not that anyone casually browses through my Kindle, but you know what I mean. Fake bragging rights, if you will. Fair trade for a dollar.What I ended up with was a great read. Mount of Hope is written in the spirit of classical fiction without all the loquaciousness. The Victorian dialogue, descriptions, and flavor are on every page in a most natural and fluid representation of the time. The story of the Julia/Alfred/Amelia triangle is clean, entertaining and clever, with a good balance of gravity and humor.

"I love the cover art, whoever drew the main character did a good job. Later in the book you'll find yourself wondering what Tetris (the main character) looks like with his transformation. The description in the book is pretty graphic but I like the fact that the cover visualizes that a bit more. This book is full of twists and turns, the story is tight the way I like it, and the language is vivid and succinct. There are a lot of idiosyncrasies in there that I think depends on who's reading you may find that brilliant or complicated. At times it feels like a mind-fck (all the Barry Hanshaw excerpts pretty much) but I like it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3JUWXN74WV97R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0140BLETU#wasThisHelpful","R3JUWXN74WV97R","A1YNUATTJS5FCM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1YNUATTJS5FCM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Guaranteed Solutions contains golden nuggets of spiritual insight and the appropriate spiritual practice, the essence of which is ""live in the present moment, fully conscious, fully aware, centered in your being"".The book appears to be a transcript of Nithyananda's talks, and each chapter contains several short stories, designed to entertain as well as illustrate the point he is trying to make.  Here's one of them:""A 90-year old man used to sit every day at the beach from morning to evening, watching the people going by.Another man who noticed this went up to him and asked him, ""What do you actually do sitting here everyday?""The old man replied, ""I am searching for a woman to be my wife.""The man was simply shocked at this replay and asked him, ""why did you not search in your youth?""The old man replied, ""I have been searching since I was 30 years old.""The man was astonished and asked him, ""What sort of a woman are you searching for?""He replied, ""I am searching for a perfect woman.""""And you haven't found one?"" the man asked.""I found one woman who matched what I had in mind but it didn't work out well with her"", replied the old man.The man asked why.The old man replied, ""She was searching for a perfect man.""Some chapters also contain spiritual practices and meditations scooped from different sources from Kularnava Tantra, to a variation of Christian (Pentecostal) practice of speaking in tongues.  Some meditations, like Darkness meditation technique taken from Vedanta, contain warning ""One should not do this meditation without the presence of an ordained teacher of Life Bliss Foundation"".The book also contains questions from participants and Nithyananda's answers.  Many of the questions, answers and examples in this book may appeal particularly to people who are accustomed to the way of life in India.Few quotes from this book:""Spirituality is always all encompassing.  Drop your notions of ""I am this"" or ""I am that"".  Keep your life open.  This is the basis of spirituality.""""Be very clear that all miseries arise because of self-contradictions.  You yourself are not fully clear about what you want to do and so you are unable to do it.""""Again and again, scan your mind and see what it is that gives you joy.

"While some information in this book is a bit dated and it was primarily focused on direct marketing, Dan Kennedy also shares timeless principles of writing sales letters that can be applied even today no matter what kind of sales letters you are writing.Getting to know your target audience will never become outdated, and the suggestions he shares from his past experience are quite thorough.  He mentions that in order to get into the mind of his readers, in this instance dentists,  he'd read every industry publication every month, visit websites that host discussions forums for dentists, subscribe to email groups where only dentists communicate back and forth, attend industry functions, conventions, seminars, trade shows, he'd play prospect, and routine mastermind with dentists.He then shares a step-by-step process he used to write a copy, very detailed with various examples.  He shares a fill-in-the-blank headlines with examples, different ways to attract attention and to overcome barriers, how to re-write and then he offers an extensive check-list with 35 points to check your copy.Yes he does have a plug for his website and services which I find appropriate in this book, and he also has a plug for few other tools like mike Capuzzi's CopyDoodles.He then suggests re-writing for passion, and editing for clarity, and how to test your copy.At the end of the book you'll find additional resources.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2XLGH2MG138GG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004J35JFU#wasThisHelpful","R2XLGH2MG138GG","AAXIW3SRA0S4R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AAXIW3SRA0S4R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This book is written in a form of letters from a caring father, Gary Halbert, who is serving time in Boron prison to his son, Bond Halbert.Through these letters Gary is giving advice to Bond related to general health, well-being and conduct in life, as well as to direct marketing and copywriting.  The letters also contain brief descriptions of incidents from prison life.  Bond says he left them in this book, so that the reader would have an idea under what kind of conditions Gary wrote these letters.Gary walks his talk and is trying to teach his son through examples from his own life.Among those suggestions for well-being is the advice to run for half an hour or for an hour each day, or for that matter to engage in some form of physical exercise, not just for the sake of exercising the body, but because neuro-science has indeed proven that if you move your body, your brain works better, which would then influence your ability to think and come up with better ideas for direct marketing and copywriting.His next suggestion relates to eating fruits and fasting at least one day a week. Again, the idea is that if you have a healthy body, you'll be able to be more productive in your direct marketing and copywriting attempts.Gary then shares wonderful insights for direct marketing and copywriting, though in sporadic fashion, as they occur to him and sometimes he's not sure what should he mention next.  In other words, they were written for Bond, who was at the time of writing these letters 16 years old and who also mentioned in the book that his father has been taking him to various direct-marketing and copywriting events or seminars since he was 9 years old.Even though these letters were written in the 80's, many of those insights are timeless, like different tips and tricks on how to attract attention, stimulate interest and desire, and call for action; how to go about getting the leads, to write simple and to read your copy aloud several times until it reads smoothly.Gary would mention what to do and what not to do - for example that you should first find the hot market, and then the product, rather than the other way around.And he'd describe the general process of developing and testing direct marketing packages, for example to start with 5,000 letters, and depending on response increase it to 50,000 or more.Since these letters were written in the 80's, Bond has added his commentary underneath each letter in an attempt to correlate those principles to internet marketing.I got the book in a kindle format, which may differ from the paperback.  The edition of the book I purchased contains typos and grammar errors in the commentary, which makes you feel like eating a super delicious apple and finding a worm inside.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1X0IP0T3D2GAW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BMWEFR4#wasThisHelpful","R1X0IP0T3D2GAW","AAXIW3SRA0S4R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AAXIW3SRA0S4R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"If you like the books and teachings of Ramana Maharshi and Nisargadatta Maharaj, and if you enjoy reading books related to advaita, non-duality, here's a gem of a book, with teachings by Wu Hsin, intended to help you realize your true nature.The realization is not an intellectual process, so it is not enough to just read the book.  But the words in this book are like seeds which if you nurture through constant contemplation, will give birth to the experience of the true nature.Wu Hsin talks about the same thing from many different perspectives, so that if you're having difficulty getting it one way, another way may perfectly resonate with you.Here are few pointers from this book:""Wu Hsin's instructions will not lead you to anywhere.  They lead you toward the place that you have never departed from.""""Truth does not require your agreement, merely your recognition.""""There is nothing to learn, however, there is much to unlearn.""""All that is needed is to relinquish one's erroneous beliefs.""""To be free from the obsession with ""What's next?"" is all instruction necessary.  You are waiting for the arrival of something that is already present.""""Enlightenment is the return to that point of view that was operative prior to the arising of self-consciousness.  It is unitive in its very nature.""""I am is the ultimate fact.  ""What am I?"" is the ultimate question.""""What you strive for is what you imagine you must strive for.  With the cessation of striving, what needs to arrive, arrives.""""What is experienced is the content of consciousness.""""You want to escape your prison,but you haven't discerned that the thinking you're in prison is the prison.""""Remove the attention from what is personal and what reveals itself is The Source, without which neither light no darkness could be cognized.""""You emit the world and its activities without doing anything.""""There is never a problem in the outside world.  All problems are in the mind.""""If you really want to end the searching, you must return the way you came.""""Consciousness can well exist, all alone, without phenomena.  But, phenomena, can never exist without Consciousness.""""Here is the secret:  Thought obscures happiness.""""Recede from concepts into perception; then recede from perception into Being.""""The truth doesn't set you free.

"This is the first book in Dr. Yang's Qigong series and it provides an overview of Qigong for health and martial arts. Like his other books, this one begins with the history of qigong, and the general principles of qigong.  This one also deals with popular martial arts styles of qigong.Following the introduction, the book is divided in sections on Wai Dan Qigong (external cultivation), Nei Dan Qigong (internal cultivation), Qigong for Health, and Martial Arts Applications.The external cultivation includes illustrated Da Mo's Yi Jin Jing, Open Palm Sequence, Moving Forms, Ba Duan Jin (Eight Pieces of Brocade), and Still yoga-like stretching exercises.  Some of these you may be able to do, at least as far as physical movement is involved, by just following the illustrations and descriptions, while for others you may be better off if you either watch them on a video or participate in a live instruction.The internal cultivation includes the Small Circulation (Microcosmic Orbit) , Grand Circulation, Qi Enhancement and Transport Training, and Chi Self-Massage after the exercises.  While the information provided may serve as an overview, you may want to cross-reference it with other works, perhaps Mantak Chia's.  In this book Dr. Yang is making it seem much harder to do than it truly is and you'll encounter all kinds of warnings if you do it improperly, and Mantak Chia teaches some preparatory exercises that make the circulation a breeze.  Also for some reason, Dr. Yang's has misplaced Ming Men, the Door of Life, and keeps referring to it as if it were the point behind the heart, when in fact, Ming Men is the point between the kidneys.In the Health section, Dr. Yang shares an overview of qigong healing modalities like health diagnosis, acupuncture and massage, using taiji balls and six healing sounds - not enough to get you to do them yourself for a healing, but more to get an idea of modalities that you may want to explore further.In Martial Arts section the focus is mainly on cavity press or chin-na, which Dr. Yang's explains in much greater detail in his related books and an excellent video.While this book may not be perfect on its own, I still do recommend it for the avalanche of good information.  Just do cross-reference it with other related books and videos.  I do recommend just about all books and videos by Dr. Yang Jwing Ming, as well as most of those by Mantak Chia.  Dr. Yang's work though seems to gravitate toward martial arts, and Mantak Chia's toward taoist spiritual alchemy, but many basic practices overlap and they wonderfully complement each other.  There are other good others, but these two seem to be among the most prolific authors.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2LJ870GN1BAH4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001VH6P7I#wasThisHelpful","R2LJ870GN1BAH4","AAXIW3SRA0S4R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AAXIW3SRA0S4R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"While I can attest to the effectiveness of the Eight Pieces of Brocade, when done properly, I was expecting this books to have more information specific to the exercises themselves.This is a small book of 112 pages, and only 20% of this book is dedicated to the actual Eight Pieces of Brocade, half of that to sitting exercises, and half to standing exercises, that's about 10 pages for each, and since illustrations take about half a page, you'll get the bare minimum of guidance for the exercise.As Dr. Yang says, he wrote the book to be used together with the videos. Although you can get the gist of the exercises from the illustrations and the right-up and you may be able to perform them to some point even using this book, and you may get the benefit from the purely physical movement, there is no specific guidance for coordinating breathing with the movements, nor the visualizations that help you to get the most of the exercises, nor a key instruction regarding a simple thing you must do get the energy circulating.Also, for some reason when talking to Middle Dan Tian, Dr. Yang keeps saying several times that it is in the solar plexus region, and sometimes that it is at the heart center.  And the kidney point, the Door of Life, which is called Ming Men, he has renamed here Jing Men.  Acupuncture charts depict Jing Men as a point on the side of the ribcage.The first chapter of this book, which is about 30% of the book deals with the history of Qigong, second part of the book, again about 30% deals with the theory of Qigong, and the last 20% of the book is the glossary.While Dr. Yang emphasizes that he believes that the theory of Qigong is more important than the actual form of the exercise, and while I respect all the hard work he invested in translating the works and sharing the information with the west, he also added that he found it difficult to translate some Chinese concepts into English and at times his choice of English words doesn't help to make the meaning any clearer.  At times the writing style seems somewhat erratic, as if Dr. Yang was just jotting down his thoughts on paper, and feel that further editing might have helped to organize and present the information in a way that would be easier to comprehend.I have read books by Mantak Chia, Bruce Frantzis, Eva Wong, Thomas Cleary, Robert Peng and others, and have found these writers to present the information in a clear and easy-to-understand way.  Again, I do greatly appreciate Dr. Yang's life-work, but have found this book to have, perhaps a lot of information that may be interesting, but not necessarily helpful for the Eight Pieces of Brocade, and I have found some information which would've been more helpful for the Eight Pieces of Brocade missing.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1O19DMGUYZ6FH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00317G70G#wasThisHelpful","R1O19DMGUYZ6FH","AAXIW3SRA0S4R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AAXIW3SRA0S4R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Master Key: Qigong Secrets for Vitality, Love, and Wisdom is beautifully written.Through the first five chapters, Robert describes his journey, meeting his teacher Xiao Yao when he was 8 years old, and practicing 2 - 4 hours a day, first martial arts, and then qigong for healing, while cultivating inner balance and developing spiritual awareness.In the course of his training, he says that he learned hundreds of Qigong practices, and in this book he shares several foundational practices. Through the following 11 chapters, Robert guides you to the process of awakening qi power, using a sword finger, creating a qi ball, empowering three dantiens (lower, middle, and upper), balancing the three dantiens, empowering the central meridian, lotus meditation, and connecting universe exercise.The qigong exercises are illustrated, and there are links to brief videos at SoundsTrue website.  While these videos are helpful, they seem to be designed more to give you a preview of what you may expect from the DVDs you can get to get more out of the exercises.Having also purchased the Master Key videos through the SoundsTrue website, just as this book, they are truly professionally created.  Robert has a resonant, hypnotic voice and through the video he radiates calm, balanced energy and both the videos and this book are at the same time informative, instructional and enjoyable.The slant of qigong practice presented in this book is primarily on creating inner balance, and becoming spiritually centered in the process, and then transforming inner imbalances and fostering healing through manipulation of energy, as well as through spiritual awareness.Robert has dedicated a good chunk of this book to the cultivation of spiritual awareness, and here he shares a simple practice for experiencing Awakened Awareness.Through the last three chapters, Robert shares guidelines for practicing the exercises; explores how energetic imbalances affect relationships and intimacy, and how you can create a healthier, more balanced relationships by first cultivating inner balance; and has a chapter on the evolution of the self-aware universe.The practices involving the balancing and empowerment of three dantiens and the central meridian are called the Four Golden Wheels, and the practices presented in this book are summed up by Xiao Yao:""Awaken the Four Golden Wheels. Become wiser, more loving, and more capable of taking action in the face of the unknown.  Remain centered, balanced, and in a state of open flow.  When the four wheels are turning smoothly, you find yourself in the right place, at the right time, doing the right thing, with the right people.  A clearing appears before you.  This path is your destiny, and with every step you take you are happy and the whole world rejoices.""","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3GW3F2JBS84YY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HZVN60S#wasThisHelpful","R3GW3F2JBS84YY","AAXIW3SRA0S4R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AAXIW3SRA0S4R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The talks with Ramana Maharshi in this book are presented in question and answer format. In the introduction, it says that 68% of these talks are the same as the ones presented in the book ""Talks with Ramana Maharshi"".The talks are presented through chapters, with various headings like ""The Mind"", ""The Ultimate as Reality"", ""The Ultimate as Truth"", and a number of the talks are repeated verbatim under different chapters.The talks consist of similar questions asked by people who have not experienced the Self, and Ramana's attempt to put in words that which can only be known through experience.Ramana thus points over and over again, that the experience of the Self is a natural experience, that the person gets to experience it through self-enquiry by tracing his thoughts back to the Source, the Self, which results not in a verbal answer to self-enquiry, but in experience of the Self, and once experienced, all that is left is to practice abiding in the Self.In this practice, the thoughts arising out of ego, the bodily identification, begin to dissolve.  In the beginning the practice requires conscious effort.  Eventually, it becomes effortless, natural expression of the Self.A person asks, ""What is this Self?Ramana answers, ""Know the Self and God is known.  Of all the definitions of God none is so well put as the Biblical ""I am that I AM"" in Exodus III.  But none is so direct as the  - ""I AM"" - The Absolute Is.  It is Self, God.Another one says, ""Convince me of the existence of God.""Ramana answers, Realization of the Self amounts to such conviction.""Yet another asks, ""How is ""I-I consciousness felt?""Ramana answers, ""As an unbroken awareness of ""I"".  It is simply consciousness.  You are that even now.  There will be no mistaking it, when pure.""Q. ""How is God to be seen?""A. Within.  If the mind is turned inward, God manifests as the inner consciousness.Q. ""What is liberation?""A.""It is to know you were not born.  Be still and know that I am God.  To be still is not to think.  You have lost hold of yourself.  Turn inward.  If the mind's source is sought, it will vanish leaving the Self behind.""""Self is beyond knowledge and ignorance.  It is Self-luminous.""""Self lies beyond [hearing or seeing] - all alone as pure Consciousness.""""The consciousness within, purged of the mind, is felt as God.""""The Self is here and now and alone.  It is not new and something to be acquired.  It is natural and permanent.""Q. ""How to get rid of fear?""A.  ""All fear is nothing more than thoughts.  If there is only one there cannot be a second (to be afraid of).  To think that there is something outside ourselves is the cause of fear, but if firmly rooted in our own reality, then there will be no fear, no doubt, no undesirable qualities, as all the latter are centered about the ego.""""We talk of attaining the Self, of reaching God with time.  There is nothing to attain.  We are already Self-Existent.  Nor will there ever be a time when we shall be nearer to God than now.  We are now ever blissful, Self-Existent, the Infinite.  Our consciousness is unbroken, continuous, and eternal.""""There is only one Self and it is fully conscious now and ever.  There is neither past, present nor future for it, since it is out of time. Without the Infinite Power, God, the true Self, this incense would not burn, this world would not exist.  This Self is in all forms.  It alone gives them reality.  Hence the Illumined One finds himself in all others, for he has found Unity and no longer perceives multiplicity.""","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3QSAAF0WHKAOH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00F13MWMU#wasThisHelpful","R3QSAAF0WHKAOH","AAXIW3SRA0S4R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AAXIW3SRA0S4R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"No book will ever reveal the secrets of the absolute.  That can only be discovered through direct experience, and in that sense whoever seeks to know God by reading the book, and through intellectual understanding will always find something missing, no matter what book he reads.Patanjali Yoga Sutras point the way.  They are divided in four chapters.  The first chapter defines the goal - samadhi - the absorption into undifferentiated consciousness, and gives an idea of what it means to practice and experience yoga. The second chapter describes the practices which help to overcome the obstacles to full spiritual realization.  The third chapter gives insight into different abilities that may arise through dedicated practice of yoga.  And the fourth chapter describes the states of consciousness preceding the Self-realization and indications of the full spiritual liberation.The essence of the entire practice is - to know God, hold only God in your conscious awareness.Different commentators of Patanjali Yoga Sutra share different insights, so reading different version of Patanjali Yoga Sutra is helpful.  Some commentaries may be clearer than others, and this one is very good, insofar that it uses simple language.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RVX4EICTOL3VW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001F7BE5C#wasThisHelpful","RVX4EICTOL3VW","AAXIW3SRA0S4R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AAXIW3SRA0S4R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Sri Yukteswar wrote The Holy Science at the request of Mahavatar Babaji with the purpose of bridging Eastern and Western Spirituality.  However, even though this book has verses from the Bible, its flavor is distinctly Eastern.The introduction to the book explores the calculation of yugas,, and stating the the object of this book is to point out the harmony underlying the various religions, and to help in binding them together.The book is divided into 4 Chapters: The Gospel, The Goal, The Procedure, The Revelation - according to the four stages in the development of knowledge.  The highest aim of religion is Atmajnanam, Self-knowledge.The first section of the book deals with Veda and the Gospel, and seeks to establish fundamental truths of creation and to describe the evolution and involution of the world.The book is written in the form of sutras with commentaries, e.g.Sutra 1: Parambrahma (Spirit or God) is infinite, complete, without start or end.  It is one, undividable Being.""The Eternal Father, God, Swami Parambrahma, is the only Real Substance, Sat, and is all in all in the universe.Now, instead of adding characteristics of God as mentioned in the verses of the Gospel (as in ""God is Light"" or ""God is Love""), Sri Yukteswar quotes the verses,""Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen.""""Then said Jesus unto them, When ye have lifted up the son of man, then shall ye know that I am he.""adding that God is incomprehensible by man of this material world (by human consciousness), and can only be comprehensible if a man lifts himself above the creation of Darkness or Maya.Sutra 2: In Parambrahma is the source of all knowing and love, the root of all power and joy.Sutra 3: Parambrahma emanates creation, inert Nature (Prakriti) to emerge.  From Om (Pranava, the Word, the manifestation of the Omnipresent Force) come Kala, Time, Desa, Space, and Anu, the Atom (the vibratory structure of creation).""Sutra 4:  ""The fundament of creation is Anu or the Atoms.  Together they are called Maya or the Lord's veil of projection; each individual Anu is called Avidya, Ignorance.""Atoms are the throne of Spirit the Creator.  They are called en masse Maya, the Darkness, as they keep the Spiritual Light out of comprehension, and each of them separately is called Avidya, the Ignorance, as it makes man ignorant even of his own Self.He then compares these 4 ideas which gave rise to all confusions, to the 4 bests mentioned in the chapter of Revelations of the Bible.""And in the midst of the throne, and round about the throne, were four beasts full of eyes before and behind.""The Holy Ghost, being the manifestation of the Omniscient Nature of the Eternal Father, God, is no other substance than God Himself, and so these reflections of spiritual rays are called the Sons of God - Abhasa Chaiitanya or Purusha.""In him was life, and the life was the light of men.  And the light shines in the darkness, and the darkness comprehends it not.""This now continues with exploration of the nature of the Ahamkara with 5 different bodies, different senses, different objects of the senses, and so on, followed by exploration of 14 spheres - seven swargas or lokas and seven patalas, five koshas or sheaths of Purusha, and different kingdoms from animal to angelic.On the 2nd birth he says ""Through his luminous body, man, believing in the existence of the true Light - the Life of this universe - becomes baptized or absorbed in the holy stream of the sound.  The baptism is, so to speak, the second birth of man and is called Bhakti Yoga, without which man can never comprehend the real internal world, the kingdom of God.""Emancipation (Kaivalya) is obtained when one realizes the oneness of his Self with the Universal Self, the Supreme Reality.""""When all the developments of Ignorance are withdrawn, the heart, being perfectly clear and purified, no longer merely reflects the Spiritual Light but actively manifests the same, and thus being consecrated and anointed, man becomes Sannyasi, free, or Christ the Savior.""""Liberation is stabilization of Purusha (jiva, soul) in its real Self.""""Residing in Self is liberation.  When man raises himself above the idea of creation of this Darkness, Maya, and passes completely out of its influence, he becomes liberated from bondage and is placed in his real Self, the Eternal Spirit.""""Then there is cessation of all pain and the attainment of the ultimate aim (true fulfillment, God-realization).""""Liberation is salvation.  On attaining this liberation, man becomes saved from all his troubles, and all the desires of his heart are fulfilled, so the ultimate aim of his life is accomplished.""""I have said, Ye are gods;and all of you are children of the most High.""","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1J9ASGZNHRKQT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00D3Q6A2A#wasThisHelpful","R1J9ASGZNHRKQT","AAXIW3SRA0S4R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AAXIW3SRA0S4R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Together with verses from the Bible that inspire faith, Joseph Murphy shares inspiring stories.""All things whatsoever ye shall ask in prayer, believe that ye receive them, and ye shall receive them.""Believe means to live in the state of being it.""Believe that you have it now, and ye shall have it"".""Call things that be not, as though they were, and the unseen becomes seen.""Murphy also shares tips for the practice of the presence of God.The first step is to realize that God is the Only Power.  Your whole world will change as you really begin to see God in everything and everyone. If you say and believe God is the only Presence, the only Power, Infinitely Good, Perfect, Boundless Love, and Limitless Life, your whole life will be transformed.""The real Name of God, insofar as you are concerned is your concept or your belief about God.You practice the presence of God when you choose to hold in your consciousness only the eternal truths and perceive that which is eternal in everyone and everything in your life.Murphy has chosen to portray the nature of faith beautifully through the Song of Solomon, where your lover is the Invisible Presence within you - the Almighty Power which created the Universe.As you go to sleep every night, clothe yourself with the garment of love, peace, and joy.  Love gives birth to all things.

"The recommendation in this book is based on the author's experience, which may be described as forcibly induced kundalini experience, but it has nothing to do with Self-Realization.  He is confusing varieties of kundalini, psychic and spiritual experiences with Self-Realization.  In spite of sharing the quotes from Ramana Maharshi's books, the author unfortunately doesn't have any comprehension of what Self-Realization is.  Thus the value of his critique of the methods used by yogis and Self-Realized beings and his assertion that you can become a Self-Realized Being using his method is pointless.The author describes his experience as the energy shooting up his spine, exploding in a shower of brilliant light, and him feeling like a marionette at the mercy of energy contorting his body violently, where he would've felt frightened except for a benevolent presence and experience of intensely erotic sensuality.In the experience of Self-Realization, you experience yourself as One Eternal Self, as pure undifferentiated luminous consciousness.  You don't see the Light - You  experience yourself as the Light.  There is no benevolence presence.  You are IT - the absolute changeless reality.  Your human consciousness dissolves in the infinite consciousness. Whatever you knew as your human self, the body, the mind - doesn't exist.  The only thing that exists is Pure Light.  You are the Limitless Formless Light - the entire creation contained within it, not in form, but as pure potential.Having the experience ultimately entails holding in your mind and heart only that which is eternal, allowing everything else to dissolve. Some may have the experience instantly through total surrender, others practice techniques that get them to dissolve human consciousness over time.  Having an experience of the Eternal Self, is only the beginning.  The journey is not complete until the experience becomes stabilized.  A Self-Realized being lives moment to moment from this undifferentiated consciousness.While the author states in some parts of his book that the experience he had was inconsequential, that it happened spontaneously without any cause, thus claiming no practice is necessary, and no practice will get you there - at the same time he states that here is the practice he followed and which he recommends as a 21 day practice:1. Month-long bicycle tour2. Substandard, calorie-restricted diet3. Sleep Deprivation4. Sexual Abstinence5. Hatha Yoga and Tai Chi Chuan (he also claims these do not work)6. Daily practice of deep relaxation before sleep and immediately upon awakening7. Sleep disturbance: being prematurely drawn up out of sleep by light of the seeing sun.8. Brainwave entrainmentThe author's recommended practice of forced deprivation from bodily needs can indeed induce all kinds of psycho-spiritual experiences, but where it takes you will ultimately depend on where your mind and heart are.  If your mind and heart are fixed on the Immortal Self, and during the practice you are placing all that you know yourself to be, your mind, your heart, your body into the hands of your Immortal Self, having nothing else in your consciousness, you may very well experience the Self.However, if your mind is fixed on bodily needs, and you're feeling deprived, these will seek fulfillment through your dreams - a man hungry for food may dream of food, a man hungry for sex will dream of sex, which is why the author has concluded that spiritual practice induces sexual dreams.  The author's summary of the chapter on Kundalini and Dreams ends with his conclusion that self-realization is about having stronger erections and enhanced sexual experiences.  The author also shares his insights on autoerotic asphyxiation - if that's what you're looking for this may be the right book for you.  Self-Realized Being does not have dreams, because he is fully conscious, even while his body sleeps.Self-Realization is an experience of Liberation from human identity, consciousness and experience, not about orgasmic pleasure. Immortal Bliss and Peace and Ultimate Freedom come from realization and experience that I AM not this body - I AM The Immortal Light - and apart from that nothing exists.  So, in the experience of Self-Realization that is all that you experience Light and nothing but the Light - the Immortal Reality - and that is the truth that sets you free.","1.0 out of 5 stars","January 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R19QVY9H05J5RI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00D4T8AYC#wasThisHelpful","R19QVY9H05J5RI","AAXIW3SRA0S4R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AAXIW3SRA0S4R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a very well written book about praying with Biblical excerpts. It reads more like a dissertation about praying, rather than being a collection of prayers.  It also has sections that may be more useful for pastors and ministers rather people who are just praying on their own.The book is balanced with many common sense tips and helpful insights from the author.The author begins by saying ""I discovered that prayer is not a religious exercise - it is a human necessity."" and I fully agree wit it.He continues, ""I discovered that prayer is the secret weapon ... It is like a missile that can be fired toward any spot on earth, travel undetected at the speed of thought and hit its target every time.""For what can we pray?  Bible encourages us to pray about everything.  ""If you abide in Me, and My words abide in you, you will ask what you desire, and it shall be done for you.""""Worry about nothing, says Paul, and pray about everything"" (Philippians 4:6)At times, the author shares quotes by other authors, like Dr. Curtis Mitchell,  ""Prayer is set forth as the chief task of the believer.  It is his responsibility to ask.  it is God's responsibility to accomplish.""The author emphasizes that we are urged to ask for what want and while we may ask for anything, he suggests that what we ask should be in accord with God's will.  He also points out that the more godly our lives are, the more powerful will our prayers be, and that while our prayers are answered immediately, they will be delivered in the ""fullness of time"", when the time is right.I the chapter on Why God answers prayers, the author quotes ""And whatever you ask in My name, that will I do, that the Father may be glorified in the Son."" (John 14:13)In the chapter on fasting, he mentioned few verses from the Bible where Peter, James and John attempted unsuccessfully to cast the demon out of the boy.  After Jesus arrived on the scene and delivered the boy, his disciples asked Him privately, ""Why could we not cast him out?""  And He said to them, ""This kind can come out by nothing but prayer and fasting."" (Mark 9:28, 29)The author then shares different kinds of fasting mentioned in the bible, lasting 3, 5, 7, 21, or 40 days, some being complete abstinence from food and water, most being water or liquid fasts, and some being abstinence from some kinds of food, but not all.On account of intercession, the author says ""We are never more like Christ than when we are praying for others.""  He goes at great length to describe what the prayer is and isn't and how to go about praying.  The author also recommends that the reader reads as many other books on praying as he can.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 5, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R28YE0DBJDG3ZJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0840743939#wasThisHelpful","R28YE0DBJDG3ZJ","AAXIW3SRA0S4R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AAXIW3SRA0S4R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Claim Your Anointing is a collection of interviews with people who are using their gifts ministering to people all over the world.The interviews are excerpted from previously published books Shifting Shadows or Supernatural Power and Supernatural Anointing.The book begins by a quote from Randy Clark ""be careful of limiting God.  There are different anointings for different seasons of time, for what you care called to do. It is not like there is one anointing.""The interviews presented in the book are  ""You are so much more than you know"" by Julia Loren, ""The Price to pay for the anointing"" by Randy Clark, ""Claiming the anointing of the Holy Spirit"" by Bill Johnson, ""Claiming the Anointing of a true prophet"" by Graham Cooke, ""Claiming the anointing for strategic warfare"" by Mahesh Chavda, 'Claiming the anointing for miracles of healing"" by David Hogan, ""Claiming the anointing to reconcile nations"" by Myles Weiss, ""Claiming the anointing of love to change the world"" by Heidi Baker, ""Claiming the anointing of power for kissings"" by Leif Hetland, ""Claiming the anointing to reach your sacred destiny"" by John Paul Jackson and Paul Keith Davis.Julia Loren says ""As you read about the various gifts, callings and anointings, listen to the voice of the Holy Spirit whispering, ""This is you! This is you!"".  Through the interviews you get a glimpse into different anointings, and the interviews are supposed to help you discover how you may use your talents and abilities in service to others and thus life your life abundantly, meaningfully and joyfully.""The anointing is God's love saturating your life and overflowing to others. If you want more of the anointing, you are, in reality, asking for more of God's love.  Love releases the gifts in greater measure than you ever dreamed could happen through you.  ... The supernatural charisma gifts, or graces, from the Holy Spirit are simply tools, which are always given by God to serve others.The gifts are yours to express but given by God alone and to God alone, belongs the glory.  They are born out of God's love for you and are released out of love for God.""""Do you want to know who the happiest people are?  Not the rich, nor the most gifted.  The happiest people are those who find their purpose in life and release their gifts in such a way that they discover they are living a meaningful existence.  The happiest people on earth are those who are living in the flow of grace - releasing God's favor and gifts to others. ... Claiming your anointing will not make you happy.  Releasing the anointing will ... if it is done to the glory of God and not to your own desire for glory.""","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 4, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R28UV8P94XF710/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BFMJI9G#wasThisHelpful","R28UV8P94XF710","AAXIW3SRA0S4R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AAXIW3SRA0S4R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The book contains the author's choice of selection of verses from the Bible.  The author has divided the book in different sections like Overcoming Negative Thinking, Protection through Proclamations, Financial and Physical Needs, Health and Strength, Guidance, Protection and Preservation, Testing and Trials, Mental and Emotional Stability, and so on.  Some verses are repeated 3 or 4 times in different section.Here are sample verses:Three of my mightiest weapons areproclamation, thanksgiving, and praise.Behold the manner of lovethe Father has bestowed upon us,that we should be calledchildren of God!And we are.Therefore the world does not know us,because it did not know Him,Beloved, now we are children of God,and it has not yet been revealedwhat we shall be,but we know that when He is revealed,we shall be like Him,for we shall see Him as He is.And everyone who has this hope in Himpurifies himself, just as He is pure.We have known and believedthe love that God has for us.God is love, and he who abides in loveabides in God, and God in him.This is our prayer:that the God may give to usa spirit of wisdom and revelationin the knowledge of Him,the eyes of our understanding being enlightened ...Bless The Lord, O my soul,and all that is within me,bless His holy name,Bless the Lord, O my soul,and forget not all his benefits;Who forgiveth all thine iniquities;who healeth all thy diseases;Who redeemeth thy life from destruction;who crowneth thee with lovingkindnessand tender mercies;Who satisfieth thy mouth with good things;so that thy youth is renewed like the eagle's.Finally brethren,whatsoever things are true,whatsoever things are noble,whatsoever things are just,whatsoever things are pure,whatsoever things are lovely,whatsoever things are of good report,if there is any virtue,and if there is anything praiseworthy,we meditate on these things.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 3, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1G16V7CVWOX6D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0082EJ2YQ#wasThisHelpful","R1G16V7CVWOX6D","AAXIW3SRA0S4R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AAXIW3SRA0S4R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In this book Don shares his views and experiences with deliverance.He says that he wished to be able to do more for people than he seemed able to, so he prayed from deep in his heart to be a deliverer and to lead people out of bondage.  He prayed to be the God's instrument of freedom.  In time, he was lead to help those who felt oppressed and who couldn't help themselves.He shares possible reasons why someone may get under the oppressive influence - the main one being some kind of unforgiveness. Thus in deliverance, the first things he asks the person to do is to forgive anyone and anything that may need forgiveness in his life.He points out that in order for someone to become oppressed, there must be some permission granted by the person, there must be a ""gate"" or doorway of opportunity.  Among these permissions he lists generational curses, traumatic experiences, weakness of mind or body, pain, spoken curses, feelings of fear, anger, shame, guilt, addictions, activities where the person doesn't seem to be able to exercise control, seven deadly sins, involvement in varieties of occult activities.While he lists involvement in different practices and activities as possible entranceways, making his viewpoint sound extremist, perhaps it would be more accurate to focus on one's state of mind and heart during those activities rather than on activity itself.  If someone spills hot water on himself while cooking in a moment he had an upsetting thought, it wouldn't make much sense to conclude that one got possessed by demons (if you'd choose to attribute burning accident to a demon) because of cooking activity, but rather to an upsetting thought.Scripture says ""He who doesn't love doesn't know God, for God is love"" (1 John 4:8); """"God is love, and he who remains in love remains in God, and God remains in him"" (1 John 4:16); ""Above all these things, walk in love, which is the bond of perfection"" (Col 3:14). The one walking in love bears the fruits of love, and one walking in fear bears the fruits of fear, ""therefore by their fruits you shall know them"" (Matthew 7:20) ""The fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faith."" (Galatians 5:22)  These verses may offer a better guideline as to what state of mind may be more conducive to attract dismal influences in one's life - Are you filled with worry or with peace? Are you filled with thoughts and feelings of condemnation or do you walk in love? Like attracts like.The author says that in his experience virtually anything that a doctor calls a ""disorder"" may be caused by demons.  He lists then things that demons don't like - the name of Jesus Christ, the anointing oil, praise music, the word ""holy"", the name Jehovah causes them to fear and tremble.In clearing the person from oppressive influence, Don would ask the oppressed individual to first forgive whatever needs forgiveness, to repent whatever he may have done wrong and to renounce the activity and the association with whatever created the opening for such influence.  He'd also ask the oppressive influence for its identity, how it gained entrance to the person and when commanding it to leave he'd command it also to ""retrieve very seed that had been planted, uproot everything that had been planted, clean up the mess completely and go into the abyss.""People portrayed through case histories in this book come from all walks of life, though all of them are Christians and among them is also ""a Baptist Deacon with demons"".Don's mother, various inmates, and little children.  He says that ""when ministering to children, parents must first go through the deliverance process in order to break any legal permissions that demons might have to the child's life through a generational curse.""Again he points out that whatever influences or spirits affect our lives, they can only must have our consent, and permission is granted in many ways through each person's life.  That includes demons, evil spirits, devils, spirits of infirmity principalities, powers, as well as godly influences.  He quotes from Revelation 3:20 where jesus says ""I stand at the door and knock"" - because He too must have our permission to enter our lives.  We give permission through the thoughts and emotions we entertain, and through activities in which we participate.He quotes from Proverbs 25:28 ""He that hath no rule [self control] over his own spirit is like a city that is broken down, and without walls.""As preventative measures, among other things he suggests, ""When negative thoughts come, you must rebuke them and replace them with positive thoughts"", trust God daily to help you make correct choices, pray throughout the day.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 2, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RVF8W0CA3M6QG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004TGSH6K#wasThisHelpful","RVF8W0CA3M6QG","AAXIW3SRA0S4R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AAXIW3SRA0S4R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book has a healthy suggestion for prevention of Alzheimer's based on scientific research studies and covering nutrition, physical exercise, mental exercise through continuous learning, cultivating social networks, and spiritual practice.Here are several tips from the book:NUTRITIONOne study showed that people who drank fresh fruit and vegetable juices more than three times a week were 76% less likely to develop Alzheimer's disease than those who drank juices less than once a week. The study showed the protective benefits of juice appeared to be particularly enhanced in people who had a genetic marker linked to an increased risk of Alzheimer's disease known as ApoE-4.In one study scientists in Germany found that increased physical activity was associated with a lower incidence of dementia. Those who exercised at least three times a week were half as likely to have developed dementia as those who reported no physical activity.In a study at Loma Linda University, a study group found that a daily glass of pomegranate juice could halve the build-up of harmful proteins linked to Alzheimer's disease.Men and women who reported eating fish at least once a week had a 60 % lower risk of getting Alzheimer's compared to those who rarely or almost never ate fish.A study on the effect of blood caffeine levels found tat older adults who drank the equivalent of 3 - 4 cups of coffee per day were protected from developing Alzheimer's.The researchers found that people who drank more than 2 cups of green tea per day had a 50 % lower incidence of cognitive impairment. EGCG is an antioxidant found in green tea that researchers frequently study for its health benefits.  The researchers used EGCG to effectively untangle the proteins causing Alzheimer's and restore the pristine state of brain tissue.People with diabetes - especially type 2 diabetes - are at higher risk of eventually developing Alzheimer's disease. Taking steps to prevent or control diabetes may help reduce the risk of Alzheimer's disease.  Alzheimer's is being called Diabetes Type 3 by some researchers.  Researchers found that insulin is not just produced in the pancreas, but also in the brain.  And they discovered that insulin and its growth factors, which are necessary for the survival of brain cells, contribute to the progression of Alzheimer's.In Alzheimer's patients portions of their brain start to atrophy, or starve, leading to impaired functioning and eventual loss of memory, speech, movement and personality. In effect, the brain can begin to atrophy from starvation if it becomes insulin resistant and loses its ability to convert glucose to energy.  Ketone bodies may restore and renew neuron and nerve function in the brain after the damage has set in.  They are found in coconut oil.  A bit over two tablespoons of coconut oil (35 ml or 7 level teaspoons) would supply with equivalent of 20 grams of MCT which is indicated as either a preventative measure against degenerative neurological diseases, or as a treatment for already established case.PHYSICAL EXERCISEThose who exercised at least twice a week in middle age were 50 % less likely to develop Alzheimer's disease in old age.  Population studies have suggested that exercise which raises your heart rate for at least 30 minutes several times a week can lower your risk of Alzheimer's.  Physical activity appears to inhibit Alzheimer's like brain changes, slowing the development of a key feature of the disease. A lack of exercise affects Alzheimer's disease in a profound way.Resistance training is particularly beneficial for improving the cognitive abilities of older adults.  Those who weight lift experience the greatest improvement.Exercise not only prevents the normal shrinkage (atrophy) from occurring, but also stimulates neurogenesis - the formation of new brain cells and connections!  So, not only can you keep your brain from shrinking, but you can make it even bigger and stronger.INTELLECTUAL STIMULATION and MUSICIntellectually stimulating careers and hobbies, like learning a new language, playing a musical instrument or doing crossword puzzles or word games, build extra brainpower.It is important to challenge your brain, as in memory recall, learning or doing something new.  Find what's interesting to you, master it and move on to the next challenge.Learning different languages and musical instrument training may reduce the effects of mental decline associated with aging.  Studies showed that bilinguals experience onset symptoms of dementia years later than monolinguists.Sustaining musical activity during advanced age may enhance thinking ability, neutralizing any negative impact of age and even lack of education.  Musicians scored higher on tests of mental acuity, visual-spatial judgment, verbal memory and recall, and motor dexterity.The mental process required to play a musical instrument may work in the same way as juggling a dual languages to strengthen the connections in your brain over time.RELAXATIONDeep breathing, relaxation, stress reduction, laughter - help to protect from Alzheimer's.SPIRITUALITYNegative or ""toxic"" thoughts affect our mental, emotional and physical health.  Thinking and feeling anger, fear and frustration, causes DNA to change shape according to thoughts and the associated feelings.  The study showed that the poor quality of the DNA codes was reversed with feelings of love, joy, appreciation and gratitude!Un-forgiveness may be the most damaging toxic thoughts, according to the neuroscientist Dr. Leaf.  We can literally protect our brain and heart by extending forgiveness.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 2, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R326DNBYN6B05U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009KSP0EY#wasThisHelpful","R326DNBYN6B05U","AAXIW3SRA0S4R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AAXIW3SRA0S4R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The author shares many good points and wonderful stories, and for them I'd highly recommend this book. And then the author also shares some of his personal opinions,  which weren't my cup of tea, but perhaps you find them agreeable.Most of this book I found awesome.  The author points out beautifully that prayer and intercession should be all about friendship, relationship and partnering with God, that what we pray should be motivated and arise out of love for God - not out of motivation to get something, nor out of feeling of obligation or sacrifice, but out of love - and under the guidance of God's love, looking at the world through the eyes of love.  We are the instruments through which love and power of God express, and we should be a pure channels through which that love flows.The author is also pointing out that while some things may happen of their own accord and we don't have to ask for them, that we are instructed to pray and ask for what we want.He shares many stories from the Scripture, as well as from his experience and from other people's experiences, and the stories themselves are worth getting this book.  There are stories about problems that people had simply because they didn't ask that those problems be solved.  There are also stories where even though people were told that the problem was solved in spirit, they still had to ask for it before they experienced it.Praying and asking may take different forms.  In this book, the author has offered prayers after each chapter, and they are a good starting point.  The stories the author shared also have examples of what people prayed for to resolve the problematic issue and the miraculous results their prayers produced. You'll find all kinds of wonderful stories of miraculous healings and of protection - truly inspiring.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 2, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R37OPNV7CCYFIJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0830745394#wasThisHelpful","R37OPNV7CCYFIJ","AAXIW3SRA0S4R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AAXIW3SRA0S4R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"If you'd like to learn evolutionary astrology, this book is a great place to begin.The author guides you through learning elements of astrology, just like you would learn to speak a foreign language - first going over the signs, planets, and houses, then aspects and finally putting it all together through interpretation.The difference between ""fortune-telling"" astrology and evolutionary astrology is that instead of merely using adjectives and telling you that you're like this or like that and that your fate is sealed, in evolutionary astrology your path is open.  It is up to you how you choose the energies expressing through you.  Having better understanding of the interplay of energies within you, you can make better conscious choices which will help you to grow, to evolve, and get the most out of your life.As you read through different elements, you get better insight into what different energies are trying to teach you, what strategies and resources it has available, and how that energy may manifest through it's shadow, when you attempt to repress it.While exploring the energies expressing through you, you learn how to successfully navigate through different areas of your life.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 14, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3IFN5UECKNXMP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009MAUXMY#wasThisHelpful","R3IFN5UECKNXMP","AAXIW3SRA0S4R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AAXIW3SRA0S4R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"While his youtube videos are decent, this book reads as if it were written at the speed of Light, without anyone checking for spelling, grammatical errors, and whether the sentences made sense in English.  I really wanted to read this book, but I kept on re-reading sentences that made no sense, trying to make sense out of them, and then I wondered how many errors may be hiding which I wouldn't be able to recognize because the information is new to me.That Mercury and Saturn are ""neutered"", Pisces is spelled as ""Piscies"", Aquarius as ""Aquirus"", Sagittarius as ""Saggitarious"" - may be minor issues, as you can still grasp the meaning.When you read ""any planets that comes in his aspect will reap the benefices"", or ""K.N. Rao in India revived this method, which to this day has about 90-95% accuracy in perdition"", you may find yourself re-reading the sentence until your brain comes up with the words that would make more sense in the context and replace ""perdition"" with ""prediction"" and ""benefices"" with the ""benefits"" (and fix the grammar while you're at it).When you read ""If Saturn aspects a planet while sitting in Taurus ascendant"", you may wonder what is sitting in Taurus ascendant - Saturn or the other planet.Due to so many errors, when you come upon a chart depicting the ""happy"" or ""sad"" placements of the planets in different houses, and the houses are numbered, you may again wonder whether those numbers are correct or do they also contain errors.I'll be happy to re-read this book and review the contents of the book, when the author takes the time to proof-read it.  On youtube he seems passionate about teaching astrology and I hope he shares his passion through his writing in a readable format.  While I may not agree with everything he is teaching (I still find the outer planets - Pluto, Neptune, and Uranus very influential -  while he considers them meaningless), I am still interested in what he has to say.","2.0 out of 5 stars","March 11, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R35RYZ4XMFUBIS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ALHCC8U#wasThisHelpful","R35RYZ4XMFUBIS","AAXIW3SRA0S4R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AAXIW3SRA0S4R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The author compares effective communication with martial arts, particularly judo, and illustrates his points through police stories, which makes the book both useful and interesting to read.Throughout the book are interspersed quotes from Sun-tzu, like ""To win one hundred victories in one hundred battles is not the highest skill.  To subdue the enemy without fighting is the highest skill.""He distinguishes between 3 kinds of people: the nice, the difficult and the wimp.  The nice people will do what you ask them the first time you ask them.  They like to cooperate.  Difficult people will not do what you tell them the first time you ask.  It is their nature that makes them say ""Why? What for?""He adds that the 4 most popular questions Americans would ask are ""Why?"", ""Who do you think you are to tell me what to do?"", ""Where do you get your authority?"", and ""What's in it for me?""And wimps are the ones who sound like nice people, but are closet difficult people.  To your face they say ""Oh yes,"" ""I agree,"" ""You're right"", but later they get you in the back.  Wimps hate authority, but they don't have the guts to challenge you.  They want revenge because they feel the need to even the score.The first principle of physical judo is to not resist your opponent.  Instead, move with him and redirect his energy - and the communication skills presented in the book follow the same pattern.The author mentions 11 things never to say to anyone (some of these statements may be more applicable to policemen on duty): ""Come here!"", ""You wouldn't understand"", ""Because those are the rules"", ""It's none of your business"", ""What do you want me to do about it?"", ""Calm down!"", ""What's your problem?"" ""You never ..."" or ""You always ..."", ""Im not going to say thing again"", ""I'm doing this for your own good"", ""Why don't you be reasonable?"" He does clearly suggest what you may want to say or do instead, and also what you may want to say or do when someone else says those things to you.The bottom line of communication that reduces conflict and tension is empathy - as in standing in another's shoes and understanding where he's coming from - and communicating with the person in a way that he can relate to.  The communication warrior's real service is staying calm in the midst of conflict, deflecting verbal abuse, and offering empathy in the face of antagonism.  If you cannot empathize with people, you don't stand a chance of getting them to listen to you.The author points out that we deal with people ""under the influence"" nearly everyday.  If it's not alcohol or drugs, it's frustration, fear, impatience, lack of self-worth, defensiveness, and a host of other influences - and that when we react instead of respond to the challenge, we run the risk of giving the greatest speech we'll ever live to regret, by saying the first thing that naturally comes to our lips.Instead, like a samurai, we must first center ourselves - because if we cannot keep a still center, we cannot stay in control of ourselves or the situation.  In this centered state we remain open, flexible, impartial, not biased.To deflect antagonistic behavior, the author shares a selection of ""strip phrases"", where you let the other person verbally vent, followed by requesting what you need the person to do, as in ""'Preciate that, sir, but let me see your license, please.""The next technique is ""paraphrasing"" by saying ""Let me be sure I understand you.  Let me be sure we're on the same wavelength."" and then stating back what the person said, using his key words - as different words have different meaning to different people.The goal of persuasion and the essence of Verbal Judo is to generate voluntary compliance. To execute it, the author suggests a 5 step process:1. Ask the person what you want him to doIf he doesn't comply2.

"When I got this book I assumed that it contained suggestions from psychological perspective.  I wish it said on the cover of the book that it is based on the author's interpretation of the teachings of Jesus, which I feel leaves something to be desired.The book contains the mixture of good ideas for setting healthy boundaries mixed with a heavy doses of ""it's Satan's fault"" or ""Satan will make you think this"" ""this is what Jesus or God meant"" when he said such and such and this is what he wants you to do. If you want to know what God wants you to do or what Jesus wants you to do, why not ask God or Jesus or read the Bible and follow in the footsteps of Jesus.In one part of the book she quotes Jesus saying ""You should love God with all your heart, mind, body and soul"", and again appropriately points out that love is the essence of the Bible.  In the Bible it also says that ""who says that he loves God and doesn't love his neighbor (a fellow human beings) is a liar"". In another part she quotes Proverbs ""Above all else, guard your heart, for everything you do flows from it"" - but this time not in the spirit of love which is the essence of the Bible, but in the spirit of fear.  The guarding of heart is from fear and from lack of faith - because he who loves God with all his heart, mind, body and soul, would be filled with love and faith, and would have no fear in his heart.She again quotes what the scripture teaches about love: ""Love is patient, love is kind.  It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud.  It does not dishonor others, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs.  Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth.  It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres."" So, if you go by the Scripture, if you truly love, love will keep you safe.  It says in the bible that ""love fulfills the law"" - that is if you love your neighbor as yourself, if you perceive God or Jesus in everyone and everything - would you really put the boundaries between you and them?Again she quotes from the Bible ""The Lord our God, the Lord is One.  Love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul and with all your strength"" - If the Lord is one - and there is nothing else but God, and one walks with the consciousness, with awareness of that One being all there is, present in everything one beholds and one loves it, what is there one should protect oneself from, other than his own erroneous perception?Along those bits where she claims that it's Satan fault that something happened or that Satan will make you think or do something, she elsewhere writes (appropriately) that you should take responsibility for your life.  And alongside the bits where she is mind-reading and interpreting what God or Jesus meant, in other parts of the book, she (appropriately) says that unless we have walked in someone's shoes, we have no idea where they are coming from.  I would have considered this book more valuable if the author stuck to what she has experienced walking in her shoes as obviously her own challenges with setting boundaries prompted her to learn more about setting healthy boundaries, to practice it and to share some of her experiences.Likewise she quotes from the book ""Experiencing God"" by Henry Blackbaby ""Don't try to second-guess Him (God)"" ... God's ways and thoughts are so different from yours ..."" This books is full of contradictory ideas - where the author would quote a spiritual idea rooted in love and oneness, and then interpret it from the fear-based-perception which makes it challenging to keep reading the book due to incongruence.Much of this book contains excerpts from the Bible, which the author is attempting to interpret through her eyes, based on her current understanding and experience; and excerpts from the books of other authors related to setting boundaries, like ""Living Successfully with Screwed Up People"" by Elizabeth Brown, ""A Woman's Passionate Pursuit of God"" by Karol Ladd, ""Boundaries: When to Say Yes, When to Say No To Take Control of Your Life"" by Drs. Henry Cloud and John Townsend, ""Dealing with the CrazyMakers in Your Life"" by Dr. David Hawkins, ""Handling Difficult People"" by John Townsend, ""Being Christian"" by Steve Arterburn, ""The Hole in Our Gospel"" by Richard Stearns, quotes by Dr. Laura Schlessinger, and segments by psychologist Bernis Riley.  The numerous excerpts make you feel as if you're reading a collection of other people's books, rather than the author's book.The essence of this book is the author's six step system for creating healthy boundaries, which in itself is helpful.She calls it Sanity and the six steps are:1. Stop Your Own Negative Behavior and Destructive Patterns2. Assemble a Support Group3. Nip Excuses in the Bud4. Implement Rules and Boundaries5. Trust Your Instincts6. Yield Everything to God","3.0 out of 5 stars","February 6, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2J0D6FUI5QRNB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0736926968#wasThisHelpful","R2J0D6FUI5QRNB","AAXIW3SRA0S4R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AAXIW3SRA0S4R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Just reading this book was a soothing experience, as the book not only inspires the practice of patience but also oozes with gentleness and loving kindness.Patience is a skill to be developed and as Easwaran points out it may be hard and uncomfortable in the beginning, but we can all begin just where we are and then keep on stretching and expanding it.This is a small book and perhaps it has more inspiring examples rather than techniques that tell you how to go about practicing patience.  Tips for practicing patience are interspersed throughout the book and if you're looking for more specific techniques then you are more likely to find those in books related to the practice of mindfulness meditation.In this book Easwaran draws upon Indian culture and customs and perhaps it will most appeal to people who do enjoy Easwaran's work and those who love reading stories rooted in Indian culture.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 15, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RI2BQ3C9KFV6D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1586380451#wasThisHelpful","RI2BQ3C9KFV6D","AAXIW3SRA0S4R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AAXIW3SRA0S4R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I got this book initially when it came out - almost few decades ago, and I got it now again in digital format.The authors give the overview of nootropics, vitamins and herbal supplements that boost mental performance.  Some of the popular nootropics are varieties of racetams, like piracetam, aniracetam, oxyracetam and pramiracetam, and pyroglutamate or pyroglutamic acid which has similar chemical constitution to piracetam; centrophenoxine, hydergine, deprenyl, vinpocetine.It is important to take racetams with choline and/or lecithin, and it is also important to take anti-oxidants while taking these kinds of brain-boosters.  It becomes somewhat of an art, deciding what you should take when and in what quantity when you start mixing different supplements because they react with each other, and they also react with your own bio-chemistry.Some of these smart drugs require that you take B vitamins, particularly B5.  Vitamins A, C, and E may help to offset the free radicals that are released in the process.The authors mention that centrophenoxine and DMAE have a similar chemical constitution, though I think you may have to try each one of them to discover whether you get the same effect.Among the herbs for brain, the authors mentioned Gingko together with a story that it's the oldest plant on earth and that it almost became extinct but was saved few thousand years ago by Chinese monks, who found it beneficial for the brain.  The authors then mention Fo-ti-tiend and Gotu kola and point that these two have similar chemical constitution.  The authors also mention Royal Jelly and Ginseng, which contribute to the overall wellbeing, being rich in nutrients that help to energize the body and nourish the brain.They also mention the adverse effect of heavy metals on brain function, and how during autopsies of people suffering form Alzheimer's, it was discovered that they had very high amounts of aluminum of their brains.  Think about all the food you may be consuming from cans.  So, taking supplements that help to cleanse your body from heavy metals, may improve your brain function.Some amino acids are mentioned for boosting the brain, like glutamine, and others for detoxifying the body like glutathione, methionine and cysteine.The authors have provided interesting excerpts from different publications and among other things have mentioned how the autopsies showed that the brain tends to shrink and in very old people it would shrink even one third of its normal size.  The smaller space makes it harder for the information to travel, much like the traffic gets stuck on a congested highway.  Brain nutrients and exercise help to keep the brain expanded and functioning well into old age.At the time this book was written most of the nootropics were hard to get, so the authors share helpful information on different channels through which one may acquire them.  These days, most of these supplements are easily available right here on amazon.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 20, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RTUKGP4J4KL5L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002C4KT62#wasThisHelpful","RTUKGP4J4KL5L","AAXIW3SRA0S4R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AAXIW3SRA0S4R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is the first Phillips Sonicare product I've used and I was immediately blown away. Prior to using this product I was using the less expensive battery operated type tooth brush. There is no comparison between the two types. The Phillips Sonicare is much more quiet, less bulky and much more efficient. I could tell the difference immediately when I first used it. My teeth felt so clean. The feeling was similar to the one you have after visiting the dentist and getting the plaque removed. It is just a great addition to your self help needs for maintaining a nice set of teeth and gums. The brushing is characterized by the speed with which the bristles turn. One might think that this might hurt your gums but nothing could be further from the truth. It is vigorous but gentle on your gums. I absolutely love his product and will never go back to the old style, let alone brushing manually; it is just so much more efficient. If you are looking for a new tooth brush definitely buy this one because you won't be let down; it is an outstanding product.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2Y4GMOI8GI3A8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QZ67T3O#wasThisHelpful","R2Y4GMOI8GI3A8","AO4A961ZKHJPL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AO4A961ZKHJPL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'll be brief and just say that these are a very nice pair of shoes. There are several things I take into consideration when buying shoes. First and foremost is the fit and comfort; always tricky when ordering online. These shoes passed with flying colors. I normally use a size 11 and this fit true to my size They look narrow and smaller than size 11 but after putting them on they felt super comfy. They immediately felt like a pair of shoes that had been broken in and used for some time. I think the material gives and the support contours to the individual shape of your foot. It passed the first criteria with flying colors. Next I look for style, something that looks good or anyway to my liking. I don't think I would make this an everyday shoe to wear out and about everyday ; that's just my preference as I have many other shoes or boots that I prefer for going out. Instead I have delegated these comfy shoes to the wear around the house indoors; almost like a slipper but more versatile for that unexpected outdoor venture. I also have another use for them which is a driving shoe. They are perfect for getting into the classic 56 Chevy and going for a spin on a sunny afternoon. The heel is contoured perfectly so it is padded and supports your foot when in the driving position. They are classy looking for a casual shoe and think you will be pleased with these shoes as an addition to your collection of shoes. I have not walked extensively in them so I cannot attest to the comfort or support after miles of walking. However for use as I've described they are perfect. They are  a very lightweight and good looking shoe that I think you would be pleased with. I recommend these shoes for your feet; you'll hardly know you have shoes on.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R5Z5SW7AQIAOE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N180HU6#wasThisHelpful","R5Z5SW7AQIAOE","AO4A961ZKHJPL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AO4A961ZKHJPL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I ordered this product through the Vine Program and was a little skeptical about whether it would actually do the job as described. My yard has mulch  everywhere in controlled path ways and around certain trees. Besides this I have made several other pathways made from stone and small pebbles or lava rock. Every year there is a problem with rain washing the mulch or stones away where I need to place them in the proper area again. High winds create the same problem this product was applied during the holidays and since it has rained and we.ve had high Santa Ana winds. So far so good. The Mulchlock has been a blessing as after application I have not needed to moved the mulch or stones back into place. Granted it hasn't been very long so we'll see how it holds up through summer when high winds return again . I felt it was relatively easy to apply and the adjustable spray was very convenient for not wasting the spay. The opaque color is really barely noticeable and looks pretty natural. If you're looking for something to contain your landscape this product will do the trick. I recommend this for making your life easier and having time to use that hammock instead of raking your mulch back into place or resetting your pebble pathway. It works so go for it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2USMH0JM8RM0O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00G8R71H4#wasThisHelpful","R2USMH0JM8RM0O","AO4A961ZKHJPL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AO4A961ZKHJPL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm not one to use creams but was afforded the opportunity to try out this product through the Amazon Vine program. I tried it out but honestly couldn't get into the discipline of applying the cream regularly. I did like the feel of it and the resulting feeling on my skin. I gave this cream to my wife to use and she raves about it. She loves the texture and non sticky feeling on the skin. It is absorbed readily, especially if your skin is dry. If I would have continued using it no doubt it would probably be gone by now with my alligator skin! The product is made from  natural ingredients mostly so it is very nice to the touch. The cream is very nice smelling and according to my wife the smell is divine. It does smell very nice I might add. It is non greasy which is a plus. She loves it so I love it.

"If you are a fan of the Robert Rodriguez's ""Mariachi"" Trilogy films than you will love this disc. It is not just for fans of ""Mariachi"" the film but for anyone that loves genre bending Spanish guitar or just cool Spanish music. Most of the guitar work is original and electrifying with a frenetic pace. It is cutting edge flamenco inspired if anything, but not Mariachi music. This is not, let me say it again, this is not Mariachi music by any means. I have a library full of music that is Mariachi and believe me this is not Mariachi de Tecalitlan El Mejor Mariachi Del Mundo or anything like it. The song by Chingon, love the name which also happens to be the name of my favorite breakfast sandwich up the coast in Carlsbad at Mas Fina Cantina, "" Malaguena Salerosa"" is a case in point. It is a hot number reinterpreted on an old Spanish theme. All the music is amazing, conjuring images of Rodriguez's film and old Mexico. As the title says it is music from the movie and inspired from Rodriquez's trilogy, El Mariachi, who was a character, the main protagonist.  The DVD is also very good and informative but unfortunately ii is much too short. I really did like the DVD but I would have just liked more behind the scenes and more footage of the concerts. All in all it is a disc worth adding to your library, just don't file it under Mariachi music, unless you have a sub category for film than it would be El Mariachi. Did I say this is not Mariachi music? This is a highly entertaining CD/DVD combo and worth having, como se dice en Mexico, vale la pena.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RKRD2B4F48DNB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00016XNAW#wasThisHelpful","RKRD2B4F48DNB","AO4A961ZKHJPL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AO4A961ZKHJPL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"First off understand where I'm coming from. I'm not really big into hip hop although I have accumulated various artists and songs into my library over the years. That said I really liked this disc; you might even say I love it/ her voice. She commands attention with authority. Being a bilingual person I do understand and am fluent in Spanish. However, hip hop is a language unto itself that requires good listening skills to keep up with the rapid- fire rap. So do I get all her lyrics? Si y no/yes and no. Honestly some of it goes over my head but that doesn't matter as the music is way cool. I first heard Ana Tijoux while watching an episode of ""Breaking Bad"" and thought who is that? The song was so catchy and cool I had to find out. Thanks to my fave music app, Shazam, I found out immediately and almost as quickly ordered the disc through Amazon. I was blown away with the talent and diversity of her style. Like a good sauce she is both sweet and spicy, angry and seductive resulting in the best of both; yin and yang if you will. Her accompanying musicians and rappers compliment her quite well. The reggae beat on some tracks is infectious adding to her world beat charms. On ""Oulala"" she raps in French and I get don't understand but it doesn't matter because it's the universal language of music; good music that traverses boundaries and language barriers for a memorable musical experience.  This makes her at least trilingual as she raps in English as well. The Chilean artist born in France to parents who were exiles from the Pinochet regime might explain her unique view of the world. She incorporates a variety of musical styles and uses the production values of incorporating the use of various elements of electronic mixing of beats and voices. Her music is mixture of jazzy world beat styles, combining elements of R&B into the musical stew that doesn't shy away from political themes. Ana Tijoux music is interlaced with intricate rhymes that pull you in and won't let go until the song is over; then another song begins demanding more and once she has her musical tentacles in you you're in for the duration. I bought this album because I fell in love with the song ""1977"" on ""Breaking Bad."" I recently found out that it is a album that you can add to your library if you are a Prime Member at Amazon. If you are go for it. I recently added another disc of hers to my Prime Library and look forward to giving it some attention. If you're looking for something different to listen to, whether you speak Spanish or not, than this disc will not disappoint; she is fresh and deserves attention. Buy it , you'll like it; you may even love it like me.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2UGAP0DP45VBZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004RKRTEE#wasThisHelpful","R2UGAP0DP45VBZ","AO4A961ZKHJPL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AO4A961ZKHJPL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"George Benson has one of the most unique voices in his own right that incorporates smooth jazz vocals  and scat singing; all while playing Wes Montgomeryesque guitar. On this jazz based album he all but abandons his own particular style to channel the sweetness of the late, great, Nat King Cole. On many songs he sounds very much like the velvet, smooth voice of Nat King Cole but with a twist at times; he performs his scat vocals to give some songs his own interpretation while his vocals remain true to NKC. This is more than a tribute CD. It goes above and beyond tribute. There are times while listening to this disc that I would swear it was NKC singing if I didn't know better.The familiar songs are all well done and to numerous to mention individually. Some of my favorites and standouts from this disc are the classic ""Route 66""  and ""Straighten Up and Fly right"" from the lesser known jazz period of Nat King Cole. If you like these songs you might check out songs from his trio period The Best of the Nat King Cole Trio: The Vocal Classics (1942-46),  BTW, there are many good NKC discs available covering all periods of his career. For an overview you may want to start with  The Very Best Of Nat King Cole. ""Nature Boy"" is another easy choice as this song has been interpreted by George Benson before. It is a song that warms the heart with the message of love. Several of his more well known songs like ""Unforgettable"" and ""Mona Lisa"" are here but with a twist; the George Benson twist. On the signature NKC song ""Unforgettable"" Benson pairs with jazz giant Wynton Marsalis to create a very outstanding rendition. ""Mona Lisa"" closes out the disc with Benson playing guitar that has a Latin flavor while he invokes his inner NKC and belts out a beautiful version accompanied by a lush string arrangement. This is truly a tribute disc; it is evident that Benson honors the tradition established by NKC and wants to honor it. If you're a fan of either artist you will really enjoy this disc. Recommended for nostalgic day or nights where timeless music permeates the air, for a truly ""Unforgettable"" musical experience.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RWQB2N15A0I7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00C1CO0XS#wasThisHelpful","RWQB2N15A0I7","AO4A961ZKHJPL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AO4A961ZKHJPL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love the different taste of these energy bars. There is a flood of bars available on the market usually with one thing in common. Much of what is available is bland tasting to overly sweet, with a consistency and taste of gooey straw. Thankfully there is a product available that breaks the mold and after one bite makes you go MmmMmm that's tasty and much different than your average bar. The mix of sweet and hot, an old concept for food but maybe new to energy bars, is absolutely delicious. The heat is not overbearing but rather blended beautifully. You take a bite and you want another bite and then another, all the while trying to distinguish what is the spicy taste that beautifully off balances the  traditional sweet taste. One problem, the bar quickly disappears; a couple of nice sized bits and it's gone. After the initial tasting of this bar I had to have another. The bars are small and not filling at all. The nuts give the bar a nice crunch and texture that compliments the spice and sweet taste. They are perfect for a snack on the go or for that snack between meals that probably will suffice for a meal until you can have something more filling. I have tucked these into my jersey while out cycling and they are great for a bite and quick energy when you're pounding the pedals. I imagine they are good for any endurance event when you don't have the time or means to feed your body. The real selling factor is the delicious taste combination, sweet and spicy that makes you go MmmMmm, so different and so good.

"This is a good addition for your grooming needs. If you or your man is like me it is always good to have a variety of tools to tame the facial hair. The size of the scissors and comb might be of concern to some men. I'm average size with large hands and my fingers barely fit into the small area designed for the thumb and finger. If you are a big man or you're buying for someone who is you might take this fact into consideration. Extra large fingers or fat fingers will fit uncomfortably. Otherwise this is a nice compact set designed for home or travel. The scissors are very sharp and cut the hair with precision. Nothing worse than dull scissors that pull your hair or worse yet don't cut at all. These are precision scissors that should give years of use with proper care. The comb is a little cheesy as it is very small; I guess that is the desired design for the mustache. Personally I prefer I larger comb when grooming the facial hair. Although it is sold as a mustache set I found that it works perfectly well with my beard. I've used it for fine tuning after trimming my beard with an electric trimmer with a length attachment. All in all this is a nice set to have in your army of facial hair grooming tools.

"I love traditional Christmas music nut also have room in my musical tastes for variations on a theme. This disc is anything but traditional. It is very cool collection of songs, some traditional mostly not that are either old school jazzy or rhythm and blues. With songs entitled ""Be Bop Santa Claus,""  ""Christmas Night in Harlem,"" "" Dig that Crazy Santa Claus,"" and other off beat titles, well. you get the picture, this might not be for everyone. You won't find "" I'm Dreaming of a White Christmas"" on this disc. This is music from a by gone era, even before my time. Good music withstands the test of time. There is lots of scat singing and horn blowing where even the most recognized songs are so different that it is hard to equate the two. My absolute favorite song on this disc is"" Zat You, Santa Claus""? by Louis Armstrong. It is a classic. If you've never heard this song it is worth a listen. Highly recommended for a change of pace when it comes to Christmas music.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RX04Y4VKQCX6X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FY3NL7M#wasThisHelpful","RX04Y4VKQCX6X","AO4A961ZKHJPL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AO4A961ZKHJPL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have this app on all my devices and my Kindle is no exception. I was very pleased to get this app as sometimes some apps are not compatible with the Kindle. If you love sports on the go than you need this app. One of the things I like about it that I get more ESPN channels than I get on my TV. This is especially cool because I can watch soccer matches, college football etc. When their is a conflict with simultaneous programming this app is perfect to watch several games at once. Overall it is outstanding for the sports enthusiast. I don't know how I managed to keep up with all my sports.

"There are almost two thousand reviews of this product currently as of this review. Basically it has all been said both positive and negative so there is not much to say that hasn't been said already, there are even video demos. That said I will keep it simple. I am not one to use a French Press with regularity. It is more of a treat for me. I've used this French Press on several occasions for both tea and coffee and found it produces a rich tasting cup of hot brew. It is easy to use, simple in fact. I was recently involved in an accident and even while going through rehabilitation I managed to use it, in spite of the nerve damage in my hand. The quality of material used is top notch. The protective design serves it's purpose and looks good to. I have had other French Press's throughout the years of lesser quality and invariably something happens, usually the glass breaking or screen tearing. I don't think this will be the case with this product as it seems durable so far. As I said I don't usually use a French Press so with proper care this product should provide years of lasting enjoyment. If you're looking for a French Press that is a quality product I would recommend this one by Idylc Homes. I definitely would recommend this French Press for the novice or connoisseur coffee lover. This would make a great gift for anyone who appreciates a good cup of coffee or tea.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2KZN1F40XKX3T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FMJDJ5C#wasThisHelpful","R2KZN1F40XKX3T","AO4A961ZKHJPL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AO4A961ZKHJPL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Like many others I liked The Shadow of the Wind more than this, the second book in the series. This is not to say that I was disappointed in any way as I was not expecting a better book, but rather a book that compels and demands my attention as the first book did. I liked it very much for all the same reasons as Shadow. The intriguing, beautifully written imagery, Barcelona in a different time and place returned to darkness and characters reborn with a running theme of a story within a story, a book within a book coming to life from the Cemetery of Forgotten Books for a mysterious epic journey. The writing is magical and as a reader I got lost in the language easily. This in turn created a problem for me because it seems the more I read and enjoyed the book, again lost in the language, the less I seemed to understand. This is not the case as I was reading but rather after a reading session, I would say to myself, what the heck just happened? It is as though I had been transported, as a reader, to within a world of awe or quite possibly awakening from a dream and asking myself if it was real or a dream ? I thoroughly enjoy Zafron's use of language and look forward to reading the final installment in the series which I recently began. Undoubtedly  many answers will be revealed that were left unanswered in this book.  Recommended for anyone that enjoys mysterious, dark  Gothic places in a superb writing style.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R23YYMHUR33JPL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001NLKZLE#wasThisHelpful","R23YYMHUR33JPL","AO4A961ZKHJPL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AO4A961ZKHJPL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you like music that transcends boundaries , both musically and internationally than this disc is for you. Italian Daniele Gaudi or as he is known,  Gaudi is a man on a mission. A musician ,songwriter,  singer, Record Producer and composer formerly known as the  Dub Alchemist for good reason . He incorporates Dub into his world music with elements of electronica, break beat  and reggae. Although using those labels to describe the music would be a simplification, his music is simply, quite profound. The titles alone make statements of profundity, like the song does on  ""And the Earth Said: Oh My God!."" The experimental results are breathtaking mysterious sojourns around the planet, to inner and outer space and back. I personally prefer the songs that have a little more structure but he is the Mad Master Moog, as he was once known. The spacey  tune  in "" Chant Thermique""  starts out slowly, droning along and turns to silence, then suddenly MLK's famous speech "" I Have a Dream"" comes through for a startling effect. ""Ayahuasca Deep Fall"" has a Indian vibe, complete with Earthy beats and chants that is happiness in a groove. ""Theremystical""  begins with a man giving a lecture on an instrument that plays without even touching. It to develops into a dance groove where the lecture voice returns off and on during the duration just to be sure you're paying attention. Gaudi returns to his roots in a song entitles ""Dub It' which is pretty basic Dub music. One of my favorite songs is when Gaudi pairs with the Spanish group Ojos de Brujo on the song made famous by them entitled ""Babylon Flamenco."" The song remains recognizable to the original but is reworked by Gaudi, for a remix of sorts. This is a magical release that belongs in your musical library, especially if you like world music that is innovative. I would definitely recommend this disc. He has released many CD's but this is as good as any place to jump in. Actually I'm quite surprised it has never been reviewed here at Amazon as it is widely considered one of his best. Recommended for adventurous listeners of world groove music without boundaries or limitations, file under, Electronica all over the map, where the  globe is just the beginning.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1JHXV776WGIZS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0006HSTVO#wasThisHelpful","R1JHXV776WGIZS","AO4A961ZKHJPL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AO4A961ZKHJPL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This disc is a mixture of flamenco fusion and pure Flamenco, depending on the artist featured. The disc is a good bargain as you get plenty of music for the price. There are 18 diverse tracks with all different artists which makes for an excellent disc with a lot of variety. The commonality is Flamenco in all it's various forms. There is up tempo, as in the song ""Almeria"", where it hits a light dance groove and down tempo fusion like ""Sangre Andaluza"" where you get a short dreamy visit to Spain. ""Morning"" is a track that lies somewhere between down and up tempo.  the track features soft female voices that creates an otherworldly result. ""En Mis Suenos,""or ""In My Dreams"", in English, is a very cool jazzy, Flamenco mix that transcends a pigeon hole description other than to say it is good vibes. Artist David Amaya displays the pure Flamenco guitar and vocals on ""Cancherito"" that is a knock out tune complete with handclaps and sorrowful singing. This song will stimulate the imagination to see dancing gitanos or gypsy's by the fire or in a caf. This is a nice disc to play at night , enjoy a glass of Tempranillo , maybe with someone, and let the mind wander. The music on this disc can be pure but it is mostly a hybrid or fusion of Flamenco. Recommended for those that would like an auditory journey to the Iberian peninsula via the Flamenco Fusion.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R26DBM16A4KS5K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CVKZ1BK#wasThisHelpful","R26DBM16A4KS5K","AO4A961ZKHJPL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AO4A961ZKHJPL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Being a long time fan of Bob Marley I take great pride in listening to his offspring carry on the tradition. I had the pleasure of seeing Bob Marley live in a small amphitheater in San Diego many moons ago. I have seen Ziggy several ties throughout the years. I now want to see Stephen Marley. I love his music, it is an evolution of his roots, maintaining the past allowing for creative liberty to integrate the contemporary vibes all around us. When I close my eyes I hear Bob Marley. Both Ziggy and Stephen sound remarkably like their father. As the saying, goes the apple does not fall from the tree. The pure essence of Bob Marley's vibe comes through loud and clear. I can visualize him with eyes closed, arms stretched out over his head imparting his spirit on the talents of his sons, creating a lasing message going beyond his years in the flesh. I play this CD over and over, anytime of the day or night, it just makes you feel good. It takes me back, I go fast forward to the present and smile. It's the Rastaman Vibration again, he live on.

"If a little blood and guts details depicted during an era where the government of Argentina made this the norm than move on, this book is not for you. If on the other hand, you can tolerate scenes that involve massacres of groups and slaughter of individuals, set in a time capsule during one of Argentina's darkest periods, where violations of human rights was as ordinary as having a cup of mate, than read this French author's noir thriller. Strange characters are revealed early on, living in he underworld of Buenos Aires, where freaks run the risk of ultimate savagery and even death. Missing persons and even missing  families is a way of life where the government and it's cronies have taken liberty to do as they please, leaving atrocities in the aftermath. Enter Jana a Mapuche  Indian who pairs with  private investigator Calderon to find out what happened to Jana's best friend Miguel, who is in reality a transvestite prostitute known as Paula. The search for Paula leads Calderon and Jana on a dangerous path seeking justice. The book is a grisly thriller, full of mystery and intrigue set to the historical background of Argentina's time of los desaparecidos, the missing ones. This is an excellent read that will have you turning the pages, looking for answers and what answers the sleuths will uncover in their adventure to find Paula. Recommended for those interested in Latin American history and politics, specifically Argentina's, and a good dark mystery.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R36FM4VBPU44F4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1609451201#wasThisHelpful","R36FM4VBPU44F4","AO4A961ZKHJPL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AO4A961ZKHJPL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a short disc consisting of only five songs. The songs are probably familiar to those that already are aware of the fine music of Chambao. The difference with this is that the familiar songs are acoustic. The song ""Chambao,"" which if it wasn't cool enough in it's original form is even more  down tempo and even more chill. Lot's of acoustic guitar to accompany Maria's vocals throughout the recognized  songs of Chambao. The difference is that the beats are very much unlike the originals; including the phrasing on the vocals. ""Ahi Estas"" is an example of how the basic structure of the song is there but it just takes a new form; that form is evolutionary Chambao. The songs never quite heat up to the Flamenco fusion frenzy achieved on their other discs but this is still cool stuff. Their classic song ""Poquito a Poquio"" showcases Maria at her finest with just the basic instruments in a soft seduction. If you're a fan of Chambao this belongs in your collection of Chambao chill out music. Recommended for those that love the new face of  Flamenco.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RIVIVYVNZLOB7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HP8KZPA#wasThisHelpful","RIVIVYVNZLOB7","AO4A961ZKHJPL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AO4A961ZKHJPL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"What superlatives to say that haven't already been said about this disc. It is spectacular in a word. I love the voice of Concha Buika and feel she is a unique talent; paired with one of giants of Latin jazz,  Cuban pianist, bandleader, composer and arranger Chucho Valdez and you have an instant classic. If you're looking for Buika to be exactly like she was on other solo projects you're going to instead how diverse her talents are. There are so many good songs but an example how the master Chucho Valdez can take a classic  Mexican song , originally by Jose Alfredo Jimenez, 100 Clasicas 1  Las 100 Clasicas Vol. 2 "" Las Ciudades""  and transform it into an  outstanding tune hardly recognized  from the original song. It becomes a  jazzy song that sounds like it should be emanating from a dark smoky caf where Concha is belting out the vocals; ""El Rey"" Jose Alfredo Jimenez would be proud of the metamorphosis of his song. Ditto for "" Cruz de Olvido"" and the many other Jose Alfredo Jimenez compositions Y Sigo Siendo El Rey : Deluxe Edition 3CD+DVD+LIBRO. I could go on and on but just go out and get this most excellent disc, you will love the pairing of Concha Buika and Chucho Valdez.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3KS6TWUCNXDVF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002NVTBOU#wasThisHelpful","R3KS6TWUCNXDVF","AO4A961ZKHJPL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AO4A961ZKHJPL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was unsure if I would like this disc as I had a bit of a prejudice remembering her late great father's entry into singing Spanish songs on Cole Espanol. I enjoyed the samples I listened to first I so bought it. I was not disappointed at all. This is not an easy undertaking, especially considering she is not a native speaker and will always be unfairly compared to her father and for that reason and coupled with the music give her 5 stars. Her father, Nat King Cole knocked it out of the park with his smoky, velvety rendition of ""Acerca te Mas""  originally on vinyl but on a modern compilation entitled Mis Mejores Canciones - 19 Super Exitos  and when they pair up on this song it is joyful to hear. Through the magic of mixing her father's version and her own the result is not unlike their pairing on the song ""Unforgettable"" from Unforgettable. Natalie's voice compliments her father's and to my ears defers to her father's greatness and memory. She is subdued as though to not out ""Cole"" him. By contrast her voice soars on ""Manana de Carnaval"" as she returns to form highlighting her talents on a song that is part samba part jazz , equal parts soothing vocals by Natalie; it's a very nice entry. ""Quizas Quizas Quizas"" is flawless in terms of delivering a song that sounds like it is from a different era with it's big band  Cha Cha Cha background laying the path for Natalie Cole. ""Oye Como Va"" originally by Tito Puente Oye Como Va: Dance Collection but made popular by Santana Abraxas  is a nice entry that is a dance floor song that allows Natalie Cole to improvise her style  to the song; she reminds me of Gloria Esteban on this dance track. A very nice romantic song entitled "" Bachata Rosa,"" a signature song by Jose Luis Guerra is quite amazing as she sounds so relaxed and genuine in her Spanish. All in all it is a very good disc that belongs in your Spanish music collection to be filled under Cole en Espanol. I would recommend this disc to anyone who likes Spanish music with a twist; a Cole family tradition, in  Espanol.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R8BCKDJWZ2HK9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00B9JDBSE#wasThisHelpful","R8BCKDJWZ2HK9","AO4A961ZKHJPL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AO4A961ZKHJPL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love Chambao and have been a distant fan for many years. As far as I know they don't come to the United States to play. Considering the health issues the lovely Maria has had to endure it is understandable. I'm just glad she's able to continue giving her gift of music to the world with her passion and lovely voice. I have most everything that has been released stateside and this is a great addition to their wonderful discography. The songs on this disc are a little different from those we have come to expect from Chambao. It is very mellow which is not to say the others discs are not but this is Flamenco chill iced, the subtleties and nuances Chambao fans have come to expect are all there but layered on a lower level which makes for an even more seductive musical experience. If you can't get enough of Chambao and want to hear something slightly different from the previous discs than give this disc a try. It is not a rehash of their previous material or a greatest hits or best of collection it is just fresh music that has been part of their 10 anos evolution. The disc is such that it can be played over and over and you will not get tired of it. Some excellent songs include the ""Instinto Humano"" that has elements of light rap intertwined with Maria's vocals that draws you in and doesn't let you go until the song is over; then sucks you in again. ""Pasta Pa La Costa"" is a nice reggae back beat oriented mix that is fusion at it's finest transcending borders and genres. Reall yall the sons are very cool and brin another light to your perception of Chambao; it's a super disc that will not disappoint Chambao fans.  Chambao at it's mellowest with light airy vibes that heat up with flamenco guitar fret work that sizzles as Maria's voice takes you soaring on an Andalusian  voyage that will bring the Spanish music to you. The instrumental and electronic work is hypnotizing and magical; it is a fusion of dance and flamenco that has evolved from ancestral villages to the modern era. It is Earthy and spicy at once; like fine Spanish Tempranillo and tasty tapas the merging and marriage of styles and flavors creates a perfect accompaniment to a good night. Highly recommended for fans of Chambao and Flamenco fusion.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R6SNKARXGGVNW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ESBFZD4#wasThisHelpful","R6SNKARXGGVNW","AO4A961ZKHJPL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AO4A961ZKHJPL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"First and foremost I loved this book and think that you will too. Through the years I've read quite a few books , both in Spanish and English on the tragic and tumultuous life of Mexican artist Frida Kahlo. I considered myself somewhat of a Kahlophile at one point in my life and have read nearly every book written about her including her poignant and revealing  The Diary of Frida Kahlo: An Intimate Self-Portrait. I've also read what is  considered by many to be the definitive biography on Frida Kahlo  Frida: A Biography of Frida Kahlo and by the same author Frida Kahlo: The Paintings , amongst many others. So how does this book hold up against he plethora of books written about Frida ?  I found this book to do more than an adequate job, actually it is an outstanding addition on the abundance of books available. Given the brevity of the book and the fact that it is not a biography on Frida but rather an overview of her life and that of her husband, the great Mexican master artist , Diego Rivera. The book is ambitious and delivers an insightful perspective that is full of photographs that compliment the narration and bring to life the lives of Frida Kahlo and Diego Rivera. The fact that Rivera and Kahlo's lives were inextricably linked makes the  brief overview both easy and a challenge for the author. Coupled with that the book is intended for a younger audience, quite possibly with little knowledge of these two giants of Mexican art, the author Catherine Reef was faced with a daunting task. She makes the book entertaining with anecdotes and a real life experiences for the reader. The mixture of direct quotes by the artists and the author's master full storytelling makes for an enjoyable read. Although intended for the younger audience, the book should not be limited to high school readers. The book can be used for middle school readers and without a doubt the adult. For the adult or advanced young reader this book can be read in one session as it is very enthralling and the lives of Rivera and Kahlo come dramatically to life. I found myself wanting to read more and more of the book , reacquainting myself with their most interesting lives, knowing that this beautiful union of lives would inevitably wind to a conclusion This is an excellent book that takes the reader on a roller coaster ride not unlike the lives of Frida Kahlo and Diego Rivera. It is a satisfying experience for the for the initiated reader and those without any knowledge of Frida Kahlo and Diego Rivera. Teacher's, students and Kahlophiles will find this book to be very pleasing. Artists and those with an interest in Mexican art will especially be satisfied. Highly  recommended for readers of all ages from middle school on, this book is a must for the public, school or private library. Read it you'll like it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2S5EU4XMRSZDW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0547821840#wasThisHelpful","R2S5EU4XMRSZDW","AO4A961ZKHJPL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AO4A961ZKHJPL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The concept is simple enough. A plastic bag similar to the one's we have all used to marinate foods, probably made by Ziploc as well but with a twist. These bags are designed specifically for marinating and they are an outstanding product for this purpose. The fact that they stand upright is a major design innovation. This allows you to place your food upright, taking up less space allowing you to pack the foods in  and avoids possible leakage that may result if the bag is placed sideways. The size is also another plus as a gallon really holds a lot of marinade and takes care of the savory concoction marinating your chicken, fish or meat. This product is extremely useful and practical and there really is no negative downside. Heat up the grill and  buy it now for all your marinating needs.

"This a very tasty salsa. It is not by any means overly hot or spicy; as stated on the label, it is mild. It is very flavorful however which makes up for it's like of heat. fairly or not I took away a star because it could be spicier. To be exact it would be 4.5 as the flavor makes up for lack of heat. The combination of fire roasted and fresh tomatoes give the salsa a unique taste that compliments the overall flavor. The same can be said for the roasting and use of fresh corn. The roasted Serrano peppers give it a little heat but there are so  many other flavors that  all blends together quite nicely. There is a recipe on the jar suggesting using the salsa for a base when making tortilla soup. It sounds like a good idea but I've yet to use it for soup. Since I received four jars, which are thick glass, packed very thoroughly and shipped in a strong box, they arrived perfectly. I've eaten one jar, in a sitting I might add with another person and half of another on another occasion. The opened jar has been in the refrigerator and has not gone bad over the course of several weeks closing in on a month. This is a testament to the jar and the freshness is maintained. Some store bought salsas don't hold up well but that is not the case with Arriba!  I'm a big chili head and grow my own and make my own salsa as well as store bought so I rotate my salsas so that is why I have half a jar left. I'm having some now, very delicious but not too hot. If you like more heat just dice up a fire roasted Serrano pepper and add it. I used to use this trick many years age when I would buy Pace. Anyway this is good stuff and perfect for a tasty salsa that doesn't bring  too much heat. Recommended for people who don't like their salsa too hot.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3ODAVHC66XLR1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CIVY5S2#wasThisHelpful","R3ODAVHC66XLR1","AO4A961ZKHJPL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AO4A961ZKHJPL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"For the price this a bargain. I was a little apprehensive when I ordered it because I thought it might be, for lack of a better word, cheap. To add to my skepticism I figured this would definitely be destined for the picnic table or outdoor table. I couldn't have been further from the truth. Surprisingly it is high quality in feel, the texture plus the color add an element of elegance to the cloth. This is one to be used inside or outdoors. It dresses up the table for everyday use or special occasions if you're so inclined. Add a touch of class by adding a runner and you've got all the making of a special night.

"I recently purchased the Samsung Galaxy S4 phone along with a cover for protection. If you have this phone you may know the cover that I purchased as it comes in several colors and the has a cover that flips that has a slit near the top to view the time, battery life etc. This cover worked good until , you guessed it my phone dropped and broke the glass face which although covered shattered it with the impact of falling. I got a replacement phone and bought a leather case for extra protection in which to place the flip covered phone.  It worked okay but it was a bit of a hassle to take it out often missing calls etc. Then I went with the Otterbox and could not be happier. I still kept the flip cover and placed it in the Otterbox. So I get a stylish look and extra protection with the protection of essentially two covers. Although the Otterbox would suffice for protection I went with overkill since I can be a little rough and careless with my phone at times. I also bike alot and am always concerned if I crash or fall that I may damage the phone. The Otterbox gives the phone a solid well protected feel and the surrounding edges are extremely durable. I mention edges because speaking from experience this is usually where the phone initially makes contact before it goes boom. There is also a hard rubber liner on the edges that add to the protection. This is a well made product that also looks good and is unobtrusive and does not take away from the phones sleek looks . It does make your phone a little heavier but that's the trade off for protecting your smart phone investment. It is simple to put in place to protect your phone. I am definitely happy with the Otterbox and would absolutely recommend it for your Galaxy S4.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2MVFZAHTMLUWA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HYSFUXS#wasThisHelpful","R2MVFZAHTMLUWA","AO4A961ZKHJPL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AO4A961ZKHJPL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I believe this product is for professional groomers but it worked well with my two dogs as I used it myself. I also gave some for another family dog when she was bathed and the results for all three pets was fantastic. As claimed the product makes the grooming process easier. My dogs have hair or fur that often tangled or gets tangled and this shampoo pre-wash seemed to help make the bathing and grooming job easier. I have only used it once bit on three dogs and there are no complaints only positive results. Since it is concentrated there is plenty here to last a long time and to bathe many dogs numerous times. I was very satisfied and would recommend this product to dog groomers or pet lovers who do the cleaning work of their pets themselves. Your dogs will love  you for it and come away with wagging tails.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1CCO4M8SD53OQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HH2V6J8#wasThisHelpful","R1CCO4M8SD53OQ","AO4A961ZKHJPL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AO4A961ZKHJPL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Although my dog has not been skunked recently I have used this product to get the pew odor of several months without a bath on my dog. My dogs are outside dogs and therefore pick up all kinds of odors and mostly unpleasant. When I used this product on both my dogs they came away smelling fresh and clean. I will post an update to how this works specifically when skunked but I hope that is not too soon as the odor is not only on the dogs but everywhere the skunk has been near the dogs. It usually requires a thorough cleaning of the bedding and the general dog kennel area. I can only at this point comment on the fact that it does remove the ""dog"" smell of my outdoor dogs.

"This energy drink is a little different  than some others on the market. For one it is better in so many ways. It has an exceptional taste that is  hard to describe. It has an effervescent light carbonated taste. As for flavor it reminds me of Tang, yes  I said Tang, the old orange flavored drink the astronauts used back in the day. Difference is this drink has a punch. This is a great picker upper in  small can that packs a punch without the jitters. There is no come down feeling or electrified hair feels like an electrical circuit that has short circuited feeling. Delicious and seemingly good for you I would definitely recommend this product for your pick me up needs. Try it as an alternative to the traditional mimosa if you are an adult looking for something different. An excellent alternative to the overcrowded energy drinks on the market.

"My dogs get a variety of treats as I like to mix up their diet with variety. One of their favorites are the jerky treats sold through Costco amongst others but I must say my dogs loved this Purina product. One of the things I was impressed with the ingredients. Nothing artificial and made with real chicken. It does not say what parts of the chicken so I assume it's a variety of chicken parts as it compressed and pressed into small slabs of jerky. My dog's are small dogs in the 20lb range and I went with the common sense suggested portion. I treat is too much so a half treat each is about right. As stated their is a suggested portion amount with big dogs over 60lbs getting up to two treats. Discretion should be used when giving treats and Purina gives the pet owner a good idea how much should be given to their dog in relation to their ordinary diet. I think the dogs love these because of the brown sugar and the fact that it is real chicken. They are very hard so older dogs may have trouble chewing them. I say this because one of my dogs is a senior pet citizen and she had trouble chewing so I broke it up into bite size pieces . How do I know they are good? Easy, my dogs were real eager and their dogs were wagging the whole time. They love these treats. My furry friends give these treats five arf arf arf arf arf's!","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3Q6AQWMDYKO1C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00I18UVO8#wasThisHelpful","R3Q6AQWMDYKO1C","AO4A961ZKHJPL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AO4A961ZKHJPL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I found this small book to be very entertaining despite the brevity and language. The language is scholarly but presented in novel form to tell a story  buried in antiquity. Mr. Schiavone presents the reader with a compelling account of Spartacus, the gladiator slave leader who led a revolt against the might Romans. There has much been written about the mythic Spartacus, much of it romanticized as a revolutionary, creating a man of larger than life character whose epic battles both in the arena and out of the arena helps create the legend of Spartacus. Mr. Schiavone presents a more realistic perspective that is based upon historical documents of the time. He uses the ancient sources of Plutarch and Appian and other Roman writers from the decades following  A.D.100 to supplement his other sources. This is a scholarly study of Spartacus the man separating the legend. Little mention is made of his exploits in the arena but rather the focus is on his militarily doomed revolt. Since little is known factually of Spartacus much of what is presented in many accounts of Spartacus are idealized visions. The author presents various versions of certain events and does make conjecture of his own but gives the reader the option to choose the real sequence of events. I really enjoyed this book and found it a good compliment to various other media, such as the highly fictionalized  but amazing Starz version of Spartacus or the classic movie by Stanley Kubrick starring Kirk Douglas. I would recommend this book to anyone who is interested in separating the myth and legend of Spartacus from the Roman warrior.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3GN9Y0X5ODRE0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0674057783#wasThisHelpful","R3GN9Y0X5ODRE0","AO4A961ZKHJPL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AO4A961ZKHJPL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Well there are lots of reviews here for this unique and intriguing novel but I'll throw my dos centavos in anyway. First of all, it has all been said before in other reviews both pro and con. If you are interested check out the listed review from Publishers Weekly which gives a complete synopsis so that you know what you are getting into. What you will get into is a bizarre world, bordering on the macabre, a Gothic tale set in another place and time. I came upon this book because I'm a lifelong avid reader who is always looking for something new. I must say that I was filled with same type of excitement I had as a teenager when I discovered the writings of Edgar Allen Poe. There is an element of horror but it is disguised within the shadows of the gargoyle guarded doors that open to the soul. The writings of Carlos Ruiz Zafon were recommended to me and I was not disappointed as he commands attention to detail, weaves an extraordinary story that captivates the soul. The soul becomes part of the story as you are transfixed with sordid transgressions that mix with all the emotions of the human soul both good and bad. Within the story you become part of the story as questions ping at your own soul and you travel the Gothic Quarter of Barcelona in 1945 looking for answers that will be evident but it is like life, a journey where we sometimes know the answers but we continue to seek them anyway; sometimes in spite of the danger and potential harm lurking. I found Zafon's use of language to be like a massage, gentle but hard, soothing yet alarming but always reeling you in closer to become part of another world. A world of inhabited by characters where the profound geniuses like Dali and Picasso once roamed the streets seeking their own answers. The world where the  Cemetery of Forgotten Books is the norm and encounters with Julian Carax or is it Lain Coubert become part of the labyrinth  within the Shadow of The Wind. If you enter this world you may just enjoy your visit and become part of the story. I believe it is a fresh narrative and worthwhile of your time; if after beginning to read you don't like the book don't read it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 3, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2P5YGZVFTAO4X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0143034901#wasThisHelpful","R2P5YGZVFTAO4X","AO4A961ZKHJPL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AO4A961ZKHJPL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Allman Brothers have a legacy in rock and roll that was honored with their induction into the R&R HOF in 1995. They were a terrific band that was instrumental in the creation of what may be called Southern Rock. However they were also known for  being a jam band. You know, let it rip and just jam, much like jazz musicians are known to do. An opening is given with a passage and the artist lets it fly, going to places on the instrument that is the moment. One of the songs where this is most evident is the seminal recording by the Allman Brothers entitled "" In Memory of Elizabeth Reed. "" This has always, both then and now been one of my favorite songs by them. With it's jazzy style it rises to heights with each solo and mellows out when the band converges again. The guitar solos go from sizzling, blistering riffs to laid back precursors to smooth  jazz that is dreamy. The percussionists are part of band and in turn take their turn in soloing. This is not a studio version but rather a live version that captures the spirit of a long jam with audience interaction. The percussion solo is reminiscent and in the lasting tradition of those performed at Woodstock by the Santana band when he electrified the crowd. Long drum solos have their place in a live show, especially if it is a jam band. Drums are the heartbeat of a band and should be appreciated along with all the other solos. If drums are not your thing it comes at the end of the song so you can stop it then.  Although this version(nearly 21 minutes) is longer than the one recorded most famously at the Fillmore East by about seven minutes it still is an awesome track; you can  never get too much of a good thing. If you're familiar or not with this song you might give this version a try. Their are no lyrics, lots of jazzy interplay guitar battling and just a flat out terrific song for the ages. I have several versions and can't ever get enough  of this song, check it out , you'll like it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3R2FDLNVKALCR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IDHIP40#wasThisHelpful","R3R2FDLNVKALCR","AO4A961ZKHJPL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AO4A961ZKHJPL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Throughout the years I've used a variety of Miracle-Gro tagged products. I like the Bloom Plus for obvious reasons and the All Purpose fertilizer for year round use . The first I used was the old school  feeder that you put the granules in and connect to your hose and it dispenses accordingly.  I have three or four in various locations throughout  the yard  as I still use them with regularity. I've given my son one too as begins is life long love of gardening. One of my sons preferred the Shake and Feed All Purpose product so I decided to give it a try. I am happy to report that this is the easiest way to tend to fertilizing my plants. No mixing in a watering can, no scooping into the feeder, no muss no fuss! It is so easy it almost makes me feel guilty as I sprinkle it around my plants and water as usual. It works marvelously with potted plants as they tend to loose nutrients in the soil and have found new growth complimenting nature's seasonal blessing. It's springtime here in Cali, so everything is growing rapidly. The noticeable difference with the Miracle-Gro continuous release feeder is the size of the leaves and the beautiful vibrant  colors of the flowers and leaves. Another thing I like about it is that I don't have to feed as often because it is time release and lasts about three months. I must admit I cheat with my favorite plants by giving them the liquid Miracle-Gro as well! I like all the Miracle-Gro fertilizing products and always have some of their mulch and enriched soil on hand and it use it regularly whenever I give a plant or tree a new home in the garden. Am I a pitch man for Miracle-Gro? No, I just like and believe in their line of plant food products because I have seen the results year after year. You can't go wrong with this easy to use shake and feed fertilizer. However, I still like my old school liquid dispenser; this is a good compliment to my old fave.  Buy it now for a greener garden and you'll be the envy of all who pass by and admire your yard. Good stuff and highly recommended for easy gardening.

"By nature I'm a skeptic, I'm from the show me state(of mind). I have never used any whitening agents and always get a bit jealous when I see people with pearly whites that seem to always be smiling and showing them off. I always write it off as they're blessed with genetics or have lots of money for treatments. Enter Colgate and the common man with a special brush and whitening pen! I was thrilled to give this product a chance and was pleasantly surprised with the results; remember I'm a skeptical person. I tried using the special brush but preferred my own brush which is motorized, you know, the cheapies with batteries. I alternate and use both, sometimes in the same brushing session since it is a ""special"" brush and want to get the maximum benefit from the Colgate product. What I really do like is the whitening pen but it does take a little getting used to. For some reason I imagined it would be thicker and  easier to apply. Although it is marketed as a gel, technically it probably is but it has a consistency more like toothpaste. It is a little messy and requires a little work to apply correctly, if there is such a way. Considering how  the gel is not that thick it is a little difficult to determine  the right amount to apply. Applying it evenly is even more challenging. in spite of these issues I have with the whitening pen it does eventually get on the teeth and sticks to them. I drink a cup of coffee in the morning and have an old set of choppers but I have noticed an improved whiter shade. Now if I would have only been blessed with pearly white teeth through genetics I could be smiling continuously! Colgate has a whole line of products that will enhance  the color of your teeth and after trying the whitening pen and brush this skeptic may be willing to try some of their other whitening products.  I think for the price and if you want to get whiter teeth quick this is a good place to start on your way to a omnipresent smile on your face. Recommended for satisfaction at a reasonable price.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ZM6O9ARIO3PS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HXAIJH6#wasThisHelpful","R2ZM6O9ARIO3PS","AO4A961ZKHJPL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AO4A961ZKHJPL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a good small bird feeder that works quite well without any assembly, which is a big plus! Don't you just hate products that require assembly that come with instructions so complicated and convoluted that you eventually end up just tossing them and figure it out yourself? Anyway, although the bird feeder is small it does the job and does attract small birds, well, until the bigger one's come and chase the smaller birds away! A simple solution I have found to work is have several bird feeders of different sizes. The birds always seem to claim their preferred feeder and than there is plenty for every birdie! This particular bird feeder is a perfect starter for developing gardens in an urban setting. We tried several locations with my son's newly planted garden and the birds have been using it quite regularly requiring refilling frequently. We tried it on a tree branch at first but found it to work best on a fence post. Attached to the post it works perfectly as it doesn't move or loose as much feed as when it was on a branch. The product looks like it will last  a few years and with proper care, cleaning etc. it should give many years of pleasure. Since it does have plastic components I recommend placing it in a shady area so that the plastic does not deteriorate with the sun. If you're looking for a small bird feeder at a reasonable price you can't go wrong with this Perky-Pet feeder. Recommended for urban gardens to add to your bird feeder collection that will keep your feathered friends happy and hanging around your garden for years and years to come. Happy birding in your own garden!","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R19RNTHYMI8A2O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00G8R2PS4#wasThisHelpful","R19RNTHYMI8A2O","AO4A961ZKHJPL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AO4A961ZKHJPL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Very nice and sweet taste if you're looking for some  hot apple cider. This product is sweet but overly sweet as it is not primarily sugar. The essence of the apple bits makes for some tasty brew. I do believe the price is a little high but it was a gift and when giving no price is too high. My man sons both love this flavor addition to their ever expanding K-Cup collection which among others also includes Green Mountain Coffee. I myself don't get the fascination with K-Cup products but my son loves them and I do enjoy having a cup of brew with him, in this case the Hot Apple Cider.

"If a product passes military standards than it is good enough proof for me as a US Army Vietnam Era Veteran who served overseas on two continents and depended on military standards. My prejudice aside I can honestly say that this cover is more than adequate and is an excellent protective cover for your IPad mini. Although I have not dropped it from 6ft. I have bumped it around roughly on hard objects and the cover absorbs the bumps and bruises just fine. I must say I was a little concerned that it might take away from the sleek and lightweight IPad mini but it is a tradeoff. The compromise in a pound heavier tablet is worth the security and peace of mind. The features I love are the multiple lock in viewing angles and the magnetic closing locks.

"First off let me say that there are already many reviews for this product with the vast majority very favorable. Of particular interest are those by Top Ten Amazon reviewers that include a video along with technical data and analysis; they are highly informative. I have had this product for a couple of weeks now and listen to it whenever I can and really enjoy it. It has a big sound in a little package. The engineering in the construction of the little XBoom is top notch and very impressive. No cheap short cuts were made in the production. It is solid. Everything fits precisely and maintains the compact nature of the XBoom. It is about the size of a rubber hand ball and little smaller than a racquetball. The cord that come with it pretty much let you play with any device as it comes with a standard radio plug, USB and mini USB that plugs into the device. The cord comes with a built in Velcro strap that allows you to store the cord in the pouch that holds everything. The XBoom opens up and expands in height with an accordion type expansion center that closes and snaps securely shut into the ball shape for storage. You can play it while not expanded in height but it sounds so much better opened up as it was intended. The volume control is a traditional ""thumb roller"" with a separate on/off switch.The sound is quite amazing for such a small speaker. I must admit I thought upon opening the package that there is no way that this little speaker could produce good sound. I was wrong. I can play the speaker in my bedroom and go to other rooms and still hear it quite well in a quiet house. For listening to music in a room it is ideal as it fills the room with sound because of it's 360 degree engineering. Right now I am in the living room a good thirty feet from my bedroom where I left it on and I hear it loud and clear. Sometimes I listen to it on a lower volume level while I watch sports highlights on ESPN and it is unobtrusive and compatible while competing with another audio source from the television. It is perfect for your tablet, phone, or lap top as the sound is superior to those that come with them; it definitely is an upgrade and an enhancement to the sound you get built into your device. I have used mine with my Kindle and phone listening to my Amazon cloud library and Pandora and am very pleased. I have also used it with Netflix and it is ideal for an enhanced audio visual experience superior to the sound built in. Outdoors it is perfect for a small group where you can listen and still talk. I have numerous portable speakers for various devices but love this one the most because of it's size and great sound and of course mobility; you can take it anywhere without giving up much space in a backpack. It also fits perfectly in a pocket of your jacket. You can take it anywhere with you and have a good portable sound system. I would definitely recommend this product for all ages. It is an excellent portable sound system that delivers a big sound in a small package. You can't go wrong for the price so get one now or get several to put away for gifts for those who love music.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 24, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R337SGA7EKL6XN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0082E9K7U#wasThisHelpful","R337SGA7EKL6XN","AO4A961ZKHJPL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AO4A961ZKHJPL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a nice set for detail cuts on your small plants. I suppose it can be used for other purposes but have only used mine for cuts on some of my Bonsai. They are delicate and do require getting used to using such a  small set of essentially garden scissors for the potted Bonsai plants. They are like tiny clippers and good for small detail work. I probably misread the product when I bought it but was expecting three different sizes. Unfortunately all three are the same size.

"This is a very good tool for the garden enthusiast. Actually after using it for some time now for various landscape projects I would say it is an essential tool. It is quite versatile and comes in handy for a variety of gardening needs. Since it is extremely durable it is a fantastic digging tool for planting small transplants, digging up weeds and perfect for planting bulbs in the fall.

It is an ideal supplement and addition to any garden tool arsenal to attack and create beauty in your own backyard. The only drawback, hence the four stars instead of five is that the handle could be a little more comfortable to grip.

One of the reasons for my hesitation to invest time into watching the series was my unfamiliarity with the lead female character; also I felt it would be somewhat of a ""chick flick"" with the modern twist of women can do it all, including packing heat and knowing how to use their seductive charms to save the world, well, Melbourne anyway. On the contrary I liked Miss Fisher and I was the one seduced! Also I was not familiar with the books so I had no previous knowledge of what I was getting into. Surprise, surprise as I was in for a real visual  cinematic treat. The sets and outfits, or wardrobe if you will, were amazing and recreated with authenticity. Watching the series you really feel the time period and get transported to a different time and place. The music, especially if you like jazz was very nice. I'm not one to try and guess every moment what is going to happen but rather like to just get wrapped up into the story and let the director, actors and visuals take me along for a ride. What a ride it was as I couldn't get enough!  The series is very entertaining and I would recommend it to all. That includes the male audience and that is coming from a skeptical male viewer who really liked the series, after all, Essie Davis is very easy on the eyes. I look forward to more mystery adventures, where's the next installment?","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 26, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1FPZ0A3OH92Q6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00A27O5AW#wasThisHelpful","R1FPZ0A3OH92Q6","AO4A961ZKHJPL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AO4A961ZKHJPL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you are a coffee lover and like variety, essentially not stuck on one style, brand, or coffee bean, give this Ethiopian coffee a taste. You may even like it to the point where it becomes more than just part of your daily rotation and one of your favorites. It is bold enough yet smooth enough to rough out the edges unlike the more bolder styles like a dark or medium roast. In my estimation it has it's own distinctive qualities from the bean itself and lies in taste somewhere between a dark and medium roast  but different because of the unique bean qualities. Like terroir in wine, where each wine region gives a one of  kind taste,  the coffee bean has it's own distinctive qualities because of where it is grown and harvested. I find this coffee to be a nice change of pace coffee has I prefer  the more robust flavors of dark roast; taste is very personal but I do think most coffee drinkers will appreciate the quality of this product. It is not bitter at all and rather mellow. I would recommend this coffee to the java-caffeine heads who appreciate a good cup of Joe.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 21, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1AK6HDFVQ8FSQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007OSBGRW#wasThisHelpful","R1AK6HDFVQ8FSQ","AO4A961ZKHJPL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AO4A961ZKHJPL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love this product! My 2000 SUV was in dire need of something to make it shine. I have tried several different waxes, such as Turtle Wax most recently but none have achieved the results I got with Meguiar's White Wax. My paint job was white but dull in certain spots where the sun had done it's damage. I applied the wax in the shade, after washing my Mountaineer of course, and then used my buffer to bring out the white from the dullness. What a difference! As my truck began to shine which inspired me to do the whole vehicle as opposed to just the dull spots on top. My SUV is going on 14 years old and the paint job now looks bright almost like new; well, at least protected and taken care of. I'm going to get the black version to bring the pop back into my classic 1956 Chevy.

"I like the laptop lift to do just that; lift my laptop. However I do not like to use it, by use it I mean using the keyboard, when the laptop is in the elevated position. It is very uncomfortable to type in this position, that is when it is resting in the lift. I use it primarily for viewing video material or doing work that requires little typing like just moving the cursor and clicking, such as downloading music. It is a good modern looking addition to the work station to store your laptop so that it is ready for use. Since it is lightweight it can be mobile and thus your work station can be as well. I do not think it is by any means an essential item  or an can't do without accessory for your laptop but it is cool looking and keeps your laptop upright, cool if turned on and ready to go.

"What does it mean to make disciples? Thats one of the key questions that Robby Gallatys book Rediscovering Discipleship seeks to answer. Further, Gallaty works to address what it looks like to actually do the work in our churches.First, lets look at the structure of Rediscovering Discipleship. Gallaty gives us thirteen chapters, broken in two major sections. The first section, comprising seven chapters, looks at how Jesus made disciples. The second section parlays that into how we can emulate Jesus.Second, lets look at the rightness of the overall premise. Has the Church neglected discipleship such that it needs rediscovered? Gallaty makes the case well that this is true, at least of those parts of the church in the United States of America. Hes rightboth the witness of the Church in the world around us and the experience of those within the church support the lack of depth in our discipleship.Third, lets consider his recommended solutions. He recommends such ordinary means as time, Bible reading, and personal relationships. Since his concepts are based in the same practices that we see Jesus use in the Scripture, its hard to argue with that idea. Some of his suggestions stem from ideas used by Wesley in the development of the Methodist way, which is not bad unless you turn legalist with it. This is, honestly, the biggest threat to most discipleship groups and plans. The step from accountable to control is a short one in the wrong direction. This is one of the main killers of discipleship these days, the trip and fall into legalismor the fear of doing it so that you never start!The above fear is why we need community and not commanders in the church.How practical is this book? Immensely. I would highly recommend this as one of the better practical books on church growth I have seen. What is the one major flaw? Zondervan saddled it with endnotes instead of footnotes. Beyond that, its well worth the time and study.I did receive a free book in exchange for the review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R9LATAP02WJVP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0310521289#wasThisHelpful","R9LATAP02WJVP","A2EDTVVR9IFNLW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2EDTVVR9IFNLW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Pepsi has taken an interesting turn with the ""small batch"" concept behind their Caleb's Kola offering.First, to the beverage: shipped in a pretty solid cardboard box, which will soon be reused for Christmas decorations, all the bottles arrived intact. I expect it would take a deliberate effort for these to not arrive in good shape. No bets on the summer time, though, with heat building up internal pressure.Taste? It tastes good, all the way through a whole bottle. The first sip was different from what I expected, because I had no real guess what ""genuine kola nut flavor"" should taste like, but by the bottom of a well-chilled bottle I found it very satisfying.The sweetness comes through well without being too syrupy. That's probably the result of using a cane sugar over a corn syrup sweetener.Caffeine level was fine, not a wake-up jolt or a sleep stealing monster. I still haven't figured out how caffeine enhances taste, but you should know it's there.All in all, this is a luxury type item that won't become an every day consumption, but it's a good add to a special event","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3LBJFX4RY5VDR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VO4J2C8#wasThisHelpful","R3LBJFX4RY5VDR","A2EDTVVR9IFNLW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2EDTVVR9IFNLW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"If you look at other reviews, you'll see that some folks have had serious trouble with setup. Their experience is different from mine--For me:1. Removed printer from box, plugged into the wall per the directions. (After I found the power cord, which I had dropped somewhere and spent several minutes unnecessarily cursing Canon for not including a power cord.)2. Setup: fairly normal setup. Install cartridges, put paper in trays.3. Wait. For what seemed a long time....while the printer aligns and primes and whatever else. I don't know how much ink that takes, but it may have been a lot.4. Setup via WiFi for one Windows 10 PC: easy but time consuming. You need to download and install the software package for it to find and program the printer to the WiFi network. That was fine, just involved.One note: Canon gives you two permission pages to accept. The first is the critical one, where the printer actually works and the EULA for it. The second is for the ongoing data back-and-forth between your printer and Canon. It looks like a ""yeah, just click accept and go on..."" but it's not critical and is data-sharing you might not want.5. Print from PC? Done. Overall, took about 20 minutes. Constant attention not required, but it's not completely automatic.6. Print from Android tablet? Pretty straightforward, if you install their app and print from it.7. NFC from phone? Didn't try but did NFC from an actual camera with that option...worked well. Obviously you have fewer options doing that than printing out of Photoshop.8. Did not go purchase printable CDs or DVDs to test that feature. Sharpies work for my low-volume use of those.9. Print efficiency: it's fast. The color looks good. The ink usage seems about normal, but it's hard to know for sure as you're dealing with the opaque print cartridges.10. I'm pleased with the scanning/copying.If I could change something, I would remove using a gray ink cartridge. To my eyes, nothing is improved by it. All it is is one more cartridge to have to buy that isn't included even in the ""value packs"" sold here on Amazon.Beyond that, this is a good working printer. Photos and documents both.

"Because it's the first set that has the Torx varieties I needed for a project, this gets a bit higher star rating from me.The basic thing is what you see: organizer with bits. There's an add-on collar to hold screws while you drive them, and it's a mixed bag. I didn't have much luck with it driving down, but straight-out (into the wall) it helped stabilize the screws.The bits seem durable, and they all have a space in the organizer. The add-on collar doesn't, which means it's headed to the bottom of the tool bag, never to be seen again. But the bits are handy to have. I don't think these are any more durable than my B&D sets, but they held up well through one major project.Value is questionable--prices fluctuate too much to be certain, but there's nothing here worth a major premium over other brands.

"Obviously not the most creative product, as it's very similar to some other chocolate products out there. It is, however, a new form of the classic Hershey's Kiss. And here on Amazon, you get a 12 pack of 15....which, if I remember math, comes out to 180 kisses. That's a lot of chocolate. And budget-wise, a good bit better than the competing products.Quality and taste are our real questions. First of all, I'm pretty used to Hershey's Chocolate as kind of the normal taste of chocolate. So I think it's good. These are a bit creamier, actually, than the standard Kiss chocolate. I could do without the crisps added in, but they don't hurt the flavor.The hazelnut center is a nice middle, and overall this feels like a fancier gift idea than a normal sack of Kisses.Taste is good, quality seems good--it's an okay product.

"Full disclaimer: I received this book free from Kregel Academic in exchange for writing this review.Tough Questions About God and His Actions in the Old TestamentIve read several other books by Walter C. Kaiser, Jr., over the years. He is a go-to scholar for evangelical America on Old Testament issues. So, I was interested in his latest from Kregel Academic/Ministry, Tough Questions about God and His Actions in the Old Testament. I was hopeful that this book would become a great resource in pastoral ministry.The questions are certainly present-day questions, such as The God of Mercy or of Ethnic Cleansing? or The God who Elevates Women or who Devalues Women? These questions form the chapters, providing the framework for the book. One question/chapter was unnecessary, and that was the last on dietary laws. This question fits into the wider framework of the chapter on Grace/Law, and the space could have been used for another question or issue. One that I would have liked relates to truth, accuracy, and historical records for the Old Testament.Overall, though, while I find no major errors or issues with this work,. (As if I should sit in judgment on the Old Testament work of someone whose books were used to teach me the Old Testament,) I dont find anything to commend as a necessary book. Some of the questions are framed as either/or and then answered with both. Others are answered with a fairly standard concept: whatever God does is right, but what God did then is not something we should assume He is going to command now.While these answers are essentially accurate, they are not much help in the apologetic or teaching domain. That God ordering judgment on the Canaanites is fundamentally different than jihad in Islam is something I would accept on faith. Kaisers explanation isnt much deeper than that. It presupposes that the Bible is right and the Quran wrong, which is part of Christian belief. (Just as part of Islamic belief is the converse of that statement.)Do I feel like it was a waste to read this? No, I do not. Kaiser has consolidated here a basic Christian response to the questions he cites. But all-in-all, I dont think his answers cover the material well enough to work outside of the faith community. Theres just too much that grounds in the presupposition that God is always right.Again, free book from Kregel in exchange for the review.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2F1JLKFO1Q1BG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0825443768#wasThisHelpful","R2F1JLKFO1Q1BG","A2EDTVVR9IFNLW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2EDTVVR9IFNLW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The Carols of Christmas adds to my shelf of story behind the song books, but in fairness to Andrew Gants hard work Ill leave the others unnamed. I mention this just to show this isnt my first trip into music history.Of course, one fear of digging into the stories behind the songs is that youll find your favorite songs are just bad underneath. Fortunately, Gant hasnt destroyed any favorite songs. It may be that he left out some with checkered storiesbut well have to wait for the sequel.Instead, we have good stories behind 21 fairly well-known songs. Except for Personent Hodie, that is. The rest youll know. In this book, I appreciate Gants depth of writing and his willingness to acknowledge the differences between facts and legends. I also like that he did not stuff the book with unknown songspresenting just one lesser-known carol for our enjoyment.Overall, of course, the presentation is repetitive. Each chapter has a song, a story, and the sheet music for the song. Thats not the way youd want a novel but this is a collection of stories. It works just fine this way. I honestly couldnt sit and read the whole thing straight throughunless I was a history nerd. Which I am. Otherwise, though, its a bits and pieces book.For example, in our house this is going to be part of daily leading-to-Christmas celebrating. One chapter a swatch, with singing the song each day.

"Uninvested promises on the cover to show you how ""Wall Street hijacks your money"" AND ""how to fight back.""The first premise is one that few of us would likely dispute. Monks, with Jaffe and Lacasse, help demonstrate *how* and document cases, but there is really nothing surprising about this idea. While the overall evidence is that neither regulations nor industry ""safeguards"" really help, they do not advocate tearing them down. Admittedly, I think differently and recognize that there will always be more money in the private sector than in government and that greed will out rather than true regulation.Still, the definite evidence presented helps clear the fog about how well the government regulates. It doesn't. And to keep clear this: money managers make a living, whether they make you a lot of money or not.Further, Monks advocates strongly for being a better educated investor. I am all for it--and personally would suggest that less regulation would allow more people direct access to the markets.Instead, Monks' suggestion still sets up investors in groups controlled by money managers. I think that's the Achilles's Heel in his plan--he fails to acknowledge that no system will work any better than the people who run it, and even his systems will attract greedy people to run them, in time.Overall, the call for investors to get their heads out of the sand and pay attention is crucial. Further, the call to reform and improve regulation to allow better participation from detached investors is also worth looking at, though it's not much of a factor here.I liked this book, but I felt like it could have been somewhat more practical in terms of clear tools for the everyday investor. I came away knowing I need to know more, knowing that companies don't want me to know more, not trusting that any financial adviser will help....and wondering just how to invest my money. Because even Monks' CIP involves trusting a financial adviser....Informative but leaves one waiting for the next step.(I did receive a free book in exchange for the review. Had I received a free million dollars to invest as well, I would have reviewed the book the same.)","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1CASA0F5LPCRA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1591848199#wasThisHelpful","R1CASA0F5LPCRA","A2EDTVVR9IFNLW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2EDTVVR9IFNLW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A the outset, I must be honest and admit that my Hebrew skills were never as good as my Greek, even in seminary. So I cringed a little, remembering that the Devotions on the Greek New Testament volume featured no English Scripture. I was afraid...And now that I have this in-hand and see that the separate devotional authors have included a chosen English translation, I realize that I kind of wish they hadn't. Part of the challenge and joy of doing the Hebrew reading is lost when you can glance over and use the English as a crutch. Having to look it up in a different book is slower, but it drives me to try a little harder.I will definitely side with the reviewer who found the Hebrew font a little on the small side. It could be bigger by half and would not look too large.Then there is the devotional content: I liked all of these, even with the divergent viewpoints inherent in a group writing like this. They were helpful, and I particularly enjoyed the efforts to dig out some different passages rather than retread the parts of the OT most of us are well acquainted with.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2OGFL4X7W63ZU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0310494532#wasThisHelpful","R2OGFL4X7W63ZU","A2EDTVVR9IFNLW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2EDTVVR9IFNLW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Well, first, it's hard to know whether this is movie-accurate, since the movie's not out yet. But, it looks like it's movie trailer accurate :)First: it comes with batteries. That's always nice. The description says ""demo"" batteries, but they're Duracell. So, since you're not getting one here on Amazon that has been sitting in the store having the batteries run down, you will probably be fine with the included batteries.Now, you have 2 major parts. A lightsaber and a light dagger. I'm guessing that, at some point in the film, the little light dagger is a surprising thing for the person dueling with Kylo Ren. Perhaps how the bad guy kills off someone we love? As a toy, it's a shell without lights or sounds. It does attach nicely to the handle of the main lightsaber, making a weapon that (if real) would cut from any angle.Which might explain the ready availability of hand replacements in that galaxy far, far away.As to the main lightsaber: nice. It extends easily and then collapses. The lights/sounds have two modes, one is reactive where a swing or hit makes a sound, the other just makes random noises. Both fully illuminate the lightsaber and the 2 side prongs. I would have preferred two modes, one with sound and one without, because parent sneak-attacks work better without the sound!It does connect in with other lightsabers in the whole ""Blade Builders"" system. That might get bad for the fragile items in the house, though...Worth your time.

"The book itself, A Commentary on the Manuscripts and Text of the New Testament (hereafter something like The Commentary) presents not only the differing manuscript readings throughout the New Testament (in canonical order) but also discusses which readings seem most likely. There are also notes on where some manuscripts have used devices such as nomen sacrum (a marker for sacred names) and potential explanations for various manuscript development.In short, Comfort attempts to explain many of the variants that are often footnoted in newer translations and also to highlight important facts lost in the realities of translations. It is a highly academic work. The first two chapters will orient the reader to the issues involved in textual criticism, but one definitely needs to be read-up in Greek to truly benefit from whats going on here.I am not an academic, but just an ordinary pastor. That means I grapple with different texts every week and rarely have time to fully research all the textual issues related to any of them. Further, Im leaning on Greek I learned a while back, and am trying to keep up with in these days. My view of Comforts Commentary is related to its usefulness for an every week preacher and teacher of the Bible.First, its not a necessary book. As much as I like it, its not critical to your weekly preaching. The information is helpful on background but not absolutely necessary. In fact, if you dont know how to work this into your teaching ministry, you can do more harm with it than good.Second, though, is that this is a helpful book. If youre putting together an in-depth study, this illuminates some of the background. Further, Comfort has provided a deeper look at something we often lean on a book-specific commentary for. Here, we have a look at the text as a whole and how the variants developed. Its handy. Especially in those times when I have a little bit of extra study opportunities.Form factor is great. Fits right alongside my Greek New Testament, my Apostolic Fathers, and the smaller hardcovers.

Almost every time that I open PowerDirector, it gives a little pop-up encouraging me to buy another software product. I'm sure it's a fine product, but I just want to work with videos.

"Seven lives. Spread across history, starting with Joan of Arc and ending with Rosa Parks, 7 Women and the Secret of Their Greatness is an introductory biography. Obviously too short to be an in-depth look at any of their lives, the chapter length looks get past the one-sentence summary that we often get.First, of course, one could look at how Metaxas chose the women to feature. History has not always been balanced in recording the lives of women and men. As such, writing a biography can be very difficult if you go looking too far back. There's just not the source material. Metaxas' choice of Joan of Arc is understandable, given the records that are available about her. Beyond that, he's chosen women from the Enlightenment Age onward.Additionally, it was his choice to include women who excelled at whatever they did, rather than seeking the ones who were ""pathbreakers"" into the traditional ""men's world."" Rather than setting up the false idea that women have to pick one side or another of the gender gap, instead he chose to highlight women who succeeded in both traditional and non-traditional fields.How is the writing?Metaxas writes with a friendly style that is easy to follow. It's not as in-depth as some writers, but this is an intro work. hopefully it will spur you to read full biographies of all seven named in the book.Factually, I must proceed on the assumption that Metaxas and his editors have ensured the accuracy of what is stated. I know that some aspects of the lives of Joan of Arc and Maria Skobtsova are hard to prove and drawn at parts from legend. These still read well.All in all, this is well worth reading.

"What do you do with someone who does not age, and would only die under certain specific conditions? What would that life be like? These are the bigger questions found in Rick Barrys The Methuselah Project: A Novel. (The A Novel part is necessary because there is already, apparently, another book with The Methuselah Project as its title. I digress.)Barrys not writing philosophy, though, so you experience those questions in the narrative of the life of a man. A man who simply had his duty set before him, and then it all went wrong. That man is Roger Greene.This is a fairly straight forward science fiction/thriller novel. Is the science plausible? Possibly, though Barry is vague enough on the science that you realize its fictional. Then you have the thriller elements as Greene approaches the new world he lives in.I was surprised at the smaller number of fish-out-of-water moments for Greene. The focus was more on the survival/action of the moment. Which is a fine focus. It just wasnt quite what I expected.In the current Marvel-dominated media world, the comparisons between The Methuselah Project and Captain America cant be ignored. Barry has enough differences, though, to separate the two. The first being Greenes forced involvement, the work of a classic mad scientist, compared to Rogers voluntary work. Other items will be clear to the reader.I have no qualms recommending this as a sci-fi thriller to you, my readers. This includes a willingness to hand off my copy to youth readers like my children. There are some heavy plot moments, but all are handled with a respect for many peoples preference not to have all of the details of love or death.I like it.

"I remember being a kid and learning to play Othello. On the box was the slogan ""A Minute to Learn...A Lifetime to Master!"" (Now, I think the Othello slogan is ""Reversi without batteries!"" but I digress.) That slogan applies well to the 5 Gears concept.First, of course, one should go out and learn to drive a stick shift. That helps the book make more sense.Overall: like most business/leadership books, the length is doubled by testimonials and case stories. That's okay, because these flesh out how the principles worked in individual lives. If you are a facts-without-stories person, skip them. The book reads faster that way. But then you'll miss some good inspiration along the way.The principles are drawn from the image of a stick-shift, and how there are times we need to be working through the gears of life to make progress. If we try and start out in fourth gear, we stall out.One thing I especially liked was how Kubicek worked to draw out differences in how this looks for introverts and extroverts.

"Todays book is Understanding Prophecy from Kregel Academic. Authored by Alan S. Bandy and Benjamin L. Merkle, both of whom are New Testament professors at Baptist schools. (Bandy is also the author of The Prophetic Lawsuit in the Book of Revelation, which sounds fascinating.)On to the book at hand, which is substantially more affordable than Bandys Lawsuit volume. The prophetic passages of the bible are among the most studied and least understood, overall, as we often go to them as divination students rather than Biblical students. Authors Bandy and Merkle make the case in the introductory matters that when we look only to the end-of-time concepts in prophecy, we often miss what God is revealing about His character and His everyday work in the world.That is not to say there is no element of forward-looking in prophecy. Nor that we shouldnt check out those ideas, only that the Revelation (and Daniel, Isaiah, Ezekiel) is Gods Word about today, not just about that day.In view of this, we have a book with 10 chapters and 2 appendices guiding the reader through the concepts of the prophetic in Scripture. The authors do not attempt to explain every prophecy in the Bible. Instead, they present a framework for understanding prophecy.It follows that their presuppositions about Scripture and prophecy come through in the writing. Both assume that Scripture contains no errors and that predictive prophecy is possible. Further, that prophecy in Scripture is accurate, not imaginary.Is it an easy read? No. This is a primarily academic book. Theres no fluffy moments or pictures, and there is a need for a basic grasp of Biblical interpretations principles.If youre into the quick-pop prophecy, trying to line up current events and popular figures with Biblical passages, then this wont help you with that. In fact, it will probably knock that idea flat. Which would be healthy.I heartily recommend this for pastors and those interested in deeper study in the prophecy sections of the Bible. The authors have done a good job explaining the presuppositions and viewpoints so that the reader knows their angle, and then presenting additional ideas beyond their own. I do not agree with some of their conclusions, but their process is helpful.I received a copy of this book in exchange for the review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2MQC40MHWP25Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0825442710#wasThisHelpful","R2MQC40MHWP25Y","A2EDTVVR9IFNLW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2EDTVVR9IFNLW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"1. It is exactly as described: 4 outlets, 2 USB ports. It has a 3 ft cord. That's about 6 inches shorter than I really needed on my desk, but I'll cope.2. The cord is thick, but that tells me well-insulated. (Hopefully I'm not wrong.)3. The safety on the outlets is fine.4. 4 outlets are enough, as my old 6-outlet had two slots taken up with USB adapters.5. Here's the main drawback: USB charging is slow compared to my Kindle charger, for example. And it's hard to nail down the stats---this points out it is a ""2.1A"" while the Kindle charger is ""9 Watts."" Those two metrics don't compare, so it's hard to know why the Woods item is so much slower. But charging a Kindle from dead, a Galaxy S5 Active from 20%, both take about twice as long here as with the Kindle 9W charager.So do with that what you will--there may be some devices (Fire TVStick, for example) that need a higher amperage than this.

"The NIV Zondervan Study Bible, the hardcover of which looks like the picture, is a replacement product for the NIV Study Bible that I had in college. At the moment, its available in hardcover. For those who arent interested in reading it as a Bible, it therefore works well to break your toes when you drop it. This thing is heavynearly 3000 pages.Without dwelling on the New International Version as a translation (Im not a big fan of the 2011 revision of the NIV), let us take the features under consideration first. On the surface, an obvious helpful feature is full-color printing throughout the Study Bible. This not only allows pictures throughout, which is a great, but allows something else nice. The study note section is shaded in light tan while the Biblical text is on white paper.The inspired text is therefore clearly separated from the ideas of the note writers. I like that. A lot. The note authorsa smorgasbord of evangelical scholars from the US and the UKgenerally hold to a high view of Scripture. They come from a range of the evangelical world, from Baptists to Presbyterians and a few more.I will not claim to have evaluated every note throughout the text, but I have yet to find one that is problematic. Passages that have major theological disputes about them (like Hebrews 6) follow the normal Study Bible pattern of providing most of the main views. Thats not a bad thing.Further, each book is given a full introduction, addressing authorship, date, etc., the basics that are typically covered in an Intro type class. Overall, the information helps one study the Scriptures better.If you are in the market for a study Bible, this one would make a good purchase. Id prefer the notes and content coupled with the New American Standard, but the notes are worth it as a reference Bible. And, it is too bulky for taking it everywhereId go for it on the shelf.The purchase of the hardcover does gain free digital access through the Olive Tree Bible App. Im still getting used to the app, so I wont comment on how well it works.

"This is my first ""non-major"" brand smartphone, though I did carry a torch for Blackberry far too long into the modern era. By the time I went to Motorola and Samsung, the old Berry was ""non-major,"" too.So, how does the BLU stack up?1. Call quality. This matters most, because IT'S STILL A PHONE! I live just outside of Little Rock, AR, and it works fine out here. I have no dead spaces that my Samsung didn't have. Certainly the BLU didn't work well in the storm shelter, but...and since this is a phone first, that matters most. Does it work? It did, on AT&T.2. Interface. Let's be honest: it's not the most interesting interface, nor has there been a lot of pre-setup with it. I'm okay with that, and it's working fine.3. Included apps: I'm still looking, but I'm not finding much in the way of bloatware. (Let's not talk about how much bloatware AT&T puts on a branded phone....ok, let's: too dang much.)4. Battery life: yes, it really does last a long time. As in 3 days of ""normal"" use for me: a few calls here and there, keeping up with data via WiFi, and a round of World Golf Tour a day.5. Screen: huge. Just huge. And responsive.6. Durability: well, it held up decently with the ""knock-it-off-the-desk"" test. But I decline to intentionally give it the ""dropped in the street"" test.7. The camera isn't great, but I'm a lousy cameraman anyway.

"1. I love the ink system, and so far it's worked quite well. Looking at Epson's website, looks like refill ink will be inexpensive. We've got a bit of a shift from the ""cheap printer, we'll make money on ink"" mindset.2. I'm not a fan of having to use a cable to set up a wireless printer. If you have to use the USB to set it up, then it's not wireless. Now, I know the ""WPS"" setup should work, but I couldn't get it to do so. So, I had to move the printer over to computer and plug it in to start with. Now, it's fine. (Plus, those cables aren't that expensive. Throw one in the box.)3. On that note, I know 6 buttons and 3 lights is a simple interface, but I've gotten used to knowing a little more from the printer itself.4. I'd like to have a paper tray instead of a load-from-the-back only printer. It takes up a little less space on the desk that way.5. But the ink should last a long time, and that's a big deal.6. Additionally, now that it's set up, I can print from both PCs and my cell phone. That's very helpful.7. Be careful after you've got it set up and primed. You have liquid ink at one end of this thing, and the ""seal"" isn't much for holding back the ink spills. And woe be unto you if you mix up the colors. Get too much Cyan in the Magenta, and your next call is for a new printer.In all, I think I'd aim for the next model for the front-dash controls, but this one is working as promised.

"I did not know what to expect with The Letter for the King, so I can't go with ""exceeds expectations.""I will instead go with: a book that needs to be read by many. Recognizing that this is a work of both translation and authorship, I'll be commenting on the book as one work. Why? I don't read the original language--or even know it---so I can't say if the translating was ""perfect."" I can say this: the writing is excellent.The story opens with the classic conflict of the duty of rule-keeping with the duty of honor-keeping. Young Tiuri must choose between those rival responsibilities, and then take the consequences.What are those consequences? A journey of adventure, danger, and peril. A journey that offers no certainty of reward nor success, yet one that must be undertaken.How will Tiuri respond?The pacing of the story is not nearly as fast as many modern books. That increases the appeal for me as I pass it to my son to read. I think it will help stretch the long-horizon attention span. The chapters are short enough to read on and off throughout the day, but the story stretches the memory and the reading skills.The moral of the story, and the morals of the story, encapsulate lessons that need to be learned and practiced.

"Some books I read for learning. Some I read because Im assigned or offered reviews. Some, though, I just happily snag for free because it saves me the money of buying them. These are the fun reads, the ones I would like to spend far more time on than I have the chance to.Oswald: The Return of the King by Edoardo Albert falls into this last category. I first met Alberts writing in Edwin: High King of Britain and have since greatly enjoyed his non-fiction related works on early Britain. I guess one could say I am a fan.Oswald follows on the heels of Edwin, as Britain remains in the turmoil of the post Roman Era. Its an imaginative tale, obviously not entirely historically accurate. After all, there arent exactly newspapers from the time laying around to be read.Still, Albert spins the tale well. The characters become people you actually care about, even though you recognize the reality of the environment. And that reality? People are going to die. Its a bloody time, a violent timeand a time of all sorts of other perils.The tale of Oswin and his choice between the monastery and the throne is not one most people are familiar with. It likely reflects the choice several people faced throughout the years of the Dark and Medieval Ages.Albert not only provides a gripping story for the reader, but he also presents several helps. The first is a list of characters so that the reader can keep them straight. Second is a detailed historical note providing the facts behind the story.Overall, this story doesnt make a family-friendly movie, but it is a fascinating piece of history. Its also an engaging read for those who want to know more about a generally overlooked time frame.Is it worth the reading? I would recommend Edwin first, just to set the stage, but yes. Its also well-worth having a copy around.I received a copy of this book in exchange for the review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2NNIFUO04DRH2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1782641165#wasThisHelpful","R2NNIFUO04DRH2","A2EDTVVR9IFNLW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2EDTVVR9IFNLW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"What is an Evangelical Christian? Other than Not a Catholic or an Episcopalian, that is?Trying to nail that answer down first, and then examining the history of what fits with Evangelical Christianity is the opening challenge of this book. After that, Evangelicals around the World addresses the global spread of this sector of Christianity. In short, there is no small task here, even for 400+ pages of densely spaced writing.Before we talk too much about content, let me make this observation: this book is nicely printed. Its full-color throughout, enabling the illustrations, maps, and graphs to pop out well. It also features footnotes! Academic-type works are harmed by endnotes, so I love to see footnotes.Now, to content: the work opens with 200 events in history that illustrate the depth and breadth of Evangelicalism. This is followed by an attempt to define evangelical in broad enough terms to include many groups while still showing a restriction to its meaning. This chapter does well in the attempt, and I will not reproduce it here. The authors did well by using both what it is and what it isnt to line out the definition.From there, we see a development of Evangelical interaction with other Christian groups. One could take issue with which groups are counted as Christianscertainly some Evangelicals wouldbut the authors are mainly working on mainstream views here.Then we see summaries of doctrines that Evangelicals agree on, with good notations on what range of opinions exists even in these areas. Rightly, the defining characteristics are the belief that the Bible is true and Jesus sent us to carry the message. How that bounds out is where there is much discussion!Finally, the book wraps with a region-by-region look at international Christianity. This section serves as a helpful introduction, though international situations can be so fluid that some of this data will be obsolete soon. Still, the snapshot of where things stand right NOW is a valuable reminder that America is not the center of the Christian world.In all, I think this is a valuable book on current church status and an encouragement that the Gospel keeps going forth. Its not the first book you should read every day, but if your church wants to learn where things are, its a good help and start. I would also commend it to homeschoolers to couple, as a reference, with geographylearn about the church in each area as well.Free book from Booklook Bloggers.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RBW76T981RBOX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=140167853X#wasThisHelpful","RBW76T981RBOX","A2EDTVVR9IFNLW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2EDTVVR9IFNLW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Honestly, I didn't quite know what to expect with The Theater of War. By the time I was done, I felt almost guilty for peeking into some of the personal moments that were shared by Doerries in this work.First, a look at what we have here: Doerries stages 'readings' of Classical Greek plays for veterans groups and other specific groups like those facing terminal illness. From that point he leads discussions about how the plays inform or address the issues being dealt with by those groups.Second, a look at the impact: this book probably has the most raw emotion I've read in a long, long time. We see people finally finding the vocabulary to express what they feel, to address what they face. It's powerful.It's powerful to see how the ancient world can inform the modern one. One of the best lessons in here is that one can address the difficulties of war separate from the politics of getting into it in the first place.Doerries' work reminds me that there is wisdom for now found in the old words.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1D7QISZN4C6JR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0307959457#wasThisHelpful","R1D7QISZN4C6JR","A2EDTVVR9IFNLW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2EDTVVR9IFNLW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As much as I disliked the Trapper Keepers of this year's line, I really liked this binder/file folder system. It's been swiped by my high school student to organize her writing class with a major project, but before she took it, I noticed:1. Closure is secure. It clips, it holds.2. Stout 3-ring binder. I wouldn't jam the ""380 sheets"" in it, but I buy that as capacity.3. Included file organization, like a filing cabinet. Small enough to carry with you, it helps with organizing various papers for projects.4. Outer pocket for electronic device or small books...it's carrying a Kindle Keyboard now.5. Small pocket for pens.It's got a shoulder strap, but that's not really much help.Is it worth the money? Not for every class, but for a major project-type class, probably so.

"Lock: Excellent.App: Okey-dokey :)BE AWARE THAT THIS NEEDS AN EXISTING DEADBOLT INSTALLATION TO BE USED. OTHERWISE, YOU'LL NEED TO GET THE BOLT, OUTER LOCK, ETC....Installing the OKIDOKEYS unit on an existing deadbolt is really quite easy. The instructions are clear, the system works well. Additionally, battery life is quite good. It is a tad sensitive on those doors which have settled with the house, where the deadbolt throw space isn't perfectly lined up. If you are used to lifting/pushing/pulling your door a hair to throw your dead bolt, then you will have a little extra work to do.All of the lock features work well, including the door sensor. The add-on magnetic door sensor does take a bit more work, but it's worth it.My one dislike comes from the app. The basic features are fine, but the app needs to allow one to shut down the ""location-based"" services. I don't typically leave location on for my phone because of battery life (and paranoia, my tin-foil hat doesn't cover my phone). But the OKIDOKEYS app asks for location every time it's opened. And several times while it is open.I don't want my door to auto-unlock when I get close to it...that might let the space aliens in! So the app should allow the user to just decline location in the settings and not have to keep canceling the ""Turn on location!"" reminders.Other than that, I think this is a good one. Do-it-yourself friendly, with clear install instructions and easy setup.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3MIPVXVF5ELLC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IVKGF3C#wasThisHelpful","R3MIPVXVF5ELLC","A2EDTVVR9IFNLW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2EDTVVR9IFNLW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Today's Book is Questions Jesus Asks. This is a follow-up to Israel Wayne's Questions God Asks, published last year. Wayne is a preacher and teacher in the United States.Now, on to this particular book. Essentially, this is an accessible theology book framed around the Scriptures that record Jesus Himself asking questions. It's a different approach than the standard formula of defining a topic and then going to the text for answers. It strengthens the reader's interest by using this approach.First, Wayne addresses the big question: Who is Jesus? Why does that matter? From this understanding of the nature of Christ, he goes on to address the other questions.A moment here to take a brief dip into the idea of all Scripture as the Word of God. Wayne is not presenting that ""red-letters"" are more important than other letters by focusing on the questions Jesus asked. Instead, he is using these questions as an organizational tool for exploring all of Scripture.The topics covered run from Christology to Eschatology, but all without being obscure or bizarre. Further, Wayne speaks plainly to the audience and without an edge of superiority.I found this a helpful book for learning theology by going through a different path, one that helps the reader stay focused. Additionally, I would commend the idea of using this book alongside reading the text as narrative, for a few excursions into what deeper things we can learn from the moments in the story the questions are asked.I did receive a free copy of this book in exchange for the review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3E6BXKQUKPQLJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0892217340#wasThisHelpful","R3E6BXKQUKPQLJ","A2EDTVVR9IFNLW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2EDTVVR9IFNLW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Not everything we do has to be deadly serious. One of the main people I rely on to keep me laughing is Tim Hawkins. And, for the first time ever, Tim has written a book!As a fan, I knew what to expect. This a short-chapter paperback that mainly holds Tims comedy in written form. The stories and jokes are funny, and considering Ive got most of them memorized, I can even hear Hawkins as one of the thousand voices in my head as I read this book. (Whether thats good or bad, my pshrink wont say!)While this predictability is an asset to the tome, Diary of a Jackwagon contains a few things I had never heard. Much of it is backstory either of Hawkins life or the longer version of humor that doesnt fit in a video presentation. These parts were the better parts of the book, mostly due to their freshness.Honestly, though, what are we expecting? Its funny, its Tim-clean, and its worth $10 to have something fun to read from time to time. It takes almost no extra brain power to read, but it also doesnt numb you to the realities of life.All-in-all, its exactly what you would expect. Unless for some reason you think Tim Hawkins is a stage name for D.A. Carson or Dan Wallace (heavy-duty Biblical scholar dudes). In which case, you might have thought there was depth. There isnt.Just good clean fun.Free book from Booklook.

"24 rounds of Nerf annoyance!Setting aside the difficulty of storing this Nerfer because of the side cylinders, I love it. It shoots straight, does not require batteries, and the rotating cylinder design is different from anything I've seen.Further, it's easy to load all the chambers without having to prime the weapon.The only thing that seems useless is the ""Slam-fire"" mode. Essentially, hold the trigger while pumping the weapon's charging handle. It's not any quicker than normal shooting if you're not really slow. And it's not going to speed you up if you're uncoordinated.The cocking lever is a little weak in the connection. Make sure you screw that in tight.

"Effective as a long-range Nerfer, the RotoFury shoots from one end of a basketball court to the other. And for safety reasons, should only be used against people past the half-court line.Now, on to the product: 1. there should be a way to release the cylinder lock so you can spin it and load it. The need to cock the Nerfer just to get the last dart in the cylinder is annoying. Plus having to work your way around loading it instead of loading from one point.2. It does shoot fairly accurately. Obviously, the longer distances are less accurate. It's a foam dart, not a guided missile. Still, 7/10 into the box from 75 feet. (from leaning on a table at one free-throw line, aiming at a box on a table on the far out-of-bounds line)3. The darts whistle better than my old MEGA darts did. Not sure why, they just do.4. It's still incredibly loud on firing. That's got to be a large spring involved.5. Rate of fire is as fast as you can cock and shoot with the pull-back handle.6.

"The first time I heard someone mention special needs children in church, it was accompanied by a long list of Dont ever do XXXX again! The commandments to the church were accompanied by a list of things to instruct parents of other kids to never do at church and to make sure their children never did. In short, it made ministry with special needs children sound like a lugging a burden through a minefield, where survival was the only hope.As a pastor, thats not the approach that seemed best to me at the time.It still seems like a terrible approach. After all, Gods people are not all of one shape, size, and ability group. If we cannot flourish as the church by welcoming all people, then we have something wrong. Then I was offered Every Child Welcome through Kregel Academic and Ministry for review. Given how hard it was to pick one book to start with, I viewed this as a godsend for learning better first steps.I was right. Katie Wetherbee and Jolene Philo, both long-term educators, present a concise look at how all children can be welcomed and celebrated in church. Rather than presenting a burdensome batch of do/donts, they give strategies to try out.Some of these strategies are genericafter all, Wetherbee and Philo dont know who youre ministering towhich is fine. Given that many readers of Every Child Welcome are, like me, not qualified to make highly specific diagnoses, we should be looking at broadly usable ideas. From there, the more specific strategies recommended come into play.The most valuable information here is what should be the most obvious. The authors give some clear guidelines about how to communicate about childrens behavior which helps keep it edifying and private as appropriate. If your church leadership hasnt learned yet to keep behavior challenges off of social media, you need to teach that lesson right quick. For all ages. (And yes, I must admit to having failed at that in younger dumber years.)Further, Every Child Welcome provides resources for further study. Its a great intro work, and ideal for a pastor who wants to launch a church in the right direction, not just making a separate space for special needs kids but enfolding all of Gods people in the church.Free book from Kregel Academic in exchange for the review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2GR3GF13BHFCA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0825443504#wasThisHelpful","R2GR3GF13BHFCA","A2EDTVVR9IFNLW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2EDTVVR9IFNLW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Todays book delves into Colonial America and looks at two figures that are not typically portrayed together: George Whitefield and Benjamin Franklin. While I am not quite certain that Ill grant Randy Petersens subtitle of The Surprising Friendship that Invented America, I still find The Printer and the Preacher a great read. Heres why:First, Petersen opens with some of Franklin and Whitefields interactions rather than burying those into chronological order. This leaps the reader ahead a few decades and sets up why one would want to read the rest of the book.Second, while there is some prior knowledge of American Colonial History is helpful, its not critical. Petersen provides many of the background events needed to understand what was going on in the world of Whitefield and Franklin. We should know what happened in those times, but keeping it all straight is easier with the reminders.Third, I greatly appreciated the admission of things not known throughout this book. While there is enough ambiguity admitted to for the overall premise to be questioned, at least Petersen is not foisting a false certainty about the relationship between the two.Fourth, there is no attempt to posthumously baptize Franklin. The man went through his life unwilling to be counted a born-again Christian and any biography dealing with his life should admit that. Too many Christian-oriented books on the founding era of the United States attempt to classify all the Founding Fathers as strong, right-wing Christians, which they werent. Honesty is a good sign for a biography.Overall, this work is not without its flaws. For example, there are several places where there is no evidence that Whitefield and Franklin met. Its possible they did or didnt, and ones view of their relationship will decide how that silence is interpreted. Naturally, Petersen presents them as likely having interacted. It helps the story, but its not certain.At its core, though, this is a story of two men with conflicting viewpoints working together. They benefited professionally and personally, and in turn two nations reaped spiritual and temporal rewards. Its a great story, one that sheds light on a model worth learning.Free book in exchange for the review.

"It's hard to figure how to really review the Amazon Echo. Here's why: I got it, expecting a WiFi enabled music player with a few other novelty perks. Which, given the deal I got was going to be just fine.So, we set up the Echo. The voice commands use an activation word, default setting is ""Alexa."" You give commands either by pushing the button on the remote and speaking them or by simply saying where the Echo hears you ""Alexa, ...."" (fill in the command). In our house, that got the Echo named ""Alexa.""First, to the intended usage: music. The music quality and streaming is excellent. Over the past few years, I've managed to get all of the music we own uploaded onto our Amazon Music account, so this is like having voice access to 100s of CDs at once. The Prime Music library is a good addition, though I've found it most useful to work those songs in through the Amazon Music App into playlists...sound quality is good, it fills the room well.I do wish there was finer control of the volume of music. 3 is often just a shade too quiet, 4 is too loud, and the voice system can't do ""3.5.""Second, though, we found a myriad of uses for Alexa that we didn't really expect. But when we recently moved and went a week, we realized a few things:1. Kitchen timer. Talk about simple--rather than punching buttons, you just call out for a timer. It would be nice to set dual timers, but the one is great.2. Calendar/weather updates. The daily briefing feature is far more useful than I expected.3. Ease of use for all things. Including that my kids love to ask for a joke...though the jokes are corny to the extreme.In all, I think it's a good purchase. There are a few limitations, like the volume control, that keep me from just going complete fanboy and five-starring this, but I think the Echo is well worth the purchase.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2D2GNSQWLJO3H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00L9EOQCO#wasThisHelpful","R2D2GNSQWLJO3H","A2EDTVVR9IFNLW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2EDTVVR9IFNLW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Reading a few other reviews, I think I'm finding a positive in what some find as a drawback1. Layout: you have a 2 page layout of the month. This has squares that are about 2 inches square on it, to do the month at a glance. Then each week gets a 2 page spread, with 8 lined sections. 1 for each day, plus a spare ""notes"" section.This is great for planning and recording what has happened.2. It's boring. There's no fancy lettering, pretty graphics, even much in terms of color. It's just straightforward. I like that, but some will find it visually flat.3. Cover: thicker cardboard, which the wire-bound style doesn't turn as easily. On the upside, it doesn't tear up in the backpack.For me, as a straightforward planner/calendar, this hits all the right notes. It's a bit pricey, and of course it's huge for portability/on-the-go use, but that's part of deciding if this style is right for you.

"Expectations matter---even though this is a color printer with a good resolution, I didn't expect perfect picture printing. And I didn't get perfect pictures, though they were good enough for what I needed.I did get great colors on basic images for work reports and printouts. Speed was good, and so far the cartridges are trucking well through their announced lifespan.Setup: I set this up strictly via wi-fi, which went seamlessly. Downloaded software direct from HP rather than using the CD. In my recent experience, installing from a CD results in ""Checking for Updates"" and a complete download anyway. Might as well cut out the middle man. So, download, install, print--worked fine.Also works fine doing Wi-Fi direct from my Samsung. Touch to print/NFC worked fine.Noise level is fine, not too intrusive.I'm not a fan of the price of cartridges but what are you going to do? That's how you can get the printer at an affordable price.In all, worth it if you need color. Primarily for printing reports/brochures in color, not pictures although pictures aren't bad.

"Looking past my wondering WHY I would ever need this product, let's just take a look at whether or not it does what it should.1. Does it light up? Yes, it does.2. Can you control it with a mobile device via Bluetooth? Yes, you can. This is subject to all the limitations and issues related to Bluetooth connection, doubly so if your light fixture is not close to you.3. Does the programming work? Yes, it does. Assuming your phone is near to the light bulb when your timer/alarm should happen. Or that no one switches off, manually, the power to the fixture.The limitation of wireless connectivity is the real problem here. Sometimes, your phone isn't quite connecting. Sometimes, you're just a shade too far away. Sometimes there's interference.In short, unless you are right up close to the light, you aren't really getting the benefits of the light bulb. If you could send a program to the bulb, rather than have it dependent on the phone/app for operation, I think this would be better. But overall, I can't get it to just run the schedule without making sure I leave my cell phone close enough for the wireless to connect.Perhaps if you did the whole house in iLumi bulbs for the Mesh effect to work...but that's a stout outlay.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2NB1TA95EFKIX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OCGV412#wasThisHelpful","R2NB1TA95EFKIX","A2EDTVVR9IFNLW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2EDTVVR9IFNLW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am fan and user of Bible software. Most Bible programs can do the concordance search way quicker than anyone with a print concordance.Except those results are sometimes too comprehensive--if you're using one Bible, do you need the extra info from fourteen translations?What is a concordance? This is an index of every word used in the NIV translation of the Bible. For example, how many times (and where) does the NIV use the word ""Father?"" or ""Rabbit?"" You turn to the word, see the heading info and you can see how many and where.So, the hardcover has value. Additionally, it's easier to show someone else what you are doing by working through the hardcover concordance.Now, to this one:1. Exhaustive--and exhausting to lug about. I'm fairly certain they got everything here. I had the 2nd edition, and it was pretty close to right on. This one has a better digital database to build on, so most everything is there.2. The use of the G/K numbering system is helpful. You can actually use the numbers to find the Greek or Hebrew word and then find that number keyed to several of the major lexical works in that language. It is no substitute for learning the languages, but it's helpful.3. I don't know why they compare to Strong's, since Strong's is a concordance of the KJV. Still, it's quite handy.4. An additional use of the numbering system illustrates the difficulties of translation: one word like ""love"" may translate several original language words. By seeing the differing numbers, you can link up the different words for study.5. If all else fails, this is an excellent self-defense tool.I find the NIV Exhaustive Concordance better than my NASB Concordance--which is a pill, since I prefer NASB as a translation.

"This one goes down as ""so-so"" in the Nerf blaster department.The Good: quiet approach and attack. You can sneak up on anyone with this...if you want to. Plus, broken down to just the core blaster it's easy to pocket. The add-ons are alright, the shoulder stock is the most useful.The Bad: one shot at a time. True, you can stick 6 Nerfs through slots in the stock. You can also carry them behind your ears like pencils and be just as fast. The one-pull, one-shot, then reload/rearm sequence makes this more like bringing a flintlock pistol to the fight. Make sure that's what you're up against--if someone comes with a full auto Nerf, you're toast.The Ugly: the add-on barrel is just flat useless. So is the weird squared config to use the belt clip.Is this a total waste?

"I'm in the middle of a work relocation, so there's all sorts of stuff I should be doing.Instead, I snagged the review offer of Pirate Hunters and blew three days reading it rather than doing any useful work. I was fascinated by the story of salvage and recovery, including the behind-the-scenes personal issues. But then I got into the story of the Pirate Bannister and the sea life.It was fascinating. I would certainly not wanted to run afoul of the pirates of that era, but reading up was fun.Further, seeing just how hard it is to bring history up from the depths was informative. In all, this is a great read for history buffs or pirate fans.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3B9OWH83S28X2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1400063361#wasThisHelpful","R3B9OWH83S28X2","A2EDTVVR9IFNLW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2EDTVVR9IFNLW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""If you want to lead the orchestra, you must turn your back on the crowd"" is something I read in some leadership book somewhere...Now, we have a leadership book from an orchestra conductor. Except it's not about turning your back on the crowd. That's apparently a fundamental assumption of leadership that needs no book.Instead, Talgam brings out some ideas that I, having been a band nerd in high school, had not considered regarding music, leadership, and orchestras. You see, a high school band director is certified in 'instructional music,"" meaning he/she can teach (and therefore play) nearly every instrument in the group. Perhaps he's better at some (Mr. B was great on brass but only good on flutes) than others but one would not argue with him about the basics of any instrument.An orchestra conductor at the pro level, though, may have no real idea about how to play some of the instruments. He may have always been a string player and can't get a piccolo to do anything. Instead, it is his/her role to take the disjointed parts and bring them together into a whole. To take the lines and create the picture.From this, Talgam builds a picture of leadership. He does not present that a person should lead without knowing *anything* but stresses the ability of a leader to guide without knowing the details of every area being led. Consider how this applies--does a ship captain know the finer points of boiler maintenance? Or does the jumbo jet pilot change the oil in the plane? Likewise, an most organizations, insistence that the leader be more competent in everything than anyone in their departments is a recipe for failure.That does not excuse, though, the leader from respecting the knowledge of those being led. Talgam's guidance here will be lost in those workplaces where the ""leader"" is considered beyond question or always right. The value here is for those who want to lead or structure organizations where the leader works together with others to accomplish the goals. Where the leader is comfortable with his ignorance being filled in by those being led, without failing to guide to the big picture.Definitely worth a read.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1NSC2M9W456VH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1591847230#wasThisHelpful","R1NSC2M9W456VH","A2EDTVVR9IFNLW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2EDTVVR9IFNLW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Roger and Suzanne mysteries are always good and have particularly liked the two that have a plot centering around the 'dog world'. The first was show dogs, which was familiar to me and this book goes on with AKC field trials, something that has been developed since I was involved personally with show dogs. Again, very accurate portrayal of dogs, their training and their personalities plus a very realistic look at dog show people as well.

"I've been waiting impatiently for this book to come out, finished it in one sitting and am bitterly disappointed. Each of the first two books were excellent, ones that I've kept to re-read. Good characterization and interesting characters, interesting plotlines, good action sequences. Each book had it's own main character, but the initial core group of characters remained. with a complete story to each book, beginning, middle, end.The writing and storyline in this third book remains excellent, as does the characterization. Unfortunately the author has apparently decided to serialize this series with no warning and there is no ending of even a minor plotline, with a major overall story continuing on to a new book, an abrupt, middle of a battle cliffhanger ending. My personal opinion is that any serialized book should carry a notation to that effect, not be unleashed on an unsuspecting reader. If a cliffhanger ending is announced in the information and I choose to read the book anyway, it is my choice. If the author shocks me with it unexpectedly, my annoyance is going to be expressed.","1.0 out of 5 stars","October 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R10WG59KQFF1GD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011HTF0TI#wasThisHelpful","R10WG59KQFF1GD","A1SSRL4Q0QHZFR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1SSRL4Q0QHZFR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I've been waiting for this ever since I finished the second book in this series. Really like the characters, the passion the main character has for old buildings comes through clearly, at an emotional level and while I do not feel the same attraction, I can understand it from the viewpoint of my own passions. While I am not familiar with the area, or with urban settings in general, the writing comes through with total credibility and the plot revolving around the current issues of illegal immigrants is definitely interesting and reads as accurately presented. Like the first two books of this series, this is one I will keep and re-read.I still like the first book of the series the best of the three. I am definitely a character driven reader and the first book spent more time with character developing and there was more interaction with the supporting cast of characters. If I have a criticism of this book, it is primarily that I wanted to know more about some of the new characters introduced. For example, Charlie appeared only briefly, a major character primarily because of her absence, but I wanted to know more about her. Characters prominent in the first book only had 'walk-on' appearances which I found somewhat disappointing.My last criticism is that this book definitely ended in a cliff-hanger, which is usually  a major problem for me as I have an irrational dislike for them. In this case, I found it something I could live with because this plot and storyline was completely wrapped up and the 'cliff hanger' was a matter of just paragraphs at the very end and just a suggestion as to at least some of the storyline for what will be the next book in this series. I vind I can live with that and I will just hope that any future cliff-hangers do not go beyond this level.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3QO1NZACZGKPX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013V94LEW#wasThisHelpful","R3QO1NZACZGKPX","A1SSRL4Q0QHZFR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1SSRL4Q0QHZFR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I like science fiction and the sci-fi/futuristic setting was done well. Enjoy mysteries and the police procedural/mystery plot was handled well. Good character development and while I find many 'cozy mysteries' simply too silly to be entertaining, this was cozy more in the way of slower pacing, more character interaction and a lack of graphic violence.The biggest downside for me with this book was the recurrent reference to the Christian orientation and beliefs of the main character when it had nothing to do with the plot or storyline. It was handled with a fairly light touch, but was still intrusive at times.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RGH9CQEW2UUHB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00B322KIO#wasThisHelpful","RGH9CQEW2UUHB","A1SSRL4Q0QHZFR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1SSRL4Q0QHZFR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The book ... at 137 pages ... is short, obviously just a segment of the next series and somewhat of a cliffhanger, which I absolutely do not like but I did expect it so can't complain too much. However, there really isn't much of a storyline within the book, it's more of an introduction to the coming series and did find it somewhat of a disappointment on that basis.

"Obviously written by an author with police experience, this is one of the most realistic looks at actual on-the-street police work I've read. The plot was well developed, writing professional although I did find the characters less well developed and 'individual' than I usually prefer. This book's strength is, for me, not in the story but in the very realistic view of the life of police officers dealing with the issues in city law enforcement today, which is something more people need to look at, I think.

"After the introductory free novella, I was really looking forward to this full length book in the series. More character development, if a little slow, more background/scene setting than action but I didn't really have any major issues for the most part.Until the ending. Classic, definite cliffhanger ending. For various personal reasons, I do not handle cliffhanger endings. I expect a book to have a beginning, middle and end and although a series can certainly have threads to the next book in the series, I expect the major issues in each book to be solved. The old movie theater serial type 'closing' with the female lead tied to the train track with the train in the background annoys me tremendously.Decent writing, reasonable storyline, interesting characters for those readers who are not put off by cliffhanger endings.

"Excellent storytelling, much better than average military sci-fi, good character development for the type of plot, good dialogue. I gave his first book a rare 5-star review and this second book is another one. Of the two books (quite different) I liked the humor in the first book better, but I have to admit this is the only criticism I can really make.Pretty standard military sci-fi but interesting characters, well written action sequences, a realistically high body count without getting too far into the splashy gore descriptions, a good touch of political underhandedness.An author versatile enough that I'm looking forward to see where he goes with his next book although I would be delighted for a second book continuing with either set of characters.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R6D4J6YUOL1WS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KVMWAQ4#wasThisHelpful","R6D4J6YUOL1WS","A1SSRL4Q0QHZFR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1SSRL4Q0QHZFR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Second of the series, entertaining read and interesting storyline.  In some ways a followup from the first in the series but I did find the ending abrupt and a bit strange.I would like to have seen more character development in this second book and less of the romance, which got a little intrusive at times and I still find the lead male character very indistinct, he seems as if he is there only for the romantic interest rather than a real personality on his own.I have some issues with what I personally term the ""Bluebeard's Castle Syndrome' ... female character going alone, without backup into dark tunnels, unlighted alleyways, open buildings.  That tends to annoy me and it's been an issue in both books.With the way this book ended, I will likely read the next book in the next series to see how the author intends to continue, but depending on that and if some of the issues I've had with the first two books are not resolved, I probably won't continue after that.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R26EWJURI330NJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00F6GHTR0#wasThisHelpful","R26EWJURI330NJ","A1SSRL4Q0QHZFR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1SSRL4Q0QHZFR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The police department and supporting characters are presented with normal personality conflicts but no huge political or personal animosity, no ""detective against the world"" scenarios.Plot line in this book is interesting, touching on money laundering, terrorists and counter-terrorism tactics, perhaps a bit of a suspension of belief is necessary but it is handled with a smooth storyline that makes an entertaining read.Just wish the author wrote more in this series faster.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3GA4IADK4T0MO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CEO1M66#wasThisHelpful","R3GA4IADK4T0MO","A1SSRL4Q0QHZFR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1SSRL4Q0QHZFR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The combination of Native American and Celtic mythologies worked well, loved the main character and the writing was beautiful. Unfortunately, for me, it seemed as if the author was almost deliberately trying to be obscure in some cases.As I read further, it became more apparent that some of these situations were in part, foundations for further storylines for future volumes in this series, something that was not made clear in the synopsis or title. While I do read a number of trilogies and/or series, I prefer that I know that this is the case in advance and that each separate volume does, in fact, have a very traditional framework of beginning, middle and end.","3.0 out of 5 stars","December 30, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1O3RJOF1L7GVJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004MDLWD0#wasThisHelpful","R1O3RJOF1L7GVJ","A1SSRL4Q0QHZFR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1SSRL4Q0QHZFR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"As good as any first book of a fantasy series I've read recently. Excellent characterization, great storyline, good action sequences. If the rest of the series holds up to the promise of this first book, it's going to be a series I keep to re-read.There were editing errors, but that is something I can overlook, especially for particularly good character development and a relatively unique world setting.

"**Pros**StylishComfortableGorgeous colorsTons of compliments**Cons**Length of thumb holeI normally wear a size small, but I ordered a medium because I have monkey arms and I wanted it to fit the length of my arms. Plus, if it was a little baggy it would be okay. I am completely pleased with it. It's a little baggy, but stylishly so.I chose the wine color and am so glad I did. It's gorgeous. This is a great fall and winter shirt and would even make a great Christmas outfit. The pocket is tilted to the side for aesthetic purposes and has a cute striped design that matches the ends of the sleeves. The shirt is extremely soft and comfortable. It's slightly thin, but not see through.The only thing I noticed wasn't right with the shirt is the thumb holes on the sleeves weren't in the same spot on the shirt. You'll have to look closely in my pictures of the sleeves. The first picture is just the sleeve length. The second picture is the thumb holes, one is about two inches down from the end of the sleeve, the other hole is about four inches down from the end of the sleeve. I can't complain about this though because I wouldn't use those anyways, but for others who want to you might want to check other people's reviews and see if anyone else mentions this. I might have just gotten a factory defect one. I don't know. Like I said, I don't care, but for other potential buyers this could be an issue.Overall, I love this shirt. I'm wearing it for our family Christmas pictures. It's extremely comfortable and pretty.

"**Pros**Easy to applySticks wellAdds personality**Cons**NoneI absolutely love this skin for my keyboard. It definitely adds a spark of personality. I have gotten a ton of compliments on it too.Applying the skin is incredibly easy. There are simple picture instructions on the back of the packaging.Directions (pictures to ago along with it too):1. Peel the white part around the sticker up. Leaving just the keyboard stickers on the sheet.2. In the package there is a thick plane white piece of paper. This is actual a clear adhesive. Peel it off and stick it on top of the keyboard stickers.3. Take a card or a coin and press it over the adhesive on the stickers to get them as smooth as possible. This is what makes the stickers transfer to the adhesive.4. Turn your computer all the way off. You can apply this with your computer on, but it's a pain. Just turn it off and save some hassle.5. Peel the adhesive. When you do this it should bring the keyboard stickers with it. If it doesn't, then you need to use your card and keeps smoothing. Also, start peeling from the right side, for whatever reason that side made it peel up effortlessly for me. (I did start on the left side as you can tell from the picture, but quickly moved to the right side.)6. This is a really important step. This is where you line the stickers up to the keyboard. I suggest starting in the middle and making sure it lines up all the way across. Take your time on this step because if you don't get it on straight it will be scratchy and worthless. Don't be scared or daunted it only took me about 30 seconds and some major eyeballing, but it does pay off.7. This is the most important step and the reason you turned your computer off. You need to smooth the stickers on to the keyboard trying your best to get out all the bubbles and making sure the stickers transfer. I didn't turn my computer off so I didn't smooth the stickers out as well as I should have and I regret this. Please learn from my mistake.8. Gently peel the adhesive. Do this slow and steady just to make sure the stickers transferred.9. Tidy it up. You can try and press out any bubbles you come across. I had a ton of bubbles because of the lack of smoothing, but I was able to gently peel the sticker corner up on a key and smooth it out. I no longer have any bubbles. Also, make sure to take the circle off the caps lock and the little slits off the pointer keys F and J.10. Enjoy your beautiful keyboard.I've been using this skin over over a week and haven't had any problems so far. The stickers have stayed on it, there isn't any peeling. I'm a writer and work from home so I'm on my computer for 10+ hours a day. Finger oils haven't been a problem so far, however, if you get down on the keyboard you can see fingerprints, but you have to get close to see them.Overall, this is a really great skin, fantastic quality, easy to apply. I've gotten a ton of compliments while at the coffee shop and my writing group on how awesome my keyboard is.During a promotional period I received this keyboard skin in exchange for an honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2RE20T3GUKO5H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016RY69RK#wasThisHelpful","R2RE20T3GUKO5H","A2DCNZGZ6N78HJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DCNZGZ6N78HJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"**Pros**Gorgeous grinderHolds a decent amountLabeledGrinds greatSmooth turn**Cons**NoneMy husband is a pepper grinder snob. We received three grinders when we got married and have acquired so many more since then, but this one is by far our favorite.The color is gorgeous, it's a rich brown with silver plating. It looks really nice on our table giving it either a homey feel or a modern feel depending on my table setting. The top of the mill is labeled with a letter P for pepper, it's discreet, but there if you buy both the salt and pepper grinder and clean them out at the same time you'll still be able to tell which one is which.The canister holds a good amount, not a ton, but enough to make it a few weeks or longer depending on your pepper use. The grind is fantastic and exactly is perfect to spice any of your foods with. The best part about this grinder is how smooth it is to grind the pepper. It really is a flawless grinder.Overall, I highly, highly recommend this pepper grinder.

"**Pros**All levels of coloringFront only designsSoothingNice pages**Cons**NoneI adore adult coloring books. This particular coloring book is really awesome because it has pages for kids and adult, meaning the intricacy of the designs are basic to expert.There are 33 pages with designs on them plus the back inside cover has a coloring page design too. Each design is on its own page, the back of the page is blank, this allows you to color without worrying about bleeding through if you use markers or pens. It also allows you to tear the page out and frame it or hang it up if you want. The designs range from animals, geometric shapes, to mandalas.The designs are soothing and are great for calming down the nerves. I can see these being used for therapeutic purposes.The pages are good quality, not department store coloring book type. They're more like thick printing paper. They do curl up when you color on them, which isn't good if you plan on tacking the page up, but it's okay if you plan on pressing it behind a frame.Overall, this is a great coloring book for the whole family. It has great designs and will provide many hours of soothing entertainment.

"**Pros**72 different colorsLets colors flow easily - doesn't bleed colorsReusable case with snap closure**Cons**Not all same consistencyName of shade not listedThis is a great set of pencils for a coloring enthusiast. There are 72 different shades of colors, some are very similar, but they really are all different. The quality of the pencils is better than most. It takes little effort to use them. In the photo of each shade I did those by loosely holding the pencil and swiping back and forth, no pressure at all.I love that it comes with a plastic case to hold them. The quality of the case isn't great, but it will last the use of the pencils if you take care of it. I did find that it takes up a ton of space. If you don't need to transport these to and from class or anything like that then you can always cut the plastic packaging to separate the sections. This will allow you to open the case without taking up a full table.The only downside I found to the pencils is each wax is a little different, making the consistency between each pencil slightly different. Some of them were more moist and others were dryer and some had it so there was more color dust. For most this isn't anything noticeable, but if you're looking to use these for more of an artist use, then I'd take note if that would be an issue for you or not. Again, this isn't noticeable if you're just coloring or letting kids draw. Also, the name of the color is not listed on the pencil or the pack, so it's really based on what you see and trial and error to begin with. These aren't a big deal to me, but could be for others and is the reason why I'm posting about it.Overall, this is a fantastic set of color pencils that would be great for many people. Great for coloring, arts and crafts, writing notes, scrapbooking, and for many other occasions.

"I really dislike writing a review when I don't care for the book, but I also know it's appreciated so others know what they're getting into.This book has a great general idea, but I feel like it was rushed and never went through a proper editing process. There were hardly any contractions, which made the dialogue feel unrealistic with everyone talking so proper.I was disappointed in the climax. It lasted two pages, it was completely rushed, and spotty. It was all telling and no showing.I truly do like the idea of the story, the background, and the dual point of view, but the book needs to be edited.

I love Ryn's humor, it helps give light in an otherwise bleak world.Overall, I can't get enough. I want more of Violet and Ryn! Really this book is full of joy and heartache and hope, you will love them.:::Spoiler::: Why did it have to end with their parents kind of having a thing for each other?! Why? I wanted a better happy ever after for Vi and Ryn!

"**Pros**Bumps and ticklersHits g-spotStays in placeFlexible**Cons**Vibration is extremely softThis is a nice vibrator for people who want something tame. It's a fairly small vibrator, but has a nice area to hold on to. It's curved so it hits your g-spot. I love the shape of it, it starts as a big bulb and then narrows down, this shape helps keep it in place and avoids it sliding out if you let your hands go. The bumps and ticklers are nice and what really step this vibrator up. Twisting and turning the vibrator puts those ticklers to use.It is made out of silicone and the bulb part is extremely flexible, allowing you to adjust it and get it in just the right spot.The only downside to this vibrator, for me, is that the vibrations were much too soft. I'm sure it wouldn't be for some people especially those who are new to the adult toy world.Overall, this is a nice vibrator. I love having a handle for such a small vibrator. You will need one AA battery. I didn't try it in the water because it didn't look fully waterproof to me even though it says it is, try at your own risk.During a promotional period I received this vibrator at a discount in exchange for an honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R27425257MKD7P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011ULT0Y4#wasThisHelpful","R27425257MKD7P","A2DCNZGZ6N78HJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DCNZGZ6N78HJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Librarian and a biker! Hell yeah! Aren't all of us reader ladies wannabe librarians? Or is that just me? I loved this book. The characters were fun to meet.Ryker was every bit of a biker man that I expect. He has Hellions on him all the time, no settling down, ever!, takes no s***, and territorial as hell.Elizabeth, aka Pinky, was one hell of a girl, maybe a bit quiet at times, but she got her backbone by the end and put Ryker in his place. I loved seeing her character grow and get a bit of a biker attitude.The story didn't have much to it except an ex that still wanted to have some action. Nothing crazy at all.

"These colored pencils are beautiful. I love everything from the black box they're in to the simple black pencils. They're very modern and grown up. The pencils do not have any writing on them, not even a color. It does come with 12 colors (black, brown, purple, blue, light blue, green, light green, red, pink, orange, yellow, and peach).The color flows right off the pencil. In the photo I provided to show the colors I barely touched the pencil to the paper so you can definitely see how well the color goes on. You can press harder for more vibrant color. I had no problem blending the colors, it was smooth and didn't glide everywhere, but just enough to take the harsh lines out.Overall, these are decent colored pencils. They're a beautiful set and the colors are great.

"What an absolutely beautiful and enthralling retelling that takes your through Thomas's dark, hurting, playboy life, to a man who feels, cares, and loves like no man ever has! You can read this book by itself without reading The Sound of Salvation, but I highly, highly recommend reading both. They're so different despite being about the same thing. It is quite extraordinary! I deeply enjoyed Nadia's point of view in The Sound of Salvation, but nothing compares to reading Thomas's point of view. I said before that I need Thomas like I need air to breathe and this book solidified the fact that he is the perfect book boyfriend.I.A. Dice did it again. She created this beautiful story that was much more intense and obsessively sweet. Thomas is a character that you will enjoy being in his head, seeing things from his point of view. He isn't perfect, but boy does he try.I seldom come across a book that will leave me one hundred percent sated, but this book was everything a romance should be. Each of I.A. Dice's novels are complete masterpieces at taking you on a beautiful journey.

"What the-? What did I just read? I was excited to jump into a sexy alpha biker story, but instead I got a twisted, warped, hell of a story.I didn't care for the heroine in the story, Nicole, she kind of creeped me out. She's definitely a strong female, but kind of crazy. Weird wasn't a strong enough term to define her. She starts off as a boring college girl and 10 pages in the story she wants to spit on a couple of guys to put them in their place. It felt pretty unrealistic like that through most of the story.Nicole and Jase are an interesting couple that we get to follow along with their story, but it really isn't about them. This story is quite amazing with how everything tied together. I knew exactly what was going on from the beginning, but I didn't know the extent that it went. The twists Nikki Pink created was amazing. It really is a masterpiece how she stitched the story together.It's told from multiple points of view, not just Jase and Nicole, but a few other people as well. I'm disappointed that we didn't get to clear things up (Bigfella or the sheriff). I'm also highly disappointed Nicole's family wasn't brought up especially her father in clearing up Bigfella. Maybe it's in the next book, but it feels like it should be in this book since it pertains to these characters.If you're looking for a wild ride then look no further, this has it all, murder, sex, psycho characters, lies, arrests, interrogations. It could use some tidying up and loose ends fixed, but it is an interesting read.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3HFBQHY5KPN3E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HMEG7HM#wasThisHelpful","R3HFBQHY5KPN3E","A2DCNZGZ6N78HJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DCNZGZ6N78HJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Fantastic quality dice. These aren't factory seconds and you can tell! They're not light or airy, they've got that quality weight, color, and press to them.I really like the colors that are provided (black, white, blue, green, purple, red/white (possibly orange), and red/black (possibly orange)). I could barely tell the difference in the orange and red, I really think they both looked about the same with different color for the numbers.These are designed just like any other dice except the d4, I've never seen a d4 where it's read from the number that is touching the table, usually you read the number by what is at the tip when it's rolled. I've attached a picture so you can see what I mean. I actually like this a lot for those sitting down a table so they can see it a bit better. It's not a big deal or a deal breaker, just something I haven't seen before.Breakdown:d4- 14d6- 23d8- 21d10- 14d12- 14d20- 14As you can see from the breakdown you'll get 14 complete sets with 16 dice leftover.Overall, the quality of these dice is astounding and you get a nice assortment.

"I love how simple this thermometer is. You can definitely use it right out of the box, but I highly recommend reading the directions so you learn how to do the fast calc and know the other guidelines for the thermometer. I am really impressed with the fast calc feature. It makes this thermometer worth it!The display is wonderful. It's simple and large which makes it incredibly easy to read. The probe has a nice tip making it easy to poke through all types of food. The best part about this thermometer is the temperature range, you can measure out hot oil for frying or to make sure your chocolate temperature is right, you can even check to make sure your cold items have hit the right temperature. To clean the thermometer just get a sponge hot and soapy and wipe the probe down.The only thing I dislike about is that it doesn't have an off button. It auto shuts off after 2 minutes. I realize it's not a big deal, but I like to conserve things when I can and an off button would help prolong the battery life longer than the 18 month prediction.Overall, I like the simplicity of this thermometer, it's a no frills get right to the point thermometer, I just wish it had an off button.During a promotional period I received this thermometer in exchange for an honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R39DD3ZLDS3JII/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011IC99R8#wasThisHelpful","R39DD3ZLDS3JII","A2DCNZGZ6N78HJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DCNZGZ6N78HJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a beautiful, classic, yet modern frame. It's not anything extraordinarily fancy, but it does look really nice. It does not have glass, which is both good and bad. Good because you don't have to worry about it breaking while shipping, plus it helps keeps cost down, bad because you have to be careful when moving the frames from one location to another because the plexiglass scratches easily and it does collect dust like no other.The inside measurements are 11x14 inches, but the outside part, the part that shows is 10.5 x 13.5 inches.The frame can be hung up horizontal or vertical. It comes with supplies to help hang it up, but I have no idea what they are or how to use them except the nail so I just used the hooks already attached to the frame.Overall, this frame is quite nice.

"I purchased the Christmas theme washi tape set, but I received the Nature theme set. I was perfectly okay with this because I like the polka dots and the chevron stripes in the Nature set.If you're new to washi tape then let me point you to a quick Google or Pinterest search for Washi Tape Projects. You can get an idea of all the things you can do with Washi Tape through that. The benefits of washi tape is that it doesn't leave a sticky residue, or any residue. It wont tear up pictures or paper. This means you can decorate a wall with washi tape if you're in a rental and want something beside plain white walls. You can scrap book without worrying about destroying pictures by taping them down. This stuff is really wonderful.I mostly got these for my planner. I like adding a little color here and there to make it fun. These 5 rolls are pretty and add a nice color. There's greens and purples and blues in the Nature theme set. I've put them in my planner  to help me get to the notes section easier. I even put them on some tea lights so they aren't that ugly silver color. I had to peel some off my desk and it didn't leave any residue and it was still sticky so I could put it on my project after peeling it off the desk.Overall, I really like the Nature set, they were just the right colors and patterns for my taste.

"**Pros**SturdyPretty7 hooksDecent sizeMultiple uses**Cons**None**Measurements**The rack is 16.5 inches wide and 9 inches tall. It will fit on a door that is slightly less than 2 inches thick.I ordered this in 7 Hooks Black. The design is attractive and not just a plain ol' door rack. I am extremely pleased with it. I keep it next to my front door on the closet door and it is quite lovely to have there. I just stick my purse and jacket on a peg and they're waiting on me when I leave the house.The hooks are quite sturdy. I can put my huge 5 pound purse on one and it hasn't bent a hook yet. I'm sure over time it will slowly start bending with the purse being pulled and just general wear and tear of it being used so much. However, I can say that it is a great door rack and will serve its purpose for quite some time. I highly recommend keeping the limit at around 3-5 pounds per hook though.Overall, this is a beautiful over the door rack that can be used for every day items like your purse and jacket. You could use it in a bathroom for towels, in a coat closet for scarves, hats and gloves, or in a garage to organize chords.

It's absolutely beautiful and definitely brightens up my bathroom. It's really wonderful if you don't have a light over your tub because this curtain lets light through.

The material isn't a crisp vinyl/plastic, it's a softer fabric type of curtain, it's not cotton, but it's not plastic either.This curtain has metal eyelets so that the hooks don't rip the curtain when you pull it open or close. It also comes with some plastic hooks, which will work for a long time if you don't want to upgrade them or don't have the money too.

"**Pros**FlexibleEasy to cleanCooks wellNo plastic taste**Cons**They don't fit togetherI really enjoy baking with silicon pans because it makes popping the bread/dessert out of the pans easier and you're less likely to rip/tear the dessert. I've been using these pans for a few months now and love them.Since they're silicone you can bend them, twist them and they will not rip or tear. They're extremely durable and the best part is, is that there's no weird taste while baking with them. They cook thoroughly and evenly and I have not had them melt on me at all.The only thing I wish was different is, I wish you could stack them inside of each other for easier storing. If you look at my picture you can see that they have little feet that stick out on the sides to help them stay stable, which prevents from stacking inside.I was amazed at how clean and evenly my bread slides out of these, there's barely any crumbs left after turning the pans upside down and letting the bread slide out. I do very lightly spray the pans like I did to my normal baking pans.Overall, these are awesome pans.

"That was one hell of a ride! Definitely a book you should pick up if you're into sexy fighters. The story is a roller coaster ride for the heroine, Rowan. She has a past that's eating at her every day, but she fights it especially when she sees her daughter for the first time.Jax, a sexy MMA fighter, doesn't know what hits him, or squeezes his hand, until it's way too late for him. He's the epitome of perfection. Sweet, caring, understanding, loving. Can we make a machine that makes fictional characters real? I want Jax!I'm used to the fighter stories having the MMA always playing a huge role in the story, but it wasn't that was for this book. Family was the center of this story. The climax wasn't intense like a fighter story normally is, but it definitely grips your heart.This is a book to get lost in. Pick it up and find yourself aching to be cherished by Jax. and craving to know more about the rest of the guys.

"**Pros**Super stretchyBright and funComfortableNot see through**Cons**NoneI adore these leggings. They're bright and fun especially around dusk because they almost seem to glow. The jellyfish images on the pants are beautiful. I really love that it's not just jelly fish printed on a pair of black leggings, the leggings are an image of jellyfish in the ocean. You can see the little specks and bubbles in the water. The leggings aren't black, the sea is more of a deep purple on the leggings. The image is really quite beautiful.These are a one size fits most. I'm a size small and they fit great and aren't see through at all. I don't think they would fit a size XS, I think they would be a bit baggy. I want to say it could accommodate up to XL. They are incredibly stretchy, but the more it stretches the more it becomes see through.They're made out of polyester and spandex which gives them a silky feel unlike cotton. They're very comfortable. I've worn them out and about for errands, just lounging around, and even on one of my runs.I usually wear size 3 longs in pants so these don't quite hit my ankles like I'd like, but I just make them so they're capris instead. Or if you're tall like I am or taller then you can do what the model in the picture did and pair them with some boots.Overall, they're really quite cute, stylish, and fun.

"**Pros**Pretty purple4 gallonsPerforated90 bags**Cons**ThinI think these trash bags are adorable. They would be great in a teen girls room, a bathroom, or just to brighten a small trash can up.There are 3 rolls that have 30 bags on each. The roll is perforated so you can easily get a bag without tearing into them. I know the description says they're 5 gallon bags, and yes they can hold 5 gallons worth of trash, but if you want to tie the bag I'd suggest only putting 4 gallons worth of trash in. The bags are quite thin so don't push the trash down or you could risk ripping the bag open. I've used a whole roll so far and haven't had any rip on me, but be mindful how thin they are.Overall, these are pretty trash bags that hold a good amount of trash.

"**Pros**Wicks moistureNot see throughNice colorComfortableStretchesNo camel toeFoldable waistband**Cons**NoneSize Medium inseam= 29 inchesGreat leggings for year round use. They're thin enough that they make great leggings for warmer months, but they're just that right thickness that they'll keep you insulated in the colder months as well. They really do wick the moisture away, which makes for a much more enjoyable run.There's a gusseted crotch, meaning they added a triangle shape piece of fabric to the crotch are (inside), this widens the crotch area and helps eliminate camel that dreaded camel toe.I usually wear a size small (I'm 5'8 and 110 pounds), but I ordered a medium to hopefully get a decent length and just deal with the bagginess. They still hit just right above my ankle. I wish they were half an inch to an inch longer, but I can't complain too much because a 29 inch inseam is still great! The color is a bold purple, not bright just bold and vivid, I'm sorry my pictures didn't capture that.I really loved running in these pants, they move with my body, never restricting my movements. Even in my stretches there wasn't any pulls or tugs. I'm really impressed with the quality, they're really durable.The foldable waistband is an added bonus that I appreciate. My stomach isn't quite where I'd like it to be so it's nice being able to cover it while running to give a full coverage. I also like that I can fold it down and make the pants look trendy and cute.To wash them I just turn them inside out and wash like normal.Overall, if you're an active fitness person these leggings would make a great addition to your active wardrobe. They're breathable, comfortable, and cute.During a promotional period I received these leggings in exchange for an honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3ANER7B021T6X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OIGYW4M#wasThisHelpful","R3ANER7B021T6X","A2DCNZGZ6N78HJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DCNZGZ6N78HJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"**Pros**REALISTICFantastic suction1.5 inch girth5 inches insertable**Cons**NoneThis bad boy is fantastic! He comes with a little tube of lube, which means he's ready to go as soon as you get him. I'd wash him with soap and water or toy cleaner and then pop him on a door, window, floor, bathtub, shower wall, etc... The possibilities to get creative are extensive.The shaft is a nice 5 inches long with a 1.5 inch girth, which makes for a nice full and realistic feeling. He is a circumcised penis complete with a fake slit in the head, veins down the shaft, and balls. He's a firm/hard silicone that is limber enough that it feels good and allows you to explore many positions.The suction cup on this thing is fan-freaking-tastic! Seriously, if you stick this bad boy to a smooth surface he's stuck there until you peel him off. Take him for a slow ride or a wild ride, either way he can handle it. When you stick him so that his shaft is vertical he will stand tall and salute you, there isn't any droop. When you stick him so that he's horizontal, he stays horizontal for easy insertion, there's little to no droop.Overall, this guy should have a spot in everyone's toy chest. He's realistic, he holds up against the job, you can have him as he is or pull out a vibrator and have some fun that way too.During a promotional period I received this dildo at a discount in exchange for an honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2AE76WU43K3VZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TXOT686#wasThisHelpful","R2AE76WU43K3VZ","A2DCNZGZ6N78HJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DCNZGZ6N78HJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"**Pros**SoftComfortableSexyMultiple wears (or)Rip-able**Cons**StrapsWowza! This little mini lingerie mini dress is sexy to the core. The first thing I noticed when I was opening it up was how soft it was, I really just want to wear all the time because it so comfortable. I love that because it helps makes bedtime fun even more enjoyable.The mini dress does fit most people. I'm 5'8 and 110 lbs, I wear a size small or a US 4. I want to say anywhere from an XS to an XL could wear this. The straps felt weird on me, they almost felt too short and slightly tight.Really this mini is on fire. My husband loved it and couldn't keep his hands off me, he even commented about how soft it felt. The fishnet adds that sex appeal that's always been sexy, but I think the stripes add a little something, something to it too. The dress is durable in the sense that my nails didn't snag and nothing ripped while I was wearing it, so you can use it multiple times. If you're a bit kinkier this is a great one time use mini, the fabric is durable, but it can still be ripped fairly easily.Overall, this is one heck of a lingerie piece. It's soft, teasing, and alluring. The photos really don't do this mini dress justice. It's gorgeous and sexy and super flattering without the bra and panties on.During a promotional period I received this Lethal Dose Mini Dress  in exchange for an honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R39QUYTHIHYRPC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RL2PG04#wasThisHelpful","R39QUYTHIHYRPC","A2DCNZGZ6N78HJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DCNZGZ6N78HJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"**Pros**FoamBright colorsCool designsGreat handle size**Cons**packaged poorlyLength: approximately 16 inches give or take a little.These are great swords for kids. Since they're foam it cuts back on how often they get hurt. Even though they're foam they will last a LONG time with normal use from kids.I was quite impressed with the designs of the swords. They were very eye catching and each one is different and unique. They range from simple knight swords to extravagant ninja swords. I love the details on the swords and the bright colors they used.My 3 year old son has had a blast with these. The handles are great for him and will still allow him to grow and continue to use them for quite a bit longer. He's been afraid of the dark recently, but he takes a sword to bed with him every night so he can get the monsters if he needs to, I love that. I love that he's able to explore his imagination further and have some active fun sword fighting with daddy.The only thing I found wrong with them is that they're packaged tightly in plastic. They're so tightly fit that the swords were curved in the plastic. When I took them out some of the designs had come unglued on the swords and there was a little piece of foam that had been torn as well. Nothing major and some that is fixable with a little glue. I just wish they weren't so tight in the plastic.Overall, these would make great party favors or just some family fun.

"I love when authors can capture the right amount of information in a novella without rushing anything. This was nicely paced. You get to know the characters even with the action scenes and the oh so steamy scenes.I love shifter romances where they find their mate and this one didn't disappoint. It was packed with flirting, a strong willed heroine and a man who desires to love and protect his mate. Their steamy scenes were packed with desire, some fun flirting, and even a delicious role playing scene.I was quite disappointed that he never mentioned his story to Marie, at least not where we got to see. I think that's fairly important since he was married before. I hope he told her.Overall, this is a great short story to get a shifter romance fix in. You wont be left disappointed after reading it. Plus, it's a standalone so there's not any crazy cliff hangers.

"**Pros**Great sizeSeals greatMicrowave/dishwasher safe**Cons**FlimsyIf you're in to meal planning or just portion control these are good containers. They have two compartments. The small compartment fits 1 cup of food and the large compartment holds 2 cups of food.I ran into a problem with them, it was minor for me. The containers were stuck together almost sealed together. I had to break them apart with my fingernail. I thought I had gotten them completely unsealed and started to pull them apart and ripped one of the containers because I didn't fully break the seal. My fault, but be careful if you buy these.They are extremely light and thin plastic. They are quite flimsy (or what they say is flexible) and the reason why I docked a star. After it cracking on me from pulling the containers apart and how thin they are I feel they're flimsy. I've only used them for one week though.I love that they're microwave safe so I can prep my meals for the week and then heat them up each day. Plus they're dishwasher safe which saves me time and money.The best thing about these containers is that they seal fantastically. I didn't test them with liquids, but I know the lids sealed. Plus the individual containers didn't seal completely, but it's still marked off so steam stays in the appropriate compartment. This was great when I had piping hot potatoes and a cold salad. The hot rice steam stayed on its side and the salad stayed cool.Overall, these are good starter containers. They're quite affordable and will last a good amount of time if you take care of them. Just be cautious the first time you pull them apart.During a promotional period I received these two compartment containers at a discount in exchange for an honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RC2TVUXPZQOFP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0125PUQVA#wasThisHelpful","RC2TVUXPZQOFP","A2DCNZGZ6N78HJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DCNZGZ6N78HJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"**Pros**SoftComfortableCozyLovely designHolds up well**Cons**LOW cutThe shirt is *slightly* baggy on me, but it's completely my fault and it isn't that bad. The shirt fits TRUE to size. If you go by the s, m, l, xl size order what you normally would. I suggest going by the measurements because they are extremely accurate. When I ordered I looked at the USA size, I wear a size 4 so I ordered a medium even though I normally order smalls and the measurements for a small are close to what I am. You can really see the bagginess I'm talking about in the left chest area of my photo, on the elephants, and in the back around the armpits, it's not bad, but if you like your shirts to fit snug (not tight) then order based on the measurements.The shirt is a beautiful dark navy blue with the vibrant white elephant design. It's really a beautiful calming print. I love the shirt it's definitely pretty and very comfortable. However, it is extremely low cut for a shirt. If you like a little more coverage you can always put a white/navy tank top under it or even a white/navy lace camisole.To wash the shirt just wash it like you normally would. There's very little to no shrinking, at least I didn't notice any.Overall, this is a lovely and comfortable shirt just be aware of how low it dips in the front.During a promotional period I received this shirt at a discount in exchange for an honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2R5SKM8PO90YD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IFRVNSI#wasThisHelpful","R2R5SKM8PO90YD","A2DCNZGZ6N78HJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DCNZGZ6N78HJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Whether it's dressy or casual this necklace is a great accessory. It has an extender so you can wear it with any length neckline. I've included a photo to show the shortest length and the longest length setting.The only thing I found to be a problem is the clasp is attached to a slightly larger ring and the ring isn't welded closed so it does come apart fairly easily. It broke on me the second time I wore it. However, it's an easy fix by closing the ring back up.

The fabric is chiffon, which makes it lightweight and comfortable. You can get a lot of use out of this wearing it from spring to fall.I'm 5'8 and wear a size US small or a size 4 so I ordered the US 4 (Asian M).

"**Pros**FeminineComfortableGreat color**Cons**NoneI usually order a size small, but I read other reviews and decided to go up a size. I'm glad I did. A size medium fits perfectly. If you're a tiny size small then I'd suggest sticking with a small, but if you're an average small, you might want to go up to a medium.The shirt is absolutely beautiful and flattering. Very feminine with the lace sleeves. The fabric is soft and comfortable. It's very breathable without being too thin. I ordered this in Fuchsia and think it's a bit more pink than purple as you can see in the pictures, but the color is bright, vivid, and absolutely perfect for an extra feminine touch.Of course the sleeves are lace, which means you can see your bra straps, a nude color bra blends in well. If you decide to wear a strapless bra or one with straps you should take note of how high it is in the back and the shape of it. My bra sits evenly on my back (it doesn't ride up or down), if you look in the picture of the back of the shirt the lace is lower so you can see the strap of my bra, I'm sure this wont happen for all of my bras because some of them are designed differently. I could also adjust the shirt up so it covers the bra, but that could become annoying as the day/night goes on. Also, the tag will most likely need to be cut out.To wash the shirt I placed it in a lingerie bag to avoid damaging the lace and washed it like a normally do with all my clothes, no special. There was very minimal shrinking, not enough for me to notice at all.Overall, this is a pretty shirt that has a unique touch with the lace. I think it could be worn casual or dressy.

"**Pros**SexyFunPretty**Cons**One sizeThese are NOT crotchless. They do have cute little cut outs around on the butt, but that's it. The material is a type of lace and the front part is mesh/spandex. It's all fairly see through, though there is a double layer at the crotch.I love how beautiful these are, they're fun and sexy. The colors are vibrant and flattering. The design on the back is gorgeous. Be careful with the lace so your fingernails don't rip them, though. These undies definitely spice things up. They're great for adding a little something to the bedroom or just to make yourself feel nice.The only downside I found is that they're currently listed as one-size. I'm a size small and they sort of fit, I can definitely see them fitting up to a size large, but not anything above that. They're really designed to fit a size medium. I ran into a few problems with a size small. My butt is flat so I couldn't fill the lace out. I included a picture and you can definitely see that on the right hand side. I think a size large would also run into problems being a slightly tight, not uncomfortably so, but not a sexy feel. Another thing is that the front isn't low cut. I thought with such sexy underwear it would be a little more flattering in the front, this is probably just a size small problem, but still something to take note of.Overall, these panties are quite sexy and pretty, but be cautious on the one-size.During a promotional period I received this pair of panties at a discount in exchange for an honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3EAB3S754KHZW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YRNG6O0#wasThisHelpful","R3EAB3S754KHZW","A2DCNZGZ6N78HJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DCNZGZ6N78HJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"**Pros**LuxuriousBeautifulFlatteringVersatile**Cons**Slightly see throughThis is a beautiful dress that can be worn for many occasions. I ordered a size small, I'm 5'8 and 110 lbs. I was worried that it would be too short since most dresses are short on me. However it came to mid-thigh, so it was perfect.The material feels luxurious, it's like a silk spandex. It's thin and breathable, this is both good and bad. It's good because it helps make the dress comfortable. However, it's thin, which means it's slightly see through, you can definitely see your bra and panty lines through so plan accordingly when wearing this dress.I love the pretty design, it makes the dress flattering by giving you a nice shape and slightly hiding the areas you don't want accented. It can definitely be accessorized to help give the dress different looks. I love how versatile it is.

" 1:13 Mins**Pros**Easy to useDurableSensitive controlsComes with a memory cardFully equipped**Cons**NoneSome assembly is required before using this drone, it is not ready to fly right out of the box. You have to attach the camera, legs, and blade guards. A small screwdriver was provided. The camera is attached to the battery cover so the camera will always be on it while flying even if you don't want to use the camera. Spare blades and screws were provided. You will need 4 AA batteries for the remote. Assembly only takes a couple minutes if this is your first drone, less if you know what you're doing and not reading the instructions for everything.This is our first time being around a drone, let alone flying one. I recorded the first flight so you can see from the drones point of view the first flight. It was much easier than we expected, but it was also not a great flight. It will take a lot of practice to fly it perfectly. One thing I can definitely say to be mindful of is landing, you have to be mindful on your throttle especially on decreasing altitude, you have to pull back the throttle slowly or the drone will drop out of the air.The controls are extremely sensitive so be careful. You aren't playing an intense video game where you have to move the joystick as far as it'll go to avoid being shot. The remote for this drone moves at the slightest touch! This is great for those who get the hang of flying.We flew it around a few times, never really testing the range of it because we aren't confident enough with it yet. I'll come back in a month or two after getting the hang of it and really put some specs in. However, after using it a few times I can say this drone is extremely durable. We've had several hard landings, one that practically crash landed and the drone was perfectly fine.The video on the drone is awesome. I love that it comes with the memory card so you can get started right away. The video clarity is decent. This drone comes fully equipped with everything you need to fly the drone and to record. Plus it comes with a USB drive that you plug the memory card into so you can upload your photos and videos to the computer.My only suggestion when buying this drone is read the instructions first and make sure you have an idea of what you are doing. Then take small test drives, just going up and landing. Then build from there, rotating, turning, etc... It's not hard to fly, but it takes a bit to wrap your mind around how to maneuver it.Overall, I think this is an excellent drone for beginners. It's easy to use and you'll get better with practice. It comes with everything you need to fly and record.During a promotional I received this Zuzo Drone at a discount in exchange for an honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R22NGAL8AHQG0V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XPWXYDK#wasThisHelpful","R22NGAL8AHQG0V","A2DCNZGZ6N78HJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DCNZGZ6N78HJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"**Pros**PrettyStretchyBreathableFlattering**Cons**Shows all flawsThin/see throughI was excited about ordering this dress. It looked flattering in the pictures, but I was worried about the length and that it would be too dressy. When it arrived I immediately tried it on and wanted to sleep in it, lounge in it, and wear it everywhere. It's super, super comfortable. I don't think it's too dressy that you can't wear it out and about. I definitely think you can wear this dress for many occasions depending on how you accessorize.I'm 5'9, which is fairly tall. Most maxi dresses don't even reach my ankles so I was nervous about this dress, but it hit my feet perfectly and looks wonderful, whether you're barefoot, in flats, or heels. I'd say anyone over 6' might want to pass this dress up if you want it to hit the right length.The dress is beautiful. It gives an illusion of a nice hour glass figure, whether you have one or not. It's incredibly stretchy so it should fit a lot of people, I would say it could fit anyone from a size 0 to a size 12. For reference when viewing the photos, I wear a size 4.The dress is breathable, you're not likely to get hot and sweaty in this dress. The downside to this is, it's so breathable because it's extremely thin, nearly see through. I want to warn the curvy ladies who might buy this dress that it gets even more see through the more it stretches. This wouldn't be a bad thing if the back of the dress had the black hour glass shape to it too, but it doesn't, it's all white. I couldn't put any underwear on because it showed through,, white, beige, thong, seamless, everything showed.I'm not flawless so I did have one more con, this dress is flattering and helps give illusions, however it does show flaws. I have a little loose skin around my stomach from having a baby and my flat butt is droopy and you can notice that in the dress. It's flattering, but it doesn't make those around you blind.Overall, this is a beautiful dress that gave me a nice confidence boost, but could use some improving.During a promotional period I received this dress at a discount in exchange for an honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RVIDG5I98M924/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0113LEEBU#wasThisHelpful","RVIDG5I98M924","A2DCNZGZ6N78HJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DCNZGZ6N78HJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"**Pros**GorgeousClassicGreat size**Cons**Band too thickThis ring isn't likely to look bad on anyone. It's a great size, so much so that it doesn't matter if you have thin or thicker fingers, it'll still look amazing. The ring has a classic look and feel to it. There are little stones that are tightly set in the front half of the ring and the larger stone is round and sparkly.The only thing I dislike about the ring is how thick is it.

"**Pros**Real roseBeautifulGreat gift**Cons**Foliage under roseLooks like stickers instead of dippedThis really is a beautiful rose. It is NOT glass, this is a real rose that has been dipped to preserve it. I was impressed with how gorgeous it is. They've kept the thorns on it and the details of the edges of the leaves are still sharp. The colors are authentic (outside of the gold stem) and vibrant.The rose feels like a real rose, it's very light and has a stunning award winning center point. The petals are opened up as if it's in full bloom, but not to the point that it's about to wilt.The only thing I wasn't impressed with is the foliage under the rose. There are leaves there that don't look authentic at all. It looks like they put stickers on the rose. I was not impressed with that part.Overall, the rose really is beautiful and the foliage is rarely seen so it's not that big of a deal. This rose would make a fantastic anniversary gift, mother's day gift, Valentine's gift, or even a just because rose. This would also make a beautiful replication for the Beauty and The Beast rose.During a promotion I received this DuraRose in exchange for an honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1FQEFC3YXX45J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00THP44M4#wasThisHelpful","R1FQEFC3YXX45J","A2DCNZGZ6N78HJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DCNZGZ6N78HJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"**Pros**Strong and durableFlexibleGreat sizeHand gripsLaunches farCarrying case**Cons**NoneWow! This is a ton of fun! Great for kids, but a ton of fun for teenagers and college students, the most fun for dads!I was surprised by the quality and presentation of this launcher. It comes in a nice carrying bag with a handle so that nothing hurts the straps of the launcher and it makes it easy to store. The cables of the launcher stretch really far, but aren't flimsy, they're strong and durable.We weren't trying to launch the balloons as far as they would go because we were entertaining our three year old, but even with a little pull back these things got 200-300 feet. we attached each handle to our hammock stand, which was very useful for this, but I think to get the 200 yards you would need 3 people to pull in the correct directions to get it to go super far.The hammock of the launcher is a great size and great quality. It'll hold water balloons or small vegetables, pumpkins, watermelons, potatoes, etc... The quality is great that I don't think it can break unless you're abusive to it.Overall, this launcher is a ton of fun. You can create a lot of games using this, wreck some havoc, or just show off.During a promotional period I received this launcher at a discount in exchange for an honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RA07JGYVAGMC6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YU62882#wasThisHelpful","RA07JGYVAGMC6","A2DCNZGZ6N78HJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DCNZGZ6N78HJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"**Pros**Doesn't get stuckBrightBig (13 inches)Lots of fun**Cons**LoudBattery eaterDo you have a friend that you love annoying to death and love spoiling their child? Then this is the perfect gift for them!The fun stuff first. This toy is about 13 inches long so it's good size toy that would be great for babies that are crawling all the way up to about 5-7 years old depending on their maturity and toy preference. The music is catchy and will keep a kid moving and having fun. The light are entertaining and bright, they look 3D in person like the star glob is floating in the train. Plus the lights flash with the music. The best part is, the train never gets stuck against a wall, it bumps into it and immediately spins and keeps moving until it hits something and then it rotates again. Wonderful toy to keep a child entertained.The annoying stuff now. The lights are extremely bright, if you're kid wants the lights in the house off to have fun with this toy then expect to see strobe light quality flashing. The music gets does get annoying because it's so loud that it's the only thing you can hear. I have the loudest dishwasher ever made and this toy drowns that noise out. My big dog barks the first time it comes on and then goes into another room to stay away from it. Our neighbors small dog came over and hated this toy, he yapped at it before leaving the house rather quickly. I think it's so loud it hurts their ears. Plus this toy eats batteries like no other. I have rechargeable Energizer batteries that I made sure were fully charged. I put all 3 in and within 3 days the batteries were dead, I already had another set of batteries charged so I put those in and again in 3 days the train was dead. That's with about 1-2 hours a day of use, maybe more.Overall, this would make a great gift for someone else, but probably not the toy you would get for your own home until they make a volume button on the train or just lower the sound because a piece of tape covering the speaker barely helps.During a promotional period I received this train at a discount exchange for an honest review.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1D47110T86WLJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YCBBCHI#wasThisHelpful","R1D47110T86WLJ","A2DCNZGZ6N78HJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DCNZGZ6N78HJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"**Pros**Large PackGreat lengthConnectors providedBright glowLasts 6-12 hours**Cons**NoneI originally got these for GISHWHES, but have found so many more uses for them than silly props. They're great for raves, the Neon Run, 4th of July, New Years, birthday parties, sleep overs, camping, homeschooling, or just to have some fun with the kiddos.This pack comes with three tubes, each tube has 100 glow sticks and 100 connectors for a total of 300 glow stick and connectors. It to me a minute to find the connectors, you have to pull all the glow sticks out and they're under them in their own little bag, but don't worry they glow sticks are in a bubble wrap pouch so it makes it easy to put back up.I love that there were connectors so you could make bracelets, necklaces, sashes, or go all out and make a skirt or something else that's extravagant... there's enough glow sticks that you could make something awesome.I have a 3 year old son so he had fun searching for the glow sticks in the dark and counting them. He also made shapes and fun designs out of them in the floor one evening. I never thought to use these in a classroom setting, but I'm sure there are a lot of things you could do with them for elementary kids to have fun and learn.There are 5 different colors, pink, orange, yellow, green, and blue. Once I cracked them they lasted about 6 to 12 hours depending on how much you crack them.Overall, I think every parent and teacher should have a pack of glow sticks. You never know when you're going to want or need them. They're great rainy day fun or just something to turn off the lights and let your kids be entertained for hours with the glow sticks.During a promotional period I received this pack of glow sticks in exchange for an honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3I4UIFQ94LB9Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0110P8Y1U#wasThisHelpful","R3I4UIFQ94LB9Q","A2DCNZGZ6N78HJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DCNZGZ6N78HJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"**Pros**Devilishly handsomeDetailsBottom straps**Cons**LargeWe needed these boot tops for my husband's halloween costume. My son is going as Jake from the Neverland Pirates and my husband is going as Hook. These boot tops pull the whole pirate costume together. They look rugged and classy on him. A female could also wear them and they would look great, too.The attention to detail is my favorite part about them, the buttons and the laces, really makes these boot tops stand out. Plus the straps on the bottom keep the tops in place and really makes it look like you're wearing boots. You put your shoe through the straps first then slide your foot down the tops into your shoes. Make sure to line the tops up to get the most out of them.The only downfall I found is that they're really big. They kept sliding down while wearing them. I have provided a picture showing where the tops should be on one leg and how they fell after 1 minute on the other leg. This is only a slight problem because you can discreetly pin the tops up by hiding the pin under the folded down part of the tops.Overall, I think these boot tops are fantastic. They're surprisingly a good quality, but shinier than I expected, I'm sure they'll dull up after wearing them a few times. If you're planning on being a pirate then these boot tops are a must, they really pull the outfit together and add that special touch to make you look great.During a promotional period, I received these boot tops in exchange for an honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R39WAF1XY58BLV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011WWD6KA#wasThisHelpful","R39WAF1XY58BLV","A2DCNZGZ6N78HJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DCNZGZ6N78HJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"**Pros**Great weightClassyDifferent sizesNice grip**Cons**CaseThis is a great set of darts especially for someone intermediate. I'm giving this set to my brother who is into darts, but doesn't know everything there is to know. He just likes to play. I'm not a professional and neither is he so I can't compare them to anything else except darts we've bought before.I was impressed with the quality. They're made really well. The seller is all about the quality of the darts and knowing exactly what you want in them. They're weight is perfect, the tip is fantastic and sharp, they're absolutely stunning. The grip is textured plastic so you can hold them firmly without worrying about your fingers slipping from sweat.There are 3 barrels provided in this case and 12 shafts (6 long and 6 short). The flight protectors are a great quality, they're a metal, and they do keep the flights square.The only thing I was disappointed with is the case. It's cheaply made and the inner lining was ripped as soon as I opened it the first time. Plus the shafts barely fit in there and the flight protectors wont stay in their slots, I had to put 3 of them under the dart tool so they don't fall out. I also had to put 2 or 3 flights under the barrels to keep them in place as well.Overall, I think this is a great beginner to intermediate set of darts. The darts are quite beautiful and fly great. The case could use a big upgrade though.During a promotional period I received this set of darts in exchange for an honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1VBLKUSUBGPAU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TWJ5XQG#wasThisHelpful","R1VBLKUSUBGPAU","A2DCNZGZ6N78HJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DCNZGZ6N78HJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"**Pros**CoolStays in placeComes off easyNo residue**Cons**The masks were hugeJust like any beauty product this isn't a quick results product. I'm half way through this package of 6 and I see a small difference, but nothing major so far. I'll post an update after my final use in the box so you can compare my first and last use in the box to see what it did for me.I have huge bags under my eyes that are hereditary and I've tried just about every under eye cream, roller, balm, mask out there to try and get them to diminish, but haven't found anything that works. I'm not 100% impressed with these masks, but I can see that they would work after many, many uses and I'm not sure if it would be worth the price in the long run.This package comes with 6 uses. My first use I put them on during the day because I was worried about something being on that delicate skin for so long and I wanted to watch it and make sure I didn't have a reaction. I kept them on for 7.5 hours and they were cool all day, they didn't move, and were only slightly bothersome, which wouldn't be a problem at night while you're sleeping. They're slightly thick/puffy when you first put them on because of the sticky residue that does it's job. However, after 7-8 hours they're fairly thin.Try to get them lined up great because the masks are huge and long when they're on your face, at least that's how they felt. They nearly reached my temples.When you take them off they just peel right off, there's no pulling or pain involved. There's also not any residue on your face, it peels completely off. My skin felt so soft and tight after removing them, just like any face mask.Overall, I think if you have major wrinkles this would be a great product to start with and tighten the skin around your eyes. I don't think it's worth it for under eye bags or dark circles, but I could change my mind about that (I still have 3 uses left and I'm using them every other night).During a promotional period I received this Oxygen Eye Mask in exchange for an honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2SAELZQUQS5M9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00U5XUVL0#wasThisHelpful","R2SAELZQUQS5M9","A2DCNZGZ6N78HJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DCNZGZ6N78HJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"**Pros**Beautiful Color, with matching tieFull neck tieLight weight**Cons**Cuffs were pretty looseTie was very longI ordered the Aqua color in a size 15 neck 32-33"" sleeve. I really needed a size 15.5 neck, but it wasn't too tight that I can't wear it. The color is beautiful. It's not too bright, but it's not dull either. The tie matches perfectly with the shirt for those gentlemen, like myself, who can't match clothes very well. I was impressed with the tie. I figured it would be a clip-on, but it wasn't. However, the tie is extremely long. I did an extravagant knot to try and get some of the length to go down, but there was still a lot of tie leftover.The fabric is light weight too keep you cool in a stuffy office, but it isn't thin. You will have to trim up some loose thread, but don't let that worry you. The seams are nice and tight. The biggest problem I found with the dress shirt is the cuffs were fairly loose for me.Overall, this makes a nice addition to any man's closet. You can wear the shirt with or without the tie. It looks great with a pair of jeans, slacks, or even under a suit jacket.During a promotional period I received this long sleeve dress shirt at a discount in exchange for an honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Z8UN7TI8G5VY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZZHCGY6#wasThisHelpful","R1Z8UN7TI8G5VY","A2DCNZGZ6N78HJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DCNZGZ6N78HJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"**Pros**12 unique colorsGlitterySmooth glideMinimal scratchingTextured gripCaps stay on end of pen**Cons**Light green color is closer to yellowYellow color is closer to orangeI've loved gel pens since I was a girl in the 90's when they were a fad. Now I find them nice to use for taking notes or writing a letter and an occasional drawing. This 12 pack is nice because it comes with 12 unique colors that include a few colors you don't see often like brown. That was really nice for some drawings and/or coloring. The ink is slightly glittery, but not obnoxious about it.The pens are lightweight, but they come with a ton of ink in them. I was pleased to find the cap stayed on the end of the pen while I was using them. Each cap has a flexible lip so you can attach it to your shirt pocket or on the spiral part of your notebook while not in use.The grip is not rubber, but there is a crosshatch textured pattern for the grip so your fingers wont slide. The gel glides on the paper smooth and the tip of the pen doesn't scratch normal paper. There was minimal scratching on thicker art paper though.The only thing I didn't like about this set of gel pens is that the light green pen color looks closer to yellow it was also hard to see while writing a to-do list, but it is great for coloring or using on black paper. Also, the yellow color I thought was closer to a golden orange color. It's something that isn't that big of a deal, but it was annoying until I got used to it.Overall, this is a great set of gel pens.

"**Pros**Earthy tonesStretchySoftNot itchy/scratchyNo shrinking**Cons**NoneMy 3 year old son loves being just like daddy, but it's so hard to find boxer-brief underwear for toddlers. I bought a different set of boxer-briefs from this seller and loved them and honestly I didn't think there would be a better pair of underwear for my son. However, this package is so much softer than the other ones. My son actually begs to wear these all the time. They're cotton, but they feel as soft as bamboo clothing. My husband was jealous and wished they had them in his size.It comes with 5 underwear in earthy tones. I really liked that because it's different than the usual bright colors that are made for toddlers. It comes with white, beige, blue, maroon, and soft green.I ordered the size 6-8 years for my 3-year-old who weighs 39 pounds and they fit perfectly. The accurate sizing is in the product description so make sure you glance at that before ordering so the underwear aren't too small.My husband is always picky about the waistband of his underwear and needing it to be soft so that's something I try to look at when buying underwear for my son, too. The waistband isn't scratchy at all, it's soft elastic and wide so it doesn't squeeze. Plus there isn't a tag in the back to tickle or scratch, it's on the side and my son hasn't asked for it to be taken off so it doesn't bother him there.Overall, this is the absolute best pair of underwear out there, especially for kids. They're comfortable and soft to wear.

"**Pros**Rich aromaOrganicStrong flavorNot bitter**Cons**NoneI am a huge fan of Marley Coffee, especially the Mystic Morning flavor. However, One Love blend has my favorite in a tie for top place. It is USDA organic, which is always a huge plus in my book. Plus they donate a portion of the sales from each bag to a cause, you can learn more about that by reading the side of the bag when you get it.The coffee itself is wonderful. It's got a nice strong, full flavor. Each person makes their coffee a specific way so I made a small cup exactly like the directions say and put it in my giant coffee cup so you could see what it looks like. It's definitely a medium blend. The aroma is absolutely intoxicating.

"**Pros**Tinker toyDurableHours of funDoesn't get stuck**Cons**NoneThis gets 5+ stars from us! My 3-year-old son adores this truck. It really is a great tinker toy that helps you learn how to focus on specific tasks. There is so much stuff you can do with this truck that it will provide many, many hours of fun.I love that the hood opens and you can use a tool to take the engine out and 'fix' it. Plus the tires come off so you can teach about rotating tires and fixing flats. It's the perfect toy to take outside when mom/dad is working on the car and your son/daughter wants to help.The truck requires 3 AA batteries (not included). This allows the truck to play music and to move. There are two buttons on the bottom of the truck, one for sound and one to make the truck move. You don't have to have both one, which means you can let the truck move without playing music or you can play music without the truck moving, or you can have it move and play music. I think this is a unique and much needed feature especially if you have younger kids that nap and your older child still wants to play, you can just turn the music off and let him/her play. It also comes with one power tool that requires 2 AAA batteries (included).I am really impressed with the movement of the truck. My son hasn't been able to get it stuck at all. As soon as it hits something it just spins and continues on. This is a great design feature to help little kids keep from getting frustrated.Overall, this truck is absolutely phenomenal.

"Out of the fires of Orodruin, and forgotten for many centuries, the One Ring has passed unto me. I have had the pleasure of purchasing this artifact from a merchant for far below it's worth, in exchange I agreed to let my opinions of this Ring be known to the world*. I believe it may be safe to say this merchant knew not of the treasure they traded away.Unlike the other great rings, the One Ring holds no gem and has no intricate designs on it, at least at first glance. However on closer inspection you can see in elven runes on both the inside and outside of the ring, and in the language of the black speech the words (translated into English):One Ring to rule them all, One Ring to find them,One Ring to bring them all and in the darkness bind them.As the Ring has traveled from the realm of Middle Earth, it has lost some of it's magical properties. Since I have been in possession of it, I have not turned invisible or seen the invisible (wraiths or otherwise). The Ring has remained the same size from the time I have bore it to present, without it leaving me of it's own will. And I have not felt the presence of any other ring bearers. I will say that I have had a strong urge to keep it and the thought of losing it troubles me greatly.I have not verified Isildur's research by testing the mettle of this Ring, nor would I wish any harm to come upon it. But after several days of wearing and normal hand washing, it appears to have not changed in the slightest.When I first donned this Ring, it fit well as the merchant described it's size accurately, but it weighed my hand down with a weight I was not accustomed to. It is, however, becoming a natural weight to me, although quite a bit heavier than my wedding band. It is also fairly thick too, but not too much to be troublesome. If, for whatever reason, if this Ring didn't fit or was uncomfortable, a chain secured around the neck will keep this close to the heart at all times.All in all, I believe I will keep my precious for quite some time.*During a promotional period I received this ring at a discount in exchange for an honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3858BBQWW61O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00F3ZK14W#wasThisHelpful","R3858BBQWW61O","A2DCNZGZ6N78HJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DCNZGZ6N78HJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"**Pros**StylishThin Material**Cons**StiffNot wide enoughHard to put onToo tight (not tall enough)Let me start by saying, we're a barefoot family. We have extremely healthy feet because we rarely wear shoes. However, we do know shoes are a tool. When the blacktop is too hot to walk barefoot, it's great to put shoes on. Since my son has only worn shoes a dozen times in his 3 years of life he has really wide feet, nicely spaced toes, and a high arch, which makes finding shoes difficult.Shoes should be flexible to move with the natural movements of your feet, they should be comfortable, not tight and not loose. These shoes were none of those things. My son wears a size 9.5 shoe, so I ordered a size 10. As soon as I got them I thought they were absolutely adorable. Then I pulled them out of the box and immediately tried to bend them frontwards and backwards and they were so stiff. I held out hope that maybe it was just because they were new and I should try to work them in. I did that for a bit, but didn't feel like they loosened up any.We had to do some errands so I let my son wear them out. I forgot to take a picture of them as soon as he put them on so you get a picture after a day of going out and getting them nice and dirty. They were extremely hard to put on over the top part of his feet because the tops of his feet are really tall, I had to stretch them as far as they could go and still had to (unfortunately) shove his foot into it. When they were on he had a difficult time walking in them because they were so stiff. He has never stumbled (except when he was learning to walk), but these shoes had him tripping a few times. After a couple hours of wearing them we came home and he immediately wanted them off, but couldn't take them off himself because they were so tight. When I pulled them off there were indents on his feet from the shoes squeezing his feet.Overall, I think the shoes are cute, but they're not for our family. I do not think they made these shoes with the health of your feet in mind.During a promotional period I received these toddler shoes at a discount in exchange for an honest review.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R37SX4P0WASTFN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FF47FLS#wasThisHelpful","R37SX4P0WASTFN","A2DCNZGZ6N78HJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DCNZGZ6N78HJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"**Pros**LightHas some giveGreat sizeEasy to maneuverDurable**Cons**Too FlexibleI have a small 2 foot deep by 10 feet long pool for my son and we have a ton of trees in our yard so there's always bugs and leaves getting in it. Plus he likes to get out and back in with grass all over his feet. That's a good amount of water to drain frequently so I thought a pool skimmer net would be a good investment.This net is nice because you can use it with or without a pole. The buttons on the skimmer to attach to a handle are easy to press. However, I don't have a pole because my pool is so small. I really liked that the outer plastic edge was thinner than most net skimmers. This helps brush it against the sides or the bottom of the pool and actually get more gunk out. The net is very fine mesh that got out the smallest of dirt and bugs from the pool. I appreciated how much give the net has. If you look at the pictures you can see it isn't pulled tight against the net, there's what looks like ripples in the mesh, that's how much give it has. My 3-year-old son wanted to help clean the pool so I let him use the net skimmer and it held up against his abuse without any problems at all.The only downside I did find was that even though it's flexible so that it bends just a little as you move it through the water, it was so flexible it bent at one point. I was able to bend it back like you would a spoon after digging out frozen ice cream.

"**Pros**Great size6 decks of cardsFun cardsMy son had a blast**Cons**Flimsy box**Card Measurements**2.25 inches by 3.5 inchesThis is a great buy! There are 6 card games, where the cards are designed specifically for that game. The cards are easy to understand and made with kids in mind by using shapes, colors, fruits, and obvious different designs to make it easier for the kids and less frustration for the parents trying to explain everything. Don't worry if you don't know how to play the games, each deck comes with instructions.These games are designed for ages 4 and up. My son is 3 and he was able to play the 'Fish' game and the 'Memory Match' game, but the others were just out of his grasp so we'll wait another 6-12 months for those.I really liked the size of the cards, they were perfect for his little hands and they felt fine in my hands too. The cards aren't laminated completely likes some kids cards, but they are coated like regular decks of cards. Just remind your little ones to not bend the cards.The only downside I found was the little boxes they come in are super flimsy. They were bent the first time I opened them and I don't expect them to hold up long with my son. The good thing about this is, it's an easy fix, you can store the cards in ziploc bags or pencil boxes.Overall, I am completely satisfied with these decks of cards. My son has had fun playing games with momma and daddy and he'll be able to play them for many years to come.During a promotional period I received 6 decks of card games in exchange for an honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1WKSVYXLN8CEW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YH60L7U#wasThisHelpful","R1WKSVYXLN8CEW","A2DCNZGZ6N78HJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DCNZGZ6N78HJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"**Pros**True to sizeLight weightYear-round tanksSuper stretchy**Cons**NoneI got the 4 pack of tank tops, which means the colors are random. I kind of like the surprise of not knowing what I'm getting, it was a good way to surprise myself. However, it would be nice if we could choose the colors. I really like these tank tops and would love a black and white one, but don't want to buy the whole set. In my set I received a beautiful bright blue, orange, soft green, and purple.The tank tops are lightweight and thin. You can wear them by themselves in the summer or use them to layer in the winter. They fit true to size. I was debating getting a small or medium. I usually wear a size small (size 3), but I looked at the sizing chart and decided to get a medium since they aren't pre-shrunk. They're slightly big, just like a medium fits on me so choose the size you normally wear. If you're still worried that your normal size might be a tiny bit small, don't worry, these tank tops are incredibly stretchy. I wasn't worried about shrinking so I washed and dried them and didn't really see much shrinkage.The best part about these tank tops is that I can wear them with any bra since they aren't racerback and the straps don't need to cross.Overall, I like these tanks a lot. I've been wearing them outside while I work in the flowerbed and I don't sweat as quickly in them. They're great for year round and would make a great addition to anyone's wardrobe.During a promotional period I received a four pack of tank tops at a discount in exchange for an honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R16BT7PESK3HXR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZDIS6YG#wasThisHelpful","R16BT7PESK3HXR","A2DCNZGZ6N78HJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DCNZGZ6N78HJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"**Pros**2 size dustersMicrofiber- soft & scratch freeEasy to cleanVersatileHolds the dustDurable**Cons**NoneI'm a microfiber fanatic! Its so soft and cleans really well. This set comes with two dusters and a bag to hold them in. The two dusters come in unique sizes; a glove that you wear and a long bendable slim duster.I really love the long duster. It helped me reach some picture frames that were out of reach for me. You can bend it and dust the tops of your door frame without any problems. Plus the cover comes off of it so you can throw it in the washer. It's really easy to put back on as well.The glove is my favorite though. It probably wont fit a large hand without the palm sticking out. I have medium size hands and they fit just right in the glove. I liked this duster the best because when I was cleaning the car I could use the tips of my fingers to get in the crevices.I used this on my car first and loved how well it cleaned so much that I brought it inside and started dusting everything: doors, top of microwave, radio, bookshelf, dressers, computers, etc... Just because in the title it says car, doesn't mean you have to use it there. These dusters are phenomenal. They grab the dust and dirt locking it on the microfiber tentacles and doesn't let go.Overall, these dusters are a great investment. They'll save you money because they're durable and washable, they'll save you time since you can use the long one to reach just about any space without needing a stool. Plus, kids love them so you can recruit help with the cleaning.During a promotional period I received this duster set in exchange for an honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3BLNQ3YHYXODW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WFSFLR2#wasThisHelpful","R3BLNQ3YHYXODW","A2DCNZGZ6N78HJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DCNZGZ6N78HJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"**Pros**Easier than false lashesLong Lasting!!!Creates gorgeous lashes**Cons**Fiber gets everywhereThis is how I did my lashes:1. Apply gel (the black end) to lashes with one single sweep to wet lashes and spread them evenly.2. Immediately apply fiber (beige end) to lashes.3. Apply one more coat of gel to lashes.4. Brush off fiber from face.This was my first time using any type of fiber lash mascara so I had no idea what to expect. I've seen so many posts on how amazing fiber lash mascara is, but it's taken me a while to jump on board. I was pleasantly surprised by how easy it is to apply. It's basically like putting on regular mascara, it does take an extra 10-15 seconds to do.I have used a ton of different mascaras, every drugstore brand, Lorac, and what was my favorite Urban Decay, but I've noticed with each of them, by the end of the day my lashes have drooped, they're no longer curled up giving me that bright eyed look. This fiber lash mascara, honestly, lasted ALL day! My lashes had very minimal drooping. I even slept in it one night and woke up without it smudged at all.I was very impressed that the mascara gel wasn't goopy and it didn't clump my lashes together at all. The gel is tinted black so you don't need any other mascara unless your lashes are extremely fair. I love the brush, it's one of the best brushes I've used, it separates my lashes really well. The fiber brush was odd to me, it was just the stem with fiber coating it, there wasn't any bristles or anything.You can't use regular face wash to get the mascara off, I tried, and it just smudged it all around my eyes. You do need an eye makeup remover. I use a generic kind from the supercenter and it took the mascara off without any problems.I have included pictures to show my lashes without any mascara (before) and what my lashes look like after applying this fiber lash mascara (after). The only problem I found with the mascara is that the fiber gets everywhere and I would assume any fiber mascara would do this, but I wasn't expecting that since this was my first time using it. The fiber is not tinted so you can wipe it away without an marks getting on you. I've included a photo to show what the fiber looks like when it drops on your face.Overall, I adore this mascara. I like wearing false lashes, but it would cost a lot to wear them daily so I only wear them for special occasions. However, with this fiber lash mascara, I can get that extra oomph without the extra cost.During a promotional period I received this fiber lash mascara in exchange for an honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RXAB5OTN228T0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00V593AR0#wasThisHelpful","RXAB5OTN228T0","A2DCNZGZ6N78HJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DCNZGZ6N78HJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"**Pros**DeliciousHealthy3-year-old approvedGoes with everything**Cons**NoneThis is delicious peanut butter. The quality is outstanding and tastes so fresh. The flavor is Butter Toffee, which adds a touch of sweetness to it. It's not sickly sweet, just sweet enough to give it some flavor.I'm impressed with how healthy it is. Comparing it to a container of regular peanut butter makes you never want to go back. There aren't any preservatives in this peanut butter, which means when you first open it up it's going to look soupy. Don't fret, just stir it for a good minute or two and it'll mix up and turn creamy. If you don't want to do this each time you open it then I suggest storing it in the fridge. I keep mine in the fridge and it stays creamy without turning soupy or hardening.My son loves this peanut butter! He has asked for it on his crackers, bananas, toast, pancakes, apples, and pbj. The other night I made some sugar cookies and decided to mix in some of this peanut butter and was pleasantly surprised by how great the cookies tasted! Hands down one of my top five favorite cookies ever!Overall, I'm pleased with this peanut butter. I feel good about serving it to my family and know they love it.

"**Pros**LovelyExtenderAccurate modelGoes with everything**Cons**NoneThis is a lovely necklace of the dopamine molecule. Dopamine is associated with the pleasure center, which makes this a fun necklace to give to your girlfriend or wife.The necklace came in a pretty little gift bag.  After taking it out of the bag I checked the chain because I'm always nervous about the quality of necklace chains. The chain on this necklace is light, but after some examination and putting on and off the necklace a few times I feel like it will hold up for a while. It's definitely not the best quality, but it's not a cheap chain either. Plus there's a 3 inch extender section so you can make the necklace shorter or longer depending on the style of shirt/dress you're wearing.The necklace can go with anything, whether you want to add a little nerdy touch to your prom dress or you want to wear it with a tank top and shorts.Overall, I think this necklace is beautiful.

"**Pros**LightweightComfortableVersatileStylish**Cons**""Belt""**Size**Should fit most people between a US size 2-14People under 5'3 these might be a bit longAnyone over 5'9 these might be too shortI am always hesitant about buying pants online because I can rarely find any that fit me. I wear a size 4 long (height 5'9) and these pants fit perfectly when worn on my hips. If I wear them any higher they become too short though.They're a beautiful black color with a slight shimmer in them. The pants consist of two layers and inner layer and an outer layer. The inner layer is black without any shimmer, but it's very thin and see through. The outer layer is black with the shimmer and extremely thin and see through. Together you can't see through them unless they whip in the wind, but don't worry you can't see your underwear through them unless you wear something extremely bright like neon yellow.The waist of the pants is elastic, which is how it's made for a one size fits all. There is a belt with the pants, but it does not help cinch the pants up, it's there purely for decoration purposes. I, personally, thought the belt was not needed and quite ugly. It reminds me of something that would come with draperies. Plus it's so long I had to wrap it around my waist twice. After having the belt on there for a couple of days I've now taken it off and love the pants even more.To wash them I suggest putting them in a delicates bag in the washer then hanging them to dry.The pants are super cute and can be dressed up or down. You can tuck the shirt in or keep it out, either way will be stylish. Plus it would make a great beach cover up. I prefer to wear the pants with tank tops tucked in for more of a hippie look. I definitely think these are spring/summer pants, They're way to thin to wear in the cooler months.Overall, I love these pants. I wear them everywhere!

"**Pros**Super softAbsorbentCleans hands/mouthGreat for bath timePerfect size for little hands**Cons**None**Measurements**12 inches by 4 inches (about an inch thick)My son absolutely adores this hand towel. When I pulled it out of the package he gasped and said, ""So cute!"" I placed the towel in the kitchen next to my towel and he takes the extra time to dry his hands off because it's almost like a toy. He thinks the little fabric pieces are funny and tickle him.When it was time for bath the other night he went to the towel and asked to take it with him. I thought he might want to use it to cover his eyes while I wash his hair, but that wasn't the case. He wanted to play with it and use it to wash his body. It worked just like any other hand towel would except it doubled as a bath toy, plus we played like the panda was tickling him. I know it wasn't designed for bath use, so it use that way with caution.If you use it in the bath I suggest wringing it out really well and hanging it to dry afterwards. I washed and dried it by placing it in a delicates bag and it held up perfectly.I love the colors of the panda towel, the purple is very vibrant and bold. The stitching is fantastic on the panda and hidden on one side. The loop is perfect to hang on a hook or to loop it through the panda to hold on to a bar. I'm a huge fan of microfiber because it is deceptively soft.Overall, if your child doesn't take the time to dry their hands or they want a fun bath washer, I would highly recommend this hand towel. Plus when your child out grows the towel, microfiber is fantastic to clean/dust with so you'll have it for many, many years.During a promotional period I received this kids hand towel in exchange for an honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2QUBH1067OOTF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VJITQK2#wasThisHelpful","R2QUBH1067OOTF","A2DCNZGZ6N78HJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DCNZGZ6N78HJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"**Pros**Deceptively sharpFits great in handScissors have large hand areaScissors are sharpHolder is adjustableAffordable**ConsFlimsy holder for scissorsEvery kitchen needs a quality set of knives. I have a ton of stainless steel knives in my knife drawer, but ever since I got this set of ceramic knives I've reached for them every single time I need a knife.There are four sizes of knives (6, 5, 4, and 3 inches). I really wish the largest knife had been an 8 inch blade, but the 6 inch is decent and can be used for most things. The blades are ceramic so you have to be mindful of not bending the knives while cutting your food. Plus the ceramic blade is sharp, deceptively sharp and wont need to be sharpened.The downside to them being ceramic is you cannot use a glass or marble cutting board. I have invested in a set of rubbery plastic cutting boards and have since put my marble board up. Also, the knives are not dishwasher safe, but they're super easy to clean. Food doesn't stick to them plus they're white so you can see if they're truly clean. Please be careful while cleaning the knives, I nearly cut through my sponge because I was cleaning them how I would any other knife.The knives are very comfortable in the hand. They have a rounded handle that fits great in your palm. Plus there's an extended piece over the blade by your fingers so you don't cut yourself while holding the knife. The holder for the knives is phenomenal. You can move each knife holder to slant at an angle or stand up straight. I love this because it lets you customize how you want to set it up in your kitchen.The bonus pair of scissors is absolutely wonderful. They have a big handle so your fingers can fit easily. The blades are super sharp and can cut thin strips of meat. I do have to say the holder for the scissors is quite flimsy and I can see it bending if you aren't careful.Overall, I think this knife set will outlast any stainless steel woodblock set.During a promotional period I received this knife set at a discount in exchange for an honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2C3F74ULOCOGR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VBS17OI#wasThisHelpful","R2C3F74ULOCOGR","A2DCNZGZ6N78HJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DCNZGZ6N78HJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"**Pros**AffordableGreat Quality10 cards/10 envelopesPostcard sizeBeautiful**Cons**NoneWhat a perfect Father's Day card set. It comes with 10 cards, 5 of each design. The red card is very much for a father figure. However the peach/cream card could be sent to anyone, which makes this set even more perfect.The cards are smaller than most greeting cards, but I found I liked the small size better. They're 3.5 inches by 5 inches and were perfect for my son to draw (write) on. The quotes on the front aren't sappy, but they are sentimental and convey how much you appreciate your father/husband/grandpa.The quality of the cards is exceptional. I was afraid they would be like folded card stock, but that wasn't the case. They're thick like a greeting card you would pick up in the store.

"**Pros**Resealable bagPleasant aromaChewySweet and bitterOrganic!!!**Cons**Sticks to teethMy husband is a big snacker at work and he loves dried fruit. I've never seen Goji berries in our local store so I was excited when I found them here on Amazon. I don't really know much about Goji berries, but they smelt sort of like raisins. They had a unique taste almost salty, I think the best way to explain it is the bitterness of a cranberry and the sweetness of a raisin combined.These Morning Pep Goji berries are chewy and delicious! They're the perfect snack that you can feel safe about eating or giving to your kids because they're organic. They only have 1 ingredient, raw goji berries. You can even cook with them if you wanted to make cookies or put them on top of your salad.I really loved that they came in a resealable bag, that makes it nice for my husband to throw in his desk drawer and know that they wont spill and they'll stay fresh longer.

"My son has been asking for this jacket for months. It had to denim. It had to be Levi's brand. It had to be grey. I think he saw some character on TV wearing it. I was convinced this was no longer made. I had just about given up, when it popped up in my recommendations feed from Amazon. I was a little unsure of size since sizing was limited to Small, Medium, Large, Extra Large and this didn't sync up well with the sizing chart listed in the posting. But I went with size Medium figuring Medium typically translates to a size 10. The size was perfect, I'd say maybe a 10/12. The jacket is a heavy denim material, great for fall weather.

"I had mixed feelings about this book. Overall, it was good. I love the series and went into this book expecting greatness. This book probably had the most YA feel to it though, which was a slight let down.So, this book starts with Luminescent Juliet ready to kick off on their first big tour. Romeo, lead guitarist and band manager (and our hero from book one) decides to hire college student Peyton to tour with the band doing publicity and blogging. She is aspiring to be a writer for a rock magazine so this would be an ideal job... if it weren't for Sam. Sam, bassist for the band, is the twin brother of  Peyton's ex boyfriend from high school. When Peyton and Seth's relationship ended badly, she was destroyed, so she and Sam basically hate each other. They agree to put their past aside and get through the tour together. Like that's going to go well.Overall, the romance part of the storyline was predictable, but not in a terrible way. I did feel like the way the book handled Seth's mental illness and Sam's coping through drug use were what really made the book take on it's YA feel.  These are strong topics and could have taken a darker view, but that's tough to do in a YA book without getting too dark.  But what saved the story for me was the characters. The characters are really well written and genuinely likeable. I also really liked the attention Gabe in this book. He's been a bit of a jerk in previous books, so I was glad to see his character develop and become more likeable in preparation for his story in the next book.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R33NMKBB5N5NHE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=147784709X#wasThisHelpful","R33NMKBB5N5NHE","ASGI7E0AJ8H5X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ASGI7E0AJ8H5X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Stay With Me is book 3of the Wait For You series.  It can be read as a stand alone, but character development works better if you read the stories in order. I really wanted to love this story. I loved the previous books and had been looking forward to learning more about Calla. The storyline has a lot of potential and I was pulled in at the start, wanting to learn more about Calla's back story and how she plans to fix the mess her mother has left her in. But I soon found myself really disliking Calla. I really have no patience for stupid characters. She is beyond nave. Ok, so she is a virgin. But the way her character was written, it's like she's been living under a rock. Her virginity is used as a crutch and a free pass to excuse her stupid decisions in every aspect of her life. Plus, she didn't exactly grow up sheltered. Her naivet seems to extend not only to her comfort level in sexual situations but also to her lack of decision making around her personal safety as well. After growing up exposed to drugs, gangs, and prostitution, she still has no idea how much danger she puts herself into by living in her mother's house and poking around in her mother's sketchy dealings.  She had a drug dealer threatening her. She was attacked in her mother's ""abandoned"" home and yet she still stays there and tries to handle everything on her own. The only thing she does actually stress over (and over and over and over) is her scar and how Jax could possibly be attracted to her (even though he assures her repeatedly that he is). Halfway through the book I found myself internally yelling at her to stop whining about her scars and do something to actually protect her safety.This story is not a good representation of the author's writing, and really doesn't do the series any justice.","2.0 out of 5 stars","September 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R301AQ3H7VK5BE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062294806#wasThisHelpful","R301AQ3H7VK5BE","ASGI7E0AJ8H5X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ASGI7E0AJ8H5X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Death of Cupids is the Third book in the Blood of Cupid series. This really can't be read as a standalone and should follow Blood of Cupids (book one) and Betrayal of Cupids (book two). With this book, as with the second book, I did struggle though with whether to rate this 2 or 3 stars, but again opted for a more favorable rating to focus more on the writing style and less on my dislike of the story line.What worked:- Overall the writing was well done. I did like the way the author managed the transition from book 2 to book 3 without pages and pages of rehashing what was already written in the previous book. There were no inconsistencies between books, and the way the chapters flipped point of view between Grace and Ryan really shows each characters thinking behind what drives their actions.What I didn't like:- This just doesn't feel like a romance novel at all. The story has so much focus on revenge and anger and violence, that the love story is really lost. By this point in the series, the main characters, Grace and Ryan, are just broken. Ryan continues to waffle between whether to take a stand or cave in to whomever has his attention. It's disappointing how easily he falls under the influence of anyone with a more powerful personality. I kept rooting for him to stand up for himself, and I think that's what the author intended for the ending, but it just sort of fell flat.-  Again in this book, the ""twists"" were all really easy to see coming. And there really was more violence, revenge and anger than there was romance. And again, this series reminds me so so much of the Gypsy Brothers Series by Lili St Germain (for those who weren't bothered by the darker story line).I guess this book is intended to end the series. But it did leave some weird loose ends, so who knows. Never did find out what happened to Mark (the nurse) or Mr Muscles (from book 2), or Ryan's family. Did they die? Meh, just an blah kind of ending.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R20B9D6K662VAD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00R1OU0QM#wasThisHelpful","R20B9D6K662VAD","ASGI7E0AJ8H5X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ASGI7E0AJ8H5X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Betrayal of Cupids is the second book in a three book series. This really can't be read as a standalone and should follow Blood of Cupids (book one). It starts and ends with a cliffhanger. But luckily, the series can be read for free through Kindle Unlimited so I didn't mind so much the way it was split into parts. Each story is a pretty short, quick read. I did struggle though with whether to rate this 2 or 3 stars, but opted for a more favorable rating to focus more on the writing style and less on my dislike of the story line.What worked:- as I mentioned, this book is in no way a stand alone. But I did like the way the author picked up with book 2 after the end of book 1. There wasn't a lot of rehashing from the first novel, just enough to catch the reader up, refresh the loose ends, and then jump right into the drama of book 2.- the writing is decent. there are no major grammatical errors and context flows pretty clearlyWhat I didn't like:- So this book just didn't work for me. If I thought book one was dark, this story is much MUCH darker. The main characters, Grace and Ryan, became even more twisted and angry. For a guy that grew up in an MC club, Ryan is really kind of a wuss. He keeps whining that he doesn't want to be part of the club, and he reinforces that every time he refuses to step up to the plate to stand up for Grace, but he also doesn't even have the guts to walk away if that's what he wants so much. And Grace, for someone who so adamantly wants to be away from the life, really seems comfortable bossing everyone around, using violence to protect anyone who gets in her way, and basically acts just like the people she wants to be away from.  Just seems like a role reversal from a typical romance novel where the man is the hero saving the woman.  Not that that's a bad message, but just not what I look for in a romance novel.-  Again in this book, the ""twists"" were all really easy to see coming. And there really was more violence, revenge and anger than there was romance.

"So this book just didn't work for me. I'm not a big fan of breaking one story into multiple parts and ending each with a cliff hanger. It feels like a cop out and aimed at charging double and triple the cost of what the story is actually worth. But in this case, I was lucky to find the entire series through Kindle Unlimited so I thankfully did not have to pay extra. Blood of Cupids is the first in the Blood of Cupids MC series. The story is much MUCH darker than your typical MC Romance novel. I wanted to like this story. I liked the premise of star crossed lovers from rival MC clubs finding each other. I liked the twists that kept intertwining Grace and Ryan's pasts. But I just didn't like Grace and Ryan. They kept making awful choices. The ""twists"" were all really easy to see coming. And there really was more violence, revenge and anger than there was romance. Book One is definitely the tamest of the 3 stories. I rated it 3 stars because it was grammatically well written and is more focused on the romance than either of the other books. This series reminded me so so much of the Gypsy Brothers Series by Lili St Germain (also not a favorite series of mine, but  those who weren't bothered by the darker story line here may like it).","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2E0ZAVCMQWKW0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KHTMFDE#wasThisHelpful","R2E0ZAVCMQWKW0","ASGI7E0AJ8H5X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ASGI7E0AJ8H5X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I've been waiting for Shade and Lily's story since the characters were first introduced in Razer's Ride (Last Riders book 1).  The author does a great job building out secondary characters. While I wasn't really into the whole BDSM part to this story, I suppose I should have seen it coming. It just felt a little forced - like the author wanted to find a way to work the topic into her series because the theme became so popular after the success of Fifty Shades of Grey.  It just didn't feel like something that Lily's character would ever be open to. Shade could have still been written as possessive and strong without being a dominant. Ms Begley should have saved that for a future book on Evie, Bliss or even worked it in with Knox and Diamond.I also don't know that Shade's Fall would work as a stand alone book. You really, really need to read the series in order to build up the suspense of wanting to see Shade and Lily finally get together. I wish we had seen more of the nice guy side of Shade. And I wish we had seen more of the fighter in Lily.Final criticism is that I wish the author would label her series better. She has several series going at once that cross pollenate characters (a good quality that sells books and has me buying books that I maybe wouldn't have found otherwise) but it wasn't as easy as just reading one series in order; you have to jump from one series to another and figure out which order to read them in. I read them in this order: Razer's Ride (Last Riders), Viper's Run (Last Riders), Knox's Stand (Last Riders), Sex Piston (Biker Bitches), and then finally Shade's Fall (Last Riders).  I guess I missed Teased (VIP Room) and Tainted (VIP Room) - which I will go back and read later. I also read Riot (Predators) a while ago  which I LOVED and didn't even make the connection to the characters that showed up at the end of Shade's Fall.Despite the criticisms, I gave this 4 stars because in the end I still love the characters, still want to read more, and will continue to follow the author as she puts out more books.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R57IQ409IY6Y1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00J47HAUS#wasThisHelpful","R57IQ409IY6Y1","ASGI7E0AJ8H5X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ASGI7E0AJ8H5X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"After reading Ms Foster's `Love Undercover' series, I was anxiously awaiting more on Yvette and Cannon and was not at all disappointed with their story. You'd think as book #1 in this new series, that the story would be able to stand on it's own, but this was really the first of Ms Foster's books that I felt needed the prequel to lay the ground work for character development. That's not a criticism, but worth noting.  To fully get into Cannon and Yvette, you really do need to read ""Dash of Peril"" from the Love Undercover series to get their history. Cannon and Yvette had SO much chemistry as supporting characters in the earlier series.  But Yvette was too young to begin a relationship, and then something horrible happened to her causing her to run off to California and leaving Cannon to dive head first into his career as a professional fighter. Now, three years later, Yvette's grandfather has died, and Cannon and Yvette are once again pulled home.Without the lure of Cannon and Yvette, I don't think I would have gravitated to a book about a professional fighter.  I had no idea what MMA (Mixed Martial Arts) and SBC (Supreme Battle Challenge) were. Had to google them for definitions. Yet, this has been my favorite of Ms Foster's books to date. Haven't read all of them yet, but I'm intrigued enough to keep reading more. The editing in her work has greatly improved. It was one of of the things that annoyed me in the last series, so I'm glad to see it has gotten better.As always, I love the way Ms Foster really spends time on building all of the characters in the story, not just the main couple. I can't wait to read more on Armie, Stack and Denver.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RYOGLLEZKTTQT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0373779046#wasThisHelpful","RYOGLLEZKTTQT","ASGI7E0AJ8H5X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ASGI7E0AJ8H5X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the last book in Lori Foster's `Love Undercover' series, telling the story of Dashiel Riske and Lieutenant Margaret ""Margo"" Peterson.  While this book can easily stand on it's own, you really get the full sense of the characters by reading the other books in the series as well. Ms Foster is has a writing style that I want to dislike, so I'm always surprised when she keeps pulling me back in. The series is very formulaic and each tale reveals a the super hot ""bad boy"" guy who can't be tied down, goes through girl after girl until he meets a somewhat reserved ""nice"" girl with a dark past. They are immediately attracted to each other and then must overcome her past, his past, multiple misunderstandings, trust issues, and any random bad guys who stand in their way in order to fall in love. It certainly is a little clich. But for some reason, it works. Until now. I really loved Dash as a side character in her other books. But I could never get into Margo. She's supposed to be this tough as nails, all business, no nonsense head of the police department. Yet in no time, Dash is walking through the police department, strolling into her office unannounced, and groping her in front of the police officers and detectives who work for her. Um, awkward.  And she always seems to get her shirt ripped off in like every altercation with criminals. I'm all for a strong female lead character, and props to Ms Foster for at least trying to add a new dynamic to her usual character development. But it just didn't work here.I would have rated this much lower, but give it 3 stars for Cannon and Yvette who show up as supporting characters and steal the show. So, while I was disappointed Dash and Margo, I am still drawn back for a new series. Can't wait to see what happens with Cannon and Yvette.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1CN4LUT3M7JQE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0373778570#wasThisHelpful","R1CN4LUT3M7JQE","ASGI7E0AJ8H5X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ASGI7E0AJ8H5X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the third story in Lori Foster's `Love Undercover' series (first was Run the Risk (Hqn), second was Bare It All (Hqn)).  While the plot does still work as a stand-alone story, I feel like you need the character development from the first 2 books in order to develop a connection and liking to Rowdy and Avery's characters.  Without the background from the earlier stories, I can see why many reviewers think of Rowdy as a total jerk, and Avery as an idiot for falling for him.  This story follows the same basic formula as Foster's previous books where the super hot ""bad boy"" guy can get any girl he wants (and does) until he meets a somewhat reserved ""nice"" girl  with a dark past. They are immediately attracted to each other and then must overcome her past, his past, multiple misunderstandings, trust issues, and any random bad guys who stand in their way in order to fall in love.  It certainly is a little clich. But despite the formulaic writing and the overall cheesiness, I really did find myself liking the characters. I liked that there was at least an attempt at a story line outside of the steamy romance scenes. I loved the addition of Marcus and Cannon (characters we did not see in the previous 2 books).If I could wave a magic wand to improve the story, I'd wish to give Ms. Foster a better editor. I think she writes her characters well, and I like the added suspense that comes from the police cases to keep readers interested beyond just waiting for the characters to get into bed.  But the spelling and grammatical errors were really unnecessary, and there were several dialog scenes that were just so over the top cheesy that I had to skip over them entirely. There were logistical errors too where the writing would describe the surroundings that then conflicted with the descriptions in the following paragraph.  Sometimes I found myself rereading sections just to figure out what I was missing. Mostly, I just tried to let it go and move on. They were all just minor errors that any quality editor would easily see through.As for the rating, I give this 4 stars and feel like I need to explain why. First, I may have ""graded"" a little easy because I am comparing this story only against other books in this genre. If I were comparing this against all fiction books, I would have scored this lower.  I don't read a lot of Romance novels, and tend to hold them to a lower set of quality standards as ""beach reads"". Could just be that I haven't found any really great Romance novels yet and hope to find some soon.  Of the few Romance series I have read, I almost never have any interest in pursuing what happens next in the characters' lives enough to make it past the first book. But this series held my interest enough for me to keep reading.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2VKP9QMIU0S75/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0373777795#wasThisHelpful","R2VKP9QMIU0S75","ASGI7E0AJ8H5X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ASGI7E0AJ8H5X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These were my first shoes ordered through Amazon. I was super impressed with the quick shipping. I placed my order on Saturday and had the shoes in hand by Monday. These boots are a deep purple, in a creamy suede with strong purple laces to tie in back. the height hits just above the ankle and which makes it snug but not tight. I typically wear 7/7.5 and ordered these in a 38 EU/7 US.  I wasn't sure I'd like having laces in back, but it makes them roomy enough to fit with either thick socks on colder days, or thinner socks/tights for a dressier look.  The sole is a sturdy rubber and the combination of heel height and platform gives a nice height but doesn't feel too high to walk.

"Yowza this is one expensive toy!  The huge novelty of this toy is the built in camera.  This contributed a big wow factor and my son couldn't wait to tear into the package and begin filming battles. But before I get further into the camera, let's start with the blaster itself.  It works using an automatic firing  method which is why it requires batteries.  Automatic firing means that it is easier for younger kids to use because it doesn't require arm strength to pull back a handle or pump.  But, automatic firing also means It is kind of loud.  This takes away the stealth factor since you can't hide from or sneak up on your opponents, but my son and his friends didn't seem bothered at all since they were mostly running around screaming and shooting at each other. When you hold down the trigger, the blaster fires 12 darts in rapid fire.  The ammo clip and the foam darts are interchangeable  with other Nerf products so reloading was pretty standard. The blaster did jam a few times if a dart got stuck, but that is also pretty standard across Nerf toys and it's something the boys seemed to take in stride.Now back to the camera feature.  I know there are lots of people who hold pretty sophisticated battles that they film and upload to YouTube. I've seen a lot of feedback commenting on the poor quality of the camera, audio, etc.  For us though, we play with Nerf just for fun, not a sport or official league playing.  My son is 10. He holds mini-battles with his friends in the backyard.  For these kids, having a camera was a super cool feature and the boys were just scrambling over who got to film each battle. Then I uploaded the video and camera footage to my laptop and the boys were in fits of laughing with the fun of it all.  I will say that we just are not going to put the time and effort into editing and uploading footage to any kind of social media .  So, overall, I give this 4 stars because while I think the feature doesn't warrant the extra money,  my son says it's one of his favorite Nerf guns and has been using it every day since we got it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RGCQ52G5HR55X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ILD58BO#wasThisHelpful","RGCQ52G5HR55X","ASGI7E0AJ8H5X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ASGI7E0AJ8H5X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This was our first in the BOOMco line.  We have long been fans of Nerf products, and must have at least 15 different Nerf guns, boxes and boxes of ammo, and all the accessories. So my son was anxious to see how this new Blaster gun would compare to some of his old favorites.First, the darts are really different from the standard Nerf foam darts. These darts are a think plastic with a rubber tip that allow them to stick to the targets that are included in the packaging.  The gun requires no batteries (definitely a plus), and works by pulling back on the rear handle to shoot up to 8 darts before needing to reload the clip. Then there is a cannon on top of the gun that can be activated by a switch in back. The cannon will shoot 3 darts at once.  The remaining 6 darts can be stored on the blaster for faster reload. There are also these wings on either side of the blaster that can capture any darts shot at them  - which make for finding extra ammo quicker when it's time to reload.Overall, we were happy with the product. It shoots really far (probably farther than our Nerf guns).  But then we had a bunch of 10 year olds over  and put this gun through it's paces. First, the targets quickly got lost or ripped or discarded.  After all, the boys wanted to shoot at each other, not at targets.  Then, they were complaining that the plastic BOOMco darts hurt a little when you are shot at close range. The Nerf foam darts didn't hurt as much (I think they were just looking for something to whine about though).  Last complaint was that the wings on the side of the blaster kept getting in the way and needed to be removed.  At the beginning of the games, everyone was fighting over who got to use the BOOMco gun, and then by the end of the day, they were fighting over who got stuck with it.So, I'm sticking with 4 stars for this.  From my perspective,  I found that it jammed less, shot farther, and seemed sturdy. I love that it doesn't need batteries.  But in the end the Nerf products won out due to their interchangeable darts, clips, etc.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RF7H3FHLA45DQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IVP1ANW#wasThisHelpful","RF7H3FHLA45DQ","ASGI7E0AJ8H5X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ASGI7E0AJ8H5X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I did have some initial trouble with sizing listed for the product. The only sizes listed are small/medium/large and there was no sizing chart posted for this product. The ones we had ordered previously were a boys small (my son is 10 and small fits perfectly). The company, Lazy One, makes these boxers for both men and boys sizes so I ordered the boys small and hoped that was right. When the order arrived, the items that arrived were mens boxers, not boys. I contacted Amazon, who put me in touch with the seller, and I found that their customer service was fantastic as well.

"I was really excited about the concept of this book. It's a great topic that I have not seen done elsewhere and has a lot of potential to make for an interesting read. I guess it just sort of fell flat.  As others pointed out, this isn't really a travel guide, nor is it a history book. It felt like a jumble of topics pulled from wikipedia and sorted together by topic. Each topic is thoroughly reviewed and explained, but nothing about it draws the reader into the experience. I would have liked more pictures, stories... just something to personalize the information a little to make the information more interesting.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1OOKTPKB4X2HL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=054410157X#wasThisHelpful","R1OOKTPKB4X2HL","ASGI7E0AJ8H5X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ASGI7E0AJ8H5X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"So I am comparing this product to the regular Dove antipersperant line ( for example: Dove Ultimate go fresh Cool Essentials Anti-perspirant/Deodorant, 2.6 Ounce (Pack of 4)).  I tend to switch between Dove and Secret based on what is on sale and have been happy with both. But I liked the idea of a Clinical Protection line and wanted to give it a try.So, as for the increased protection - while this is something that is hard to measure, I do feel like this product works better than the regular strength deoderant both at managing persperation, and at odor control. 5 stars for clinical protection.My only wish is that this would come in a solid deoderant instead of this semi-solid so as to not feel so wet going on.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 21, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2SBUVXR3GV1SS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001ECQ58E#wasThisHelpful","R2SBUVXR3GV1SS","ASGI7E0AJ8H5X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ASGI7E0AJ8H5X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When Skylanders Giants was released, the only question we had to work out was whether to get the portal owners kit, or whether to purchase the set with the new portal. When I heard that the new portal plugged in, that decided it for us. We went with the new portal. This has been a huge battery saver for us. Plus, the new portal lights up and looks very cool!Skylanders Giants has the same concept as the orignal game: there are worlds to explore, battles to win, treasures to find... each character can go through a series of upgrades to build upon his or her power. (I also like that they have increased the number of female characters too. On the rare occasion that ""mom"" gets to play, I always pick one of the female characters. Go Girl Power!)  I like that the original characters transition into the new game, so all the $$ spent on old characters was not in vain. I wish that the Giants game wasn't so easy to win. I was surprised when my son beat it so quickly. But, luckily, he still has artifacts to find, characters to collect, and mini games/battles to experience. So he has definitely not lost interest.I love that this game is not too violent for younger kids, but still fun and interesting for older kids. This is definitely one game my son and husband are equally obsessed with!  Wish we could figure out how to get it to work with 3 players!  If anyone has figured that one out, pls comment.... I'd love to know if it's even possible.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 21, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2KK83312Y5RW9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0088MVPRY#wasThisHelpful","R2KK83312Y5RW9","ASGI7E0AJ8H5X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ASGI7E0AJ8H5X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was disappointed with this set. I'm giving it 3 stars because the product works as advertised...but it just wasn't that fun.  The package comes with 2 sets of LED glasses and a small football (estimating ball is maybe around 3"" long).  Each of the 2 players wears the plastic glasses. The ball is coated in a special reflective fabric so when you wear the glasses, the ball looks illuminated at night. Glasses can be set to red or green light. The set does work, and my son and husband played a nighttime game of catch in the backyard.  I guess where I was disappointed was that the set looks and feels so cheap. The glasses are plastic and feel like something you'd win at a carnival game. The ball is so small. And only 2 people can play at a time.If you find it priced reasonably, I could see giving this as a novelty gift or for a school friend's birthday party. But, if you're looking for a fun ball to really play night games in the back yard, we like this one better: Full-size, Tough, LED-lighted, Light-up Football (Better Than Glow in the Dark!).","3.0 out of 5 stars","December 26, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1MWS904GLOM4K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005SRBHDE#wasThisHelpful","R1MWS904GLOM4K","ASGI7E0AJ8H5X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ASGI7E0AJ8H5X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is our 6th year buying Advent Calendars. I've alternated in previous years between Lego, Playmobil, and once even tried doing a candy calendar. I agree with other reviewers that Lego is the most expensive.  But here is why I keep coming back to it. The candy calendars are awful. The chocolate isn't tasty, and the candy is gone in a few seconds. For my money, I'd rather spend a little more and get something that lasts. So, I'm left with either Lego or Playmobil.I have to say that Lego has always been our preference. I like that the Lego toys fit nicely with our other Lego sets. And I do like the differet themes they roll out each year. It will be nice this year to add the little Firefighters to our collection of ""Lego guys"".  I understand the complains some reviews have noted about spoiling the surprise by printing the pictures on the box. This has never been a problem for us and I actually LOVE this feature. I always look at what each set contains before making a decision on which calendar to buy.This year's Lego set comes with 6 figures, plus vehicles, a christmas tree and even Santa on a snowmobile. Every day, kids are opening something fun to play with.  Compare that to the Playmobil sets where many of the day's pieces are small and disappointing. With Playmobil, the pieces don't really make sense until you have them all lined up together. And there is typically only one ""figure"" in the playmobil sets: usually a santa that you open on the 24th.So, for a little extra money, Lego is the way to go in our house!","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 15, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RTOVYOZ70WX74/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007Q0OF9E#wasThisHelpful","RTOVYOZ70WX74","ASGI7E0AJ8H5X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ASGI7E0AJ8H5X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We purchased this for a Dr Seuss themed party. The figure comes in 4 poster board panels and is perforated along it's edges. It is made of sturdier material than paper, but not as thick as cardboard.I'm guessing, based on the advertising, that the item was not intended to be a stand alone figure, and that it was made for classroom bulletin boards. For our use, we wanted this to be a stand alone figure. So we needed to get it to stand up, and we needed to make it sturdier.  For this figure to stand on it's own, it needs some kind of backing. The 4 panels need to be taped together to assemble it. This is my only criticism really. I would have expected it to come with interlocking tabs, or even adhesive backing to better adhere the panels together. But overall, that wasn't a deterrent as you can really easily just tape it yourself. Once assembled, the figure stands around 5' tall. We acutally used the packing box that it arrived in as our backing. We just cut a long rectangular panel from the packing box and taped it to the back of the figure to make it a little sturdier. It was a big hit at our party.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 26, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3O0Z7T8Z8OTCQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000T2YJBK#wasThisHelpful","R3O0Z7T8Z8OTCQ","ASGI7E0AJ8H5X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ASGI7E0AJ8H5X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This game just arrived, and has quickly become our new board game obsession. We are having fun with it, and I am already starting to consider it for holiday gifts for some of our friends. The only minor issue I have is that there are A LOT of pieces. And I don't think all of the pieces are critical to game function. I think the product could have been simplified a little, and for that I take off one star.I'll start with what is included in the box:- the game board,- 54 route tiles (these cards determine how the pieces move around the board),- 7 treasure tiles (these cards are the starting place holders for the gems you are trying to collect)- 24 glass gems (the yellow ""amber"" gems are worth 1 point, green ""emerald"" gems are worth two points, and blue ""sapphire"" gems are worth three points)- 24 player tokens (there 6 per player for up to 4 players -- these tokens are placed at exit points around the board and determine which exit points each player owns )- 4 screens (1 for each player for up to 4 players -- these are just to hide your gem collection from other players)- Game instructionsThe game board is set up in a big hexagon shape with 24 exit points around the edges of the board, and 6 treasure tiles placed evenly between exit points around the edges of the board. There is also one treasure tile in the center of the board. The treasure tiles are where you place the gems as a starting point. You want to maneuver the gems from the treasure tiles to one of your exit points (and away from other players exits) in order to add the gems to your collection.Each player gets 6 player tokens to place at exit points around the board so that you can determine which exit points are yours to move the gems toward. The object of the game is to lay down the route tiles and develop pathways along which to move the gems. The player with the most gems wins the game.I played this with my 8 year old. He picked up the concept really quickly. Each game lasted maybe half an hour. The game was a lot of fun. At times we were helping each other out by pointing out better route tiles, and at times we played more competitively. The age guideline of 8 years and up seems accurate. My son had no issues learning or playing the game.I do think game could have been made simpler and with fewer pieces. For instance, if the treasure tiles were printed directly on the game board itself, that would eliminate the need for these 7 extra game pieces that never move or change anyway. And I don't really get the need for the screens. Does it matter if your gems are hidden from other players? Even the idea of player specific exit tiles could be simplified. Can't every exit be up for grabs and whichever player gets a gem to an exit wins it?Overall, it's a great game. We may end up modifying instructions on our own to simplify set up and game play.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 25, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R20KX2NEP7HLSQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007SM3582#wasThisHelpful","R20KX2NEP7HLSQ","ASGI7E0AJ8H5X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ASGI7E0AJ8H5X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I will refrain from a synopsis, since there are several other reviews that have that posted. I will say that I found this to be a quick read, and a really ""believable"" story - given that it is about zombies. This actually had the same feel as one of my favorite thrillers The Things That Keep Us Here: A Novel (Random House Reader's Circle). The two stories are very different, but both have that 'what do you do when society breaks down' kind of feel.  I also love a good zombie story, so this was a fun read. I do agree with some of the other reviews that mentioned the book dropped a bit in the middle. But for me, it didn't hurt my exeprience with the overall story.

"My son has been collecting Beyblades for a couple years now. He has dozens of them and he and his friends (and my husband) have had many battles.  We have 2 other beyblade stadiums: Beyblades 2011 Metal Fusion Beystadium Burning Firestrike Stadium and another one.  so when I saw this one, it looked like a great addition to our collection.The set comes with a plastic dome that you put together. It is easy to assemble, and my 8 year old mastered putting it together even without my assistance. Once you assemble the dome, there are these sort of lightening bolt shaped stickers to affix to the outside for decoration.  The dome is plastic and is made of similar quality/material to the other beyblade stadiums.The set comes with 2 beyblades and 2 discs/wheels that the beyblades fit into to make them spin better inside the dome. Without the wheel, regular beyblades will not work real well in the dome. After that, it works like any other beyblade set. You pull the rip cord and launch the beyblades into the dome, and watch them spin. There is a hole at the bottom of the dome, and the last beyblade to stay inside without falling through the hole is the winner.I do like that the beyblades in this set are interchangeable with other beyblades in your collection. I don't have any real problems with the construction of the set compared to the other beyblade products we own. Overall though, this held my son's attention for maybe an hour. Then he went right back to his other stadiums. The open stadiums are just more fun. It is easier to launch the beyblades when  you aren't trying to aim them into a small hole. The beyblades spin longer in the open stadiums too. And, the open stadiums are half the price of the dome listed here.So overall, I give this 3 stars. It's not a bad set. And for the beyblade obsessed kid who has everything, it could make an ok gift... if it weren't for the price. But there are just better, and cheaper, sets out there.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 24, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3RBBAYGFDXCI0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0083TXW6E#wasThisHelpful","R3RBBAYGFDXCI0","ASGI7E0AJ8H5X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ASGI7E0AJ8H5X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Our glasses arrived well packaged and seem very durable. They have endured dishwashers and dinner parties with no issues.The glasses are not all the exact same width or height, or even thickness.

"My son wanted a special storage case for his skylander guys. We looked at this one, but ended up returning it because it just wasn't worth the price. As another reviewer pointed out, this doesn't hold the portal itself, it is just designed to hold the character figures. That part was fine with us, we were looking more for character storage rather than to store the portal, disc, etc. But the case itself is small and holds just a few (8) figures, along with the game disc. We ended up instead refurbishing an old lunch box (the soft insulated kind). It had an extra zipper compartment on top where my son stores the trading cards that come with the figures. Then the figures go into the main compartment and it all zips shut and has a handle/strap to carry it. My son even used his Skylander stickers to decorate the outside of the lunch container. Not bad for $2.99, and holds our dozen or so figures with room for more.","2.0 out of 5 stars","January 25, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1QXRHA7FKIR0K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005DUEPQ2#wasThisHelpful","R1QXRHA7FKIR0K","ASGI7E0AJ8H5X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ASGI7E0AJ8H5X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We just got the Skylanders game/set for Christmas, and it has quickly become a family obsession. This game has been a lot of fun, and something my 7 year old, my husband, AND I have all enjoyed playing together.  This was the first expansion pack we bought outside of the starter set.  The set comes with Hex (Undead Element), Zap (Water Element) and Dino-Rang (Earth Element).HEX:Before upgrades, Hex's primary power (A Button) is to shoot magic orbs, and her secondary power (B Button) is to *slowly* cast a spell that summons ghostly skulls that attack/rain down from the sky (I think to start there are 2 skulls that rain down). The nice thing about her secondary power is that the skulls rain down from the sky, so you can attack from a distance. So if Hex can attack an enemy while standing safely on a bridge or behind a pillar, she's all set. The problem with her secondary power is that it takes so much time to cast the spell and she is vulnerable to attack during this time. So we found at first that she was getting attacked a lot and losing all her energy quickly and was not a great asset in our adventures. Then we met up with Persephone the Fairy who upgraded Hex's powers......All character upgrades give you options to improve Primary and Secondary abilities, and to add a Tertiary ability. Some of Hex's upgrades include: increasing her secondary power to conjure up to 4 skulls in the Rain of Skulls attack, increasing the range and power of the magic orb attack in her primary power... But the BEST upgrade, is adding her tertiary power (Z Button). This creates a Wall of Bones that protects Hex from attackers and gives her a shield to allow her the time to conjure her spells. This attack skill is fantastic and a must have. Other characters can benefit from this power as well and can stand behind the wall of bones and shoot at attackers.ZAP:Zap's primary power (A Button) allows him to breathe bursts of electricity. His secondary power (B Button) allows him to leave a trail of sea slime behind him that enemies can get stuck in. The trail is temporary and only lasts a few minutes. He's a decent character, not the fastest runner, but not super slow either. And of course, being a water character means that he can swim, which allows him access to some areas that other characters can't get to.Some of Zap's upgrades include: increasing his Primary Power to shoot his electricity blasts further and do increased damage, and increasing his Secondary Power (Sea Slime) to electrify the slime trail and zap enemies that get caught in it (this is my favorite of Zap's upgrades). Then there is also a Tertiary Ability (Z Button) that you can add on once you have accumulated enough points: the Wave Rider Ability. This allows Zap to create and ride a big wave that sort of mows down attackers in it's path. It also allows Zap to move over distances more quickly which makes for a nice bonus there too.DINO RANG:Dino-Rang's primary power (A Button) allows him to throw boomerangs at attackers. His secondary power (B Button) allows him to throw boomerangs that circle around himself as a shield while also doing damage to attackers (this is helpful during close ranged attacks). These 2 powers make him a decent fighter, even right out of the box, prior to updates. Dino-Rang sort of reminds me of Trigger Happy in the way that they both are easy to maneuver and fight well.Some of Dino-Rang's upgrades include: increasing his Primary Power to cause greater damage with his boomerangs, and increasing his Secondary Power to give his boomerang shields more strength and control. Then there is also a Tertiary Ability (Z Button) that you can add on once you have accumulated enough points: the Stone Fists Ability. This allows Dino to summon Stone Fists that come up from underground and destroy attackers.All things considered, we are happy with this expansion pack. Since this is our first add on to the starter set, I don't really have any other packs to compare it to, but I will say that we are happy with all of the characters and they have all made our gaming lots of fun.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 10, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2EOY4HM2YJDI4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0050SVEKW#wasThisHelpful","R2EOY4HM2YJDI4","ASGI7E0AJ8H5X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ASGI7E0AJ8H5X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Playing video games has always been a fun activity for my husband and son to do together, but I never really got into any of the games.  Then we got the Skylanders game/set for Christmas, and it has quickly become a family obsession. This game has been a lot of fun, and something my 7 year old, my husband, AND I have all enjoyed playing together.Hex was the first figure we purchased outside of the original characters that come with the starter set.  She was the figure we were most looking forward to collecting. I loved the idea of getting a female character.  I like the idea of reinforcing that you can have a fierce looking, powerful girl character and that these adventure games are not just boy-centric.  We picked up Hex in a 3 pack that included Hex, Dino Rang, and Zap (will review those characters separately).Now, our first impression right out of the box was disappointing: Hex just wasn't that impressive. We had been used to playing the starter characters like fast shooting Trigger Happy, Fire Breathing Spyro, and Gil Grunt with his ability to swim around and access areas that others can't get to. After them, we found Hex to be slow to attack and slow to run/dodge bad guys.Her primary power (A Button) is to shoot magic orbs, and her secondary power (B Button)  is to *slowly* cast a spell that summons ghostly skulls that attack/rain down from the sky (I think to start there are 2 skulls that rain down).  The nice thing about her secondary power is that the skulls rain down from the sky, so you don't have to be right on top of the bad guys in order to attack.  So if Hex can attack an enemy while standing safely on a bridge or behind a pillar, she's all set.  The problem with her secondary power is that it takes so much time to cast the spell and she is vulnerable to attack during this time. So we found at first that she was getting attacked a lot and losing all her energy quickly and was not a great asset in our adventures.  Then we met up with Persephone the Fairy who upgraded Hex's powers...... Now she is back to being fierce and powerful, and is truly one of our favorite characters!Some of the basics:Hex is a dark elf/Sorceress of the ""Undead"" Element.  Her Starting abilities include: * Health: 270 * Speed: 43 * Armor: 18 * Critical Hit: 30 * Elemental Power: 25All character upgrades give you options to improve Primary and Secondary abilities, and to add a Tertiary ability.  Some of Hex's upgrades include: increasing her secondary power to conjure up to 4 skulls in the Rain of Skulls attack, increasing the range and power of the magic orb attack in her primary power... But the BEST upgrade, is adding her tertiary power (Z Button).  This creates a Wall of Bones that protects Hex from attackers and gives her a shield to allow her the time to conjure her spells. This attack skill is fantastic and a must have. Other characters can benefit from this power as well and can stand behind the wall of bones and shoot at attackers.So, give Hex a chance, build up her upgrades and I promise you will LOVE this character!","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 9, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RDHDQ3SE5LSTD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0050SVDT4#wasThisHelpful","RDHDQ3SE5LSTD","ASGI7E0AJ8H5X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ASGI7E0AJ8H5X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was hesitant to buy this for my son for christmas. He is a big fan/colllector of all things Beyblades, but in general, these electronic beyblades seem to be getting poor reviews. We had no problems with construction or quality of the toy and the lights/sounds were lots of fun.  The toy can be used with our other beyblades and with the standard stadium we already have. So it requires no additional pieces to work.The beyblade itself is slightly larger than normal sized beyblades and has a tiny on/off button on the side that activates the lights and sounds. You pull the rip cord as usual to launch the toy. There are lights and sounds, and even sword-like clanging sounds when the toy hits against another beyblade.This toy was a big hit in our house with my son and his cousins.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 1, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RS73IH80Z5504/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004SKQN6I#wasThisHelpful","RS73IH80Z5504","ASGI7E0AJ8H5X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ASGI7E0AJ8H5X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you are looking for a simple toy yo-yo for a young child, this is not your toy. But it doesn't advertise itself to be. The advertising says this is for the intermediate user, and I absolutely agree with that. The Yo-Yo comes with a fantastic instructional video that will walk you through some of the moves. It also comes with an oil lubricant and extra string.My 7 year old loved that the yo-yo lights up. He had fun playing this in the dark. To really get the most out of the instructional video, I'd rate this for maybe ages 9 and up. But as a fun, light up yo-yo, this can be used with younger kids just fine.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 1, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RCA5M37XRZN06/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000NSW0LQ#wasThisHelpful","RCA5M37XRZN06","ASGI7E0AJ8H5X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ASGI7E0AJ8H5X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was skeptical about getting into the whole Skylanders idea. The idea of collectable character statues was a little off-putting at first. We've done pokemon cards, beyblades, bakugan....I wasn't sure I was ready for another type of toy for collecting and trading with friends. But, my 7 year old really wanted this game set for christmas and so we took a chance. I am happy to say my initial impression was way off.The makers of this game are nothing short of marketing geniuses. The starter kit comes with the game, the ""portal"" that you place the figures onto, and 3 characters: Spyro, Trigger Happy, and Gil Grunt.  Each character has different strengths and weaknesses. You place the character on the portal, and the portal recognizes the character, including what level it's on, and any treasures or tools it has earned. These qualities follow the character statue even when playing on someone else's game system (so you can bring your statue to a friend's and use it on other portals without losing your stats).The game itself is winnable with just the 3 characters included the starter kit. You don't HAVE to buy any additional characters. But the game is really engaging, and you can get sucked into the excitement pretty quickly.  It is an adventure game format with lots of treasure to hunt for, great scenery, and of course, bad guys to battle.Each character has an affinity (water, magic, earth, tech, air, etc.....). Some characters will have an advantage based on the area of the game you are exploring. So if you're in a water based area, Gil Grunt is your guy.  You'd be ok with non-water characters in a water themed area, but Gil has the advantage of being able to jump in the water and swim over to battle the bad guys from behind. Spyro has a Magic affinity, and I think Trigger Happy is Tech themed.There are also special gated areas that need to be unlocked by characters of a certain element.  All of this will make the game appealing for repeat play....so even though you beat a level with Spyro, you  will have a different experience beating the same level with Trigger Happy -- (you can find different treasure, tools, etc buy using different characters).We have been playing this game a lot since Christmas. It has become a favorite with both kids and adults. We are already planning out which characters to buy next. Oh, and my son wants me to add to the review that this is the 'best game ever'.1/1/12 update: My son wanted to use his Christmas money to buy some extra character guys to add to his set.  Have been to and/or called all of the toy stores, video stores, and general dept stores in our area and EVERYWHERE is sold out of the character packs.  Lucky for us, Amazon has them in stock. Just ordered an Adventure pack and a triple character pack. Will post reviews for them once they arrive.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 30, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2342666HLQ9O8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004VQENY8#wasThisHelpful","R2342666HLQ9O8","ASGI7E0AJ8H5X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ASGI7E0AJ8H5X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Question your doubts, says Powell. An interesting twist, isnt it? Research on metacognition, the process of thinking about ones own mental processes, shows that doubting your doubts can lead to more confidence, while second-guessing yourself can lead to immobilization.Powell, a biomedical research scientist with a PhD in virology from Harvard, hardly sounds like a person who should question anything that passes through her brain. Yet, even with all her learning, she struggles with doubts about God.Truth is, I struggled a little with her struggle  in the beginning of the book. No, the book isnt poorly written or unintelligent. Thats far from true. In fact, Im pretty sure Powell could think circles around me. Its just that often I couldnt relate to her examples, and other times I felt like no example was necessary. In discussing our doubts about God, Powell often referenced practical situations from her post-graduate work. She discussed the influence of others, the decision-making process, the role of doubting in producing quality work, and so on. The instruction she gave for the most part seems intuitively obvious, and so the topic remained flat.But the time came in the book when Powells story grew personal. She wrote of her mothers faith, which Powell concluded was flawed. Her mother felt that denying logic was a measure of the strength of her faith. When faced with cancer, Powells mother put her faith in Gods healing power to the exclusion of medical treatment. Her death was inevitable, which then shook Powells fathers faith. His faith never recovered and he remained resentful of the teachings which cut his wifes life short until his own death.Powells story came alive for me in those pages. The research she conducted at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute suddenly carried more meaning; her position of ordained minister with the Assemblies of God carried more clout; and her journey into doubt and how she learned to question her doubts kept me riveted for the second half of the book.Says Powell, a world of faith that mocks the advances of science breeds spiritual arrogance and plants the seeds of destruction in the lives of vulnerable people. Today, her faith remains strong, and she encourages us to build a bridge between faith and reason.Definitely a book worth reading.Intervarsity Press,  2014, 208 pagesISBN: 978-0-8308-3678-9","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R36M8O3VL9KDTR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0830836780#wasThisHelpful","R36M8O3VL9KDTR","A1TJPQDW2GB5X8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TJPQDW2GB5X8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the most comforting book about death I've ever read. Oddly, it wasn't written by a Christian. Bachrach remains an atheist. It's about near-death experiences, but it has nothing to do with belief. Rather, it's a study of what ""death travelers"" report as having experienced.The thing is, we are better able to study these experiences than ever before, because medicine has advanced so rapidly. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation, a frequent way of reviving the dead, has become commonplace. More and more people are brought back from the dead, their brains stuffed with memories of what they experienced. We now have tens of thousands of reported cases.Some common claims include a lucidity of experience even among people with brain damage like Alzheimers, a feeling of deep bliss, and feeling of going home. Speechless communication with other beings is often reported. Traditional Christian teachings are usually contradicted; warnings of eternal damnation or promises of a blessed eternity to the faithful hold no water with those who have been there and back, and most return with no fear of death. A very common word on the lips of survivors when recounting what they experienced is ""love,"" but this experience has no correlation with religious attendance. It just doesn't much matter what you believe. It happens to Christians, Jews, Buddhists and Hindus. It happens whether you believe in an afterlife or not; whether you believe in God or not. Only two of the people Bachrach researched encountered Jesus in the afterlife, and none met up with the devil.However, some death travelers do still report a deepening of faith. One person recounted that she discovered she was ""perfect, endowed with love,"" and later realized that so is everyone else. She had never before understood the passage in the Bible about being created in God's image, and it finally made sense.The one thing that I found not comforting about Bachrach's research is how commonly death experiences cause divorce. People who have experienced death often undergo a radical change in priorities. Selfish desires make way for universal concerns-they feel united and at one with rest of the world-and this new focus is hard for spouses to understand.But are these experiences ""real""? We still don't know, but the experiencers usually insist they are. Bachrach fairly examines the pros and cons and doesn't pretend to be an expert, but her bias shows. She believes.National Geographic Society,  2014, 249 pagesISBN: 978-1-4246-1514-8","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R357RB4IQPRB63/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1426215142#wasThisHelpful","R357RB4IQPRB63","A1TJPQDW2GB5X8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TJPQDW2GB5X8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Progressive Christian C. Drew Smith asks, Is Christianity a religion that legitimizes intolerance, subjugation, and violence, or is it a faith of tolerance, equality, and peace?He locates the answer only after digging clear back to our Savior, and Smith brings a Ph.D. in the New Testament to help with the job. Jesus, Smith explains, believed that God was presently acting in the world to bring about something new, a radical shift in the Judaism of his day. He invited people to enter an empire; an alternative empire, the Empire of God, under the rule of God. He was calling them to offer their allegiance to God and not Caesar. Jesuss dream of a Kingdom of God was never about getting to a place called heaven. It was a call to insubordination against the Roman Empire and all that was unjust. Joining the Jesus movement meant opposing the powers that carried out oppression, violence, and injustice, whatever those powers may be.How do we oppose injustice? First and foremost, Jesus called his followers to respond to the harm that is done to them with nonviolence. Turn the other cheek. Learn to love even those who harm you. Develop a radical love for neighbors and enemies equally in the quest for compassion and justice. And do so in an outward practice, welcoming and embracing your enemies.Can it possibly work? Jesus bet his life on it, and he turned out to be right, though he wouldnt live to know it. Smith argues that Jesus surely understood his fate, that he would most likely be crucified. History had told him that to challenge the authority of Rome was treason, and the penalty for treason was death. We may not need to die for the cause as did our leader, but lets be clear: Following Jesus is liberating, but it is also demanding. It is costly. If your Jesus permits you to wage unjust violence against your enemies in the name of national security, if he allows you to hoard money and possessions in the name of financial security, if he consents to your prejudices against people of other races, genders, religions and sexual orientations, then he is not the Jesus of the Bible. The real gospel of the real Jesus calls us to give up ourselves in self-sacrificial service to God and others by taking up the cross and following Jesus. The question is not can it work, but can we embrace the crucified Jesus?In case you havent figured it out yet, I absolutely loved this book. I struggle to rate it because, frankly, I agree so strongly with everything inside its covers that I fear my own bias will unfairly influence my rating. Yet as I now go over my notes, I see how much encouragement it provided me, which seems a fair measure of the books value. So, five stars, with no apology. Thank you for your humble message, Mr. Smith, and thank you, Energion Publications, for knowing how much i would fall in love with the review copy you sent for my perusal.Energion Publications,  2014, 122 pagesISBN: 978-1-63199-121-9","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R6824AUFHCYEJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QQWHF90#wasThisHelpful","R6824AUFHCYEJ","A1TJPQDW2GB5X8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TJPQDW2GB5X8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Herricks new book is more than fiction; its a controversial, studied picture of the Jesus of history. Just as the Gospel writers set about to convey the nature of Jesus in story, so does Herrick. His Jesus, however, is human and fallible. The man we call Jesus fell into his place in history through good intentions and a bit of naivete.Buy this book for a thoughtful portrayal of a driven, compassionate man who lived 2,000 years ago. Herricks prose is a bit passive; this book just isnt meant to be a page-turner. He repeatedly tones down the supernatural claims of scripture, sometimes blatantly rewriting the Bible. But thats sort of the point. Herrick means to provide a reasonable image, true to the atmosphere of the first century, of the most influential man who ever lived.The books real value is in the retrospective analysis that it demands. Readers already familiar with the Jesus of the Bible will enjoy Herricks work the most, since it is the rewritten passages which are most meaningful. This is Herricks subtle way of highlighting where historical truth escalated into evangelical posturing, particularly in the passion narrative. Thus, the short section at the end, where Herrick discusses the research which led him to portray Jesus in this manner, cannot be missed.Recommended for all who believe they know who Jesus really was, this book will make you think differently.Sunstone Press,  2014, 136 pagesISBN: 978-1-63293-021-7","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RVDYF2SMSN3YF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1632930218#wasThisHelpful","RVDYF2SMSN3YF","A1TJPQDW2GB5X8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TJPQDW2GB5X8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Who is God, really? A fire-breathing tyrant? A loving Father? Woodward wants to reintroduce us to a God whose purpose is love. Yes, theres fire in scripture, but Gods fire is for refining, not punishing. Everyone goes through the fire, not just the uncooperative guys.For everyone will be salted by fire Mark 9:49But what about the book of Revelation, which promises everlasting punishment in a lake of fire? What about the gospel of Matthew, which seems especially hung up on hellfire? Woodward suggests we forget about them. A number of books have covertly slipped into the canon, through the deception of evil angels, which do not carry the authority of Christ or the apostles. He insists that apocalyptic themes, especially those regarding eternal fire, are contradictory to the true message of Christ. This is not the purpose of Gods refining fire. Consequently, Woodward rejects a number of the New Testament books, and calls us to return to the gospel taught to us by Peter, John and Paul. His arguments for this radical action are very interesting.As with most highly controversial books, there was much I agreed with and much I did not. For me, the value of a book can often be measured by how many notes I take in the margins reminding me to research the topics further. This time there were plenty! One fascinating example is Woodwards suggestion that when Jesus spoke of returning on the clouds, the cloud he referred to was the Holy Spirit. Similar to my own interpretation of the Gospel of John, Woodward suggests that the arrival of the Holy Spirit represented Jesuss Second Coming. (I hope Im representing him properly.)On the downside, I did find the book just a little bit preachy and assumptive. Woodward looks forward to the day the Jews finally understand their own scripture. He recognizes the Spirit of God working in groups like Alcoholics Anonymous, while noting that they dont really yet know Him as we do. I found such passages a bit distracting, so I dropped my rating one star.I received an unedited version for review, and did not take into consideration its lack of editing.Createspace,  2014, 227 pagesISBN: 978-1502365569","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R189PU9A0G0GRI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1502365561#wasThisHelpful","R189PU9A0G0GRI","A1TJPQDW2GB5X8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TJPQDW2GB5X8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've been a sucker for short stories ever since I discovered Edgar Allen Poe as a young teenager, so when Judy Croome offered to share a collection of her stories, I couldn't resist. It isn't really an appropriate choice for my blog, but it was an enjoyable break, definitely worth sharing in a casual review.Leslie (my blog partner) asked me as I was reading what the book was about. I said it was about life, and that seemed to satisfy her. But the question remained with me: What is your book about, Judy? My mind wandered back to another book I reviewed of Croome's, a haunting spiritual journey titled Dancing in the Shadows of Love. It, too, was about life, and I found myself captivated by Croome's short story collection in the same way.Croome is a very good writer. Her stories are imaginative and engaging, they play heavily on the element of surprise, but more than that, they leave you full of feelings. Icky feelings, happy feelings, sad feelings, nervous feelings. Her characters-all of them-are simultaneously common and peculiar, a little like peeking into the closet of your smiling next door neighbor. A little like if you were to peek into your own heart. It's scary stuff.Some stories appear to have been published before, and some appear to be originals, but they're all great reads.

"British Christianity just isnt the same as our American brand. Its funnier, raunchier, and more real  that is, if Spufford, a self-proclaimed Christian, is a legitimate example.Were not likely to hear Spuffords take on Christianity from the pulpit, but I wish we could. I really do. This book is a must-read. This is Christ and Christianity down off its pedestal, down in the mud and the blood. This is Jesus the way he really lived and died. It is Christians today, with our human doubts and fears and needs, the way we live and die in the real world. This is life; therefore, this is God.The kicker? Despite everything, despite the HPtFtU (Human propensity to f things up) Christianity does still make surprising emotional sense.Francis Spufford is first and foremost a writer, as becomes evident in the opening paragraph, which is a good thing.

"Definitely a candidate for the Dubious Disciple top ten award this year. I cant recall when I last enjoyed a book this much. Gist brings the Bible alive as ancient Hebrew storytelling, and though theres sometimes a bit of speculation involved, the flavor of his interpretation is so fascinating that it must be spot on.Gist describes himself as a still growing, though retired, minister, who enjoys what he is continuously learning about the Bible. He does not pretend to be a biblical scholar, yet he brings a common-sense approach to understanding Jewish literature. One fun example is his discussion of the difference between Hebrew prophecy and Christian prophecy. Hebrew prophets were never future-tellers the way we want to believe they were; they were actually more likely to go around playing music, falling into trances and stripping naked.So why dont we understand the Bible the way ancient Hebrews did? Because were Christian. Within two or three generations after Jesus, Greek-speaking gentiles took over the church. The early Christians did not understand Jewish literature, they began to distance themselves from Jews, and soon even became enemies. People began to read scripture literally, which buried the subtle messages within. The Jesus movement, instead of promoting the prophets dreams, somehow turned into a religion.Nowhere is this more evident than in comparing two early Christianities, which Gist labels Pauline and Petrine. Pauline Christianity won the raceits what we all are familiar with todaybut Petrine Christianity is more loyal to its Jewish roots, and thus surely more loyal to Jesus.So if weve been wrong all along, is there hope for us to learn what the Bible really means? Yep, I think so, if we can outgrow this tendency to read scripture like a literal history book, and Gist is the person to help us! His approach is loads of fun, his writing is engaging, his research is fascinating, and most important of all, he simply makes sense.Buy this one for sure.FriesenPress,  2014, 176 pagesISBN: 978-1-4602-4272-8","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RUO06U938M30B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1460242726#wasThisHelpful","RUO06U938M30B","A1TJPQDW2GB5X8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TJPQDW2GB5X8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Lord, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, the courage to change the things I can, and the wisdom to know the difference.Repeated by millions worldwide, this simple prayer has transformative power. Father Morris first began to contemplate its healing power when he found himself sitting in an open Alcoholics Anonymous meeting and hearing it shared aloud. Says Morris, It was the purest and most genuine act of self-abandonment to Gods will I had ever witnessed. Their prayer wasnt especially pretty, or clean; it was real, and gritty. It was the opposite of religious showmanship; it was intimate, existential, and wholly indifferent to any outsiders praise or reproach. It was prayer, plain and simple.So he broke the simple prayer into its three parts and wrote a three-part book. It is a Catholic perspective, but without heavy-handed religion; just inspirational encouragement and practice suggestions to develop our serenity, courage, and wisdom. You can guess the first suggestion we should put into practice: Pray this little prayer every day.Serenity arises partly from knowing that we have done all we can and the rest is up to God. The problem of evil can be daunting. Why are their earthquakes, floods, birth defects, terrible diseases and calamities if God loves us? The only satisfying explanation is that God is able to turn evil on its head and bring good out of it.Courage, too, arises from faith in God. Have you ever noticed how many of Jesuss parables have to do with getting out and doing somethingand how displeased he seems when we fail to act? Doing good is, in essence, the meaning of Christianity. Our purpose is to change the world around us, and the first to change must be us.But the hardest part of the prayer may be the last part. The wisdom to know what to change and what to accept. Morris encourages us to listen to the whispers of God.This is a book that can make a difference, one day at a time.Harper One,  2014, 231 pagesISBN: 978-1-06-211913-1","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1HZ488O11RH43/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062119133#wasThisHelpful","R1HZ488O11RH43","A1TJPQDW2GB5X8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TJPQDW2GB5X8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Well-written and touching, heres another atheist lawyer finds Jesus story. Minot hooked me early in chapter one with this claim: I was amazed to learn how the Scriptures read like a lengthy letter from the Creator to the objects of His love. If Minot could impart this perspective to me, I would finally have what Ive been searching for: a real reason why apologists should imagine that the God of the Bible is our creator.The book didnt quite take me there. In fact, bits of it feel a little presumptuous, even naive. Minot ignores the research of Bible scholars and historians, repeating instead the claims of amateur apologists, such as the idea that the Bible is full of unexplainable prophecies and truth-proving, recently-verified historical claims. Sometimes Minot pits Christianity against evolution or against science in general. There is a chapter-long warning against the wiles of Satan, who often works through the voices of philosophers, political leaders, educators, scientists, or even those claiming to be experts in religion  in other words, anyone who has studied a topic enough to know more than we do.But there are definitely worthwhile sections too, because the journey Minot narrates rings of authenticity. Minots story of how he found a church that fits him is heart-felt. His feelings of love and awe and appreciation are surely sincere. He has experienced the goodness and comfort of Christianity, and rightfully wishes to share it with others.Its best, then, to read this book as Minots personal journey rather than scholarly research. It contains the arguments and discoveries that spoke to a new convert and urged him toward his brand of Christianity.  Some readers will find Minots perspective convincing and some will not, but all will be inspired by Minots 180-degree transition from committed atheist to joyful believer.Morgan James Publishing,  2015, 195 pagesISBN: 978-1-63047-124-8","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R14LZM88WIJAGI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1630471240#wasThisHelpful","R14LZM88WIJAGI","A1TJPQDW2GB5X8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TJPQDW2GB5X8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Ten scholars present papers (now seven years old) about early Jewish Christians, their writings and practices.Its a slippery topic. All scholars recognize the ambiguity in the term Jewish Christian, which makes classification difficult. Understanding that Christianity is an offshoot of Judaism, where exactly do you draw the line between Judaism and Christianity? The term usually refers to Jesus-followers who continue Jewish practices, such as Sabbath observance, circumcision, and dietary restrictions. But what makes a person more of a Jewish Christian (speaking of practice, not nationality) than a Christianized Jew? Its a sliding scale without full consensus, but this book examines early Christian groups and certain Christian texts which lean toward Judaism; enough to be classified as Jewish Christianity. These include:Groups: The Jerusalem church; the Christ-believing Jews who opposed Paul; the Ebionites & Nazarenes; and the Johannine CommunityTexts: Q, Matthew, James, Revelation, the Didache, and the Pseudo-ClementinesThe examination of the epistle of James was the most interesting to me. You may find the writing a bit on the scholarly side unless this is a topic which fascinates you. For me, its more than fascinating; its essential to understanding our Christian roots. This is because in my own studies, I have come to believe that Jewish Christians (particularly the Ebionites) trace their heritage back to the church leadership in Jerusalem, headed by the inner apostles themselves. This is not to say that Jewish Christianity didnt evolve  it surely did, as did other strands of Christianity  but its roots are just as strongly anchored in the earliest Jesus traditions as the Gentile religion were more familiar with.I found this an essential collection for those who want to keep their finger on the pulse of early Christian tradition.

"Wow. I wish I had written this book. Speculative but convincingly argued, it strikes a perfect balance between reason and wonder, as it traces the evolution and demise of Jewish Christianity.I have both curiosity and sympathy for the Ebionites, that early Jewish Christian sect which probably stemmed from the first Christians in Jerusalem, headed by Jesus brother James. Their disagreements with Paul, their emphasis on simplicity, and their primitive Christology have always intrigued me. But Akers pulls no punches in digging up the truth about the Ebionites and others. Some of their doctrine entices me, and some does not. For one thing, by the time you finish this book you may turn into a vegetarian  and life without bacon? No thanks, Keith.In my studied opinion, Akers oversteps the bounds of reason only oncewhen he discusses the Talpiot tomb (the Jesus tomb) and its implicationsbut the thing is, his scholarship is so precise elsewhere that it makes me want to take a hard look at even this and see if there is really something to it! If it sounds like Im gushing praise, its because this may be the most intriguing book Ive read since discovering Paul Andersons Johannine studies. In a word: Disciples is simply brilliant, very highly recommended.My one complaint is that it suffers from a scarcity of references, having no reference section or footnotes.

"For the Lord is our judge, the Lord is our lawgiver, the Lord is our king. Isaiah 33:22This stuff frightens me. Sanford approaches the topic of the Religious Right much like a journalist struggling mightily to remain unbiased. This goal is too lofty, and though he gives it a good try, the inherent danger of merging church and state nevertheless surfaces in his writing.The word theocracy merely means a form of government where God is in control. It sounds wonderful, until the question arises of who speaks for God. Sanfords book is the history of the growth of the Religious Right and its infiltration into government, from the Moral Majority through todays time. Its deeply researched, written intelligently and straightforwardly, with strong reference material.Is Christian Reconstructionism, ala Rushdoonys The Institutes of Biblical Law, really dead? How about Abraham Kuypers Christian Worldview? Are personalities like Francis Shaeffer, James Dobson and Charles Colson really under control? By 1984, Pat Robertson, an extremely popular evangelist, was insisting that only Christians and Jews are qualified to govern the nation, and that Gods people would soon hold sway in Washington.Should we fear the emergence of organizations such as the Institute on Religion and Democracy (IRD) or the Campus Crusade for Christ (CCC) who run their fingers through politics? How about politicians such as Palin, Bachmann and Gingrich who see politics as a battle against secular America?The fear runs both directions. In 1980, Timothy LaHaye predicted that without a Christian awakening, humanists would achieve their goal of a complete world takeover by the year 2000. How did we get so polarized in politics? Will the culture war ever end? Sanford argues that secularism is not hatred of religion; pluralism is not anarchy; tolerance is not indulgence; autonomy is not rebellion. There is nothing to war over. Yet all these are imagined by the Christian Right as undermining a Christian Nation.Sanford traces the assumption of Divine authority back to Calvin. Supreme authority makes demands that must be obeyed at all costs, however unreasonable or unpalatable its directives may appear on their face. The ultimate goal for such Christians is salvation in another world, sometimes reflecting a lack of concern for this world  for the sooner things spiral out of control, the sooner Christ will return.This book is a probing but necessary read. Still, the solution to ending the culture war is unclear, and it leaves me feeling nervous.Metacomet Books,  2014, 278 pagesISBN: 978-0-9747042-0-3","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R307K7VEY6N2OB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0974704245#wasThisHelpful","R307K7VEY6N2OB","A1TJPQDW2GB5X8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TJPQDW2GB5X8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a scholarly look at the evidence, both archaeological and from the written record of the Church Fathers, of early Jewish Christianity. Howard focuses on two sects, the Ebionites and the Nazarenes. He notes that early Christians all went by the name of Nazarene, and that the Jewish Christians probably fled Jerusalem just prior to the war of 70 AD, landing in Pella (the famous Christian exodus noted in the Gospel of Luke, chapter 21). These displaced Christians were surely the Jerusalem church, once headed by James, the brother of Jesus. They favored versions of the Gospel of Matthew. There in Pella, they splintered, dividing into two or more sects sometime in the second century, with the point of division probably being over the matter of Christology.Howard considers the Ebionites to be clearly heretical, denying the divinity of Christ and not believing in the virgin birth. The Nazarenes, on the other hand, were orthodox in all respects except that they adhered to Jewish ceremonial law. This respect for the Law was to be expected: when the apostle Paul met with the Jerusalem Christians, they reached a compromise. Jewish Christians would continue to observe the Law, while Gentile Christians would not. This worked well, apparently, and Jewish Christianity remained the dominant expression of the Christian Church in Palestine up until perhaps the time of Constantine.This compromise was broken, however, over the course of several centuries. Antisemitism reared its ugly head, and Jews in all forms grew despised. Jewish Christians all began to be classed with the heretical Ebionites, whether they fit the mold or not. They were not invited to the Council of Nicaea; of the 318 fathers at the Council, only 18 were from Palestine and these were Gentile bishops representing only the coastal cities. No Jewish Christians were in attendance, and by the end of the fourth century, it was no longer acceptable for Jewish Christians to practice any aspects of the ceremonial law, even if they were in all other ways orthodox in belief. Epiphanius declared the Nazarenes heretical in 376 CE, Augustine endorsed the claim in 400 CE, and Jewish Christians simply ceased to exist.Excellent booklet, very well documented.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RWIUWIEHWVJ4O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HH1K3QQ#wasThisHelpful","RWIUWIEHWVJ4O","A1TJPQDW2GB5X8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TJPQDW2GB5X8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"April Lewiss book is a pluralistic Christian approach to happiness. She notes that it is Gods will that we be happy, experiencing heaven on earth, and that virtually all religions promote common goals of love, forgiveness, altruism and healthy relationships  the very things which contribute to our happiness on earth. Lewis has apparently been through the wringer in life and learned some hard lessons (which she doesnt discuss), but she eventually overcame them, with the help of God. She describes her success through the acronym STABLE, writing in a conversational, heart-felt tone that makes it easy to get to know her and to join in her journey toward heaven on earth. Heres what STABLE means:S.T. = Sound Thoughts, which is much more than just positive thinking. Lewis teaches that we should treat the harmful thoughts which pervade our brains as unwelcome enemies, to be chased away and replaced. Happiness is attainable, and one secret lies in the awareness of an afterlife, as it will someday offer us a feeling of incredible joy. This Lewis deduces from her research into near-death experiences.A.B. = Always Believe, by which she means belief in God. Lewis thinks atheism is silly, that it is impossible for life to begin without a creator, and she assumes that this creator is a loving intelligence, a personal God interested in our well-being. STABLE depends upon faith in God, finding a deeper meaning and divine plan in every circumstance. The meaning of life can be summed up in one phrasewe are here to love and to help othersand God is our ever-present strength. Says Lewis, I ask God for everything. I talk to Him about everything.L.E. = Life of Excellence, the result of focusing our life on others. The excellence in our lives is determined by how we treat each other, how we treat animals, how we treat the earth, and so on. It is a result of living as though heaven were on earth, and it is not merely a switch we can flip on. Practice, perhaps years of practice, is required. Lewis refers to the research of Dr. Martin Seligman, who finds that altruism, volunteering, donating to charities, and helping others is what leads to what he calls Authentic Happiness. It is by giving of ourselves that we achieve joy.Lewis then begins to steer a bit off course, as she encourages us to chase our dreams as part of the Life of Excellence. The idea is that God has ordained a particular life for us from an early age, perhaps revealed to us by childhood dreams, and we should hold tight and pursue them. When heaven has a plan for you, God will not allow you to look back, so we must work toward our goals and achieve our individual purpose. To be honest, this new emphasis didnt seem to me to fit the live for others mold of STABLE. Anyway, setting that asideEncouraging and inspirational, this is a book worth reading.Inspiring Voices,  2012, 171 pagesISBN: 978-1-4624-0471-1","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2KCF7EDUZCF12/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1462404715#wasThisHelpful","R2KCF7EDUZCF12","A1TJPQDW2GB5X8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TJPQDW2GB5X8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Yes, Jesus lived, hes no myth  but hes not who you think. Daniel Unterbrink is a retired forensic auditor who turned his analytical prowess to uncovering the real Jesus.In this fascinating, controversial study, Daniel equates Jesus with Judas the Galilean (not Judas the betrayer of Jesus), and he equates Paul with Saul the Herodian, both from the writings of Josephus. The Fourth Philosophy that Josephus writes about is what we scholars refer to as the Jesus Movement. The famed Testimonium Flavianum in Josephuss Antiquities is authentic, but its not about Jesus; it was originally about the death of Judas the Galilean. These corrections to our understanding shift parts of the Gospel story back about a decade, and shift other parts forward a couple generations to the time of the war of Jerusalem in 67-73 CE.Unterbrink leans on the combatant tone of some of Pauls letters toward the Jerusalem Christians as he builds his theory. He escalates the known friction between Paul and the Judaizers (primarily James, the brother of Jesus/Judas), presenting it as deadly antagonism. He notes how the book of James opposes Pauline writings, and suggests that the enemy of god in James 4:4 is none other than Paul, who once was a follower of the Jesus Movement (the Fourth Philosophy) but strayed  or was ousted. He sees two distinct churches that share little commonality: the Jewish Jesus movement centered in Jerusalem with James in control, and the Pauline Christ movement among the Gentiles.So if the Jesus story is founded on Judas the Galilean, where did the gospel story come from? Unterbrink suggests it may have been dreamed up by Paul, who was actually still alive after the war of 70 CE. Paul contributed to (or perhaps himself wrote) the Gospel of Mark, and the other three gospels built upon Pauls foundation. The evidence? Much of the Jesus story sounds more like Paul than any other historical character. Heres an interesting twist that comes about when the Bible is read this way: when the crowd calls for the release of Barabbas instead of Jesus, they are calling for the release of Judas Barabbas, and selecting Jesus (Paul) to be crucified. Paul sounds a little whiny about the whole thing in his letters, but he does come out on top  thanks in no small part to the destruction of the Jewish temple in 70 CE.The gospels of Matthew and Luke were likewise written by followers of Paul, who reworked the story of Marks Gospel to fit their audience. Unterbrink suggests that Luke wrote his gospel with Matthew in hand, and that the contradictions between Matthew and Luke (such as birth narratives and resurrection appearances) merely reflect Lukes willingness to change the story willy-nilly as needed for his own agenda. This negates the need for a Q document.Unterbrink relies heavily on a controversial document known as the Slavonic Josephus, which, when first discovered, was thought to be a translation of Josephus from Aramaic, but which few modern scholars any longer consider genuine. Unterbrink recognizes that the book is a Christianized version of Josephuss Antiquities, dating to the eleventh or twelfth century. Nevertheless, he does find some fascinating and relevant passages in the SJ to further his research.My thoughts on the whole matter? I have a few difficulties with Unterbrinks portrayal of Paul and his beliefs. For example, Unterbrink thinks the virgin birth stories in Matthew and Luke reflect Pauls methodology, but it seems clear to me that Paul never imagined a supernatural birth. And for all the devious, dastardly deeds of both the Saul/Paul movement and the Jesus movement, we somehow wound up with a pretty compassionate set of scripture. I loved studying all the comparisons, but Im not sure they are more convincing than the similarities to other historic figures uncovered by other scholars. The focus on Judas and Paul as Jesus doppelgangers is entertaining, but it seems to me that if we are going to go looking for parallel figures, parts of the Jesus story could just as easily be founded on Jesus, son of Ananus (another figure from Josephus who prophesied against Jerusalem), or the healer Hanina ben Dosa, or any of several pagan gods. The scriptures are a great mystery.I believe this is a five-star book which repeats itself for emphasis a bit too much. Too scholarly for an easy read, Unterbrink could probably put more trust in his readers to study carefully, and condense the book by about one third. Nevertheless, I really enjoyed the read.Bear & Company,  2014, 365 pagesISBN: 978-1-59143-182-4","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2XFGYG20YQCA0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1591431824#wasThisHelpful","R2XFGYG20YQCA0","A1TJPQDW2GB5X8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TJPQDW2GB5X8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a verse-by-verse commentary on everything in Revelation outside the letters to the churches. As a writer about Revelation myself, I must begin by pointing out how differently Kessinger and I read the Book of Revelation. Please pardon my upcoming rantanyone who submits a book about Revelation to The Dubious Disciple can expect some critical analysis, habecause Kessinger really does provide solid research, and I dont want to leave the impression that its unscholarly. Tony holds a Ph.D. in religion, has taught more than 1800 pastors and church workers on five continents, and has published twice before.Kessinger subscribes to a premillennialist view. He bemoans the way some scholars interpret Revelation too symbolically, and encourages us to read the words literally unless they cannot be taken as such. But if I follow his advice, noting the repeated promise that all would be fulfilled immediately, it would destroy Kessingers theme of things that must take place, replacing it with things that took place as promised, or maybe things that were promised but failed to take place. See verses 22:7, 22:10, 22:12, 22:20, 1:7, 3:11, and 11:17 plus a host of verses written in a tone of urgency to a first-century audience. A common promise made by Christ in Revelation is Behold, I come quickly. Kessinger largely ignores these, except to point out that since a long period of time has already gone by, our interpreterswho all use words like quickly or soon or pronto for the Greek word tachyshould substitute suddenly, as this word at least preserves the possibility of a 2,000 year wait. This odd substitution appears to me unwarranted, given the way the word tachy is used everywhere else in scripture. So, its hard for me to take the timing of Kessingers interpretation seriously.Kessinger could come clean about the immediacy of Revelations message and its first-century setting if he wished; he just doesnt. For example, he discusses how Antiochus IV serves as a typology of the antichrist to come, showing his appreciation for the historical setting of the book of Daniel, but neglects to do the same with Revelations ancient nemesis. The Beast of the Sea, according to the best Revelation scholars both conservative and liberal, is primarily identified as Roman emperor Nero Caesar. 666 = Nero Caesar, NRWN QSR, in the cryptology often used in religious writings of the first century. Much of the book of Revelation is about Nero Caesar. Hes the antichristic figure of the first century, the hated enemy of Christians, and the immediate threat John was warning about back then. This is all well-known today, and since no scholar of Revelation could possibly be unaware of Neros role, Kessingers refusal to even mention Nero betrays his one-sided interpretation.In another example, Kessinger notes how Revelation chapter 9 is reminiscent of a volcanic eruption. Well, of course it is! Revelation was probably written just after perhaps the most famous volcanic eruption of all time; an eruption near Rome that buried an entire city (Pompeii) and spread famine for thousands of miles. An eruption so extreme that it happens somewhere on earth only about once every thousand years. How could any first-century Mediterranean apocalyptic book not be influenced by the eruption of Vesuvius?Of course, Kessinger doesnt consider Revelation to be apocalyptic. He considers all the other books like Revelation, written in the same time period, to be apocalyptic; just not Revelation. Its special I guess  from the mind of God, Kessinger decides, not the mind of man, I assume because it eventually snuck into the Christian canon. This insistence that Revelation is in a genre of its own creates a problem. Kessingers research is deep and illuminating, but his modus operandi contains a weakness, which nearly cost him a five-star rating: He ignores a great deal of extra-canonical Jewish writings which can shed a lot of light on Revelations nuances. (I also felt like dropping one star when he asked us to tell our families about their fate of being eaten by birds if they dont repent, but one isolated bit of hellfire evangelism can be forgiven, ha! This is, after all, the book of Revelation!)Now on to the good side. Though Kessingers approach is blatantly canonical and futuristic, I nevertheless enjoyed it a lot. The insights are fresh and well-presented; not merely a rehash of other publications. The discussion of Antiochus IV as a typology was particularly well-done, and the comparison of the plagues of Egypt (from the book of Exodus) to the tribulations of Revelation is fascinating. As much as Ive studied Revelation, Ive never carried the comparison to Egypts plagues as far as Kessinger, so it definitely helped my understanding. Kessingers in-depth study of the Church as the Bride of Christ was also helpful (though its not emphasized as such in Revelation).Though I hope this isnt the only book you read about Revelation, I definitely recommend it for a premillennial view! Very good, if a little confusing about the timing of events in places. (Kessinger recognizes Revelations confusing order, and presents a chronological order of events in an appendix.)CrossBooks,  2013, 295 pagesISBN: 978-1-4627-3432-0","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3BG808G915W67/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1462734324#wasThisHelpful","R3BG808G915W67","A1TJPQDW2GB5X8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TJPQDW2GB5X8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"An excellent little book covering the major heretics of the first five centuries. The authors do not try to present these men as evil or anti-Christian at all. On the contrary, they were sincere people trying to understand the Christian faith in their own context, asking important questions and seeking to lead others to what they took to be a fuller understanding of the Gospel. The authors eventually describe a heretic as a person who carries one truth about God too far, such that it distorts other doctrine. For example, who can comprehend the Trinity? The divine mystery gets out of balance by focusing too heavily on any one aspect.Youll see how Marcions early ideas shaped Christianity; heretical views did serve a role in sharpening Christian theology. Youll learn how Augustine battled Pelagius. Youll learn about the Ebionites, Docetists, Gnostics, and Montanists. Youll learn how Christology developed and the Trinitarian battles, which the authors explain with a cute baseball analogy.All of this is extremely well-written, informative yet friendly. The book goes into just enough theology as necessary to paint a descriptive picture of each Christian offshoot.

"Can Gods existence be proven by logic? Demaree takes a shot at it, by providing a reasonable argument for the existence of a being who dispensed to us a moral law. Demaree calls this being God and assumes him to be our creator. He then takes a leap of logic:It is highly probable that the Biblical God is the God who wrote objective morality into our mind. Objective moral principles and the Biblical commandments written into our mind are similar, if not identical.From this foundationthat we have proven God exists, and is the God of the BibleDemaree begins his discussion. But this argument is not convincing to anyone who is not already persuaded. For example, the issue of gay rights easily defeats his argument. Got no religion to taint your opinion? Then you typically have no moral problem with gays. Thus, any universal morality that exists today accepts gay relationships. Yet the Biblical God, in Leviticus, holds a different moral standard:  If a man lies with a man as one lies with a woman, both of them have done what is detestable. They must be put to death. I bring up this example not because Demaree shares any opinion about gay rights in his book (he doesnt)  but because this simple example disproves Demarees argument that objective moral principles agree with Biblical commandments. If there is a moral law inside us, it contradicts the Bible, so if a moral law does prove the existence of God, it simultaneously excludes the Biblical God as a candidate. Oops.Unfortunately, the scientific discovery process promised by the books title ends after a few pages of this flawed argument. Demaree then turns a bit preachy and remains that way to the end. I scanned the rest, but could not get interested after the topic of the title was left behind. All in all its not a bad book, actually quite inspirational in places, as Demaree focuses on Gods attributes of love and mercy, but it just wasnt what I was expecting to read.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R15WYGP0BO40HG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IJ5DMIK#wasThisHelpful","R15WYGP0BO40HG","A1TJPQDW2GB5X8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TJPQDW2GB5X8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Wanna meet the real Jesus? From page one, I was hooked by Nehrers jaded dismissal of believers and scholars alike, and his promise of delivering the real Jesus. Nehrer, the mystic, reveals Jesus, the visionary  and he does it entertainingly well.Nehrer is not religious, and finds no value in the Bible (other than as a historical oddity) outside the parables of Jesus. No sugar-coating, here. But dont let Nehrers self-aggrandizing style turn you off. He over-values his credentials a bitfor example, his mystical background allows him to see clearly what Jesus meant with his parablesand thus commits the same error he warns us against: perceiving Jesus through the lens of his own worldview. But theres nothing wrong with a little positive endorsement, right?Nehrer promotes embracing Oneness, by which he means the connection between Self and experienced Reality. He prefers the term Clear Awareness for seeing deep into the Oneness and understanding how life works. That was Jesus insight: he understood life.140 pages into the book, it shifts unexpectedly into a fictional narrative of Jesus lost years. Jesus is a smart, hard worker able to contribute at multiple jobsites, but he is driven to keep moving and learning. Nehrer feels he is uniquely qualified to take a stab at reconstructing where Jesus wanderlust carries him, because of his own extensive travel and spiritual journey as a young man. This fictional account continues for roughly 200 pages, and was my favorite part of the book, as Nehrers fiction is quite engaging.In Nehrers recreation, Jesus is self-confident, not a goody-goody but quite likeable. He speaks in religious language when necessary, perhaps inventing a Heavenly Father image to help his listeners displace the vindictive, judgmental Yahweh. His vision is encapsulated in what he calls the Kingdom of God, describing (you guessed it) how life really works, but his greater knowledge is so contrary to the established religious regimeparticularly the Temple classand so difficult for everyday people to grasp that he struggles to make progress, and is eventually put to death.A final section then discusses how Christianity was born out of the misunderstood message of Jesus. An interesting take on the life of Jesus, but far from the direction my own studies have led me.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2OHYLX762ZDCF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1782795480#wasThisHelpful","R2OHYLX762ZDCF","A1TJPQDW2GB5X8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TJPQDW2GB5X8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We love this scale! It's attractive, sleek, large enough for a man's feet, and easy to read with large LED numerals. It takes four triple-A batteries, which are included. It seems to weigh consistently no matter your posture ... so long as you stand still. Until you quit shifting your weight, it cannot zero in on a measurement, but once it does, it blinks to show a completed reading.The scale measures to the tenth of a pound, though I'm not convinced it's accurate to quite that level. If I step off and back on, it usually weighs precisely the same, and if I pick up another item (weighing, let's say, one pound) it then measures exactly one pound more. However, repeated testing shows that it will differ by up to .2 pounds. Since I've yet to see a reading with an odd number of tenths of a pound, I think it measures to the nearest 2/10ths of a pound, and does so within a .2 pound margin of error. Not bad at all!!We were provided a free scale to provide an honest review, and found it to be of high quality, very easy to recommend.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2N80ZDXU3NUIM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IFRZVQI#wasThisHelpful","R2N80ZDXU3NUIM","A1TJPQDW2GB5X8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TJPQDW2GB5X8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have huge respect for Craig Keeners work ever since his 2003 two-volume commentary on the Gospel of John. It was largely instrumental in researching for my own book about Johns Gospel, and I believe has become the primary resource for Johannine studies. So when IVP sent me this brand new second-edition 800-page New Testament commentary, I was quite excited.As a reference book, it doesnt disappoint. Scholarly and interesting, each book of the New Testament is given a short introduction detailing authorship and setting, and then a verse-by-verse commentary. The verses are clustered and topical, so its easy to page through the book looking for topics of interest. Be aware that Keeners emphasis differs from other commentaries; he is less interested in providing simple exegesis than in painting a picture of the first-century setting whereby a saying or statement can be understood. Note the title: this is a Bible Background Commentary. It is about the cultural background and what was going on in Bible days that colored the writings we read two thousand years later.Its this focus that gives this reference book its unique niche. A few examples of Keeners focus will help explain what makes this a must-have resource for sermon development or (in my case) writing Bible commentary:Matthew 5:22, about the fires of Gehenna for someone who calls his brother a fool: Keener doesnt delve into the history of Gehenna but speaks to its metaphorical meaning as the opposite of paradise, and how some Jewish teachers envisioned eternal torture while others believed the wicked would be burned up.Acts 2:1-4, about the arrival of the Holy Spirit: Keener explains the Jewish anticipation of the return of the Spirit and its outpouring as a sign of the Messianic age.1 Corinthians 11:14-15, about a woman wearing long hair as a head covering, while long hair on a man is a disgrace: Keener points out how ancient writers, especially Stoic philosophers, loved to make arguments from nature. Nature taught them that men could grow beards, but womens hair naturally seemed to grow longer. Paul is well aware of the exceptions to the rule (such as the Nazirites)  but draws on this observation more to make a point than to instruct his readers in how to wear their hair.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1AGE9P7Y3IBGI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0830824782#wasThisHelpful","R1AGE9P7Y3IBGI","A1TJPQDW2GB5X8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TJPQDW2GB5X8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Will the Antichrist never quit dogging us?This is a fascinating peek into Americas obsession with the Antichrist, from the time of our founding as a nation until today. While the Bible speaks of antichrists in only two short booksFirst and Second Johnand while these passages refer only to people who have already lived, fundamentalist churches 2,000 years later still anticipate the arrival of a demonic force akin to Revelations Beast of the Sea. This Antichrist may take the form of an organization, like the Catholic Church, or a person, like Mussolini, depending upon whoever is in the news at the time. In latter times, the Antichrist has been discovered in computers, bar codes, rock music and the Susan B. Anthony coin.Fuller is an oft-published professor of religious studies at Bradley University, and his writing style is precise and engaging. He carries us through dozens of Americas apocalyptic enemies, so-named the Antichrist by vigilant stalkers of the Beast, going clear back to King George III in 1777. Yankees, Masons, liberals, communists, Catholics, unions, feminists, socialists, modernists, few people have escaped demonization by various clergy in the cosmic war of good versus evil. Popes, world leaders, diplomats and too-liberal preachers are identified by name. Just wars are fought under the banner of God, spurred by apocalyptic lyrics such as the Battle Hymn of the Republic. Entire nations are portrayed as evil empires, even from the presidential pulpit, compared to the Gog of Ezekiel and Revelation. Charles Taylor solved the sinister mystery of Gog: Gromkyo, Ogarkov and Gorbachev, with that birthmark on the latters head surely disclosing his beastly identity.Beware anyone preaching tolerance, advocating pluralism, striving for universal brotherhood, saving the whales, or hoping for world peace. Fuller rightfully observes in the final line of his book that this relentless obsession with the Antichrist appears to have done more to forestall than to signal the realization of the Kingdom of God on earth.Written before the turn of the century, Fullers book surely struck a chord with readers mystified by the manic draw of the millennium end. At the time, over half of adult Americans expected the imminent return of Jesus, accompanied by the fulfillment of cataclysmic biblical prophecies including the appearance of Revelations Beast. The whole obsession would be comical to me, had it died before my own lifetime, but when Fuller got to the 70s the tone turned somber. I remember the panic over communism, the demonization of Kissinger,  and Gorbachevs antichristic delusion that peace was possible. I remember counting the letters in Ronald Wilson Reagan to reach 666. I remember when Greece became the tenth member of the EEC, completing the ten horns of Revelations beast. Had the rediculousness ended with the printing of 2001 calendars, I could write it all off as the nonsense of a prior age, but it hasnt. Our newest president has far and wide been the subject of this same religious madness.The Antichrist may never fade away, but thank goodness for reasonable studies like this one to help us understand and cope with this odd cultural phenomenon in the United States.

"The firstborn of thy sons shalt thou give unto me. Exodus 22:29Did Israel at one time offer child sacrifice to God? If so, when and how did they overcome this barbaric ritual?Levenson takes seriously the hints throughout the Bible that Israelites once condoned child sacrifice to Yahweh, though he doubts its practice was widespread. The firstborn belonged to God, and the most pious parents considered the most appropriate means of giving him to God was in sacrifice. Levenson argues that the phrase beloved son (yahid) seems to have been, at least on occasion, a technical term for the son sacrificed as a burnt offering. This practice was roundly condemned by the prophets Jeremiah and Ezekiel, and in time worshipers began to understand that God would accept animal sacrifice in place of ones favored son. The story of Abraham and Isaac is a key example.Sibling rivalry is a common Old Testament theme, reinforced often by the outward favoring by the parents of one son over another. One would imagine the beloved son to be the firstborn, with all the privileges that go with that station, but the Bible breaks the rules often. Abel over Cain, Isaac over Ishmael, Jacob over Esau, Joseph, David, the list goes on. The beloved son is not only favored by parents but God-chosen, and belongs to God  either in sacrifice or by atonement.This theme of the sacrificial death of the beloved son was never purged from the Judaic mindset, even to the point of believing Abraham did put the knife to Isaac. Many midrashic interpretations of the sacrifice of Isaac refer to his blood being spilled. Perhaps all of his blood, depending upon which midrashic commentary you read.Intelligent, deeply researched, and reasonable, this is a look at just about every beloved son in the Bible except the one you expect: Jesus. It goes without saying that Jesus is the ultimate beloved son, but he gets only a brief nod here and there. Still, this book will inevitably make you think differently about what the death of Jesus meant. There is a bit of New Testament theology thrown in, but the focus is really the development of a theme through the Old Testament  the theme of giving the one you love most to God.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RBRGGDRSQVBK5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0300065116#wasThisHelpful","RBRGGDRSQVBK5","A1TJPQDW2GB5X8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TJPQDW2GB5X8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Surprisingly, this book provides precisely what the title promises. Its in three parts:I. Can we do without religion?II. Does God exist?III. Can there be an atheist spirituality?In Part I, Andre argues that humanity survives on the same moral, spiritual, and cultural values that religion cultivates, but that religion itself is unnecessary. Religion doesnt provide the basis for our morals, but rather our morals provide the basis for religion. We do have a foundational need for our spiritual well-being, but Andre shows these basic needs to be communion, fidelity, and love  of which atheists can partake without entering a church building.Part II you may skip with no feelings of regret. Its a rehash of various arguments against God, and refutations of the common arguments for God, and there is not enough depth nor originality here to bother with.Part III makes up for the lazy part II, by exposing both the smallness and the awesomeness of our being. Just staring at the stars is a religious experience. Sensing nature in all its immensity helps the spirit break free, at least partially, of the tiny prison of the self. What a relief, when the ego is driven away and nothing remains but the All, the enormous thereness of being!Why would you need a God? The universe suffices. Why would you need a church? The world suffices. Why would you need faith? Experience suffices. Says Andre, the certainty that you cannot fall out of the universe, the sense of being at one with the All  never have I experienced anything more powerful, more delightful, more overwhelming and more soothing.It turns out that atheist spirituality is as experiential and meaningful as promised, but the training course may be more cerebral than fulfilling. You have to dive below the surface or get trapped in a head bubble, trying to oppose sophistry with rationalism and nihilism with humanism or some such similar commandment. I suppose thats a struggle with any worthwhile philosophy.Fun book, written with wit and intelligence, and which does indeed titillate your spiritual side without looking to God.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R26STH0Z4T9YAM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0143114433#wasThisHelpful","R26STH0Z4T9YAM","A1TJPQDW2GB5X8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TJPQDW2GB5X8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I doubt anybody needs an introduction to Saint Augustine, the 4th century Bishop of Hippo. Augustine preached for perhaps 30 years and authored over 100 titles. But if you want a quick overview of his life and spiritual growth, without getting bogged down in theological discussion, this is a friendly little book. This is my first Armchair Theologians book, and Im impressed.Cooper follows the lead of Augustines most famous work, Confessions, most of which is autobiographical, to tell the story of his life. Augustines other most famous work, his massive City of God, gets a brief nod in the final chapter. I found that Cooper provided a proper balance to the influences and motivations of Augustines life: his closeness with his mother, his relationships and later determined abstinence, his foray into Manicheism, and his resultant theology of grace. A proper perspective helps overcome the shallow perception that Augustine was wracked with guilt over what he considered a terribly sinful life. Augustine did indeed condemn his youthful actions, but they hardly ranked very high on the sin scale, and he comes across in this book as much more reasonable, merely cognizant of his shortcomings.This is not to say his denunciation of Manicheism and acceptance of Christianity was an easy one. He quickly grasped the untruths of astrology and other competing life views, and saw Christianity as the one true way, but was unwilling. One day, before feeling any strong conviction toward Christianity and feeling unfulfilled, he picked up a Bible and it opened to this passage:Not in revelry and drunkenness, not in chambering and shamelessness, not in strife and envying, but put on the Lord Jesus Christ and make no provision for the flesh Romans 13:1314He needed to read no further. His past ways were put behind him, and he found the strength to overcome his sinful naturemost of which amounted to a youthful lust for women. Augustines reputation as one who condemned the evils of sex (that whole original sin thing, you know) is somewhat deserved, but to be fair he was a product of his Christian times. The connection between Christianity and a preference for the virginal or celibate life was not something he or his generation manufactured. Christian asceticism traces its origins to the practices of Jesus and Paul, who were themselves both celibates. By Augustines time, this strain of religiosity was in full bloom, and he strove to overcome his slavery to lust.The majority of Coopers book, then, is of the formative years of Augustines journey, with little attention given to his time as Bishop of Hippo. Fun and engrossing, this is an easy book to recommend.This book was provided for review by Logos Bible Software and read on their mobile e-book software.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2XLLP3EQGU8FT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0664223729#wasThisHelpful","R2XLLP3EQGU8FT","A1TJPQDW2GB5X8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TJPQDW2GB5X8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Gordon Dyes new book (which is only part 1 of a 4-part series) is meant to help us think humbly but responsibly. Some questions we have no justification to pretend certainty about. His playground for the topic is religion, which is a perfect arena, since we all think we know all about God.Dyes point is that we dont. Not really. And suppositions compound, so that as we add assumptions on top of assumptions, the probability of accuracy continues to decrease. Yet religious people tend to define certainty in a way that questioning the possibility of error threatens their religious beliefs.So Dye introduces what he calls a certainty notation early in the book, and from that point on, he labels each of his suppositions/projections/claims with his level level of certainty. These notations are (without getting into details):C1 = possibleC2 = probableC3 = extremely probableC4 = certainC5 = true by definitionBrilliant! I wish all religious writers would do the same. This methodology definitely reinforces the concept of absence of certainty. Of course, Dyes level of certainty often differed from mine; what he feels certain about at the level of C3 or C4 I would measure a C1 or C2. Im a more practiced agnostic than he, ha.The point, however, is that C1 through C3no matter how probableshould be categorized in our brain separately from the known facts. That way, when we build upon the foundations of our assumptions, we know which foundations are shaky. Dye uses this approach to discuss the authority of scripture, the need for an afterlife if God is fair, the appropriateness of exclusivity, and the concept of good and evil, among other things.I admit, I kept waiting for Gordon to get to the point. Cant we use these techniques to answer some of the big questions about God? Can we at least decide on the odds of whether theres life after death? No, sorry, Gordon never goes there; he merely uses God as a basis for conversation, beginning with assumptions about His existence, approachability and moral fiber in order to provide practice of thinking without certainty. Dyes most significant conclusion so far is that pluralism is logical. If this book sets the groundwork for more in-depth exercises in later books, then maybe well attack the harder questions later.This book (part 1) is a bit slow, spending an inordinate amount of time on definitions and ideas, so Im hoping for more engrossing discussion from of the next three books.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R34MBJSGRFJ7Z8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=147872143X#wasThisHelpful","R34MBJSGRFJ7Z8","A1TJPQDW2GB5X8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TJPQDW2GB5X8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In case you misread the subtitle, thats physicists, not psychics!Ive seen them myself: arguments from modern physics that prove the existence of the Spirit (or some metaphysical phenomenon that justifies our spirituality or transcendentalism). Ive seen the opposite, too: arguments from modern physics that debunk spirituality.So Wilbers book should be a hit. What do our best mindsthe people who actually understand the physics of Quantum Theory, Relativity, and morehave to say on the topic? Youll recognize a lot of the names in this book: Einstein, Schroedinger, Heisenberg, Bohr, Eddington, Pauli, Plank and more. This is a collection of essays by these men, with brief editing and an introduction by Ken Wilber.Wilber culls the writings of these great minds to uncover their opinions, and discovers that they are virtually unanimous in the opinion that modern science can offer no support for mysticism in any variety. And yet they are all mystics of one sort or another! They simply do not believe modern physics can fully describe the universe we live in. Modern physics isnt in opposition to spirituality, it is simply indifferent to it. Eddington explains: We have learnt that the exploration of the external world by the methods of physical science leads not to a concrete reality but to a shadow world of symbols, beneath which those methods are unadapted for penetrating.If I had to choose a favorite essay, it would be In the Mind of Some Eternal Spirit by Sir James Jeans. Science is not yet in contact with ultimate reality, Jeans insists, and this is no surprise. Any meaning that the universe as a whole may have, would entirely transcend our terrestrial experience and so be totally unintelligible to us. The universe is a mathematical construct butand dont eschew the profundity of this claimthe mathematics enters the universe from above instead of from below. Jeans pictures the universe as consisting of pure thought. While Jeans may be the most daring of the bunch, the dualism of mind and matter is nevertheless a common theme.Fascinating book which starts a bit slow (after a great introduction) and builds from there.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2D6M4MPCB1A22/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1570627681#wasThisHelpful","R2D6M4MPCB1A22","A1TJPQDW2GB5X8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TJPQDW2GB5X8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Caution to readers of this review: As a liberal Christian who promotes liberal Christian books, I am a wolf in sheeps clothing who will be held accountable by God for deceiving Christians. That is Laura Daviss reckoning, who calls for Christians to rightly discern doctrine by making sure it aligns with scripture.Dont worry, I didnt just offend my new acquaintance. Davis actively promotes stringent intolerance as a Godly virtue, and couldnt have picked a better book of the Bible for her foundation: that intolerant book of Revelation. Had she been writing about Johns Gospel, I could not have given it four stars. Her stance is quite consistent with the scriptures she reviews, and I appreciate that. Still, I doubt she realized my deep liberal stance before passing her book to me for review, nor did I realize her deep conservative stance when I requested it.He Who Has an Ear covers the seven letters to the seven churches in chapters 2 and 3 of Revelation, and Davis provides a thorough exposition. I also have studied these letters, and the history of the cities to which they are addressed, so I can vouch for her accuracy and depth of research. Not so much for her Greek translation of words like apoktein. The writing is interesting and engaging, so I enjoyed the book.Davis then goes a step further and considers the impact of these letters, their promises and warnings, to todays world. They were all written to churches which no longer exist, but might the letters have more relevance than we think 2,000 years later? Do you see your own church in any of them? (Yes, Laura, I do  I grew up in the church at Ephesus.) If so, the warnings of Jesus should be carefully heeded.One place where I felt Daviss treatment didnt quite jibe with Revelation was her assumption that the gospel is about going to heaven. That the book of life is a list of people going to heaven. As best I can tell, Revelation doesnt say anything at all about going to heaven, and instead suggests the afterlife will be lived on earth.Then Laura begins chapter twelve with the words I dont think this chapter is going to win me any friends. Its her Wolves in Sheeps Clothing List, where she lists the worst offenders by name. This chapter, too, is quite within the spirit of Revelations letters, where John of Patmos invokes the authority of God to condemn both churches and individuals: Balaam, Jezebel, the Nicolaitans. Lauras list of baddies includes Joel Osteen, Kenneth Copeland, Benny Hinn, Rob Bell, and lots more.I confess that I can find nothing very Christlike in a prosperity gospel (that would be folks like Joel Osteen), but Id also be remiss if I didnt challenge Daviss conservative Bible understanding, since she makes it such a personal matter. Davis is fascinated that Rob Bell ignores all mentions of hell in the Bible, and wonders how he reconciles scriptures like Matthew 10:28, Matthew 23:33, Mark 9:43, Revelation 20:15. The answer is, Bell probably reads all of these in the context of first-century idioms and events as Bible scholars should, and recognizes that none of them really have anything to do with the doctrine of eternal punishment. Laura, if you really do want to know why many scholars read scripture differently than you do, Id enjoy chatting with you about it.Davis finally closes her book with precisely the promise made over and over to Revelations audience 2,000 years ago: Jesus is coming soon. A perfect ending. Her book is well-organized, thoughtful, and thought-provoking in a conservative way.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3RMRBGX2I2Y4I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1492125059#wasThisHelpful","R3RMRBGX2I2Y4I","A1TJPQDW2GB5X8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TJPQDW2GB5X8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I really enjoyed this one. I asked for a review copy because I had previously devoured Steve Greggs Revelation: Four Views. This guy is an engrossing writer who gets right to the heart of the matter. While Gregg doesnt entirely mask his own opinion, he does manage to fairly represent several alternative views with these books, and this time around he gives voice to the following opinions about hell:  Traditionalists, who stick with the common view of everlasting conscious torment.  Conditionalists, who argue for annihilation of the sinful. The wages of sin is death.  Restorationalists, who insist that hell is a place of rehabilitation. Everyone will eventually find their way to heaven.Universalists, at least those who reason that for God to be victorious no one could find themselves in hell, are not strongly represented in the book. Hell is too real in scripture to dismiss.Its important to emphasize that all three views are solidly founded in scripture. Lots and lots of scriptural references are provided for each view, and all views have thoughtful, scholarly supporters.Wed all like to know the ultimate truth about hell, but I just dont think the scriptures are in total harmony in this matter. Thats where this study led me, though I doubt thats where Gregg meant to lead. The more I study topics like this, the harder it is to believe in Biblical Inerrancy. I remain baffled as to why otherwise thoughtful Bible scholars rage against the obvious  that doctrinal differences in the Bible are a natural result of differing opinions among the Bibles writers.Nevertheless, this is a book to make you think, and to make you appreciate the richness of the Bible even as it examines the most frightening topic known to man.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 22, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1D02OQRTS8KMC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1401678300#wasThisHelpful","R1D02OQRTS8KMC","A1TJPQDW2GB5X8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TJPQDW2GB5X8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Coffee with Jesus isnt your everyday comic book. You think its easy putting words on the lips of Jesus, while avoiding the sacrilegious? I get the feeling that Wilkie toned it down just a little to take the edge off. He could have been much more pointed. Yet it really is as amusing as it is serious how Jesus pokes holes in our religiosity, just sipping coffee and offering advice. Jesus gentle sarcasm hits the mark time after time.Its a great book, but I have to point out a couple negatives. The print is small, and the same artwork is repeated throughout. Im guessing there are maybe a dozen unique frames throughout the book, which differ only in the words printed underneath the character drawings.  Whenever Joe, the Pastor, turns to look to the right, the part in his hair magically shifts to his left side  the wonders of mirror imaging. Obviously, youre not buying the book for physical humor or captivating artwork. This format works well for a daily publication; not so much for a book, where the repetitiveness may begin to wear on you.Artwork aside, though, youll fall in love with the personalities and their many character flaws. How like you and me they are, and how patient Jesus is with each of them! Definitely a feel-good book, whether or not Wilkie meant it to be!","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 18, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1YJB1SHLICWWE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0830836624#wasThisHelpful","R1YJB1SHLICWWE","A1TJPQDW2GB5X8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TJPQDW2GB5X8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is an introductory philosophy text, complete with worksheets, focusing primarily on the subject of the nature of truth and how we know something to be true. What makes this text unique is that it chooses Christianity for its playground.Do not assume an argument will be presented justifying Christian belief. Apologetics is not the focus at all. The exercises and examples often relate to Christian thinking, but youll find little resolution. In fact, the discussion seems to meander around several philosophy topics without ever zeroing in on any solid answers. The point is to introduce the philosophy of examining truth.Along the way, youll discuss what is means to believe, the nature of religious belief, how God is experienced, providence, cause and effect, dualism, even miracles and the afterlife. Finally, Vick touches on the friction between science and faith, and the role of both. Its an appropriate finish, and the book closes with an enigmatic discovery: One cannot reasonably claim that knowledge results only from one kind of experience, or only from one method of understanding the world. In other words, science and faith should cooperate in the search for truth.My favorite section was a discussion of self-deception. Is such a thing even possible? This topic borders on the psychological. Does anyone ever really hold contradictory beliefs, or does one simply refuse to acknowledge the contradiction?I cant say this book is what I expected, but I did enjoy the study!","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 10, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1JDQ6HDQN85NS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1938434544#wasThisHelpful","R1JDQ6HDQN85NS","A1TJPQDW2GB5X8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TJPQDW2GB5X8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"And we know that all things work together for good to them that love God, to them who are the called according to his purpose. Romans 8:28If ever there was a testament to the comfort of believing in God, this book is it. I cannot share all of Pamelas beliefs (which are too conservative for my taste), but I rejoice in the comfort her God brings into her life, through good times and bad. I cant help but award it five stars: warm, honest and heart-felt, this book is certain inspiration to believers.Pamela tells of outgrowing the solemn way that was a burden to her in her childhood, into a full trust in the boundary-crossing grace of God. She grew up in the same Christian sect as I did, which she calls the One True Way to highlight its exclusiveness. No single belief system is right for everyone, and this one simply could not satisfy Pams spiritual needs. She found the church meetings suppressive and joyless. While she was still a child, a close friend died in an accident, who was outside the exclusive boundaries of the sect. Was this friend going to heaven or not? Pamela was distraught, until one day, God gently pointed out Proverbs 20:11 (Even a child is known by his acts) and Genesis 18:25 (Should not the judge of all the earth do right?) Gods love was greater than she had ever been taught. Still, the emotional turmoil of leaving behind the religious tradition she had been born into was very strong. Telling her parents of her change in beliefs was the hardest thing she ever did.Choose this day whom you will serve. Put away the gods that your fathers served beyond the river and in Egypt and serve the LordJoshua 24:14-15Also hard was the first time Pamela attended another church. All such churches had been condemned by her former belief system. But had she never made the transition away from exclusivism, she would never have been able to draw strength from the God of grace for the greater test around the corner. Her husband contracted cancer, and began slowly wasting away.Romans 8:28 became Pamelas rainbow in a world of pain. The end result of the long, cancerous journey with her Godly husband is this book, about the goodness of God.Definitely recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 7, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R17DB7WB4SVSVA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1907509585#wasThisHelpful","R17DB7WB4SVSVA","A1TJPQDW2GB5X8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TJPQDW2GB5X8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Christian canon refers to that set of scriptures, complete and bounded, that we accept as scripture. Modern Bible scholars often examine the development of the canon from an extrinsic model, noting that the canon was formed over the course of several centuries as the church fathers selected their favorites. Many argue that Irenaeus, in the late second century, was the first to feel the need for an authoritative canon. But what if the selection of accepted writings was more intrinsic  that is, guided from within, rather than from without? What if the New Testament writers themselves understood that they were writing Scripture, and their work was quickly recognized and adopted as such, perhaps with Gods guidance?Kruger doesnt deny the extrinsic claims, that the canon was fluid and argued over for centuries. He simply highlights the evidence that our New Testament writers were knowingly writing Scripture, and our earliest Scripture readers knew it. This Kruger does by critically examining five tenets of the extrinsic model to see if they really do hold water. The five tenets he questions, in five chapters, are:1. We must make a sharp distinction between Scripture and canon.2. There was nothing in earliest Christianity that might have led to a canon.3. Early Christians were averse to written documents.4. The New Testament authors were unaware of their own authority.5. The New Testament books were first regarded as Scripture at the end of the second century.Kruger hits his stride at about chapter three, and it gets stronger from there. So if you find the book winding up a little slowly, I promise itll be slinging fast balls by the end. Krugers research is convincing and well-argued, with generous footnotes. At the very least, this book will make you a believer in the passion and conviction of the New Testament writers, even as they sought to remain anonymous, letting the gospel message speak for itself on its own authority.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 4, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R9SAANJ7U74EC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0830840311#wasThisHelpful","R9SAANJ7U74EC","A1TJPQDW2GB5X8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TJPQDW2GB5X8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Can a downer be a positive reading experience?This is a book that needs to be read, even though its not enjoyable. Its about how to relate positively to those who are going through hard times. How to be a friend in love. Its written from a Christian perspective by an Episcopal priest, but it does not pretend that faith solves all the hard problems.Schmidts younger brother Dave was struck with cancer, and endured seven years of the disease before succumbing to death. Sometimes life just sucks. Hoping for a handy guidebook about what to do in such situations, maybe a collection of pick-me-up promises like God wont give you more than you can endure or at least a cant-fail casserole recipe to bake for a suffering friend, I read all the way through to the end before I finally accepted that I was not going to be given any Biblical solutions for coping or helping another cope. This is just down-to-earth advice on how to validate and share the pain of another. As Schmidt would say, ditch the stained-glass language and learn to walk wounded.And yes, it WAS a frustrating read for me, most of the way. If Im going to endure a downer of a book, cant it just teach me to dispense a little Hallmark wisdom and send me on my way?Perhaps the best advice I gleaned from the first nine chapters (by reading between the lines) is this: When times get tough, go befriend a couple of recovering alcoholics. They understand struggle and neither coddle you nor make light of your pain.Schmidts message finally sank in as I neared the end of the book, with these three strange words: Availability is incarnational. Its really not as cryptic a message as it sounds. After stressing that Jesus interface with humanity was in the fleshincarnationaland after stressing that sincere love is sharing a genuine presence, making oneself available, the advice finally hit home. Theres lots of other advice in the book, of course, this just happens to be the message that finally penetrated for me. The simple secret of dealing with anothers grief, for both your own benefit and that of your friend, is this: Availability is incarnational.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 24, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZPAR6ZF0OE11/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1426755937#wasThisHelpful","RZPAR6ZF0OE11","A1TJPQDW2GB5X8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TJPQDW2GB5X8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Im a fan of Robert Cornwalls writing. Its hard to overrate brevity, common sense, and simple honesty. Last year, one of his books made my Top Ten for 2012: See Faith in the Public Square.In this book, Cornwall tackles the sticky subject of evolution. He writes as a theologian, not a scientist, but as one who recognizes his limited expertise and therefore respects and appreciates the contribution of scientists. Cornwall believes evolution is true not only because our greatest minds have offered convincing explanations, but because they have made great strides in medicine by building atop this biological knowledge. Cornwall believes the war between science and religion harms both sides, and that truth can best be approached by leaving the experts on each side to do their jobs without interference.Cornwall is not alone in this opinion. A few years back, Dr. Michael Zimmerman penned a letter encouraging the compatibility of religion and science, and this letter has now garnered over 10,000 clergy signatures. Evolution Sunday was born, marking the closest Sunday to the birthday of Charles Darwin (February 12th), and at last count nearly 600 churches celebrated this day by using their worship service to address the issue, declaring that evolutionary science and faith are compatible.Worshiping with Charles Darwin is a series of non-technical sermons and essays to that end. Many of the points and themes repeat in multiple sermons/essays, so theres a bit of redundancy, yet I believe this book fills an important niche, with the theologian side of the war respectfully reaching out to make peace.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 19, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1J5NH57KVO5XD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1938434722#wasThisHelpful","R1J5NH57KVO5XD","A1TJPQDW2GB5X8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TJPQDW2GB5X8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This beautiful full-color book highlights the major personalities in Christian development over the last 2,000 years  from A.D. 64 to 2009.Its a short book, so I confess I felt a little frustrated at the lack of depth. The book takes on a little too big a topic for 188 pages of text, and religion is a topic where oversimplifying by bouncing along the surface can distort as much as elucidate. Therefore, to get the full benefit of the book, treat it like an instruction course and take advantage of the internet research suggestions peppered throughout the text. But for my money (for a lot more money, Im sure) Id love to have 600 pages between the covers of this one.One other minor frustration: Jones is a Southern Baptist whose subtle preaching permeates the book. For example, Deism is at least twice referred to as a false doctrine. This is probably just a personal issue, but I find it easier to trust a scholar who does a better job of hiding his own religious bias.With my complaints out of the way, let me say that I thoroughly enjoyed reading the text! Its a fun read, full of tidbits from history and helpful explanations of Christian terms. Every Christian should know at least the basics of Church history, and I definitely recommend this book as an entertaining stepping stone to whet your appetite for further in-depth reading.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 16, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R31ZL5F46356M7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1596363282#wasThisHelpful","R31ZL5F46356M7","A1TJPQDW2GB5X8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TJPQDW2GB5X8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Are you into graphic novels? I've never considered them my thing, always picturing such texts as little more than a comic book. So I was surprised to enjoy this one as much as I did.A graphic novel attempts to communicate on a different level, with penetrating images. The artistic lines and colors, at least in this book, are vibrant, stark, evocative, powerful ... this is a visual journey with a serious tone.Messiah: Origin is the beginning of the gospel story, from the birth of Jesus through the ministry of John the Baptist. I presume it's the first publication of a series. What sets this ""novel"" apart is that it contains no words except as translated directly from the Greek of the New Testament. It is a narrative harmony of the four Gospels, translated by Mark Arey, a Greek Orthodox clergyman, arranged in story form by Matt Dorff, and illustrated by Kai Carpenter ... an effective partnership.Definitely recommended as an enjoyable and moving story, though anticlimactic ...

"ARE YOU KIDDING ME? Where has this been all my life???We typically cook with time.  We use a heat source much hotter than we want the food to be. Nobody wants a casserole to actually reach 375 degrees. We all know what happens if it does.We want it to maybe get to 150-160, and then take it out of the overheated oven. Timing is critical to avoid undercooking or overcooking.With sous vide, you cook with temperature, not time. You use a water bath at a precisely controlled temperature.  This is the temperature that you want your food to achieve (all the way through). So you CANNOT overcook your food, because it will never get hotter than the bath. You CANNOT undercook your food if you leave it in the bath for the minimum time. So your food is PERFECT every time.Your idea of ""perfect"" might not be the same as mine.  Expect to do a bit of experimentation at first. If you cook above 130 degrees (F) then your food will never be unsafe - it is considered Pasteurized, and free from any harmful bacteria or parasites (131 degrees is the perfect mid-rare steak, BTW). Once you find YOUR ideal temperature, you can reproduce it EVERY SINGLE TIME without fail.Tough cuts of meat (typically smoked, in BBQ) such as beef brisket, pork shoulder roast (Boston butt), and ribs will be THE MOST TENDER THING YOU HAVE EVER EATEN.  Rib meat literally FALLS OFF THE BONE (try sous vide baby back ribs - pure heaven). Forget about slicing a sous vide pot roast - it crumbles beneath a knife. The cheapest cuts of meat become tender delicacies that your family can't eat fast enough.This is a revolutionary approach to cooking that is NOTHING like regular cooking.  DO NOT TRY THIS AT HOME without some expert guidance.  I am indebted to expert author Jason Logsdon for his book, ""Modernist Cooking Made Easy: Sous Vide: The Authoritative Guide to Low Temperature Precision Cooking"" which I highly recommend. You will learn about the importance (and the method) of searing certain meats to achieve the Maillard reaction (the same reaction that makes golden bread crust so tasty).I created my own sous vide bath ""appliance"" using an Igloo 12-Quart Quantum Cooler. The lid has two molded cup holders. I used a 2.5"" hole saw to drill a hole in one of the holder depressions. This is a perfect fit for the Anova cooker (the black part must be able to ""breathe""). The insulated walls of the cooler make this HIGHLY energy efficient and help maintain the precision temperature.AND HERE'S A FREE BONUS FOR READING THIS FAR: a scientist (me) weighs in on two ""confrontational"" sous vide topics:1) Sear meat BEFORE you sous vide it, not afterward. The scientific rationale:  We don't want to impart any more heat into the meat than necessary to achieve the tasty Mallard reaction.  We want to impart heat only onto the surface, not into the core. It is TRUE that searing cold meat will impart MORE heat into the core (since the thermal gradient is higher, which accelerates heat transfer). However, this heat should fall well below our intended target temperature, so it does not affect the outcome.  HOWEVER, if you prepare the perfect mid-rare steak at 131 degrees and THEN sear it, you will impart SOME additional heat into the core that you do NOT want.  SOME of the meat (near the surface) will exceed the target temperature, and become overcooked.2) You DO NOT need to get the bath to your target temperature BEFORE you begin cooking. You should always start out with fresh hot tap water in your bath. This will already be 120-130 degrees (F). It is ALREADY significantly hotter than whatever you are putting in the bath. Heat transfer begins immediately.  It might take a few minutes more for the bath temperature to stabilize at your target, but the food has been heated the whole time.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1KBVSQF4E3DWD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UKPBXM4#wasThisHelpful","R1KBVSQF4E3DWD","A27KTLDSBWXNED","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A27KTLDSBWXNED?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"These filters work great, but are WAY overpriced.  Here's how to filter your Cat Mate bowl without paying an arm and a leg:The filters have a blue plastic housing that easily snaps apart with a small screwdriver.  If you open it up, you will see that the innards consist of a fibrous filter fabric and some activated charcoal pellets.You can change out these innards for pennies instead of dollars.The fibrous filter fabric can be replaced by HVAC vent register filters (4 x 12), which can be found on Amazon for $3.50 (with Prime shipping) for a dozen.  These filters are exactly the correct width, but are (obviously) too long, so they need to be cut.  You can try scissors, but I could not get satisfactory results.  Instead I used a guillotine paper trimmer with a stop-guard, and was able to quickly and easily create many perfectly sized filters.  A dozen register filters will produce 72 fibrous filters (each register filter will produce six Cat Mate filters).The Cat Mate filters use a pellet form of activated charcoal behind the fibrous filter (pellets are ""tubes"" of activated charcoal, usually more than a half-inch long).  I believe this is a very ineffective filter, especially at such a shallow filter depth (typically just one pellet deep).  Water (and crud) will tend to flow BETWEEN the inevitable gaps between the pellets.  I prefer Marineland GRANULAR activated charcoal, which provides a more dense surface area.I award two stars (instead of one) because these filters do work.  I recommend that you buy at least three of these (one of which came with your Cat Mate bowl).","2.0 out of 5 stars","June 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2GBVHNOQDCLO0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0025YT83E#wasThisHelpful","R2GBVHNOQDCLO0","A27KTLDSBWXNED","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A27KTLDSBWXNED?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

So, overall, the board supports 12 USB 2.0 and four USB 3.0 connectors - impressive.Good placement of main power connectors clears even the largest of heatsink fans (such as my huge Cooler Master Hyper T4 120-mm fan CPU cooler). A large fan will hang over the memory banks, so modules with tall heat spreaders might interfere (my Corsair XMS3 4GB (2x2GB) DDR3 modules fit with about 2mm to spare, but I can't install or swap them with the heatsink installed, so plug in your memory before you mount your heatsink).Support for six SATA ports and easy-to-use BIOS (including multiple boot device selection - hit F12) is really nice.

"I liked every flavor except the chili lime shrimp (way too heavy on fake tasting chili seasoning).  The noodles are the same in every package; the difference is the artificial flavoring powder that is added during preparation.  It's a quick, inexpensive, and satisfying meal, but with little nutritional value (negligible vitamins and minerals).The front of the package warns, ""See nutrition label for sodium content.""  And I saw that the average content was around 960 mg per serving (about 40% of USRDA).  That didn't sound too bad.  EXCEPT, upon closer examination, I see that a ""serving"" is half a pack.  If you eat a whole pack (and, who doesn't?) with the entire seasoning package, you are getting DOUBLE that amount - almost the entire sodium allotment for a whole day.  The directions ""helpfully"" point out that you can reduce the sodium by ""simply"" using less of the seasoning packet (the noodles themselves have very little sodium, and very little flavor).  Well, of course, less seasoning means less flavor.  I used about half of the seasoning, which gave it a little flavor, but still fairly bland.  And, instead of enjoying it like a soup, with the broth, I used a fork and drained the noodles and discarded the leftover broth.It would be SO easy to package the spices and salt separately.  This would give consumers complete control over the sodium content without sacrificing the seasoning and flavor.  That would have won five stars and a glowing review.

"OK, this is strange - I wanted to review the Pepp sticks and the Turkey sticks separately, but the same review shows up on both products.  So I will combine the review:The Pepp sticks are good, but I recommend the Old Wisconsin Turkey Sticks instead.  The taste is VERY similar, but the turkey sticks have half the fat and significantly less sodium (250 mg, compared to 320 mg).The product description says ""No refrigeration required"" but the package says (in bold lettering) ""Refrigerate after opening.""  So the ""no refrigeration"" applies only to the unopened package.

"Really tight compression (which is good), but I bought the largest size and I wear a size 10 shoe.  If my foot were larger, the socks would probably feel too tight.  The graduated compression makes them comfortable to wear for a few hours at a time, but I wouldn't want to wear these for more than three or four hours without taking a break.  They are heavy and durable and look pretty snazzy.  The heavily reinforced heel should contribute to the durability of the product.They're great for people with DVTs (blood clots) which can cause the feet to swell.  But I would recommend a different approach for plantar fasciitis. PF is caused by the Achilles tendon (which runs down the calf) being too tight.  The Achilles tendon (AT) is anchored to the ankle bone, which also anchors the plantar fascia (the thing that hurts).  The AT is much stronger than the PF, so the ankle is pulled backwards and upwards, stretching the PF and causing heel/arch pain.  These socks will lift and support the PF, countering the pull of the AT, which will give relief from heel pain, but it's just treating the symptom (pain) and not treating the problem (the overly-tight AT).  The preferred approach for PT is to stretch out the Achilles tendon to relieve pressure on the ankle.  This is simple to do - if you have stairs nearby, stand on a step and hold the handrail (if you don't have stairs, make do with something you can stand on like s step).  Stand on the front part of your foot, allowing your arch and ankle to hang over the edge.  Slowly allow your heel to drop down and hold it there for three or four minutes.  Do not bounce up and down - keep steady pressure.  This will stretch the Achilles tendon (you will feel a mild burning sensation in your calf).  Discontinue or reduce pressure if you feel pain or burning at the back of your ankle (which tells you you're overdoing it).  Do this two or three times a day and you should experience relief.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1XLWCW9AMFV01/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FFFLNJ2#wasThisHelpful","R1XLWCW9AMFV01","A27KTLDSBWXNED","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A27KTLDSBWXNED?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"OK, maybe I just don't know how to use a double boiler.  I got this pot for a particular recipe.  As I understand it, you put some water in the lower pot, which boils, creating steam, which imparts indirect heat to the upper pot, which holds whatever food you are preparing.  This indirect heat prevents overheating (or very localized heating) for the food in the upper pot.But the two pots fit SO CLOSELY together that DISASTER is the ONLY possible outcome.  The steam builds pressure in the lower pot, but cannot escape, so it forces the upper pot off.  At best, the upper pot is merely displaced, while steam and water pour over the sides of the lower pot.  At worst, the upper pot comes completely off and lands on its side, spilling whatever was in it (this is more likely if the contents of the upper pot were heavier).I'm thinking that the only way to salvage this purchase is to drill some holes in the side of the lower pot, near the bottom of the upper pot, to allow steam to escape.I look at other Amazon reviews, which do not mention this obvious problem, so maybe I don't know how to properly use this pot.

"Editor Alicia von Stamwitz provides a brief introduction to The Spirit of Saint Francis in which she characterizes both Pope Francis and Francis of Assisi. She emphasizes the pope's optimism, courage, and ""playful sense of humor reminiscent of the beloved saint.""The book is divided into 10 chapters, each containing roughly 18 titled, single-page quotations. Chapter themes reflect major principles of Franciscan spirituality such as discover true joy, do not forget the poor, and choose simplicity and humility. Quotations are taken from official Vatican texts of Pope Francis's homilies, speeches, tweets, audiences, prayers, daily meditations, and writing. The source is provided for each.In one entry, the pope outlines his ""ideal"" prayer practice, which includes Lauds, lectio divina, Mass, work, lunch, siesta, Vespers, Office of Readings, afternoon work, Adoration, rosary followed by dinner. ""And then I'm done."" After presenting this schedule, the pope refers to a member of the staff: ""I look at Sandro's face and he laughs and says: `But you don't do this!'"" Francis agrees.Tweets from @Pontifex are sprinkled throughout the book; for example:* Your sins are great? Just tell the Lord: forgive me, help me to get up again, change my heart!""* To be friends with God means to pray with simplicity, like children talking to their parents.* Every Christian can witness to God in the workplace, not only with words, but above all with an honest life.The editor points out the care taken in choosing and arranging the material while reminding readers that no single approach to using the book is better than another. ""Let your experience and curiosity be your guide,"" she writes. ""Trust it, trust yourself, and trust that the message you most need to hear will find you.""","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3VR96OOBKR8OO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1616368594#wasThisHelpful","R3VR96OOBKR8OO","AJ1XY1PK6SROF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJ1XY1PK6SROF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In his latest book, Psychologist Robert J. Wicks addresses spiritual resilience, which he defines as ""bouncing back in a way that deeper knowledge of both God and self may result."" Wicks is best known for his work in integrating psychology and spirituality. His practice is focused on those in the helping professions, including ministry.The central tenet of this work, intended for the general population, is ""Be clear and be not afraid for you are loved by God."" The book is presented as 30 points meant to build greater responsiveness to God and closer solidarity with others. The points are laid out as ""days,"" each beginning with a short phrase and ending with a suggestion or question.The first 14 days, grouped under the heading Spiritual Strength: A Psychological Resource during Difficult Times, address faith, prayer, and spirituality in times of crisis and loss. The next eight days, under the heading Uncovering and Addressing the Enemies of a Healthy Spiritual Psychological Perspective, relate to self-esteem problems; negativity; and anxieties due to inordinate fear of failure, doubt, and change. The final six days, headed Reaching Out...without Being Pulled Down, tackle the issue of preventing burn-out in the process of extending ourselves to others.All three parts of the book have at least one day dedicated to silence and solitude, emphasizing the importance of prayer and listening to God. Other overarching themes include opening our hearts to contemplation and greater appreciation of true simplicity. Wicks offers truly useful insights for everyday seekers in a down-to-earth format based on his own experience and writings of numerous teachers and healers throughout the ages.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3F6NOXDTQMVHY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SHX7IM0#wasThisHelpful","R3F6NOXDTQMVHY","AJ1XY1PK6SROF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJ1XY1PK6SROF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Sacred Silence opens with Phyllis Zagano's observation that we need to ""select among the great kaleidoscope of choices life puts before us in such a way as to fulfill our legitimate desires without disrupting our own or others' lives."" She suggests that the stillness and silence of Lent can help us decide what we need and want. Instead of the typical approach of doing better at something or not doing something at all, she recommends that we practice silence with an open heart before the Lord.Each daily reflection begins with a title, list of Old and New Testament readings, and short quote from the gospel. Next comes a meditation on the gospel that may include a personal example, proposed activity, or simply a deeper look at the passage. The reflection ends with ""A Grace for Today,"" a one-line original prayer.The following points from Wednesday of Holy Week, titled Spy Wednesday, show how it all fits together. The passage from Matthew (26:14-25) addresses Judas's betrayal of Jesus. Zagano recognizes three internal storms: (1) the disciples are confused and frightened, (2) Jesus is devastated, (3) Judas is troubled and will become more disturbed by his action. In our own lives, we experience these same reactions when tempted to sin. ""Evil so often masquerades as some good,"" writes Zagano, and ""Every sin moves us, each and all, further away from life in Christ."" The Grace for Today: Lord, help me understand the nature of sin.""","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R6PKSOJWYEQ3B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1616367180#wasThisHelpful","R6PKSOJWYEQ3B","AJ1XY1PK6SROF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJ1XY1PK6SROF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Introducing his latest book, Pat McCloskey, O.F.M., explains that the phrase ""Peace and Good"" is the greeting Francis of Assisi offered to everyone he met. The daily meditations McCloskey presents are based on writings by and about Francis grouped into 12 topics reflecting Franciscan themes. The monthly format consists of a two-page introduction followed by a page for each day with three sections: (1) a meditation on the theme, (2) Living as Francis Did, and (3) Growing with Francis. These last two, containing only a few lines, connect the teachings of Francis to our own lives.For example, the March section opens with the observation that most popular conversion stories are based on a specific event, such as Francis embracing a leper for the first time. However, McCloskey writes, the encounter with that leper and several other dramatic events in Francis' story were an integral part of a lifelong faith journey.The March 18 meditation, Step by Step, is a letter from Francis in which he asks God to grant ""that we may do for your sake alone what we know you want us to do, and always what pleases you."" Under Living as Francis Did, McCloskey reminds us the interior enlightenment Francis describes takes time. ""The ante keeps going up, so to speak. We are tempted to tell God that we have done enough, that God should count on someone else for whatever may leave our consciences unsettled.""The March 30 meditation, Do It, features an incident in which Francis was flooded by ""a very great sweetness"" that renewed his spirit, seemingly changing him into another man. Under Living as Francis Did, McCloskey addresses this change in Francis: ""He retained his original DNA and fingerprints, but his heart became ever new and young.""Pat McCloskey, O.F.M., a priest since 1975, is a Friar Minor of the Province of St. John the Baptist, headquartered in Cincinnati, Ohio. He serves as Franciscan editor of St. Anthony Messenger where he writes articles, editorials, and the monthly column ""Ask a Franciscan."" He has also written five books and contributed to several others. He holds graduate degrees in ministry, theology, and Franciscan studies.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3H5082RJUDEJQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=161636730X#wasThisHelpful","R3H5082RJUDEJQ","AJ1XY1PK6SROF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJ1XY1PK6SROF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Joyful Sprit of Padre Pio is the fourth book Patricia Treece has written on this southern Italian priest who was canonized in 2002. (Note: Having little knowledge of Pio's life, I found it helpful to search out a dedicated biography on the web to give greater context to ""Joyful Spirit."" At the same time, I knew going in that that Treece wasn't writing a bio, as such, but  offering witness to ""neither Pio's perfection nor to his ordinary spiritual gifts so much as to the richness of his love..."" This book may go beyond the author's specific goal and encourage those unfamiliar with Pio to investigate further.)That aside, Joyful Spirit is rich in detail, starting with background on the ongoing controversy over his stigmata. (On her web site, the author reports that Pio was the first Catholic priest to experience the stigmata.) In the intro to this book, Treece describes efforts to expose Pio as being ""a fake mystic with self-created stigmata wounds. Other analysts, including Catholics who do not believe he is a phony, nevertheless reduce Pio to a very pious soul with a limited neurosis that made him bleed."" Equally inexplicable, and therefore open to speculation by some, were Pio's ability to survive on little sleep and nourishment, ""odors of sanctity"" that sometimes announced his unseen presence, and visible bilocations.Treece concludes that all these factors fall away in light of the Church's rigorous procedures for determining sainthood and examples of everyday occurrences in Pio's life. The Joyful Spirit is presented in eight chapters, each consisting of roughly 25-30 titled meditations made up of stories, letters, and prayers by and about Padre Pio.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2E2ZLKQR0U57D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1616367326#wasThisHelpful","R2E2ZLKQR0U57D","AJ1XY1PK6SROF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJ1XY1PK6SROF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Marcellino D'Ambrosio opens 40 Days, 40 Ways by describing the scriptural basis for Lent from Noah on the ark through the temptation of Jesus in the desert (Luke 4:1-13). The 40 days between Ash Wednesday and Holy Saturday are ""training days,"" he explains. The six Sundays of Lent, always exempt from fasting, are mini-celebrations of Christ's resurrection. This distinction underlies the 40 Days, 40 Ways format. Each Sunday is devoted to a general meditation, but content for the weekdays consists of life-changing actions that can lead to a fuller discipleship.D'Ambrosio provides guidance for using the book to best advantage. Before Lent begins, read the Table of Contents, with its specific daily goals (for example, Day 12: Read a portion of Scripture every day). Praying for guidance from the Holy Spirit, choose up to three items that seem both important and realistic, then read the pages about those activities and commit to following the practice faithfully throughout Lent. Next, commit to reading the appropriate pages every day and trying to carry out the practice at least on that day if not on a more regular basis.Though the activities are presented in random order, I found myself fitting them under the following four themes: prayer and scripture, worship, reaching out, and learning. These are fluid and often overlap. For example, we learn about the works of mercy on Day 10. The action for Day 23 is reach out to the least important, least popular, most ignored..... Day 28: Visit someone lonely in the neighborhood, the hospital, or prison. Day 32: Pray regularly for those whose rights and dignity are trampled and for those responsible for their pain. Look for a way to help. Day 35: Learn the Prayer of Abandonment of Blessed Charles de Foucauld. Surrender your possessions, your future, and your life to God as you slowly pray it daily.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R30JP5A7KVDECI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1616368942#wasThisHelpful","R30JP5A7KVDECI","AJ1XY1PK6SROF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJ1XY1PK6SROF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"For thirty years Margrit Banta has worked as a pastoral minister, caring for terminally ill and dying patients and their families and friends. In ""What Do I Say?"" she shares what she has learned from that experience. Though she writes of general medical, legal, and religious issues it is always from the perspective of a layman. One example that mirrors an incident in my own family is that of recognizing the physical signs of impending death. When Margrit was a teen, her mother was taken to the hospital in the terminal stage of cancer. In what turned out to be the last visit between the two, Margrit missed the signs and engaged her mom in talk of recipes and routine daily activities. Shortly after Margrit left, her mother died. In the chapter titled ""Approaching the Arms of Angels,"" Banta explains the most common physical signs of near-death from terminal illness or advanced age. She then describes two specific incidents of witnessing a peaceful death.Throughout the book Banta stresses the importance of attentive, impartial listening whatever our situation and relationship with the person. Separate chapters on unresolved issues and reviewing life suggest ways in which one might help by taking and transcribing notes, recording spoken words, and helping craft a letter. Banta also addresses religious issues such as wavering faith and psychological areas including denial by the patient and family members and friends. The chapter on final arrangements touches on DNR orders, living wills, hospice services, funeral arrangements, and after-death demands regarding notifications, insurance, and distribution of personal items. The last chapter, a discussion on praying with the patient, consists of six pages of appropriate prayers and a list of psalms.All this in a pocket-sized, 53-page book.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RL6KUMXQGEHHZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1616368047#wasThisHelpful","RL6KUMXQGEHHZ","AJ1XY1PK6SROF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJ1XY1PK6SROF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Spiritual Genius of Thomas Merton is an updated version of The Human Journey: Thomas Merton, Symbol of a Century (1982). ""Human Journey"" is considered to be the seminal work of author Anthony T. Padovano, a professor of literature and philosophy. Padovano is also an internationally recognized authority on Merton, and as such, he goes well beyond a simple biography. From the preface: ""This book will sketch the life of Merton in its elusiveness and assertiveness...deal with his faith and his writing...his mysticism and secularity, the psychological pressures that shaped his life and the myths that influenced his century.""In Chapter 6, Cargo Cults and Ghost Dances, Padovano's background in literature shines through. The longest chapter in the book, it focuses on Merton's poetry, in particular ""Original Child Bomb"" and ""The Geography of Lograire."" Padovano explains that Child Bomb is about the detonation of the first atomic bomb over Hiroshima. He points out that Merton ""weaves into the account the language of the Christian myth that was used by America in the process of creating and delivering this `child'"" and explores myths underlying our attitude toward war. This section is rich in historical information. The myth of cargo cults, we learn, is an amalgam of the creation and Cain-Abel story. Padovano devotes 30 pages to The Geography of Lograire, characterizing it as one of the most important of Merton's books, written when he was ""ready to enter into a comprehensive stage of his development.""My hope is that this brief review will encourage readers to broaden their knowledge and understanding of Thomas Merton, his life, work, and the culture in which he lived. Anthony Padovano has laid it out in imminently readable style.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RMT6KMF8I1C68/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1616368020#wasThisHelpful","RMT6KMF8I1C68","AJ1XY1PK6SROF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJ1XY1PK6SROF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Joyful Witness is the sixth book by Randy Hain, a nationally known business consultant who converted to Catholicism in 2006. In ""Witness"" he celebrates more than a dozen ordinary Catholics, unsung heroes who are ""shining examples to us of how to be a joyful witness for Christ."" The idea for the book grew from Hain's experiences during work-related travel and involvement in Church ministry. Those featured have rejected the secular culture in favor of serving Christ. Hain discovered common traits of humility, selflessness, and self-sacrifice across the spectrum. His subjects radiate peace and joy as they participate in parish and community activities.In each chapter Hain provides a summary of the individual's faith journey, a short description of practical lessons, and questions for reflection. Examples:Keri Davison, a home schooler, runs a family business that develops and distributes resources for other parents. The chapter on her family story closes with three ways to pass the Catholic faith to our children: (1) complete trust in God will be rewarded, (2) we must rely on God and our own efforts, and (3) integrate the practice of our Catholic faith into everything we do.Manny Garcia-Tunon is a founding member of the Catholic Association of Latino Leaders. From his story Hain draws four actions to help us live our faith 24/7: (1) practice prayer and discernment (2) stay connected to family, community, and fellowship, (3) seek out the Blessed Mother, and (4) radiate joy, humility, and the light of Christ.Hain's collection of unsung heroes also includes religious educators, artists, pro-life activists, and media professionals. With its standalone chapters, this work would be an excellent resource for parish ministers, retreat leaders, and faith sharing groups as well as individuals.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RP61D2A9GGZ7K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1616368101#wasThisHelpful","RP61D2A9GGZ7K","AJ1XY1PK6SROF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJ1XY1PK6SROF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Richard Fragomeni's Let Us Adore Him presents Advent meditations focused on Communion antiphons. The meditations for each day from the First Sunday of Advent through Christmas consist of a title; a list of readings for Year A, B, and C; the antiphon; a meditation; and a suggested practice. The same format is applied to feasts during the remainder of the Christmas season.The antiphons, which do not always mirror the theme of the readings, are like a conversation. ""Some days we talk to God, other days God talks to us,""  Fragomeni writes. He sees the antiphons, with their ""joy of the heart"" as a unique perspective on the Advent and Christmas season.Within that structure Fragomeni adds special features such as saints whose feast days are celebrated in Advent and three consecutive days on ""the power of three."" On Monday of the Second Week the antiphon leads us to reflect on three comings of Christ: birth, the end of time, and Holy Communion. The next day we explore three crowns God offers to us: crown of royalty in baptism, crown of champions, and the crown of thorns. The third day addresses three ways of seeing: eyes of the body, eyes of the mind, and the eye of the heart.Let Us Adore Him becomes a special Advent resource with the inclusion of meditations on the Communion Antiphons, a liturgical element unfamiliar to many of the faithful.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RMKA2PNB9SVDB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1616366664#wasThisHelpful","RMKA2PNB9SVDB","AJ1XY1PK6SROF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJ1XY1PK6SROF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Change our Hearts, Daily Meditations for Lent is a pocket-sized book formatted in roughly two-page reflections for each day from Ash Wednesday through Easter Sunday. All three readings are cited, and the Sundays include readings for Cycle A, B, and C. The reflections focus on the readings and their connection to our daily lives. Entries end with a suggested practice or original prayer. Themes include the traditional prayer, fasting, and almsgiving, but also emphasize baptismal promises for those already baptized and those preparing for the sacraments of initiation.Some samplesPrayer: ""...May my hunger, and the gift of my goods, fill my neighbor's belly so that my neighbor may know that you are a God who wants their needs met more than you desire my noisy prayers.""Practice: ""...Do you believe in God the Father Almighty, Creator of heaven and earth?

"In his recent book ""John XXIII a Short Biography,"" Kerry Walters recounts the life and times of the son of Italian sharecroppers who served as a priest and bishop for more than 50 years before being chosen pope. In just eight chapters, covering 55 pages, Walters tells the story of a humble, holy, and forward-thinking, man whose career had been thought lackluster by many.The book's early chapters center on Giuseppe Roncalli's story from his birth in 1881, through ordination and various ministries to 1958, when he became pope. Those years encompassed two world wars and the reign of five different popes: Leo XIII, Pius X, Benedict XV, Pius XI, and Pius XII. Walters does an excellent job of describing ways in which these forces shaped Roncalli and how he negotiated quietly and effectively among them to advance an agenda of openness, peace, and social justice.The final chapters focus on Roncalli's brief papacy. Walters makes it clear that Roncalli was chosen by a power-hungry curia as ""a good stopgap pontiff who would do nothing and then conveniently die."" They were right about his lifespan--he died just short of his five-year anniversary as pope-- but they were mistaken about the legacy he would leave. One of the first acts of the new pope was to convene the Second Vatican Council. He also intervened with U.S. and Soviet leaders during the Cuban Missile Crisis and wrote eight encyclicals on such topics as Christian unity and economic and social justice.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2DEITKKVECQVO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1616367512#wasThisHelpful","R2DEITKKVECQVO","AJ1XY1PK6SROF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJ1XY1PK6SROF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"In his latest work Ray Guarendi, Ph.D., tackles the subject of anger. As the examples below show, he uses a common-sense approach based on years of experience as a counselor and parent (he is the father of 10). The book contains more than 22 short chapters on contrasting opinions involving the nature of anger (Problem or Disorder, Emotion or Thought, Trait or State) and its expression (Vent or Contain, Forgive or Feel Bad).Some examples:In the Right or Wrong chapter, Guarendi examines assertiveness training, a ""quasi-therapy"" that claims emotional benefits to those who assert their rights firmly in social relationships. Under certain circumstances, such assertiveness can result in pushy and even obnoxious behavior, Guarendi writes. He suggests that sometimes the parties involved would better let the issue pass. Turning to Matthew 5:39, he recalls the counsel of Jesus to ""turn the other cheek."" The psychologist points out that setting aside some ""rights"" can be emotionally healthy while pursuing them may lead to distress and prolonged irritation. In summary, he emphasizes the importance of discerning whether anger is a choice or a right and, more importantly, how asserting that right will affect me and others. Anger, he says, is almost always a choice, not a right.Guarendi also questions the conventional wisdom that venting anger is a healthy way to release pressure. He cautions that venting is more likely to agitate than pacify the venter and can lead to guilt, shame, embarrassment, and regret. He suggests two ways to relieve frustration, the difference between what we want and what is: (1) align reality with our desires or (2) align our desires more closely with reality. Lowering expectations is often a good choice, he writes. Adult children living with parents is another popular topic Guarendi addresses. After a few examples, he offers two choices for parents based on their goals. If parents have no intention of taking definite action they need to ""be quiet,"" that is, stop commenting, nagging, and pleading. If, however, parents decide to take action, they are advised to bring the reality in line with their own expectations. For example, stop doling out money and acting like a maid.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1W2VI5CE9NDWL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1616367075#wasThisHelpful","R1W2VI5CE9NDWL","AJ1XY1PK6SROF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJ1XY1PK6SROF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Each entry in Joseph Girzones Stories of Jesus begins with a passage from Scripture, primarily from John and Luke. The selections were chosen for their dual emphasis on the human and divine qualities of Jesus. Following each of the 40 readings, Girzone presents his creative interpretation of the event based on his theological training and historical research. His process is in some ways like that of a screenwriter adapting a book for the movies, fleshing out the characters and adding dialogue and clues to motivation. All 40 reflections end with original prayers.Luke 8:1-3 is the reading for day 12, titled The Strange Group Who Followed Jesus. Girzone reviews the crew traveling with Jesus as coarse and uneducated fishermen, a mixture of women representing the well-to-do and politically connected, and Mary Magdalene, whose reputation was built around her being possessed of seven devils. Girzone points out that in the absence of motels or the like where they could stay, the company camped outdoors together. Needless to say, the itinerant teacher was widely criticized. Yet, through it all, Jesus just kept moving on in his own merry way. The message for us today is that Jesus was comfortable with every sort of person, and his teaching sets us free.The authors goal of presenting Jesus as a companion for people of all ages and spiritual leanings is the basis for his present ministry. Joseph Girzone was born in 1930, joined the Carmelite Order in 1948, and was ordained as a Catholic priest in 1955. After poor health forced him to retire from the active priesthood in 1981, he turned to writing as a second career. He is best known for a nine-book series on Joshua, a modern day version of Jesus. The books have sold millions of copies and been translated into several languages.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 30, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2NFO2AZVOHTQ0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1616366311#wasThisHelpful","R2NFO2AZVOHTQ0","AJ1XY1PK6SROF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJ1XY1PK6SROF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In his latest book, Daniel P. Horan, O.F.M., shares his reflections on the last words of Jesus in terms of what they might mean to us today, highlighting ways in which Christian discipleship depends on sharing in the passion of Christ. Two major themes are the reconciliation of love and suffering and understanding the place of these two elements in our lives.Horan presents the seven sayings in separate chapters, each consisting of four segments: (1) an extended passage from scripture (2) refection on how the saying might speak to today's Christians, (3) reflection questions, and (4) an original prayer.The reflections all connect Christ's Last Words with Catholic social teaching and the Franciscan view of the Passion of Jesus (for example, loving and suffering are two sides of the same coin, and the Cross is entwined with the Incarnation).The book grew out of an invitation Horan received to be the 2011 preacher for a Good Friday talk at a large Manhattan parish. The topic was the Seven Last Words of Christ. While the young priest was aware of the traditional service, he had never witnessed it himself, so he considered carefully before agreeing. Once he signed on he embraced reflection on the seven last words as his Lenten practice, allowing them to permeate all his activities. Through that experience and further research, Horan concluded that the words of Jesus as he parted this life ""should be the founding words of my life.""Daniel P. Horan, O.F.M., entered the Order of Friars Minor in 2005, professed vows in 2007, and was ordained a priest in 2012.

"Joe McHughs vocation is helping others grow through spiritual direction, workshops, and retreats. He learned his craft as a Jesuit priest of 20 years and continues to reach out to others through Spiritual Direction Twin Cities and the spiritual direction program at Southern Methodist University. He has written for National Catholic Reporter and America magazine and is the author of the recently released book Startled by God: Wisdom from Unexpected Places. McHugh defines spiritual direction as reflecting and praying with another to uncover God in our everyday experiences. The structure he favors centers on how God is active in our lives, the meaning of that activity, and ways we might respond.The book features more than 30 short vignettes, many of which show God turning up unexpectedly in the lives of those who are open to faith, hope, and love. The stories are grouped under three headings: (1) What? Dilemmas of Perspective; (2) So What? Dilemmas of Discipleship, and (3) Now What? Dilemmas of Discernment. McHugh offers specific exercises at the end of many entries and suggests that readers construct their own activities for others. He recommends not just reading through the book for information, but using it with another person or a group, an approach that will demonstrate the special presence of Jesus among those who gather in his name.In an early story, McHugh explains that he suffers from binocularity, (using only one eye at a time) and relates this physical condition to the spiritual. He notes that some see only grace or guilt, but not both; likewise death or resurrection, loss or gain, and self-giving or self-fulfillment. Instead of this one-sided view, he writes, we need to see ourselves as God sees us: a loved sinner. He encourages those prone to either/or thinking to pray frequently for healing and to meditate on Scripture passages in which Jesus opens the eyes of the blind.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 11, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R10NESZBKKP7B0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FPRYYLO#wasThisHelpful","R10NESZBKKP7B0","AJ1XY1PK6SROF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJ1XY1PK6SROF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In the 1980s and '90s, Fr. Mitch Pacwa, S.J., a student of the Holy Land, joined three pilgrimages to the ancient sites. Within a few years, the Jesuit was adding information to the guides presentation and eventually was permitted to lead his own groups. By 2012 he had led 58 trips to Israel, 10 to both Jordan and Egypt, 5 to both Greece and Turkey, and 2 to Lebanon. With this armchair pilgrimage, Pacwa hopes that readers, both those who have traveled to the Holy Land and those who have not, find an opportunity to pray more and come closer to our Savior, Jesus Christ.The Holy Land, an Armchair Pilgrimage contains biblical texts associated with key shrines and sites, photos and art, mediations, and prayers. By structuring the book geographically Pacwa provides readers with an experience similar to that of an actual pilgrimage. Some of the featured sites, such as The Church of the Nativity, lend especially to that outcome. This chapter opens with a photo of the church and brief historical background. The next pages take us inside the church with photos and a description of the visitors experience from adult visitors must bend down to avoid bumping their heads on the wide stone lintel to public expression of prayer is not permitted as you wait in the long, disorganized line. The same feel of being there continues through The Cave of the Nativity. This page features photos of pilgrims descending into the cave and the silver star marking the spot where Christ was born. The chapter closes with history, scripture, and photos related to the chapels of St. Joseph and The Holy Innocents and St. Jerome.In addition to the rich text and full color artwork, Pacwa provides lists of illustrations, scripture citations, and a subject matter index.

"Whether it is used for reference or daily reflection, by individuals, faith-sharing groups, or catechists, this classic is a valuable resource for anyone seeking the path to sainthood.The editor of the seventh edition of Saint of the Day reminds us that the holiness of the saints, Gods holiness, is something we all share. Their lives were indeed conditioned by the culture and history of their own day; their expression of holiness is partly different from what it would be in the twenty-first century. But the essence is the same: They received Gods gift with joy. They call us to do likewise... writes Leonard Foley, O.F.M.Though most of the dated entries feature lives of saints and blesseds, others are devoted to solemnities of Jesus not assigned a specific Sunday or holy day, feasts of Mary, and celebrations commemorating the dedication of important churches. The Sunday after I first picked up the new edition of Saint of the Day I heard a homily on the Dedication of St. John Lateran. The priest did a great job explaining the history and reminding us of church as building as well as people as Church. I found the Saint of the Day entry essentially the same, but appreciated the opportunity to be able to reflect more fully on what I had heard at Mass.As for individual saints, Fr. Foley explains that the earliest stories were written to memorialize martyrs on their anniversaries. In addition to these historical accounts, legends grew up around certain saints. After the presentation of facts on St. George (D. 303?), Foley writes that the story of a slain dragon, rescued princess, and conversion of Libya is a twelfth-century Italian fable. In the comment section, he reminds us that Americans somehow need Paul Bunyan in addition to historical heroes.Each entry consists of brief background, a comment linking the feast to our own life, and relevant quotations from scripture and the saint or another spiritual writer. The book closes with an index of alphabetical titles of feasts and the dates they are celebrated.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 17, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R36PWTPEDIKT56/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1616366532#wasThisHelpful","R36PWTPEDIKT56","AJ1XY1PK6SROF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJ1XY1PK6SROF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"In the prologue to ""Thirsting for God,"" Editor Angelo D. Scolozzi writes of his relationship with Mother Teresa, which began in Calcutta in 1976. ""By her words and example during my twenty-one years of association with her, she showed me the royal way of the cross...encouraged me to do heroic acts of total surrender, loving trust, and acceptance."" Scolozzi describes this book as a kind of yearlong spiritual diary made up of reflections, meditations, prayers, and his personal recollections of Mother Teresa. The material is drawn from numerous sources including a manuscript the senior sisters of her congregation developed incorporating Mother Teresa's first teachings. Scolozzi ponders the reaction to today's readers as her spiritual reality unfolds before them.For a taste of this work, let's look at a series of five consecutive entries filling two pages. (1) ""Be faithful to little things, for in them lies our strength."" Teresa saw opportunities for ""little practices of love"" as gifts from God on which we may build lives of holiness. (2) Practicing small, daily acts of penance draws us to God and God to us, and earns us the grace to overcome our faults. (3) Allowing Jesus to pray in and through us enables us to act out of love for others. (4) Praying and living the ""Our Father"" teaches holiness: ""Everything is there: God, myself, my neighbor."" (5) In the name of Jesus we pray for grace to love God above all and to make our hearts meek and humble like the heart of Jesus.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 27, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1X9E402V87D1X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1616366893#wasThisHelpful","R1X9E402V87D1X","AJ1XY1PK6SROF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJ1XY1PK6SROF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Sr. Wendy Beckett is known worldwide for her documentaries on art history shown on the BBC and PBS. Her new book on ""The Art of Mary,"" features fourteen full-color reproductions of world-class art works related to the mother of Jesus. Most are from the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries and many are icons. Each full-page reproduction is accompanied by three pages of text on the history of the piece, a description of certain of its elements, and a personal reflection.In providing background Beckett includes several legends as well as factual information. For example, some believe that the Annunciation as described in Scripture was not Gabriel's first appearance before Mary, and that the reason wine ran out at the marriage feast at Cana is that Jesus brought along his apostles. Many of the reflections end in an observation about our own lives. For example, Mary's accepting God's plan ""is essentially about trust in God and letting him do as he pleases with us,"" and ""Joy comes from the deep, unshakable happiness of faith in Our Lord.""Beckett's treatment of the Russian icon ""The Mother of God as the Burning Bush"" is a good example of the detail she provides. After describing the large, central portion of this complex image, she points out smaller symbols such as a ladder, symbolizing the incarnation as a connection between heaven and earth, and a tiny representation of Christ the high priest celebrating the Eucharist on the altar of his tomb in Jerusalem. ""The icon is telling us that the Church contains Jesus, just as Mary did, and this complex imagery is held in her heart,"" writes Beckett.This book, quick to read, beautiful to ponder, would make a lovely gift.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 22, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R9DVN6KQ3QLJ3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1616366931#wasThisHelpful","R9DVN6KQ3QLJ3","AJ1XY1PK6SROF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJ1XY1PK6SROF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Patrick Madrid introduces his new book, On a Mission, by describing St. Paul as one whose apostolic zeal irritated others because proclaiming and testifying to Jesus Christ made others uncomfortable. Paul's fervor, Madrid writes, was based on a personal encounter with Christ rather than on intellectual, scientific knowledge. All Christians are called to act with this kind of fervor for bringing others to the Church.Madrid uses St. Francis de Sales (1567-1622) as his primary model, with additional lessons from St. Francis of Assisi, St. Francis Xavier, Pope Francis I, and twentieth century apologist Frank Sheed. From these men, and others, Madrid says he has learned that anyone who is willing can become a channel of God's grace to others simply by saying ""yes"" to God and neighbor with a loving heart.The first chapter, What an Apostle Looks Like, is devoted to the story of Francis de Sales, who is credited with ""re-evangelizing"" the people of the Chablais region of France after the Catholic Church had lost influence in favor of John Calvin's brand of Protestantism. Madrid enumerates the steps de Sales took, the struggles he overcame, and his success in converting nearly 60,000 former Protestants on Calvin's turf.Here, and throughout the book Madrid reiterates the qualities of an ""apostolic heart"" marked by a wellspring of charity,  burning love for Christ and neighbor, and  ""willingness to live and speak the truth courageously yet humbly in a world that resists the truth,"" based on deep knowledge of the teachings of Jesus and the Church.He offers a specific program for gaining that knowledge beginning with spending at least 10 minutes daily reading a chapter from the Gospels and three paragraphs from the Catechism of the Catholic Church. He recommends several Internet sites, additional publications, CDs, and Catholic radio programs including his own show Right Here, Right Now.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 22, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R107SF0ZQ6E4ER/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=161636436X#wasThisHelpful","R107SF0ZQ6E4ER","AJ1XY1PK6SROF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJ1XY1PK6SROF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Fr. Ronald Rolheiser, president of the Oblate School of Theology in San Antonio, Texas, is an internationally known lecturer and writer. The author of a 2010 article on Rolheiser for National Catholic Reporter had this to say about him: ""Few Catholic authors have that kind of cradle-to-grave appeal, across the widest possible spectrum of political and theological outlooks and life experiences.""His latest book, Prayer, Our Deepest Longing, bears out that observation. In the 32 reflections on prayer Rolheiser covers topics using examples from daily life, Scripture, and contemporary culture ranging from Zorba the Greek to the cartoon Ziggy. Scripture references are sometimes familiar, sometimes enlightening, depending on the reader. For example, in writing about the Good Shepherd, Rolheiser explains that sheep were so attuned to their master's voice they would not follow even a very good imitator. He also explains the phrase ""He descended into hell"" from the Apostle's Creed in a way unfamiliar to me.The material is organized into six chapters addressing prayer issues such as common struggles, hearing God's voice, and developing a mature prayer life.Rolheiser's intention for this book is to provide ""a healthy combination"" of consolation and challenge to help readers overcome struggles with prayer  ""so that it no longer feels as though you are simply doing some drab duty, wasting precious time, talking to a  wall, entertaining yet another daydream, or simply rehashing your heartaches and headaches.""The reflections may be read in any order, he writes, then echoes a non-negotiable rule from great spiritual masters: You have to show up for prayer and you have to show up regularly.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 17, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2T7APIYGJG610/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1616366575#wasThisHelpful","R2T7APIYGJG610","AJ1XY1PK6SROF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJ1XY1PK6SROF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Author Sister Wendy Beckett, now in her eighties, joined the Sisters of Notre Dame de Namur in 1946, continued her studies, taught, and translated Medieval Latin manuscripts for a number of years. In the late 1970s, in declining health, Sr. Wendy was permitted to leave her order for a hermit's life of prayer. For two hours a day, she studies and writes about art, a subject that has fascinated her from childhood. The proceeds of her work, including very popular TV documentaries, are donated to the Carmelite community on whose property she lives. Most recently she has written a series of three new books: the art of Christmas, the Saints, and Mary. Like the others, Sr. Wendy on the Art of Christmas is arranged around 14 works. Each entry consists of a reproduction and three pages of text on historical background of the piece and the story it represents; the work, itself; and a reflection for today.I've chosen ""The Census at Bethlehem"" by Pieter Brueghel as an example. Beckett begins her presentation on this sixteenth century painting with a reflection on current secular Advent preparations. Advent is intended as a time of prayer, she writes, but we are often overtaken by activities related to the commercial side of Christmas. She asks us to spend a little time every day acknowledging our need to receive the transforming grace of Jesus.Turning to the painting, she provides the cultural background in which ""The Census at Bethlehem"" was created. The Netherlands was in turmoil during the period in which Brueghel lived in Flanders. In this work he connected the upheaval in his own time with the political events leading up to the birth of Jesus. Thus, Joseph and Mary are embedded into a noisy, confusing scene depicting Flemish peasants in contemporary clothing milling about among brick buildings, gathering provisions, wood, and beer while children play in the snow. Beckett ties together the reflection by pointing out that for Mary and Joseph the approach to Christmas was filled with anxiety, yet they thought only of Jesus. ""In all this, we can unite with them,"" she writes.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 12, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R32X5ZCAN41883/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1616366958#wasThisHelpful","R32X5ZCAN41883","AJ1XY1PK6SROF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJ1XY1PK6SROF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Did you ever spend a day with someone who came back with three or four really funny ""bits"" based on his observation of things you barely noticed? Lino Rulli is that guy. Like Cosby, he's a master storyteller; like Seinfeld, he sees everything as ""material."" Before you object to my comparing Rulli to these comedic greats, remember that ""Saint"" suggests he merits canonization--sort of. Rulli, host of ""The Catholic Guy"" on SeriusXM Radio, is really saying that canonized saints often have led lives of such great holiness that the rest of us can become discouraged.In elementary school he discovered he could get a laugh, and that was one road to popularity for an insecure kid with few other obvious gifts. Unless you count his family--a wacky, but much loved bunch--and his friends--where does one find these characters? Again, it's his eye for the amusing and his ability to craft great stories and one-liners. That's the humorist part. In addition, Rulli is a cradle Catholic with a master's degree in theology who is fully dedicated to discovering and accepting the call God issues to us all--sanctity.In his chapter on the corporal works of mercy, Lino is at his best in balancing the serious and the funny. He presents the works in checklist form, each with an account of his own performance. While pointing out that he seldom sees anyone naked and doubts that there's much opportunity to ""give drink to the thirsty"" in our culture, he also tells a wonderful story about feeding the hungry. It took place during Lent when he was honoring the season by giving at least $10 a day to folks he met on the street who seemed needy. Rulli had $20, needed dinner, but wanted to donate to a man begging for spare change. He explained the situation, asking the man if he had $10 ""change."" Lino ended up taking the guy along to a deli and buying him $10 worth of food. In addition to ""feeding the hungry,"" Rulli also takes credit for his stint in prison ministry, but disavows burying the dead as illegal.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 7, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1PVK19FC62I51/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1616366680#wasThisHelpful","R1PVK19FC62I51","AJ1XY1PK6SROF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJ1XY1PK6SROF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The content and presentation of From the Back of the Pews to the Head of the Class is exceptional. Information on interviewees; pull quotes; and an index all are ""value added"" to the story subtitled ""The remarkable Accomplishments of a Segregated Catholic High School in the Deep South."" The school, Most Pure Heart of Mary (HOM), opened in Mobile, Alabama, in 1917 and closed in 1968.Older alumni represented in the book generally speak with delight. Larietta Hall, a 1944 graduate, talks about The Holy Ghost nuns, who had the students performing Irish jigs at the all-black, Heart of Mary school."" The nuns got pictures of Irish dancing costumes, and my mother sewed them...I knew nothing about Ireland."" Others from that time said they were unperturbed by ""Coloreds Only"" signs. In many cases, they were satisfied with and thankful for the lives they were living--close-knit family and community, comparatively well off, good education. One interviewee said he had peeked into a white-only restaurant. Noting the elegant setting, he came away feeling he'd gained some interesting information, but it had little effect on him.Fr. John George Harfmann, SSJ, who was assigned to HOM as an associate pastor in 1964, was unprepared for the brand of racism in the Deep South. The newly ordained priest came from Brooklyn, and studied in Washington, D.C. ""I had never seen face-to-face segregation the way it was in Mobile in those days,"" he said. He described his first ""head-on collision with white and black"" as he tried to visit a parishioner in the local hospital.Alums from the 1950s and 60s spoke highly of their education at HOM, but also about segregation, and the Church's complicity in it. Some recalled parishioners, staff, and even students who were instrumental in raising awareness and supporting civil rights legislation. Several former HOM students shared their initial views on the effects of desegregation in their community--not always favorable-- and their overall impressions of growing up as back-of-the-pews Catholics in a back-of-the bus society.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 20, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R37KT8DD1AVZME/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0879465107#wasThisHelpful","R37KT8DD1AVZME","AJ1XY1PK6SROF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJ1XY1PK6SROF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Franciscan Priest Richard Rohr is the author of more than 20 books and numerous articles, an internationally known speaker, and founding director of the Center for Action and Contemplations (CAC) in Albuquerque, New Mexico. Those with more than a passing knowledge of Rohr's history may be aware that, at age 70, he is cutting back on his travels in favor of a long-held dream of opening the ""Living School for Action and Contemplation"" at CAC. The curriculum will be based on seven central themes Rohr developed over the years: methodology, foundation, frame, ecumenical, transformation, process, and goal. In his latest book, ""Yes/And!"" Rohr organizes excerpts and adaptations from his previous works under these seven themes. A deep understanding of the themes isn't essential to appreciating the 366 titled  reflections, most of which cover only one page.The book is suitable for individual or group use, and lends to either straight-through reading or browsing. The range of topics is extensive. A few examples:""In the inspired documents of Vatican II, I found my best teacher in putting together Scripture, Tradition, and Experience in a quite reasonable (rational) way.""""Jesus, you could say, came to show us how to suffer, how to carry `the legitimate pain of being human,' as Jung called it.""""Substance addictions are merely the most visible form of addiction, but actually we are all addicted to our own habitual way of doing anything, our own defenses, and most especially our patterned way of thinking or how we process our reality.""""In recent years and elections, one might have thought that homosexuality and abortion were the new litmus tests of authentic Christianity....They never were the criteria of proper membership for the first two thousand years, but they reflect very recent culture wars instead.""In the end, Rohr writes that he is most excited when a conference participant says ""Richard, you did not tell me anything new. Somehow I always knew this would be the case, and you just gave me the courage to believe it.""","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 16, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJFM8BKBHJLVU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1616366443#wasThisHelpful","RJFM8BKBHJLVU","AJ1XY1PK6SROF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJ1XY1PK6SROF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Road of Hope is a collection of teachings written by an imprisoned Vietnamese archbishop to his people. Francis Xavier Nguyen Van Thuan (1928-2002) was ordained a priest in 1953. Subsequently he served as a pastor, studied canon law in Rome, served as a seminary professor in the archdiocese of Hue, and was consecrated as bishop of Nha Trang in 1967. During the following eight years he took on additional duties that included traveling widely to support peaceful solutions to the Vietnamese conflict and solicit aid for reconstruction. In 1975, after the communist takeover, he was arrested as he journeyed to Saigon for a new assignment as an archbishop.In the introduction to The Road of Hope Translator John Peter Pham describes the communist persecution of priests and religious who were deported to ""re-education camps,"" as Church property was seized. In March of 1976, Pham writes, the Archbishop was deported to North Vietnam along with 2000 other prisoners. For the next 13 years he was confined to prisons and camps, spending the bulk of that time in isolation. For a period in 1975, Van Thuan was placed under house arrest. ""Realizing that this 'respite' would be brief and that the Church, bereft of its shepherds, was facing a period of possibly years of persecution, the Archbishop took up his pen,"" writes Pham. The plan was to write a few messages to encourage and offer spiritual counsel to his flock. Over time, the messages formed a manuscript, and pages were smuggled to the outside and assembled as 1001 reflections, which were printed clandestinely and disseminated widely despite government efforts to interfere. Van Thuan was eventually able to edit the manuscript himself following his expulsion from Vietnam.As for the content of this book, the 1001 messages are grouped under headings such as duty, interior life, the apostle, ordinary work, and a life of hope. Most of us are familiar with the themes here, but the way this priest from this background presents them is extraordinary, yet simple and specific.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 6, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1OXXPN0UDM7GS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1565484991#wasThisHelpful","R1OXXPN0UDM7GS","AJ1XY1PK6SROF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJ1XY1PK6SROF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Author Melanie Rigney researched more than 700 saints and blesseds using nearly two dozen books and countless websites before settling on the 366 individuals to feature in her latest book, Sisterhood of Saints. The only introductory material appears in the preface, where Rigney highlights the variety of backgrounds, personalities, and activities these women represent, emphasizing that ""in short, they are women just like you and me."" What she learned, and hopes to pass on to readers, is that their love of God is the uniting trait of the sisterhood, regardless of when and where they lived.Single-page daily reflections, designed for busy women, consist of a short synopsis of the life of the subject, a paragraph about its relevance to our daily lives, a ""snippet"" from Scripture or the woman's writings, and a challenge. I'll choose Margaret the Barefooted (1325-1395) as an example. Margaret, showing her solidarity with beggars, went barefoot while begging alms for them, at the same time suffering disapproval and verbal abuse from her husband. Rigney takes this lesson from the story: ""The importance of putting ourselves in someone else's situation, and at least offering a smile and perhaps a friendly word.""In writing my review, I noticed one drawback to Sisterhood of Saints: no index, no discernible order to the entries. After deciding to feature Margaret the Barefooted, I had to page through to find her again. The content rates five stars, but lack of searchability caused me to award only three.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 2, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3LKZ0ENEQ77VB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1616366176#wasThisHelpful","R3LKZ0ENEQ77VB","AJ1XY1PK6SROF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJ1XY1PK6SROF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"What better way to prepare for Christmas than to experience the infancy gospels of Matthew and Luke through the eyes of a first century Jew? Author Edward Sri provides that opportunity in his latest book, The Advent of Christ: Scripture Reflections to Prepare for Christmas.Week One reviews Luke's story of the birth of John the Baptist and Matthew's references to the Book of Genesis through three titles for the child: Jesus, Christ, and Emmanuel. Sri shows the connection between Old Testament and New inherent in these titles. For example, he explains that the Hebrew name ""Jesus"" (God saves) is significant because ancient Jews blamed Israel's sin for loss of the Promised Land and exile from God. The child Jesus, would not only free the Jews from the oppression of the Roman forces, but also restore their relationship with God. The author also points out that ""Jesus"" is a form of the name ""Joshua."" Joshua led the Chosen People into the Promised Land. Thus, Jesus can be seen as the new Joshua, who will lead the people out of spiritual exile.Week Two continues the story of Zechariah and introduces St. Joseph with an interesting parallel to Joseph the patriarch from the book of Genesis. Week Three focuses on Mary, and Week Four ""the joys and sorrows of the Holy Family"" as they travel from Nazareth to Bethlehem. A final section on Christmas covers Christmas Eve through the Feast of the Epiphany.Each section begins with a short preview and each day opens with a passage from Scripture and closes with a reflection question and prayer.This resource is suitable for individual and group use during Advent in all of the church's liturgical cycles.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 2, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RD5PNHO84DQFZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1616366516#wasThisHelpful","RD5PNHO84DQFZ","AJ1XY1PK6SROF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJ1XY1PK6SROF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The Miraculous Medal by Donna-Marie Cooper O'Boyle is all about miracles. The backdrop is the story of Catherine Labour (1806-1876). As a young girl, Catherine saw St. Vincent de Paul in a dream and discerned his call to her to join the Sisters of Charity. She was accepted into the order in 1830. In her days as a novice, Catherine had visions of St. Vincent's heart, Jesus visible in the Blessed Sacrament, and Christ the King, all of which she confided to her confessor. Later she had dreams and visions in which Mary prophesied and gave instructions regarding reforms needed in the religious communities founded by St. Vincent de Paul. Mary also charged Sr. Labour with having a medal cast, with specific directions on the design.As Catherine worked to see the mission fulfilled, numerous miracles related to the ""Miraculous Medal"" occurred.  In a chapter titled ""Modern-Day Transforming Miracles,"" the author shares stories from people to whom she has given Miraculous Medals. ""These encounters and stories happen on ordinary days during run-of-the-mill circumstances, but with the Blessed Mother's grace these moments are transformed into extraordinary occurrences,"" she writes. ""Only God, the Blessed Mother, the angels, and the saints know for sure how these miracles come about."" Subheadings throughout the 50-page chapter include Resuscitated Twenty-Eight Times, Peace Overshadowed Her, Wine Store Owner Celebrates a New Birthday, Spouses in Surgery and Transformed Hearts, Two Delivery Guys, and Faithful in China.Cooper O'Boyle provides a complete package here: the history of the medal, miraculous encounters to the present day, and a section on devotions to Our Lady of the Miraculous Medal.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 22, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R4M3DGPOIHDI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1616366257#wasThisHelpful","R4M3DGPOIHDI","AJ1XY1PK6SROF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJ1XY1PK6SROF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Greg Willits presents the nuts and bolts of ""The New Evangelization"" from a wealth of experience. He is director of Evangelization and Family Life Ministries for the Archdiocese of Denver. He is also deeply involved in Catholic media, notably Twitter, Facebook, and The New Evangelizers web site.The New Evangelization and You is based on Church documents and Scripture, all cited in chapter-by-chapter notes. To complement these formal sources, Willits includes sidebars called ""New Evangelizers in Action"" in each of the book's 12 chapters. These stories feature ordinary individuals modeling elements of the New Evangelization: (1) renewed spiritual devotion and efforts in catechesis, (2) living our faith, and (3) sharing our faith with others.Willits also describes his personal insights on the New Evangelization. He tells about annual fishing trips with his brother, emphasizing the planning and knowledge that lead to success in catching striped bass. The same kind of preparation is required for evangelization (fishing for men). In this case the task is sharing faith and drawing others to Christ, even if we feel unprepared. Willits points out that our efforts must not be limited to only ""the big fish,"" that is, those who are extremely skeptical or hostile. ""We oftentimes get caught up with converting all the atheists and non-Christians we know,"" he writes, ""but what about the small fish in your life?

First, there's no one way that works for everyone, and even the several experts whose work she draws on emphasize different methods. The message is stay flexible and incorporate the information from the first three chapters when considering guidelines like the following:* Don't start at the beginning and plow through.* Start with the New Testament, familiar gospels, or Acts.* Read sections, and read aloud--that's the way the stories were first encountered.* Read the introductions and footnotes.* Reflect on passages.* Imagine yourself as part of the story.* Always invoke the Holy Spirit.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 15, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQPCQ9TF9NZ78/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1616365803#wasThisHelpful","RQPCQ9TF9NZ78","AJ1XY1PK6SROF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJ1XY1PK6SROF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In ""A Quick Look at Heaven and Hell a View Unlike Any We Might Imagine"" Tom Molnar covers a good bit of ground in a mere 43 pages. He opens with a survey of ways scientific findings have influenced ideas about afterlife from the days of Copernicus through the 1966 Time Magazine cover story ""Is God Dead?""Other topics address images of heaven and hell through history, possible criteria for God's judgment, what heaven might be like, and the form of those who attain heaven. Citing several Bible passages, he writes, ""God, of course, has no difficulty in resurrecting a body intact."" The question is what would we look like? Glorified and immortal versions of ourselves at the time of death? All resurrected at a past or future age, such as 33 to commemorate the age at which Jesus died? ""Personally I tend to think our bodies will be resurrected at our body's earliest fully mature age,"" Molnar writes. ""Babies will likely come to heaven fully matured, and the elderly will again see the full bloom of youth.""Turning to hell, Molnar explores scripture, reported visions by saints and others, and near-death experiences. Heavenly near-death experiences are familiar to many, but those of hell are less so. Molnar describes reported end-of-life visions of hell with words like ""moans and screams of those tormented...beasts in the shape of grotesque animals...huge worms appear(ing) to emerge from their bodies...utter sense of despair and loss.""In conclusion Molnar reminds us that each of us is called to be with God in heaven, and we have ample information on how to make that happen.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 10, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3VRU3M3OB9OOC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0976695219#wasThisHelpful","R3VRU3M3OB9OOC","AJ1XY1PK6SROF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJ1XY1PK6SROF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In ""Raising God-First Kids..."" Barbara Curtis introduces her 1980 self as ""a single mother living in Marin County, California, with two daughters, Samantha Sunshine and Jasmine Moondance--both part of my hippie heritage."" She wanted something more for her girls than the kind of chaotic upbringing she had endured, yet had no clue how to provide it. In turning to Alcoholics Anonymous for help with her addiction, she was able to replace non-belief with acceptance of a Higher Power. It was in AA that she met Tripp, whose background was similar to hers. The two married, and their first son was conceived shortly afterward.When their second son was born following a complicated pregnancy, the couple decided to forgo using birth control, agreeing that their spiritual purpose was ""to continue raising a healthy family."" Within eighteen months, their third son was born and their marriage was failing apart.Out of desperation, the couple attended a marriage conference that led to committing their lives to Jesus and embracing evangelical Christianity. Barbara abandoned her support for abortion in favor of pro-life advocacy. By 1993, Barbara and Tripp were raising nine children, and had made the decision to home school them. Barbara began offering home-schooling workshops, incorporating her Montessori training, and eventually wrote several books on the topic for evangelical publishers. She had also become an advocate for children with disabilities following the birth of her son Jonny, who has Down Syndrome. Tripp and Barbara eventually adopted three boys with Down Syndrome, bringing the number of their children to an even dozen. In 2005, Barbara began blogging in hopes of sharing ideas with other moms. At the same time, she accepted invitations to speak before pro-life groups, usually made up of Catholics and evangelicals. Through these events, she became aware of what she saw as hypocrisy among the evangelicals because they purported to be pro-life yet condoned birth control. There followed a moment in which Barbara recognized that the Catholic Church offered authentic and consistent teaching on these matters. In 2007 she, Tripp, and six of their children converted.Raising God-First Kids in a Me-First World is the tale of this extraordinary family told with honesty and humility in the hope that it will provide inspiration and support to others.

"Joan Mueller has written this book for those wanting to know more about St. Clare, who is sometimes considered only in light of her relationship with Francis of Assisi. Though a follower of Francis, Clare ""has much to say for herself,"" writes Mueller. ""Clare knew confused times, war, and poverty, and lived her life with simplicity and joy. In difficult days, she reaches across the centuries to guide us yet again."" In this book, Mueller, a Poor Clare sister and internationally respected scholar, brings Clare to us in a personal, modern-day telling.One of my favorite literary devices is mixing current language with historical information, and Mueller does it here with gusto. In the introduction she writes of objections from some churchmen over canonizing Francis ""this street guy with his grungy followers."" She describes Clare as no ""pushover or ""vagabond."" In the eyes of her uncle, Clare was a ""mutilated wreck"" no one would want to marry after she allowed Francis to cut her hair. In a quest to force Clare to return home, Uncle Monaldo both tried to ""keep his cool"" and ""cooled his heels.""Rather than simply recite the events, Mueller portrays the drama of Uncle's subsequent violent actions aimed at dragging (by the hair) Clare's younger sister away from the protection of the nuns with whom she was sheltered. That same dramatic effect also contributes to the reality of Clare's story. For example, when she and Francis first meet, ""Francis found himself fidgeting, his hands sweating a bit,"" as he waited for Clare to appear.The final chapters of the book describe the daily life of Clare and Francis and their followers, development of their religious orders, Clare's death, and testimonies of those interviewed during the process of her canonization.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 18, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RV677TRY9CJMO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1616365994#wasThisHelpful","RV677TRY9CJMO","AJ1XY1PK6SROF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJ1XY1PK6SROF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Like others in The Catholic Update Guide series, this overview of the New Evangelization is based on material from Franciscan Media and edited by Carol Kendzia. The first two chapters address development of Church teaching on evangelization, with special emphasis on evangelization as the mission of all the faithful, not just Church leaders.The third and final chapter ""Go Out into the World,"" focuses on the how-to. Kendzia states that we are called to present an inviting image to the world. ""We must be a collective sign of God's goodness, openness, and acceptance to all men and women."" She turns to the writings of Henry Libersat, author of 16 books and an ordained permanent deacon, for specific ideas, among them thinking about ""how to tell your story."" He suggests we look at our lives before we came to know the Lord, describe the feelings that arose when we experienced God's love, and identify ways that experience changed us. Most importantly, we need to share our story as a conversation, not a homily or a lesson.Each chapter ends with reflection questions, and back matter includes a 10-point evangelization checklist and information on sources and contributors.

Most of the role models appear to be personal acquaintances of the author, but three are known more widely: Saint Elizabeth Ann Seton, Jane de Chantal, and Vice President Joe Biden, whose wife and daughter were killed in a car accident just after he was elected to the U.S. senate.The author's own experiences and those of numerous others are embedded in each chapter along with a wealth of resources to help the widowed  ""begin to understand that there is nothing wrong with you for being despondent or feeling physically ill in the weeks or months after your loss,"" regardless of what others may say.On the spiritual side, Barkley shares the importance of prayer and ritual in her own healing. For example, she found inspiration to begin praying the psalms based on the writings of Scripture scholar Walter Brueggemann. In the book she devotes four or five pages to her approach and the results.All in all, Life after Death provides an effective balance of data, personal stories, resources, and prayer. The subtitle ""Practical Help for the Widowed"" says it all.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 7, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R146LOYTSKC4MS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1616365226#wasThisHelpful","R146LOYTSKC4MS","AJ1XY1PK6SROF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJ1XY1PK6SROF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"These were all the rage when I was in school, but they faded out of style. Looks like ACCO/Mead is hoping to make them big again by appealing to parents, who ostensibly grew up when Trapper Keepers were in fashion.Ironically, this Trapper Keeper does not have any Trappers, which are basically dividers with pockets. But the front & rear covers have a pocket apiece.The Star Wars Pattern looks great. I really like it. The R2D2 and Vader Patterns are a bit over the top, but look more period-correct.I note a few improvements over the Trapper Keepers I recall from my childhood:(1) Narrower: My old Trapper Keepers were wider and were difficult to fit into some backpacks. These are only a quarter inch wider than a typical 3-ring binder.(2) Softer vinyl. My old Trapper Keepers were already cracking and tearing before they even left the shelves. This vinyl is very pliable and looks like it might last a good while longer than the older ones.(3) Steel rings. My old Trapper Keepers has plastic rings that slid when you pulled a tab. These have the common round-rings with release tabs you find on most 3-ring binders(4) Snap closure. My old Trapper Keepers had velcro. They made a lot of noise. Snap should be much quieter. However, the snap on this particular Trapper Keeper appears to be damaged and will not close at all.But at the end of the day, none of these improvements make Trapper Keepers any more practical. Standard 3-ring binders are every bit as good and cost much less. You can get the kind with clear sides and put whatever graphics your prefer in there.And keep in mind there are much better alternatives. Just as an example, this binder is constructed with nylon (far more durable than vinyl), zippered on all sides, has pockets and organizers inside, and costs roughly the same. But I'll admit it's not as nice to look at as this Trapper Keeper.It really boils down to how nostalgic you are? If you really miss the 70s-90s and need a Star Wars themed Trapper Keeper, go for it. It's better than the old Trapper Keeper in many ways. But if you're looking for a practical binder for Back-To-School, look elsewhere.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RH91RE8MQFR6V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00X7NSPI6#wasThisHelpful","RH91RE8MQFR6V","A1SI2993YY7C61","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1SI2993YY7C61?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"You have to keep in mind that this is for younger children, not for older fans of the show. Collectors will be disappointed. It feels cheap. It doesn't look great. But on the bright side, for the collectors, it stands upright very stably and the arms are somewhat posable; shoulders and elbows twist. No other part is posable. Most of the details are painted, not stickers, which I appreciated as a parent. Paper stickers tend to get wet and tear off. And truthfully, it looks pretty good in both robot and truck form.Part of what attracted me to Transformers as a child was the challenge of transforming from a robot to a vehicle and back. It was basically a puzzle, frustrating at first, but a lot of fun once you've figured it out. This does away with it completely. It transforms in very few movements, not 1 like they claim, but very few.The 1-Step refers to main action of turning Optimus from a robot into a truck. You'll still need to straighten out the rear wheel-set, put his arms at his side, and pivot the hood, etc. Maximum, approx. 5 movements to go from one form to the other. Very simple, which makes it great for introducing Transformers to younger children. Even my 1 year old is intrigued. I'm sure she'd lose interest if I showed her an older Transformer with a dozen steps or more.BOTTOM LINE: This is for young children. Keep that in mind before you give this a negative review. Yes, it's cheap and boringly simple, but the target audience (children) will probably enjoy this. Mine does.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R18X0H0L14GVAK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VQ7PUOC#wasThisHelpful","R18X0H0L14GVAK","A1SI2993YY7C61","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1SI2993YY7C61?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Most Green Toys are excellent, and this is no exception. They're durable and attractive. They don't contain BPA, phthalates, PVC or external coatings which are potentially toxic.The block colors seem to vary from set to set. For instance, our triangle pieces are green, the 2x4 blocks are yellow, 2x2 are blue, 2x1 are orange. In the set pictured, the triangles are yellow, 2x4 are blue, 2x2 are orange, 2x1 are green. That doesn't bother me. These aren't Legos and my baby and I aren't building anything elaborate. More on that later.The hues are pretty organic, which I appreciate. No wild neon colors. The green is a deep leafy color. The orange looks like carrots. The yellow resembles spaghetti squash. It's probably wishful thinking, but I hope the colors encourage my children to eat more vegetables.As another reviewer pointed out, though they look like big Lego or Duplo, they barely stick together at all. I believe that's intentional. I recall when I was younger, Lego pieces would stick together so well I'd resort to using my teeth to get them apart, which probably isn't healthy. But also consider, younger children that haven't developed fine motor skills will enjoy knocking these over more than they'll enjoy assembling them. In the case of our 1 year old, she enjoys knocking over my creations as fast as I can build them. The sound of the pieces colliding make a satisfying plonk.But keep in mind, as with all toys, appeal will vary from child to child based on their development, age, personality, etc.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R17QRIU8PMGJ7N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TL8UHPA#wasThisHelpful","R17QRIU8PMGJ7N","A1SI2993YY7C61","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1SI2993YY7C61?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The box and photos do a pretty poor job of selling this game. I don't think many people will be attracted to this if it were sitting on a shelf. That's a shame, because with the right group, this has the potential to be a lot of fun. If it weren't given to me, I doubt I would've even noticed it.There are a lot of checks & balances which serve as equalizers to level the playing field. The objective is to mold something neither too accurate, nor too vague.In theory, it seems like this should be a fair game. In practice, the game favors mediocre sculptors. Better sculptors will find it difficult to ""dial back"" their dohdle.The packaging is suggestive of a fast-paced guessing game with players shouting guesses, but it's actually pretty thoughtful and calculating.Overall, this was a fun game to share with adults over drinks. Not as much fun for smaller children.

"As the other positive reviews will attest, this is a HUGE bang-for-the-buck rangefinder.It's comparable to units well-north of its price-tag.The accuracy is pretty good when aimed at something relatively large and reflective.Naturally, it gets dicier if the object is sloped, dark, and/or very distant.For most of my applications, this works just fine.Tip for golfers, the pin is usually often too thin to pick up.Try aiming it at something broader that's approximately equidistant, like a tree or a rock.If you're aiming uphill, you'll just have to try your best to lase the flag.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RFAFEYG73C460/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SX7JPMG#wasThisHelpful","RFAFEYG73C460","A1SI2993YY7C61","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1SI2993YY7C61?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is way better than I expected. It's a perfect fit on my HP Chromebook 14"". The handles are a high-quality webbing. The body is like that EVA material used in luggage. The sides are pretty shallow and do not bother my wrists when typing. The exterior fabric is pretty coarse and has great traction against your pants when you're working off your lap. Not as helpful on a smooth table, but it's not slick so it won't slide around.There's one handle on either side of the case which make it very easy to quickly open the Chromebook by the handles.There's enough room behind the screen to stash the AC adapter and 7"" tablet, Android of course. ;-)I use my Chromebook much more now that it has some protection and convenient carry handles.

"A hall-of-famer has already reviewed this, so I'll just add a few extra thoughts.It uses AAA batteries, which is far more convenient than button-cells. And they're accessible via a very simple trap-door. That's an under appreciated feature. Some tools require tools to disassemble and change batteries.I verified the tire pressure gauge against my most trusted dial-type pressure gauge. That's close enough for me. The digital readout is very easy to read.The red light is indeed a throw-back to the old days of reading maps by red-light to preserve night-vision. It's mostly useless for anything else. It's very dim and red light does not cast light well. If you have a light interior, you might be able to find a few things on your seats or dash, but for a dark interior like mine, the red-light is effectively useless. Same under the hood. It's not bright enough to illuminate anything. Doesn't hurt to have the feature though. You should have a map in the glove-box anyway, just in case your vehicle and phone lose GPS. They're free from AAA, weigh nothing, take up nearly zero space, and make excellent kindling in a pinch. :-)The white light, is just fine though. It's just bright enough to get the job done. It's a color is much cooler than an incandescent AA Maglite, but the intensity is nearly par. It casts a wide irregular beam out a few feet. Very efficient for inside the car, trunk, or under the hood. A little more light might be welcome, but isn't necessary.I have not tested this exact glass-breaker or seat-belt cutter, but I have tested similar ones at a pick-apart/u-pull. I concluded that hardness and point are the two most crucial factors. A steel glass-breaker requires a lot of energy because of how soft it is. They're very pointy when new, but after the test, all were blunted. Steel hardness varies with type, but carbide tips are far harder than any steel can ever be. The pointy ones will shatter glass with just a tap. Blunted carbide tips fall somewhere in between, depending on how rounded the tip is. This tool has a blunted carbide tip which isn't too rounded, so I expect it to require a confident swing, but should have no trouble.The breaker folds away, which is nice, but considering the blunted tip, probably not necessary. It's one less thing to snag and it does take up a little less space this way, and I appreciate that.Seat belt cutters were tested at the same pick-apart/u-pull yard and with various scraps of webbing. The conclusion was that this style of cutter with a shrouded razor blade works, but not well. They snag part-way through and required a lot of jerking. Perhaps the adrenaline of the moment will help you muscle through, but consider the awkward positioning of a shoulder belt across your chest. Righties in the driver's seat have a tough time since the angle of the belt is parallel to the direction of pull with your strong hand. Lefties are better off. The reverse is true of the passenger side. The best seat belt cutters were the gut-hook style made from higher-end knife steels no less than 420HC, but I've yet to see this style paired with a carbide glass-breaker at a reasonable price.BOTTOM LINE: The seat belt cutter could be better, but the other 4 features are great. For the price, I can't ask for a better multi-tool for auto-emergencies. The only tool that comes to mind that may be better than this is a Benchmade Triage which costs 8x as much and doesn't have lights or a tire-pressure gauge.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1DNVDG90PN2OX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UHNM1KM#wasThisHelpful","R1DNVDG90PN2OX","A1SI2993YY7C61","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1SI2993YY7C61?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm hesitant to give utilitarian products more than 4-stars, because it's really hard to love a device that only does what it's supposed to. I only give the 5th star when it exceeds expectations.

"I remember the analog version of this from decades ago, back when Radio Shack was not only in-business, but doing well. Back then, before prolific internet, this was conceived to carry a phone signal from one room with a phone jack to a room without a phone jack. Sending an analog signal over active noisy mains cables meant a lot of static on your phone calls, if it worked at all. Those units were $50 in '80s money, which is around $120 in 2015 money. In fact, I can still find them on Amazon: InstaJack, EasyJack, Etc.I tell you this to emphasize my trepidation when testing this. I expected the digital signal to fare better, but I never dreamed it would be crystal clear. Well lo and behold, it is. I have one end connected to my router and the other connected to a VOiP box. I detect zero static. It sounds exactly as clear as before when my VOiP was connected directly to the router. Even international calls are clear (said in my best infomercial voice).You may be thinking, VOiP isn't a bandwidth hog. How would a Gaming PC handle on this? Surely a powerful machine would overwhelm this hokey connection. Unfortunately, I've left my gaming days behind, so I don't have a L337 machine to test that, but I do have a HTPC and I couldn't detect any lag while streaming video. This thing is rated for 500Mbps, and thanks to modern packet-switching, it should handle all common household tasks. I don't recommend adding a router to this. Then you might really start testing the limits.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3082809JUSXU5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010Q29KRK#wasThisHelpful","R3082809JUSXU5","A1SI2993YY7C61","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1SI2993YY7C61?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've always preferred a spiral notebook for class and work. The ability to open 360 was great for crowded desks. But I would always destroy the spiral from repeatedly taking the notebook in and out of my bag. The spiral would snag on something or a few rings would bend out of place, and would ruin that ability to open flat. This notebook seems to have solved the problem by shrouding the rings with cloth. It prevents snagging and is still able to open flat.The pen holder is handy.The dividers are movable and the pockets hold a fair amount of paper. The little tabs that hold the dividers in place may get worn out or tear if moved too often.After a few days of use, I prefer this over 3-ring binders, composition notebooks, and stenographers pads, though the steno pad is a close 2nd.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1VLP62SO5XUQ5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00X7X2K9Q#wasThisHelpful","R1VLP62SO5XUQ5","A1SI2993YY7C61","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1SI2993YY7C61?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This griddle has SO many great applications. Aside from the usual griddle foods (pancake, eggs, bacon), you can cook also cook proteins that stick or fall through (fish, loose-packed burgers, tofu, vegetables, veggie patties, kabobs), and even bake to some extent (pizza, flatbread). And all of the food still catches that smoky charcoal flavor. There is some loss of flavor though, but it still tastes much better than when we use a frying pan in the house.But the application that really excites me, though I don't think it's advertised for this, is slow-roast BBQ. Get a low fire going, add a chip-pack if you want more smoke, and just forget about it for a few hours. I've tried this before straight on the grill, using a charcoal tray to one side and the meat on the other. There isn't enough charcoal to keep the heat consistent for hours. But if you lay out a good amount of charcoal, the direct heat dries and toasts the underside of the meat, not to mention the messy collagen/fat drippings all over your coals.This keeps the underside from drying and the trap catches all the drippings. The only caveat is that the smoked meat must be smaller than the griddle. That's fine for brisket and shoulders, but ribs need trimming. That's okay though, just chop off a few and freeze it for boiling stock later.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2S35OBBJZJW6J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003VGM012#wasThisHelpful","R2S35OBBJZJW6J","A1SI2993YY7C61","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1SI2993YY7C61?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a lot of watch for the money, which I guess isn't saying very much considering the price. There's a lot of style-infringement and the execution is pretty decent, even if the materials aren't great. The watch itself (hands, case, bezel, face, etc) are styled after Rolex. Search for Submariner to compare. The band is styled after Maratac's Zulu straps. Together, they give the watch a diver's look, which I find very attractive. Unfortunately, according to the manual, it's only water resistant to 10 meters and should not be immersed. That means no swimming, much less diving.The second hand jumps precisely from hash-mark to hash-mark. It's not mistimed like many watches I've seen in this price range.The bezel sounds a bit cheap when you turn it. The clicks sound light/thin. But the serration on the bezel is positive and it turns pretty smoothly. The timing marks on the bezel are a joke, so you won't actually need to crank it often.The band looks like a Maratac Zulu, but it isn't. It's a pretty decent knock-off though. The hardware is thick steel, much like a real Maratac. The holes are precisely fused. The nylon is fairly rigid.It arrived in an oversized cardboard box with minimal padding and a folded 8.5""x11"" sheet of paper they call a manual. It explains how to set the time, states that the bezel only turns counterclockwise, describes cleaning/maintenance/warranty. All very intuitive things that almost don't even warrant publishing.The manual suggests which ""setting"" to use with various grillables, e.g., NY Strip setting can also apply to Lamb Chops, Pork Chops, Beef Filets, Flat Irons. Take those suggestions with a grain of salt because the watch does not know the temperature or thickness of what I'm grilling. If my grill iss fired up to 600 and I'm grilling a 1/4"" slider, that burger will be crispy in the recommended 12 minutes.Additional things I'm curious to know:(1) Who made the movement? Amazon says Seiko, but nowhere else is that published. The case only says Japanese movement.(2) I know at this price, the crystal isn't going to be Gorilla or sapphire, but is it plain glass or at least a mineral crystal? For the price, I think mineral is a reasonable expectation.Really, what you have is a sharp looking watch that steals design points from other good looking pieces, all done in a BBQ theme. Notice, it even says Sauce Resistant. It's not exactly the most durable watch, but it comes at a very reasonable price. I haven't had this long, but I do love this watch. I will revise my review if the timepiece becomes inaccurate or otherwise unduly breaks, but I'm expecting this to keep on ticking with average use. You could do much worse this price. I rate this over any Fossil, Casio, Seiko, Timex, for the same price.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2J1V1NGB03N9K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010F333L4#wasThisHelpful","R2J1V1NGB03N9K","A1SI2993YY7C61","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1SI2993YY7C61?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a pretty decent diaper pail. The biggest selling point for us is that it uses plain trash bags which we buy in bulk anyway. Another advantage is the steel body which we're told will not absorb smells the way plastic does. And a benefit they don't mention is that the construction is hefty enough that it's more difficult to knock over than tall skinny cans like a Diaper Genie.Speaking of the Genie, we believe the Ubbi is superior. Even though we can get the refills fairly cheap via Costco and the Commissary, it's still pricier and less convenient compared to a big ol' box of Costco kitchen bags. And then there's the additional heft and stability mentioned earlier. The Genie is better at trapping smells in the bag during use as long as you're not squeamish about shoving your hand into a pail full of old diapers. Our plastic Genie hasn't absorbed much smell.Compared to our other pail, the Baby Trend Diaper Champ Deluxe, it's a draw. The Champ is plastic but wide and hefty. It's quite stable. It uses a sort of giant ball-valve to trap smells in the bag when tossing fresh ones. The Ubbi has no provision for trapping smells while open. Every time you toss one in, you get a whiff of stinky old diapers, but you learn to be quick about it. The Champ's plastic HAS absorbed some stink, but it's really not that noticeable, but I suppose this is one area where the Ubbi wins. So it's kind of a wash.But in the end, you can't help the smell. In all 3 cases, when you go to empty the pail, you get a big helping of days-old #1 & #2.Given a choice between the 3, I'd recommend the Champ overall because, as I said, it's a draw in performance, but it costs less than half the Ubbi! Next runner up is the Ubbi, despite the price. The Genie's easy to topple and the bags are annoying. Once we've used up all the bags, it's going to be donated or tossed.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1STQPVC22VVX4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00821FLT4#wasThisHelpful","R1STQPVC22VVX4","A1SI2993YY7C61","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1SI2993YY7C61?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've read some of the other reviews and I share some points I agree with:(1) There's nothing in here that should relieve itch, not even oatmeal.(2) It's a pretty decent body wash.If nothing else, this will suffice as a body wash, but you could buy another body wash for less.HOWEVER, I found that this actually works on me. I am not typically very itchy, but I do get some irritation after being in the sun for a while, especially when mowing the lawn. I develop a mild itch over every exposed body part. Showering with this immediately relieves the itch. Just as an experiment, I showered with this as a prophylactic and it worked; I wasn't itchy after mowing the yards.Judging by how my skin feels after using this, my theory is that it leaves a behind a film that keeps the skin hydrated and seals out irritants. This actually felt a little bothersome at first, a bit like sunscreen, but it wasn't unbearable.Another excellent use for this is to relieve those funny itches you cannot find. You know the ones where you end up scratching head-to-toe with no relief. Just jump in the shower with this and I'm relieved.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R14W4L6AJLDRI4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YXXPZLO#wasThisHelpful","R14W4L6AJLDRI4","A1SI2993YY7C61","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1SI2993YY7C61?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The film actually does resemble stained glass from 5 feet away. They're pretty convincing. The privacy is excellent. And because of the nature of the pattern, it's more forgiving to mistakes. I used a pattern called ""paper"" by the same manufacturer and because it was monotone and homogenous, you could very plainly see the bubbles and the edges peeling. It took 3 or 4 tries to get it right. This one went on in just one shot and I'm happy. The colors make our front entrance just a bit more fun.Many of the reviews are excellent.

"Very much like a K-Cup for gardeners. It makes it super-duper easy to start a garden. Each cup is filled with plenty of seeds to effectively guarantee that at least ONE plant will sprout from each cup. I didn't have a single dud. What more can I ask for.I do have 1 small complaint though. One pod opened, presumably in transit, and spilled everywhere. I was able to collect most of the seeds and put it back in the cup, but some were lost completely.

"First things first, to reap the FULL benefit of this 802.11ac wi-fi dongle, you must have a 802.11ac router. However, it will work with just about any wifi router on the market, albeit not at top speed.I do not have an 802.11ac router. In fact, I don't even have a 802.11n router anymore (long sad story). I'm running a plain ol' FiOS router which I believe is only 802.11b. This dongle found the network quickly and easily and stays connected, but it's not any faster than my previous dongle because the router is the limiting factor.But to that end, I want to stress how incredibly simple it was to set up. (1) Plug the dongle into your USB port (2) Insert CD into your optical drive and let it autorun (3) Select the driver-only or driver+utility for the T2UH (4) Wait for installation to finish (5) Connect to your network.The hardest part in the entire process is remembering your network name and password, but even if you've forgotten, TP-Link has you covered. If you're the forgetful type, I hope you have a router with WPS configuration. If you do, you can simply press the WPS button on your router and then press & hold the WPS button on the dongle. Hold it until the connection is established, and you're done. Easy peasy.If you're looking for an inexpensive, reliable, easy-to-use dongle to connect your device to your wifi network, you can't do much better than the T2UH. I confirm that this works well on my Windows 8.1 and Windows 7 machines.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R79FV43QWQJUP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UZRVY12#wasThisHelpful","R79FV43QWQJUP","A1SI2993YY7C61","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1SI2993YY7C61?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is very well constructed and relatively light too. I'm not the least bit concerned in the quality/robustness department.It does have a considerable amount of battery life and worked just fine outdoors in the relatively harsh 2015 winter. However, I received this late in the season and was unable to take this to the mountains where the super cold conditions tend to suck the life out of batteries.However, I'm a little annoyed with it's incompatibility with the standard waterproof GoPro housing. Falling snow or powder kicked up by other skiers/boarders/wind will stick and melt. This puts the camera at some risk. More importantly, the waterproof enclosure adds a moderate amount of shock-protection, which I appreciate as a clumsy all-mountain rider. Without it, I don't feel confident taking my GoPro on the slopes.I considered the following 2 options:1. Use the pole with the waterproof housing and forgo the USB connection. That basically makes it an overpriced selfie-stick.2. Modify the waterproof housing to allow for the USB connection. That makes it no-longer water-proof, but sufficiently water & shock resistant for use in the snow.And ultimately opted for #2 and bought another waterproof housing. All in all, I'd say it was worth it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1YKSC51LPMUEI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OIK31NG#wasThisHelpful","R1YKSC51LPMUEI","A1SI2993YY7C61","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1SI2993YY7C61?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Canister vacuums have more or less been completely replaced by uprights in the average American household. And in the last decade, we've all gone from bagged uprights, to bagless uprights. And with good reason. For most of us, a bagless upright maneuvers quickly and easily, takes up very little space, and weighs less. All great qualities, considering the landscape of the average suburban American home (taller and narrower to cram more homes in smaller spaces). So why would anyone take 2 steps back in vacuum technology to buy an old-school bagged canister vacuum?PROSAs far as aesthetics go, this thing is hands-down the prettiest vacuum I've ever seen. Dysons are attractive in a somewhat industrial and functional way, but this Miele has curves and real steel tones in an almost art-deco way.It's also the most solidly built vacuum I've seen since the old Dirt-Devil canister vacuum from back in the day. The steel neck is robust, heavy even. And the plastic halves click shut like something you'd find on a car than the usual cheap clackiness you find on Dysons and Rubbermaids. It's hard to explain, but this feels like a serious piece of equipment where the Dyson and Eurekas I own feel toyish. It makes vacuuming feel like you're accomplishing something, like you're actually working, rather than performing a chore. It's just an oddly satisfying feeling.This is the most quiet vacuum I've ever witnessed by a large margin. Even with the brush-roll on, you can carry on a conversation. Not sure why you'd want to, but you could. Naturally, you'd have to talk over it a bit, but you won't be shouting like when I use the Eureka.This (relative) silence belies its power. It's very capable of sucking up dust and crumbs. It doesn't choke on anything either. I don't have the tools to quantify the suction, but my calibrated arm-technique, it feels as strong as the Dyson, but over larger area.And about that brush-roll. It's electrically driven and it has way more torque than the pneumatic ones that rely on the suction to drive impellers and gears. Instead, this one just chugs along, sucking up long hairs with nary a hiccup.CONSBut, like all bagged canister vacuums from back in the day, it has the same flaws. You feel like you're dragging a small carry-on bag everywhere you go. The convenient handle makes it easier to transport, but it's still not as convenient as an all-in-one upright design.Replacing the tiny bags are simple, but not nearly as simple as pulling the trigger on the Dyson's trap door. On the bright side, you don't get a dust cloud when you change bags. The bags aren't cheap. There's no good way to reprocess them either, I tried.The air filter on the canister is nominal. It'll probably catch stray dust that escapes the bag, but nothing more. Miele sells a HEPA filter that looks like it'll be more effective at air filtration.It doesn't store as well as an upright. Uprights stand on their own and have a small footprint. The canister can sit up and it takes up less space that way, but the handle and vacuum head are big and cannot stand on their own. It's currently propped in the corner of a hall closet. Honestly, that's no worse than an upright, after all, they'd be standing in the same corner. But where this affects me is in between cleanings. For instance, let's say I vacuumed the dining room and want to straighten out the cushions before I vacuum the living room. I have to put the handle on the floor because it would slide down the wall if I propped it up. Also, sometimes, I leave the vacuum out in the middle of the room as a reminder to vacuum that day. While its inability to stand on its own is a very small nuisance to me, I imagine this will be a much bigger issue for folks with bad backs.TL;DR This is an excellent quality product that unfortunately doesn't suit the modern American home. But if you can put up with the quirks, it's really a great vacuum and deserves your consideration.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2CXHRPSRNU7EI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00R43I3XW#wasThisHelpful","R2CXHRPSRNU7EI","A1SI2993YY7C61","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1SI2993YY7C61?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There are many excellent uses for this body wash. Naturally, the first is for Baby. Our daughter has mild eczema and this doesn't seem to make it any worse. Other soaps make it flare up. Her skin feels softer during the wash too, so it seems to be pretty effective. I wish it were a miracle cure for her skin, but I'll take minor victories.What works for Baby, also works for Mom & Dad. Skin feels noticeably smoother after a shower, but it's a small bottle and we went through it really quickly once the adults started using it.M. Lafferman suggested using it for shaving. I have sensitive skin so I'm always on the lookout for a new product that takes the pain out of shaving. I've used hair conditioner in lieu of shaving cream with excellent results, so I knew he was probably right, and I just had to try. Lo and behold, it's better than conditioner, but not quite as good as Lubriderm. My Fusion cartridges glide over the skin with very little effort. It barely even tugs at the skin. I don't even need toner or balm afterwards. Best of all, it cleans right up. The Fusion with its tight blade spacing is notorious for collecting stubbly gunk between the blades. It washed right out with water. Normally, I'd have to tap pretty hard to get it clean.Just an observation, but this stuff is roughly 60 cents per ounce. It goes a long way on Baby, and with her skin condition, we'll buy her more. As for the grown-ups, we'll go back to normal body-washes which are around 20 cents per ounce. As great as it felt, it didn't feel 3x as good as Olay, for instance. Call me cheap. I admit it.Fun fact, calendula are also known as pot marigolds, not to be mistaken for other types of marigolds.

"It has a good heft without being heavy, and the tamping surfaces are very flat. It's better than I expected for the price and would have earned 5 stars if not for a small flaw.The flash (defined below) is too prominent. It interferes with the sides of the filter cup which is very slightly tapered. The cup has marks for double and quadruple shots. Because of the flash, the tamper will not reach the double shot mark. Basically, I can only make quadruple shots.Considering that it would drive up the price if they took the time to debur each tamper or improve their cast, I'd leave this product as-is. It's a solid 4.5-star product.If you're in the market for this size tamper, I recommend this. If the flash bothers you, you can do what I did and hand-finish it yourself. It's just aluminum, so you can knock down the flash with a steel file.From Wikipedia: Flash, also known as flashing, is excess material attached to a molded, forged, or cast product, which must usually be removed. This is typically caused by leakage of the material between the two surfaces of a mold (beginning along the parting line[1]) or between the base material and the mold (in the case of overmolding). Molding flash is seen when the optimized parameter on cull height is not calibrated.[citation needed] Proper design of mold parting surfaces can reduce or eliminate flash.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1YQOEW8OS8AM2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QQTA2B6#wasThisHelpful","R1YQOEW8OS8AM2","A1SI2993YY7C61","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1SI2993YY7C61?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This review is for the N300. It's not the easiest to set up, nor is it the prettiest. Had it been, it would've earned a full 5-stars. 4-stars is a good rating, equivalent to ""I like it."" I simply can't say ""I love it"" which would be a 5-star rating.The instructions were not what I'd call clearly written. 5-star instructions are immediately intelligible to an average user. If I weren't already experienced in setting up wireless networks, I might have struggled with the instructions that were provided. That said, it's not a difficult device to set up. You plug in a power outlet within range of your desired network. Connect your personal computer to the booster via wifi or the provided patch cable. Then, use the provided address to access the setup menu. There, you can see the networks within range. Connect the booster to your desired network. Wait while it saves. Once it restarts, you can unplug and relocate the booster anywhere within range of your network. Sound easy? Great, you'll have no trouble. Was that hard to follow? The instructions are worse.When everything else in the tech-world is so stylish and even $10 gadgets get the full industrial-design treatment, you can't bring a brick with antennas to market. Just look at the TP-Link AC750 sold on the same page. It may not be your cup of tea, but they put a lot of effort into making it easy on the eyes. The N300 looks like a brick-phone from the 80's. It would look right at home with an Apple II desktop computer. But the bigger issue isn't simply that it's ugly. It's brickiness means it sticks far out of the wall. If you plug a wall-wart into this, it'll stick out twice as far. For this reason, I put it in a low-traffic area where my family won't kick it by accident.But I DO appreciate the concept, and if you need a wifi booster in a home that doesn't have enough available power outlets, I DO recommend this. After all, despite my whining about its looks and setup instructions, it works quite well, at least for now.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3TZEM28ZT34E4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PEW7V7E#wasThisHelpful","R3TZEM28ZT34E4","A1SI2993YY7C61","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1SI2993YY7C61?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A lot of great reviews have been written about this radio already. If you haven't yet, I recommend you read the most helpful positive & critical reviews.There's not much I can add, so I'll try my best.Mine says ""Grundig Edition"" across the top. It's nice to see the legendary manufacturer's name on the radio, but it's only a name. Eton licenses the name in the US. The radio was designed & developed by Eton. Still, it was a pleasant surprise.Assembled in China. That doesn't bother me, but it does to some, so I'll mention it. It might explain some quality-control issues other reviewers have had, but my radio works just fine.Came with a really handy nylon pouch. It's not the prettiest, but the radio slides in and out smoothly and keeps some dust and moisture out. I could do without the large bright white Eton logo, but at least it's easy to identify. If this radio catches on like I imagine, there may be nicer pouches on the market soon. Maybe leather? Belt loops?My opinion on the sound-quality is that it's pretty good for what it is. The mono speaker does a decent job, but for better quality, you need to use headphones. It's not perfectly balanced, but I don't expect hi-fi sound from a tiny inexpensive transistor radio. It's more than good enough for hours of casual listening.It has every feature I could ask for in a radio except NOAA's National Weather Service. This would've been perfect if it just added that one feature.I don't miss the solar and/or crank features found on other Eton radios because this is supposed to be lightweight, compact, and portable. Adding solar makes it bigger to accommodate the surface area of a 3v panel, adds a nominal amount of weight & bulk, and makes it more fragile. The crank & dynamo would also add unwanted weight & bulk.I think the size is perfect as-is. It's similar in size to an iPhone 4, but weighs considerably less. It's barely noticeable in a pocket. I've added it to my EDC. A radio is an often forgotten EDC item. When a power grid crashes, it tends to take cell and cable out with it. Radio, OTA HDTV, and satellite may be the only sources of information at such a time, and of the 3, only the radio is portable. Remember to use lithium batteries for longer life and less weight.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3S1VA12FBQT28/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LEFYF4M#wasThisHelpful","R3S1VA12FBQT28","A1SI2993YY7C61","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1SI2993YY7C61?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"So far, this is turning out to be another excellent product from OXO. In one of the photos, you see the feet. They're just tall enough, stout enough, and spaced enough to allow plenty of drainage. Other mats I've used were too low and used many tiny feet. This lead to food getting stuck under the mat. I'm talking about common things like rice, getting hung up under the mat. I'd have to lift the mat and spray it down after every load of dishes.The design on this allows most food to drain away without getting stuck. I don't have to lift the mat unless something stringy gets under there, like tough noodles or stringy vegetables. This is much easier than before.The taller feet also provide more cushion. You can toss a dish in the sink pretty carefree. It will just bounce on the mat. On cheaper mats, the dish bottoms out and I could hear a thunk as the plate connects with the steel.It doesn't use suction cups, like some other premium mats I've tried, which is good. Food likes to get trapped around those cups too. And lifting it off to clean is much harder when they're anchored down with suction cups. That's why I made the decision, that if I have to release trapped food regardless, I may as well use something that's easier to lift.As much as I like it (4-stars), I don't love it (5-stars), because it isn't very attractive. It's a very utilitarian look. It's not even the usual 2-tone black & white OXO likes to use, not that it would've been an improvement. I think they were shooting for a neutral tone, but what they achieved is just dull grey. Are aesthetics really worth a full star? For many, the kitchen is the star of the house and everything in it needs to look good, so for those folks, yes it's easily worth a full star. It's more like a half-star for me, but since that's not an option, I give it 4-stars","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3B6YSH9ME4RO2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OCFCK70#wasThisHelpful","R3B6YSH9ME4RO2","A1SI2993YY7C61","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1SI2993YY7C61?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I only give 5-stars to things that go above & beyond expectation. Hard to do that with wipers, but these Bosch Insight blades accomplished that.As usual, removing the crusty old blades is the hardest part of the process. Once they're off, installing fresh blades are generally simple affairs.Once you pop the trap-door open, these go on like any other blade. Then, when you close the trap-door, they provide an additional positive lock. You can't remove them without opening the trap-door. I've never had a blade fall off before, but this still gives me peace-of-mind, which I appreciate. And that's the ""value added"" aspect that earns the 5th star.As a wiper, it's as good as the pair that came with my Subaru, which is to say, perfectly. Blade swings, water wipes off. No hiccups. There seems to be a bit more tension than factory, which I appreciate. I think that helps wipe away water more completely.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/REEPWCU53NSFV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MWNZ1LG#wasThisHelpful","REEPWCU53NSFV","A1SI2993YY7C61","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1SI2993YY7C61?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I like the simplicity of  installation.(1) Find appropriate screws(2) Find studs(3) Align between studs(4) Drive screws into studsIt's a sturdy plastic panel that gets the job done. Reminds me of the Race Deck garage flooring tiles.I like that you don't need to pre-install mounting spacers or lug huge cumbersome sheets of pegboard around.Black plastic finish looks pretty professional. Better than a cheap wood pegboard.But, that ease of installation robs you of the freedom to mount this wherever you need. You MUST hang between studs and that may not be the best location for you.Maybe if you plan to use this with very light tools, you can just use anchors in your drywall, but I would advise against that.All in all, I'd call it a wash. Just keep in mind the issue about mounting between studs. If that doesn't bother you, I'd have no qualms of recommending this to you.Project idea: This might look really good if you finish an entire garage wall (corner-to-corner, ceiling-to-floor) with these tiles. The tough plastic would protect your walls and you could mount just about anything anywhere on that wall. The dark plastic finish would look pretty macho too. You'd have to trim the edge pieces to fit.

"After reading other reviews, I've come to the conclusion that this product is particular about the type of mulch used.The most common complaint has been that the glue is too thin to hold their mulch in place. They spray more, and it turns white. Some have complained of it turning white even with a light application.My experience was nearly identical. The product looks like very runny glue. Upon first application, it didn't hold my mulch and it was starting to get a bit frosty. I applied a second coat later, and it became much more frosty.

"They do exactly what they're supposed to, so I like them. There's not enough of any 1 hook for me to finish my work bench, but it gives me a taste of everything, so I can buy more of the hooks I'll actually need.I didn't verify whether they hold up to the claimed 20 lbs, but I don't see any reason they wouldn't. They're solid thick-gauged steel, not like the cheap off-brand stuff.One thing to note is that this is for 1/4"" pegboard, either plastic or particleboard. Just as a test, I tried it on my tool chest which has 1/8"" steel walls.

"On the Amazon product page, this novel is described as:""-a cozy mystery with a dark side-some laughs, gasps, and a little murder-a heroine you'd like to take out for coffee or join for a beer on the beach-fun, smart, beautifully messy characters-contemporary mystery, romance and suspense""And in this case, Sea Devil is a story that actually delivers all it is said to be. ;-)I thoroughly enjoyed Sea-Devil from start to the exciting finish. It is a cozy mystery/romance with substance.Many of the chapters start with a description of a sea creature that is then used as a metaphor in the pages to follow; I thought that added a lot to the story overall and added a nice, original touch.The characters are well-developed, I especially liked Sam Tegue, the main character's boyfriend. All were believable for the most part although I did think some of the actions of the dysfunctional family members that Delilah had were just a tad ""over the top"".Example: SPOILER ALERT!!! When Uncle Clark just can't wait to publish that naughty photo of Delilah from the past in his newspaper, knowing it will be devastating to her and was of minor relevance to the current situation that the police were investigating. Then in other parts of the book, he is kind and generous to Delilah. I know a LOT about crazy families, I've met more than my share over the years, but I thought in some respects their nastiness and then rebound civility and in some cases kindness, didn't ring true at times. But this was a minor complaint I had with the book and definitely did not detract from enjoying it overall.This is a long novel (over 400 pages) for the kind of story that it is; again I appreciated this. I dislike novellas and novels that are too short and hover at 200 pages or less. IMO, not long enough to really develop most stories worth telling.LOTS of twists and turns and the author keeps the reader guessing right up until the last few pages, how the whole story will unfold. I appreciate that. Too many cozies are of the ""cookie cutter"" variety, with the same old, same old plot, with only minor variations for each story. Definitely not the case with Sea Devil.I will definitely be checking out more books from Jessica Sherry. She did a better than average job writing this one and the characters in this book could certainly be used effectively in a series worth reading.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R167A22LKQLGRJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012J1R1V8#wasThisHelpful","R167A22LKQLGRJ","A3W4VE2L5G4HN6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3W4VE2L5G4HN6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

So much for Christianity!!!This surprised and annoyed me so much that I gave up at that point.

"I'm always looking for ways to get more done in a day and to be less distracted along the way.I was attracted to this book by its title and also the many positive reviews written about it, at Amazon.com.Although it's obvious that a lot of work went into writing this book, it didn't appeal to me overall. Seemed to be a lot of the same things I had read elsewhere about prioritizing lists of things to do each day. And with the added suggestion to drop things from those lists if they weren't REALLY important for a person to actually complete.How would that realistically work for most people? I know that in my case, I often have things on my ""to do"" list that I'm not all that excited or crazy about BUT for whatever reason, eventually they still need to be addressed. Things like: paying bills, going for groceries, dentist appts....not thrilling by any means but still, in the real world, they have to get done. Wouldn't call them ""10s"" though, by any means.OK, but not a book I'd personally refer to or keep on my kindle. I have read a lot better motivational and organizational books.In my case, what seems to work best is not making the daily ""to do"" list TOO long but rather picking a realistic amount of things to actually complete or get a large part of them completed, that day. That DOES give me a sense of accomplishment and spurs me on.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2JVLD3HF81UM1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014OZ8W4C#wasThisHelpful","R2JVLD3HF81UM1","A3W4VE2L5G4HN6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3W4VE2L5G4HN6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was attracted to the cover, title and theme of this book so decided to give it a go. For the most part, I really enjoyed: The Sea Les Traveled.It is rather a unique story about a man who actually DOES run away from home and sail off into the sunset, finding adventure, romance and lots of abundance along the way, often in very unexpected places and ways.The description of sailing on the high seas in a large sailboat were interesting and were an eye-opener too. Not for the faint of heart or the weak of muscle, that's for sure.I did find parts of the story rather far-fetched but as the author states at the beginning of the book, parts were embellished and changed but apparently most of it did happen.I thought the author and his friends did a LOT of drinking, morning, noon and night...that part seemed a bit much, considering the long and early start of days on-board and quite unhealthy too.Overall though, an enjoyable ride along with Les, Essie and Long John...I wish I could have been there!!!Will check out other books from this author too.Geraldine Helen Hartman, author of: Third Chapter, Second Chance, a midlife romance","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Z43Q5UGNJ119/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0982335806#wasThisHelpful","R1Z43Q5UGNJ119","A3W4VE2L5G4HN6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3W4VE2L5G4HN6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"As I wrote about in my own book:Laughing AT the Grim Reaper! Gems of Wisdom for Aging Well,Ive had (MORE THAN) my share of sleepless nights, over the years. :-(Particularly annoying for me has been waking up in the middle of the night (around 3 AM) which is also a time referred to as:The Hour of the Wolf.Tossing, turning, wide awake but tiredthinking all kinds of crazy, annoying and at times, very disturbing thoughts. Where some of them came from, I have no idea. But enough to keep me awake and to interrupt sleep in a most unpleasant way.The sleepless night situation HAS improved in the past couple of years as I have been making a real effort to go to sleep in a calm, relaxed frame of mind and when I DO wake up, in the middle of the night now, there are a lot fewer negative thoughts that come to mind.But now, when it does happens, I replace these thoughts with positive ones. Good things I choose and WANT to dwell on,its worth the effort and it really has helped.I happened to be browsing over at Amazon one day recently and did a search for Hour of the Wolf as I had seen the  Ingmar Bergman movie of the same name, many years ago in Toronto and wondered if it was still available. A strange, surreal and original story that I never completely forgot.And the term hour of the wolf is one that has always stayed with me, particularly on sleepless nights when I wake up during the period between 3-5AM  AKA, the hour of the wolf.When I did that search at Amazon, this Kindle book: Taming the Hour of the Wolf, also came up and I am SO glad I checked it out too. Its a wonderful book! :-)Written in a personable, engaging style and filled with 144 affirmations that readers can refer to, again and again, when the Hour of the Wolf strikes a discordant note.I am a true believer in the power of positive thoughts and particularly affirmations.The ones that the author shares in this book are divided into categories including:Sleeplessness, Negativity & Doubt, Procrastination, Abundance and several others.By choosing a particular category, you are then given a list of useful and calming affirmations to help still the mind and replace negative, upsetting thoughts, particularly during the Hour of the Wolf.I think most people at some time or other grapple with sleepless nights. Its not fun, its frustrating and getting back to sleep can be so difficult attimes.By keeping this book: Taming the Hour of the Wolf, close at hand on a bedside table perhaps, there is help only a click or page turn away.The Kindle version (which is the one I have) is nicely formatted, with full page nature photos to begin each new category.  And at less than a $1. for the Kindle version right now, a real bargain for a reference guide that I know I will be referring to, again and again. Especially when the hour of the wolf takes a turn for the worse and I need some positive thoughts to help to calm my mind and get back to sleep.If you also struggle with ongoing or even occasional sleepless nights, check this one out.Also shared at: mypoeticpath. wordpress.com  and myreallifereviews  .com (spaces removed)HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!*****NOTE to Author: I would appreciate you getting in touch via email if possible as I have a couple of questions re: this kindle book, thanks.

"This soap has an ok ingredient list but it goes downhill steadily from there.First of all, the bars are SO big that they are hard to grip when taking a shower. Yes, there is such a thing as a bar of soap being too big and this one is.Then there is the slime factor. After only a couple of uses, this soap gets all slimy and gooey, no matter how often you empty out the soap dish.The smell of this soap is hard to describe, it IS nauseating as another reviewer mentioned, not pleasant at all. I don't like heavily scented products of any kind but for this one, it's a case of it being a very weird, 'earthy' smell that lingers on the skin afterwards.I now use Dr. Bonner's unscented soap bars and have been very happy with their products.

"A very interesting and in depth personal story about life in Belize.I've been fascinated by this part of the world for many years. For the most part, up until reading this book, I had only read stories about the idyllic, tropical setting, friendly people, cheap cost of living....none of the downside aspects of what this ""paradise"" can also is all about.I was particularly shocked and saddened to read that there are a lot of Belize residents who are not eco-conscious AT ALL and routinely burn all types of garbage etc...and also about how much animal cruelty there exists there too. Very upsetting.I do wonder though, why the author still lives there, given the MANY negatives he writes about in this book about Belize.

"...not as good as I expected it to be, based on the many glowing editorial reviews about this book and its author,Roy Rowan.As a couple of other reviewers have mentioned here, it toggled between a self-help book and memoir and that was a bit distracting.I also would have preferred a more optimistic tone overall. I didn't enjoy reading all the (sometimes gory) details about his two experiences with cancer and the MANY pages of war stories.I think this book would appeal to people who have lived some of the same experiences as this author, living abroad extensively and/or as an international reporter.

Barbara Stanwyck and Burt Lancaster are both terrific and the story has some unexpected twists and turns to keep things interesting from beginning to end.SPOILER ALERT..I particularly liked the scenes set on Staten Island, mysterious and added so much to the intrigue and suspense.

"I liked some aspects of this story but not everything.The good: liked the choice of the 1950s and the ""noir"" type feel to the story. Henry was a believable main character and for the most part like-able. Lots of twists and turns to keep things interesting and to keep the reader guessing how things would eventually turn out. I also (unlike several other readers) DID like the time travel closet, I thought it was a rather unique idea to add to a detective story.Loved the cover too, just perfect!What I didn't like, some of the plot is kind of far-fetched. SPOILER!!!! Henry allows Luna to go back to her home in the woods and to stay for hours at a time at a hotel, when the bad guys are hot on their trail, that didn't ring true. Another thing I wondered about was when Henry was told to be at the docks at 11 and then it's actually midnight when the meeting begins. What happened there? Did they keep him waiting or was it a mistake by the author, about the different times mentioned in the book for this meeting?I would have liked a LOT more 50s related references in the story re: cars, clothes, food, music, slang...that always adds to these kinds of nostalgic stories, in a big way. Not much that made it uniquely 50s fare.I think I may check out more books by this author, based on this experience but it will have to wait till I catch up with my Kindle backlog.

The British humor in this book really appealed to me as did the redemptive aspects  of the story as well.I'm taking off one star as I would have enjoyed more of a focus on Imogen's present day life and the steps she took to carry on as a newly divorced woman and not so many stories about past jobs, experiences...I found the present day passages much funnier and kept me wanting to read more.

"In spite of not being a big fan of Cary Grant, I loved this movie! In other films from the 40s and 50s that I've seen him in, he often appears rather blase and one dimensional, more there for ""eye candy"" than playing a role authentically. Not the case in Notorious, he was wonderful and perfect for the role of Devlin. And as usual, Ingrid Bergman was perfection and oh so beautiful too. The chemistry between them was tangible. I also loved Claude Rains, again perfect for the role he played.This movie has it all, suspense, intrigue, romance, great settings, beautiful costumes...I was sorry to see it end but I DID like the ending.

Unfortunately, it fell well short of my expectations, especially considering all the good reviews I had read about it previously.I thought the time frame of going back and forth between past and present, with so many characters, and how quickly these transitions were made, took away from what could have been a better book overall.

She really was believable as a nun and that's the kind of part I couldn't previously have imagined her playing. A long way from her usual sexy, sultry roles.This is a sad story and at times far-fetched. Some parts re: race are offensive too. But given the time it is set in, that probably was the norm. Still worthwhile and rather a unique story too, if you usually enjoy movies made in the 50s.

The black color appears somewhat faded and slightly brown in places, may be a flaw in the dye, but might indicate the product was pre-owned. Pre-ownership may also explain discrepancy in sizing as other reviews cite the product stretches significantly with wear.EXPLANATION AS TO WHY I DID NOT TRY ON THIS PRODUCT: To be clear, I had every intention of trying the top on and in other circumstances I'd have done so, but I was too grossed out to attempt it. Fresh out of the packaging the top was streaked with either dust or deodorant and the back sported what appeared to be human hair and dandruff. This was not a factor in my review as it doesn't describe the product itself, but I feel my review would be suspect and dishonest if I implied I tried on the shirt and/or didn't offer plausible explanation on my admission of not trying it out. The color and size of the product left me suspicious that the item I received was pre-owned/worn and the state of the product I received appears to support that impression.","2.0 out of 5 stars","November 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R29L7DLOHS6CCP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CE5ZG76#wasThisHelpful","R29L7DLOHS6CCP","A7WNQN5D1E4HW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A7WNQN5D1E4HW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"*** I received this product free of charge in exchange for an honest and unbiased review. ***Pros: Generally speaking I like the design of this product. The grip opened easily, held my phone securely, and the swivel head made it easy to align the phone to my line of vision.Cons: That said, the base is a little bulky and that made it difficult to position the mount in the 5-inch square of the lower corner of the windshield as required by law. I was also frustrated that the suction didnt hold in the heat of my afternoon commute, causing me to reinstall the mount at each of my three stops between work and home.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2Y9N7O3I7P2I6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0126SWVPA#wasThisHelpful","R2Y9N7O3I7P2I6","A7WNQN5D1E4HW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A7WNQN5D1E4HW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've a problem with Elizabeth Chadwick. Well, not personally, I've a problem reading her work. I pick it up intending to read one chapter, but somewhere between points a and b, I fall through the damned pages and lose all sense of time and responsibility. I should have started the laundry two hours ago, but what was I doing instead? Tramping around the Welsh Marches.Am I sorry? Not in the least. Okay, maybe a little. I'll be scrambling to find clean clothes come morning, but I'm quite pleased with the time I spent on this book. Chadwick's ability to blend fact and fiction is brilliant and while I don't feel The Leopard Unleashed is her strongest effort, I admire much of the content and greatly enjoyed the narrative's direction and tone.Guyon trumps both, but I admit I like Renard more than Adam. I had difficulty warming to the latter when reading The Running Vixen, but Renard's easy-going manner, modest tastes, and perceptive nature intrigued me almost instantly. I wish Chadwick had written more from his perspective, I think there was a lot of untapped potential in his character, but I liked what she offered and thought his personality and disposition engaging just the same.That said, I think Elene the strongest of the three heroines. She's a contented homemaker, but shrewd, intelligent, and capable. She's insecure, but I think her struggles intensely realistic and I liked how Chadwick was able to showcase her emotions without sacrificing Elene's integrity. Her gentle inexperience makes an interesting contrast to Olwen's bold proclivities, but she's intensely empathetic and I found much to appreciate in her quiet strength and intense loyalties.I wasn't particularly fond of Olwen, but that has more to do with the structure and development of her character than her personality. She's shamelessly bold and conniving, but I think she'd have read better if the reader had been privy to more of her scheming. She disappears for several chapters of the narrative and is reintroduced in an entirely new situation and I would have liked to see her rationalizing that transition. The incident with Ranulf's would have been equally interesting, as would her seduction of Owain. All this happens 'off screen' and while I recognize the intent, I felt the approach left her somewhat fractured and arbitrary. Like Renard, I liked what was offered, but I think more could have been done with her character and role.The supporting cast didn't interest me as much as they did in earlier novels. Ranulf of Chester was more a more convincing antagonist that Walter de Lacey, but I struggled to understand the origin of the animosity he harbored against Renard. Judith and Guyon make brief appearances, but their roles aren't as significant as Miles' in The Running Vixen. Henry felt underdeveloped in my eyes which made his emotional trials difficult to fathom. Hamo was superfluous in my opinion and while Stephen made an impression, he paled next to predecessors William II and Henry I. I truly enjoyed Chadwick's interpretation of Antioch and the Battle of Lincoln, but I felt the absence of Raymond of Poitiers and Empress Matilda. Both are mentioned, but neither enjoys face time with the reader. Owain Gwynedd interacts with Ranulf toward the end of the novel, but it is a cameo appearance, one that left several unanswered questions in its wake.There is a lot going on towards the end of the novel and while I appreciated the action, I felt the final chapters rushed and slightly awkward. It isn't like Chadwick to leave loose ends, but I felt there was a lot of unresolved drama in this particular volume and that put a slight damper on my appreciation of the novel's strengths. I loved the book and would definitely recommend it, but I wish there'd been more to it as it doesn't offer the closure one expects at the end of a series.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3J74WT1M407X4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0751541362#wasThisHelpful","R3J74WT1M407X4","A7WNQN5D1E4HW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A7WNQN5D1E4HW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I got excited about Marci Jefferson's Enchantress of Paris the moment I learned its release date. I'd fallen in love with Girl on the Golden Coin: A Novel of Frances Stuart in 2013 and had high hopes for the author's sophomore release. I knew nothing about Marie Mancini or Cardinal Mazarin, but I was excited at the prospect and eagerly anticipated watching the unfamiliar story unfold under Jefferson's pen.Did the book live up to my expectations? Yes and no. There were a lot of things I loved about the story, but I'd be lying if I didn't admit the time I spent with this particular narrative left mixed impressions in its wake.Like many of my fellow reviewers, I fell for Jefferson's heroine. Marie is intelligent, passionate, romantic, and tenacious, but my favorite aspect of her being is that she is vulnerable. This is a seventeenth century woman, but the flaws Jefferson incorporated in her characterization make Louis' mistress empathetic, engaging and relatable.I've not spent much time on fictional accounts of the Sun King, but I thought Jefferson's interpretation of Louis XIV equally noteworthy. Young and idealistic, he is portrayed as a monarch still growing into the duties and responsibilities of his position. He is unsure of himself and easily manipulated, but his growing confidence endears him to the reader and gives them reason to overlook, or at least accept, his personal shortcomings.I enjoyed the politics Jefferson folded into the narrative as well as the social drama experienced by her cast. I felt the multiple allegiances, rivalries and ambitions depicted within these pages authentically convoluted and appreciated the effort that went into crafting such a tangled web of pretension and purpose. I also thought the novel convincingly atmospheric and savored the descriptive details scattered throughout Marie's story.That said, there were several elements I thought might have been stronger if they'd been more fully developed. I liked the ambiguity of the magic depicted within these pages, but I was disappointed at how thoroughly the theme faded as the story progressed. Marie's maid Morena fascinated me, but her character arc ultimately felt incomplete, unfinished and fragmentary in my eyes.Olympia, Hortense and Marianne boasted similar potential, but despite their fascinating and controversial legacies, the trials of Marie's sisters go virtually unacknowledged. Don't misunderstand, I truly adore the story as written, but I couldn't help wishing she'd spotlighted the girls as Perinot did Marguerite and Eleanor in Sister Queens or Quinn did Cornelia, Lollia, Diana, and Marcella in Daughters of Rome.Do I regret the time I spent on Enchantress of Paris? Hardly. Jefferson is a gifted storyteller and I adore the fiction she crafted. I believe more could have been done with the material, but I've no complaints of what appears within these pages and look forward to her next release.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3ALVT39JPBR0S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250057094#wasThisHelpful","R3ALVT39JPBR0S","A7WNQN5D1E4HW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A7WNQN5D1E4HW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Kindle Unlimited catalog is chock full of titles. I've browsed it a couple of times and bookmarked more than a few promising pieces, among them, Clare Flynn's Kurinji Flowers. None of my friends had read it, but the premise sounded different and I loved the idea of a WWII story set in a nontraditional locale so I threw caution to the wind and checked it out.Fortune, it's said, favors the bold and my daring was justly rewarded. I felt certain aspects of the novel could have been stronger, but I genuinely appreciated a lot of Flynn's ideas and admired much of the material she incorporated into Ginny's story. The social structure of the British, its contrast to that of the natives, and the inevitable struggle between the two was particularly noteworthy. I felt the relationship between Ginny and her mother struck a very intriguing note and I liked the subtle way that politics influenced events as the story progressed.Not to downplay Ginny, but I was fascinated by three of Flynn's male characters. Hector is a flat out brilliant addition to the piece. His character arc really appealed to me and I felt Flynn's treatment of his trials both appropriate to the period and sensitive to the subject matter. Rupert is a disgusting example of humanity, but such individuals do exist and despite my distaste, I admit a certain appreciation for Flynn's depiction of his depraved personality. I genuinely disliked him and right or wrong, my lack indifference speaks to a penetrating characterization and that is something I feel all authors should strive for. Tony rounds out the trio and though I felt his dialogue annoyingly reminiscent of Phil in Miss Pettigrew Lives for a Day, I felt his emotional journey the most engaging of the narrative. He is arrogant, but weak, sheltered and naive. He strives to fulfill society's expectations, but he is woefully ill-prepared to do so. I might be alone here, but I liked seeing so much emotional conflict and individual struggle in a male character. I personally thought it a refreshing change of pace and lent a certain authenticity to him and his role.Thematically, I liked what Flynn presented, but I'm not ashamed to say I felt there was too much going on. There is a lot of great concept material within these pages, but the various concepts compete for the reader's attention and I don't think any is explored as thoroughly as it could have been. Looking back, I certainly appreciate where the story went, but I can't help wishing Flynn hadn't tried to fit many underlying motifs into a single piece. Not to sound picky, but I honing in and really developing one or two of these ideas would have been more satisfying on the reader's end.That said, I've no regrets over the time I spent with Kurinji Flowers. I found the novel original and thought-provoking and look forward to reading more of Flynn's work.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R4PTZ439YGJXQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NA9YFRW#wasThisHelpful","R4PTZ439YGJXQ","A7WNQN5D1E4HW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A7WNQN5D1E4HW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've read Elizabeth Chadwick's The Wild Hunt three times now and I love it as much today as I did when I first discovered it. As a teen, I was seduced by the romance between Guyon and Judith, but as an adult I find myself draw to the characters, atmosphere, politics, history and emotional conflict. Romance aside, there is a certain timelessness to the narrative that appeals on a variety of levels.Guyon's relationship with Judith might sound odd to some, but the pairing of a twenty-eight year old to a maid of sixteen was quite acceptable in the twelfth century and I like that Chadwick didn't shy from exploring the intricacies of that age gap. The novel spans four years and the emotions she illustrates in both hero and heroine are intensely authentic. The relationship ebbs and flows, it changes as the characters grow together and that really worked for me.Guyon's relationship Rhosyn is equally intriguing. Chadwick's treatment of the Welshwoman in downright captivating. On the surface, she is Judith's rival, a pebble in the boot of the Lady's marriage, but as a reader I couldn't help respecting Rhosyn's position and spirit. She is honest to herself, kind, generous, gentle, sensitive, accepting, practical and realistic. I liked that. Too often, authors paint the other woman in extreme shades, but I felt Chadwick's approach thought-provoking and appreciate how she handled Guyon's conflicting emotional allegiances without physical infidelity or blatant stereotyping.Several members of the supporting cast also caught my eye. The author had no cause to develop them as she did, but conflicts each faced over the course of the story added much to the fabric of the narrative. Eluned's childish infatuation and jealousy, Rhys' sense of possession and developing understanding of the world and Alicia's struggle for happiness both during and after her marriage pulled me further into the story. Each has an individual journey and I liked how their struggles played into the main story line.Chadwick's book marked my first introduction to the Welsh March Wars, but I've learned a lot about them over the years and revisiting the novel only heightens my admiration for her handling of the material. Most who read the book will remember the character drama, but the power struggle between Guyon and the other marcher lords is rather interesting if you've an interest in period politics. The novel touches on the death of William II and ascension of Henry I, but Chadwick's focus is definitely on the border violence that characterized the age.Atmospherically, I love this piece. There are a couple of words, treadmill for example, that stand out like sore thumbs, but for the most part the language and descriptions feel genuine to the era. Chadwick obviously understands the period and the lifestyles of those who lived in it. Folk remedies such as moldy bread are prominently depicted, but no one feigns to know why the treatment is effective and there are no undue hints that the concoction of bacteria on the aging crusts is in fact penicillin.Bottom line, The Wild Hunt is a wonderful book. Brilliant in both historic detail and fictional drama. Highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R9OV715243WHL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0751540269#wasThisHelpful","R9OV715243WHL","A7WNQN5D1E4HW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A7WNQN5D1E4HW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've no nostalgic memories of Elizabeth Chadwick's The Running Vixen. I've read The Wild Hunt three times, but the second installment of 'The Ravenstow Trilogy' enjoyed limited international release and was next to impossible to find when I first discovered the series in the late nineties. Fortunately for me, the book was reprinted in 2009 and I was afforded a cost-effective means of indulging my interest.Though not specifically illustrated, I love Chadwick's mention of The White Ship and the crisis it created for Henry I. The book itself documents events between 1026 and 1028, but it is chock full of references to The Anarchy and the events that led to it. William le Clito, Geoffrey of Anjou and Hugh de Mortimer enjoy small, but noteworthy roles and I liked how their inclusion added to the political drama that played out in the background of the novel. I was further impressed with how Chadwick made the bureaucratic unrest relevant in the eyes of her fictional cast. Miles' grandson and namesake drowning alongside William Adelin, Adam serving as royal escort for Empress Matilda, and Guyon's personal support of Stephen of Blois weren't exactly pertinent to Adam and Heulwen's story, but such details spoke to the author's deep appreciation for the facts on which her story is based and her dedication in recreating this time and place for her audience.As far as the narrative is concerned, I wont deny feeling The Running Vixen took a long time to find its feet. Chadwick's books usually draw me in immediately, but I was a good seventy pages into this installment before I fell into the story and I think that had a lot to do with the relationship between Heulwen and Adam. Unlike their predecessors, Adam and Heulwen have history. They are at a turning point in their association while the reader is playing catch-up. Chadwick handled the situation well, but as stated, development took a little longer than I'd anticipated. In comparing the book to its predecessor, there is also a notable shift in both style and tone. It's not bad by any mean, but it is very different.I found Heulwen fascinating, especially as the story progressed. She has many original attributes, but I noted traits reminiscent of both mother and stepmother in her demeanor. I made no secret of my appreciation for Rhosyn in my review of The Wild Hunt and maybe I'm alone in this, but I thought Heulwen's tendency to seek solace away from the confines of the keep a nice nod to her mother's aversion to stone walls. Her married life is challenging, but Chadwick managed to make her demons very different from Judith's which is why I feel the story works. The author picked up where she left off, but took things a completely new direction to explore entirely new subject matter.Guyon is a tough act to follow, but I think despite the odds, Chadwick managed to do a lot of interesting things with Adam. I thought his struggle to balance his own merit against his father's legacy inspired and feel it brought an interesting dynamic to his role, especially toward the end of the novel when his insight serves a poignant and tender purpose. I also liked that for all the skill in his sword arm, he finds himself at something of a disadvantage with Heulwen. It's not something I've noted often in medieval fiction, but I found the intimate role reversal both striking and original.Miles caught my eye in book one of the series, but he shines in book two. Despite his pride, the aging patriarch is openly devoted to his family and I liked how Chadwick utilized him to further his granddaughter's story. Rhodri has a lot going on under the surface and while I wasn't particularly fond of him, I wont deny appreciating how the author's presentation challenged me to think about him from different angles. As far as antagonists go, I felt Warrin de Mortimer stronger than Walter de Lacey. He's isn't likable or sympathetic, but he isn't one dimensional either and I liked the idea of villain with layers.The Running Vixen is heavily romantic, but it is also clever and engaging. It's a little slow in places, but it is a solid sequel to The Wild Hunt and something I'd definitely recommend to fans of medieval fiction.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1L0EHSKOVZO0I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0751541354#wasThisHelpful","R1L0EHSKOVZO0I","A7WNQN5D1E4HW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A7WNQN5D1E4HW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I owe my discovery of Richard Rashke's Escape from Sobibor to my father. He introduced me to the death camp in one of our notorious late night discussions and his account of operations within the compound and the subsequent uprising that took place there were so captivating that I took it upon myself to learn more about the remarkably obscure chapter of Operation Reinhard.Rashke's was the first title Google turned up and thanks to Open Library, it was also freely available for download. I felt providence was on my side and I checked it out thinking myself well-prepared for the material it promised to address. A WWII junkie, I'd studied AuschwitzBirkenau, Treblinka, Theresienstadt and Ravensbrck in some detail and couldn't imagine the accounts of this camp being much different. It took only a few pages for me to realize how wrong that assumption had been.Broken into three sections, the book is extraordinarily comprehensive. It covers the prisoners, their lives before transportation, life and death behind Sobibor's barbed wire, the soldiers, their duties, the planning phase of the uprising, the execution of the mass escape and the events that followed in the surrounding forests.I spent almost a month wading through the accounts Rashke painstaking recorded within these pages, but I don't regret a minute of it. I put the book aside several times to process and consider events as I discovered them, but the publication was never far from my mind. Fact is it dominated my imagination and challenged my perception in ways I hadn't expected when I first cracked it open. It put my brain into overdrive and I liked the depth and dimension it brought to the subject matter.Exceedingly intense, the book itself is a brilliant blend of historic detail and raw human emotion. Poignant, powerful, unapologetic and ofttimes overwhelming, Escape From Sobibor is easily the best Holocaust book I've had fortune to pick up. A highly recommended and unique volume that deserves a place in every WWII library collection.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZX2PMCQVW7R2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1480458511#wasThisHelpful","RZX2PMCQVW7R2","A7WNQN5D1E4HW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A7WNQN5D1E4HW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I discovered Nathan Dylan Goodwin's The Orange Lilies while browsing the Kindle Unlimited catalog. None of my Goodreads contacts had read the novella and the Amazon reviews weren't particularly detailed, but the premise held promise and I decided to give it shot.Before I get too far ahead of myself, I want to make a couple of things perfectly clear. The Orange Lilies is book 2.5 of Goodwin's Forensic Genealogist series, but it can be read as a standalone. I know because it's the first I picked up. It's also a bit of a slow starter so don't toss it aside if you aren't captivated by the end of chapter one. Here again folks, I'm speaking from experience.Despite being a mere one hundred pages in length, the book is filled with several wonderful characters. Charlie, Nellie, Margaret and Morton in particular struck a chord with me. They each enjoy relatively modest face time with the reader, but they feel fresh and original nonetheless.Goodwin's descriptions of the Western front are brilliant. The author worked far more detail into the piece than I'd expected and I was quite impressed with his realistic portrayal life at the front. From the mud and blood to the mental fatigue and gallows humor of those struggling to survive the trenches, these scenes demonstrated both Goodwin's skill and dedication to authenticity.The modern day story line is equally captivating. The multi-generational mystery of family secrets took longer for me to appreciate, but as the pieces fell into place, I recognized a growing fascination with the puzzle that represents Morton's personal history.Highly recommended to fans of both historic and contemporary fiction.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2S0PYEDVLEYBR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QF7HXAW#wasThisHelpful","R2S0PYEDVLEYBR","A7WNQN5D1E4HW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A7WNQN5D1E4HW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Ellen Feldman's Next to Love was a recommended read. Heather, the voice behind The Maiden's Court, suggested it at the Historical Novel Society Conference in Denver and I tracked down a copy soon after returning home. I wasn't at all familiar with it, but her rending of the plot had me sold sight unseen.She mentioned the trials of life on the home front, but was very clear that the story focused on post-war America as well. She mentioned that one of the heroines struggled to understand her husbands PTSD and that another was defined by her husbands death. She went on, but my mind was already racing. I flashed on that scene in A League of Their Own, the one in the locker room where the Peaches apprehensively watch Jimmy Dugan walk the telegram down the line. The audience breathes a sigh of relief for Dottie Hinson, but what happened to Betty Horn? How did she weather the years without George? It wasnt something Id ever considered, but I couldn't argue the potential in the story of a war widow.At this point youre probably wondering if the book lived up to Heathers praise and/or my imaginings and Im happy to report, it did. I think Babe, Millie and Grace make very interesting protagonists and I liked watching their lives and personalities change with each passing year. I also liked style and tone of Feldmans writing and found it very easy to slip into the world she created within these pages.My only complaint is the structure of post-war chapters. I didnt like the sudden shifts to narrators in the supporting cast. Sporadic intervals with Naomi, Claude, King, Jack, Al, Mac and Amy felt awkward in the context of the story and made it difficult to remain focused on the central trio. The erratic timeline caused further confusion and often forced me to stop and rearrange events in my head to make sense of the order in which they took place. I liked how Feldman used multiple perspectives to explore various themes, but I can'd help feeling her execution imprudent and that the latter chapters of the novel suffered as a result.Obviously I'd have liked a stronger ending, but I cant say I felt the time I spent with Next to Love wasted. The presentation was disappointing, but I greatly enjoyed the plot and look forward to reading Feldman again somewhere down the road.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2A31OLO7SBSGP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004KPM1W6#wasThisHelpful","R2A31OLO7SBSGP","A7WNQN5D1E4HW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A7WNQN5D1E4HW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The premise of Praveen Asthanas The Woman in the Movie Star Dress looked vaguely interesting when I skimmed the description, but my main interest in the book was that it wasnt historic fiction. Id just come off a heavy hitting period piece and I was looking for a break. I mean no offense, but I didnt expect much of this piece and was entirely unprepared when it captured my imagination hook, line, and sinker.Im a voracious reader, but when I dont have my nose in a book, I greatly enjoy movies which probably explains my enthusiasm for the myriad of motion picture references in The Woman in the Movie Star Dress. The title garment is the striking red number worn by Marilyn Monroe in Niagara, but the story also refers films such as When Harry Met Sally, Roman Holiday, Before Sunset, Witness for the Prosecution, Alien, Silence of the Lambs, Double Indemnity, To Kill a Mockingbird, and Casablanca. There are others, but what Im getting at is how Asthanas allusions draw readers into the narrative by playing on the emotional connections we make to films and those who star in them. Its an interesting tactic, but it works beautifully beginning to end.Another thing I loved about this book is how deliciously atmospheric it felt. I reveled in the authenticity of scenes at Griffith Park, onboard the Queen Mary and inside the chapel at Mission San Juan Capistrano. I grinned over the authors illustration of the street performers that occupy the cement outside Grauman's Chinese Theatre and sympathized with Genevieves frustration with traffic on the five. It isnt often that one sees their corner of the world through the eyes of a storyteller, but I cant help feeling Asthana interpretation genuine.As to Genevieve, well, Asthanas leading lady took some getting used to, but she grew on me as the story progressed and I felt quite connected to her when all was said and done. Shes an emotionally complex character and I liked that a lot. The same can be said of much of the cast now that I stop and think about it. Renzo and Todd are just as distinct and not just from one another. Theyve a unique quality about them, something real and relatable.Conceptually intriguing and dramatically dark, The Woman in the Movie Star Dressed proved an absolute pleasure. Brilliantly imaged and thoroughly addicting.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R26ERLSG5AYVBT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0692367446#wasThisHelpful","R26ERLSG5AYVBT","A7WNQN5D1E4HW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A7WNQN5D1E4HW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I owe my introduction to The Graham Saga to Amy Bruno at Historical Fiction Virtual Book Tours. Anna Belfrage was not a name Id known before receiving an invitation to review the authors sophomore release and while I remember thinking Like Chaff in the Wind looked vaguely interesting, I also remember wrestling down a significant amount of skepticism. I never expected to fall in love with the world Belfrage created, to connect with her characters or become thoroughly captivated by their experiences, but that is exactly what happened.To make a long story short, I loved the book and inhaled installments three through seven as soon as they were published. That said, it wasnt until early 2015 that I decided to backtrack. Book one had taunted me for two years and I didnt feel right tackling the series finale without knowing where Alex and Matthews journey began. My timing couldnt have been better as the action in To Catch a Falling Star is closely related to plot points introduced in A Rip in the Veil. Linked as they are, I couldnt help feeling the two served as beautiful bookends to the series and while I feel book one the most challenging in terms of content, my understanding of the how the novels progress allowed me to appreciate the intent and purpose of the novel in a way that is probably much different from those who approached the books chronologically.First and foremost, I want to note A Rip in the Veil is historically lighter than the rest of the series. Dont misunderstand, there is plenty of period detail in these thirty-seven chapters, but Belfrages focus is in developing the relationship between hero and heroine. On a macro level this makes perfect sense as their partnership is the cornerstone of the series and requires solid development. The same can be said of the attention Belfrage pays time nodes, their nature and function, but I can see where fans of historic fiction may feel those elements received too much emphasis when considering the novel as a standalone. To this, all I can say is push forward before passing judgement. Trust me on this, it makes a lot of sense of the stories progress.The book is character heavy and frequently shifts between a number of narrators. Some may find this a little overwhelming, but I personally loved the movement and perspective Belfrages alternating POV afforded. I appreciated the insecurities the author established in both Alex and Matthew and how she wasnt afraid to showcase lovers with flaws, quirks and personal demons. I also appreciated the care Belfrage took in crafting her antagonist and while I cant say Ive much affection for Hector Olivares, I can admit him exceedingly well-developed, he is an adversary with layers of rage and a personal vendetta as deep and complex as the centuries it spans.In sum, I loved the book as much as I did its successors. I could kick myself for waiting so long to read it, but thats neither here nor there. A permanent part of my library, I cant recommend the book or series highly enough. Thoroughly enjoyable, fun and imaginative.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2H77WP8MSXGW8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1781321671#wasThisHelpful","R2H77WP8MSXGW8","A7WNQN5D1E4HW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A7WNQN5D1E4HW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My purchase of Gwendolyn Womacks The Memory Painter was something of a surprise. I mean no offense, but when push comes to shove Im a bit of a penny pincher and rarely buy books blindly. Truth is, Id not heard of this piece before spotting the striking yellow cover at the Historical Novel Society Conference bookstore and was entirely unfamiliar with the author. I queried a handful of my peers and while they agreed the book looked promising, no one had read it and I wasnt entirely convinced I wanted to be the first to plunge into a debut. Historically speaking, such ventures seldom ended in my favor, but something about the description sparked my curiosity and refused to let go. I debated a while, but ultimately caved to indecision and acquired the title.Ill be honest, things did not start well. I spent the first three chapters wondering what Id gotten myself into, but all that changed in chapter four. The plot started coming together and the story began to find its feet. The rush, however, was short-lived and by the end of chapter eleven, I felt I could confidently predict how things would turn out. Chapters twelve through thirty-nine didnt leave much of an impression, the drama was diverting enough, but predictable in my eyes. The pacing intensified in chapter forty and the curve-ball in chapter forty-five found me cheering Womacks creativity, but the moment was all too brief as the novel concluded only three chapters later.Did I like the story? Yes, looking back at the plot, I think The Memory Painter a fun crossover piece. There isnt as much history as Id hoped, but I enjoyed the elements Womack wove into the narrative. I think the author could have done more with the emotional relationship between Bryan and Linz, but the pair proved enjoyable protagonists nonetheless. I found Finn and Conrad incredibly interesting, but youll have to read the book to understand why. As far as supporting characters are concerned, I liked Barbara, but felt Claudette, Martin and Layla underdeveloped in comparison which bothered me as I felt their roles should have placed them on more equal footing.Ideally, Id have loved a historical note. Something that explained how and why the author chose the historic figures that appear throughout the piece. Personally, Id have loved to know why certain figures, Louis Le Vau and Pedro Damiano for example, were less prominent than Origenes Adamantius and Alexander Pushkin. Id also have liked a slightly stronger finish. I appreciate that Womacks conclusion is meant to lead into a follow-up, but the final notes of the narrative felt rushed and awkward just the same.Would I recommend The Memory Painter? As usual, that would depend on the reader. Diehard historic fiction fans might find the book a difficult sell, but the book incorporates exciting elements of both thrillers and science fiction and should prove quite entertaining to those with varied tastes and open minds.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3VR8B0HOG9JFB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=125005303X#wasThisHelpful","R3VR8B0HOG9JFB","A7WNQN5D1E4HW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A7WNQN5D1E4HW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Ive a confession folks, so I hope you dont mind if start there and get it off my chest. I was over the moon when I received my copy of Anna Belfrages To Catch a Falling Star, but a part of my didnt want to read it. Ive loved each and every installment of the Graham Saga, but I wasnt ready to say goodbye. Truth be told, Im still not.That said I think this installment of the series is my favorite. The writing itself feels much stronger than it did in book one and I love the contrast in how these characters have grown over time, how experience has altered their views and solidified certain elements of their personalities. More importantly though, I loved how this book, more than any other, complimented A Rip in the Veil. The story brought closure to so many key points and functioned as a flawless bookend to some of the most sensitive elements of the saga.Dont get me wrong, the historic hallmarks of the series are still there, but this time around it was the Alex and Annas emotional journey that struck a chord in me. You read that correctly, I did just reference the author, but in all fairness her personality and passion shines through this piece, as unmistakable and profound as the star that graces its cover. I think every author puts a bit of themselves into their work, but this is one of the rare occasions in which I felt the story gave insight to the creative spirit behind it.Ive never been against time slip novels, but I didnt consider myself a fan until reading these books. Ive enjoyed each and every one and recommend them as one of the best fiction Ive had fortune to come across.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RSH7WE9AIAGN4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SZESLCC#wasThisHelpful","RSH7WE9AIAGN4","A7WNQN5D1E4HW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A7WNQN5D1E4HW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was lucky to receive all three installments of Dawn Crandall's Everstone Chronicles in quick succession. I read the first two books in early March and rounded out the series with The Captive Imposter, early in April. I admit fitting a series into my review schedule was tough, but I believe it enhanced my experience.As I said in my reviews of The Hesitant Heiress and The Bound Heart, the books are character heavy, but before I get too far ahead of myself, I want to make it clear that comment is not a criticism. I actually like how the earlier books established some of the relationships in The Captive Imposter and anchored it to the series. I also like how characters from those stories are referenced in the last installment. All I'm really saying here is that there are a lot people keep straight in these books and while that can be confusing for those reading the novels as standalones, it actually unifies the books quite nicely when approaching them as a series.As before, I appreciated how Crandall depicted her heroine's personal introspection and faith, but more importantly, I liked how she managed to do this without losing Estella's voice. It's the same approach, but Estella, Meredyth and Amaryllis are three very different women and I was impressed by Crandall's ability to retain a sense of individuality throughout each of the books.Of the three, I think I liked Estella's revelations the best and feel the message in her story incredibly relevant to modern audiences. Historically I might have liked more detail, but I found The Captive Imposter entertaining just the same.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R20A9KKURRIN0P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VKLN3JS#wasThisHelpful","R20A9KKURRIN0P","A7WNQN5D1E4HW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A7WNQN5D1E4HW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I felt prepared when I picked up Dawn Crandall's The Bound Heart. Having just finished the first installment of the Everstone Chronicles, I felt I had a handle on the author's style and I thought I had a good idea as to where the story might go. Looking back I can honestly say I was right in a lot of ways, but I was also surprised at certain subplots and have no problem admitting that I enjoyed book two more than I did book one.Like its predecessor, I felt the novel character heavy. I was actually very happy that I'd tackled the books in order as it made it easier for me to keep everyone straight in my head. Again, I found I appreciated Crandall's voice and the balance she struck between faith and fiction.Unlike its predecessor, I felt Meredyth's story more dramatic and historically appealing. Her situation posed a lot of interesting insight to the social order of the day and highlighted the disparity in consequence suffered by men and women who defied those dictates.I'm not a huge fan of light inspirational fiction, but The Bound Heart proved both enjoyable and thought-provoking. It is slow in places and a bit drawn out toward the end, but I liked the story and find myself looking forward to the next installment of the series.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RSR51KVN04N7I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00P2YEFSC#wasThisHelpful","RSR51KVN04N7I","A7WNQN5D1E4HW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A7WNQN5D1E4HW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'll be the first to admit I was uncertain about accepting Dawn Crandall's The Hesitant Heiress for review. My record is hit and miss with Christian fiction and I tend to favor stories with darker material, but I pride myself on stepping out of my comfort zone from time to time and something about the Everstone Chronicles prompted me to take a chance.So what did I discover? Well to be brutally honest, I found something I'd not expected, an engaging and rather delightful story of conviction, personal introspection and light romance. Crandall rocked the first person narrative and I while I often found myself at odds with her characters, I can't deny my appreciation for the style and tone of her work.I liked the direction of the story and was impressed with the author's use of religion. Experience has taught me that many writers have difficulty finding balance between faith and fiction, but in this, Crandall proved an exception. Her use of religion makes sense in the framework of Amaryllis' story and never struck me as abrasive or heavy-handed.The story takes a while to get going and I wish it had been more focused on Amaryllis and Nathan, but I've few complaints over the time I spent with The Hesitant Heiress. Crandall brings a nice level of intrigue to the table and while I felt the ending predictable, I liked the twists and turns that transpired between points a and b.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R27PM24W1UGNNJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00M4LQ81I#wasThisHelpful","R27PM24W1UGNNJ","A7WNQN5D1E4HW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A7WNQN5D1E4HW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've been eyeing Donna Thorland's Renegades of the Revolution series since the publication of The Turncoat, but fitting the books into my schedule has been something of a challenge. Till now that is.For the record, the books are written as standalones and weren't published in chronological order, so feel free to start where you will. I also encourage readers not to worry too much over the material. Thorland's writing is wonderfully detailed, but easy to follow and she never overwhelms the narrative with lecture style exposition.As far as the characters are concerned, I wasn't initially sold on Jennifer Leighton, but she grew on me and I became quite fond of her by the end of the novel. Severin Devere, on the other hand, proved an engaging rouge from the start. Frances enjoys a supporting role, but I loved the passion Thorland embedded in her character and words can't describe my enchantment with the enigmatic Angela Ferrers.Historically, Thorland paints New York as a political battleground and I found her interpretation intensely interesting. The action is brisk and incredibly addictive, but the story itself highlights the struggles of those living in a city under occupation. Power shifts frequently and the growing unrest makes it difficult to discern friend from foe and I really liked how Thorland manipulated that principle to her advantage.I admit it took me a few chapters to get into the book, but I once I did I found the novel almost impossible to put down. Dramatic, clever, entertaining and provocative, Mistress Firebrand isn't to be missed.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2AOJ59IRIO4C4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KWG5ZCA#wasThisHelpful","R2AOJ59IRIO4C4","A7WNQN5D1E4HW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A7WNQN5D1E4HW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"K. Lang-Slattery Immigrant Soldier was a huge gear shift for me. I read war era fiction all the time, but picking it up on the heels of Paul Letters' A Chance Kill emphasized a lot about Lang-Slattery 's writing.Emotion propels the narrative beginning to end. The story trades on a lot of internal conflict and private feeling and I think that went a long way in developing Herman's character. Lang-Slattery 's approach made her hero easy to identify with and drew readers into the world as he saw and experienced it.Historically, I think Immigrant Soldier has a lot of really great material, particularly regarding the Ritchie Boys and US special military intelligence, but I couldn't help feeling the author might have done more in terms of atmosphere. I liked Lang-Slattery's presentation of fact, but I often had difficulty envisioning Herman's surroundings.Like Cara Langston's Battle Hymns and Trini Amador's Gracianna, Immigrant Soldier captures the individual experience of the WWII. Earnest, informative and heartfelt, the book evokes the spirit of a unit who refused to be victimized and honors their contribution to the war effort.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2NWPL18KBBKX1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00U0PDWSM#wasThisHelpful","R2NWPL18KBBKX1","A7WNQN5D1E4HW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A7WNQN5D1E4HW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Paul Letters' A Chance Kill is an interesting piece. It captures the macro level politics of the period, but like Sofi Oksanen's Purge and Philip Schultz's The Wherewithal: A Novel in Verse, it also delves into less well-known chapters of WWII, affording readers both new insight and distinct intrigue.This is ambitious storytelling that covers much of Europe. It is at times intense, but I personally thought Letters' tone appropriate for the material at hand. The writing is heavily detailed and while I sometimes felt the sheer volume of information detrimental to the novel's pacing, I can't deny being impressed by the research Letters put into his work.I wasn't much for the love story, but that's just me. I liked how the soft emotions between Letters' lovers countered the tension and desperation of the resistance movement and their operations, but the romance itself didn't hold a candle to the darker drama at the heart of the novel.A Chance Kill is a weighty fiction, but an enjoyable one that proved well-worth the time I put into it. I wouldn't recommend it as casual reading, but fans of war era thrillers should have no trouble getting lost between these pages.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RIUVMCCMX5K67/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1781323135#wasThisHelpful","RIUVMCCMX5K67","A7WNQN5D1E4HW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A7WNQN5D1E4HW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Id not read Kristin Hannah before picking up The Nightingale and in all honestly, Id given the jacket description only a cursory glance before accepting the title for review. I knew a few of my friends enjoyed the book, but Id made a point of avoiding their assessment of the piece. Im rambling, but I guess what Im trying to say is that I seriously underestimated this book.Hannahs illustration of occupied France is nothing short of brilliant. Supply shortages, displaced refugees, the plight of the Jewish people, the changing political landscape, the resistance movement, and the daily struggle to hang onto hope in the shadow of the German swastika are all represented in Vianne and Isabelles story, but the way Hannah manipulates the material and uses it to shape the sisters and their relationship is what makes this novel truly special.Of the two, I suppose I felt closer to Vianne, but Isabelle is an equally compelling character and I feel the differences between the two only made the story more moving. The emotional depth Hannah gifted these women, the strength and fortitude she showed in such varied contexts is both eloquent and heartbreaking. Theirs is a powerful story of passion, family, courage, conviction and faith, it is the kind of drama that haunts your imagination and touches something deep in your soul.Historically speaking I felt the novel impeccably well-researched, but the Ravensbrck scenes stand out in my memory. Most authors focus on Auschwitz-Birkenau, Theresienstadt and Dachau and maybe its because I began reading Ravensbruck: Life and Death in Hitler's Concentration Camp for Women by Sarah Helm halfway through The Nightingale, but I found Hannahs unapologetic portrayal of the brutality in the oft overlooked labor camp intense and fascinating.It sounds odd considering he is a German officer, but I thought Wolfgang Beck an inspired addition to the cast, especially alongside to Von Richter. That said, neither holds a candle to Julien Rossignol. He enjoys a supporting role, but his part brought tears to my eyes.Looking back on this piece sends chills down my spine and while I dont usually buy into editorial reviews, I have to admit author Sara Gruen hit the nail on the head when she said The Nightingale is a beautifully written and richly evocative examination of life, love, and the ravages of war, and the different ways people react to unthinkable situations (not to mention the terrible and mounting toll of keeping secrets. This powerhouse of a story is equally packed with action and emotion, and is sure to be another major hit.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2OMTB735I5S6O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0312577222#wasThisHelpful","R2OMTB735I5S6O","A7WNQN5D1E4HW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A7WNQN5D1E4HW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I suppose it's only right to confess that I've never liked Helen of Troy. I'm not sure why, but as a character she's never interested me so it should come as no surprise that content was not a huge factor in my decision to read Amalia Carosella's Helen of Sparta. To be honest, my interest in the book was sparked by author Stephanie Thornton. Weeks before Helen of Sparta was available, Thornton made her enthusiasm for the book known via Facebook. For one reason or another, the glowing remark lodged itself in my memory and ultimately motivated my procurement of Carosella's debut.Lucky for me, Thornton's assessment was spot on. Carosella put my skepticism to rest in only a few pages and I quickly found her work all but impossible to put down. Her depiction of Helen has a fire and intensity I'd never seen attempted, but the way she balanced that drive against soft emotions and feminine gentility brought a fascinating degree of depth to Zeus and Leda's daughter.I was equally intrigued by Carosella's decision to begin Helen's story long before Paris laid eyes on her famed beauty. In shifting focus to Helen's association with Theseus, Carosella brought Helen's history into perspective and challenged readers view her character in a wonderfully refreshing context.Carosella's depiction of Theseus was also very dynamic and I was deeply impressed with how his relationship with Helen was handled over the course of the story. He is much older than his leading lady and far more experienced in both love and politics. There is a maturity about him that contrasts Helen's youth and that really appealed to me.The book is character heavy and I'll admit Carosella covers a lot of mythological material, but I was never overwhelmed by her presentation and was quite pleased with how she brought the various elements of the story together. I thought the book very well-researched and appreciated how the narrative complimented both familiar and lesser known Greek legends.Helen of Sparta is an ambitious novel and I understand that many may find its length intimidating, but I found the book nothing short of brilliant and would easily recommend it alongside Bradley's The Firebrand and Fortier's The Lost Sisterhood.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2K81HRM0AEUBJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1477821384#wasThisHelpful","R2K81HRM0AEUBJ","A7WNQN5D1E4HW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A7WNQN5D1E4HW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've a confession folks, one I'm almost afraid to admit. I love historic fiction and there isn't a lot that doesn't interest me, but the truth is I'm all but burnt out on Henry VIII. I wish it were otherwise, but I've grown reluctant to pick up pieces involving the mercurial monarch and his scandal ridden court. With so many titles on the market it's difficult to imagine a writer bringing anything new to the table and I know sex sells, but I'm frankly bored with the salacious twists writers of this particular period have come to favor.Having said that, one might wonder why I'd tackle Nancy Bilyeau's The Tapestry. I myself questioned my sanity on accepting the title for review, but something in the back of my mind prompted me to put my doubts aside. Make no mistake, I waited till the last possible moment to crack the book open, but when I finally did, I conceded my skepticism had been misplaced.The market may be overrun, but Bilyeau's work has a feel and flavor few can rival. Her attention to detail is practically flawless and I love the balance she strikes between personal and political drama. Joanna Stafford is not the typical Tudor heroine and Bilyeau never loses site of that. The character's background and convictions dictate her actions and I like that her principles often find her at odds with the royal family. Bilyeau's characterizations of historic figures like Henry VIII, Catherine Howard, Jane Boleyn and Thomas Culpeper defy the stereotypes and bring a refreshing degree of originality to well-known events while her illustration of textiles and the art of tapestry add an unexpected glimpse at a fascinating cultural element of sixteenth century life.At the end of the day, I'm glad I took exception for the third installment of Bilyeau's Joanna Stafford series. Like its predecessors, the book proved both original and entertaining and while there were a few slow moments, I can't say the time I spent with this piece left me disappointed.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1JEOGLCBF1UQP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1476756376#wasThisHelpful","R1JEOGLCBF1UQP","A7WNQN5D1E4HW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A7WNQN5D1E4HW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In the realm of World War II fiction, George T. Chronis' Sudetenland is a little different as it digs into a lot of very interesting, underrated and largely overlooked aspects of the conflict. It plays on what ifs, but is extensively researched and chock-full of delightful historic detail.Sudetenland is not a light piece. There is a lot of very heavy political exposition in the book and I often had to break to let the material settle in before moving forward. Don't misunderstand, I greatly appreciated Chronis' approach, but there is a considerable amount of information between these pages and readers shouldn't expect to fly through it as they would most narratives.Chronis' writing is dialogue heavy and I'd have liked more atmospheric detail overall, but can't deny the book boasts great tension and wonderful movement. The characters struck me as slightly stereotypic, but as a thriller, I enjoyed the twists and turns Chronis built into the story.Sudetenland is a challenging read in terms of content and size, but it is a thought-provoking and engaging piece just the same. It is a solid narrative that will appeal to fans of both military and historic fiction.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R33YKLJV3N7JGU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00O2T6B9Y#wasThisHelpful","R33YKLJV3N7JGU","A7WNQN5D1E4HW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A7WNQN5D1E4HW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Many know I'm a self-proclaimed cover slut, so I want to be perfectly clear when I say that Greta Sibley's design had nothing to do with my decision to read and review Michael Callahan's Searching for Grace Kelly. The truth is I've many delightful character flaws and one is a tendency to let my imagination run wild which likely explains my bypassing the description under the assumption the title's focus was the famed Princess of Monaco. If memory serves, I was somewhere in chapter three when I broke to read the premise and erupted into giggles over own incompetence. Looking back, I'm almost sorry no one was 'round to witness that realization because if it was even half as amusing as I imagine we'd all have a tale to tell.I suppose you're wondering where I'm going with this and I promise, I've a point. You see, that moment gave me reason to pause and reflect on exactly what I'd gotten myself into. Callahan's themes lean toward women's fiction, a genre I've a historically rocky relationship with and I'm not particularly keen on the 1950s. Had I bothered to do my homework, I'd have skipped the title without a second thought, but as it stood I'd managed a good thirty pages and am too damned stubborn to give up without a fight. So, skeptical of my prospects and suspicious of the material, I continued dubiously down the rabbit hole. And what did I discover at the bottom? A captivating novel that defied both odds and expectation.Atmospherically, Searching for Grace Kelly presents a fascinating portrait of New York. The glitz and glamour of Park Avenue plays beautifully against the bohemian counterculture of Greenwich Village and the seedier elements of the city's back alleys, but none of this holds a candle to the sisterhood Callahan created behind the walls of the Barbizon Hotel. Laura, Dolly and Vivian forge a unique bond despite their differences and I found the ambiance of their shared living situation and the experiences it fostered quite entertaining.The girls themselves are very well-drawn and universally engaging, but it was the supporting cast that captured my attention. Metzger, Nicky, Jack, Pete, Box, Betsy and Connie enjoy minor roles, but they are essential to the telling and I loved how Callahan gave each a significant moment with one or another of his protagonists. I also appreciate that not all of these characters are admirable and applaud Callahan's decision to include such a colorful group of individuals within his narrative.Wicked, witty and overflowing with intrigue, Searching for Grace Kelly was an absolute pleasure. A surprising fiction that caught me off guard in the best possible way.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RX5V730TC3MGC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0544313542#wasThisHelpful","RX5V730TC3MGC","A7WNQN5D1E4HW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A7WNQN5D1E4HW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Author Sandra Byrd has been in my tbr for a while and though I own two of her earlier novels, Mist of Midnight marks my first taste of her work and I'm happy to report I found the experience quite enjoyable.First and foremost, I really liked how Byrd used identity theft in the context of this story. I'm used to seeing 19th century murder mysteries and I thought impersonation a fun and refreshing departure from that norm. The pacing was a little slow for me personally and I predicted the ending long before the final page, but I liked how Byrd cast suspicion on multiple characters and how she played with ambiguity over the course of narrative.Mist of Midnight is marketed as Christian lit, but Byrd's religious themes are subtle at best and she never allows faith to overwhelm the story. She's not at all preachy and that really appealed to me as a reader. I was also drawn to the blend of culture she incorporated in the fabric of the novel and the contrast she illustrated between Rebecca's life in India and her efforts to find her place in England.Though set in different eras, I think Mist of Midnight makes a nice companion to The Masque of a Murderer by Susanna Calkins and would easily recommend its author alongside Julie Klassen and Roseanna M. White.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1KAIC6945Q29D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1476717869#wasThisHelpful","R1KAIC6945Q29D","A7WNQN5D1E4HW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A7WNQN5D1E4HW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Christian Kachel's Spoils of Olympus: By the Sword was one of those titles. I stumbled over it, thought the premise looked vaguely interesting and jumped on the tour bus. I liked the idea, but if I learned anything from Queen of Sparta, it was not to get my hopes up. That in mind, it shouldn't surprise anyone to learn I opened Kachel's work with no expectation whatsoever, a fact which likely contributed to how thoroughly the novel managed to sweep me off my feet.It's clear from the early pages of the novel that Kachel's understanding of the period and politics is extensive, but the fictional elements of the novel are equally well-drawn. The story is graphic and intensely descriptive, but I personally thought Kachel's depiction true to the history on which it is based and appreciated the author's dedication to authenticity.The story itself centers on Andrikos and his coming of age in the chaos following the death of Alexander the Great which is something I liked for several reasons. Kachel's narrative captures a timeless concept in his illustration of a young man struggling with pressure and social expectations. What does it mean to be a man and how do you retain your humanity and sense of self in a world defined by death and destruction.Andrikos' journey is augmented by several supporting cast members, but two stand out in my mind. The slave Mara brings a much needed feminine element to a heavily masculine narrative and staff officer, Vettias who serves as both mentor and friend to Kachel's protagonist. Both these individuals challenge Andrikos in different ways and I liked the contrast that brought to the larger story. Refreshingly dynamic and scrupulously researched, Spoils of Olympus: By the Sword proved a profoundly compelling read, the kind of novel I'd easily recommend to fans of both military and historic fiction.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2AQYU1XABSI4W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00O29RDVO#wasThisHelpful","R2AQYU1XABSI4W","A7WNQN5D1E4HW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A7WNQN5D1E4HW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Curiosity may have killed the cat, but I suffered no such fate when I accepted Sisters of Shiloh by Kathy Hepinstall and Becky Hepinstall Hilliker for review. Fictional accounts of the American Civil War are hit and miss in my book so I wasn't expecting much from the title, but I liked the idea of women in war and was interested to see an account of their role on the battlefield so I threw caution to the wind, tried my luck and was thoroughly enthralled with what I discovered between these pages.The material Hepinstall and Hilliker work into this story is absolutely amazing. I don't mean to gush, but there are scenes in this book that literally caused me to pause in awe. Libby's encounter with a young boy who suffered an amputation and talks of his phantom limb through the pain struck a chord so deep I had to come up for air afterward. The authenticity of the moment, the courage the authors exhibited in putting such a scene to paper, everything about it felt right. There are similar moments throughout the narrative - the trial of Corporal Thadeus Grant, the incident with Private Abraham, the discovery of Matthew's letters, Floyd's saving Wesley's guitar - Hepinstall and Hilliker pair human emotion with the trial and tribulation of life at the front without filter. It is realistic and as a student of the conflict, I couldn't help but be impressed.From a more artistic standpoint, I loved how Hepinstall and Hilliker handled the relationship between Josephine and Libby. It is a complex connection to say the least, but I thought the illustration of their bond very well-done. I also liked the slow development of Libby's madness, her conversations with Arden, and how her desire for revenge alters the reader's perception of both sisters over the course of the story.All told, I enjoyed the diversity in both the cast and themes in Sisters of Shiloh. I was fascinated with the research that went into the novel and tickled by the authors' nod to Victor Hugo's Les Miserables. Highly recommended to fans of historic fiction and civil war buffs alike.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RKJPP6SVHPVHP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0544400003#wasThisHelpful","RKJPP6SVHPVHP","A7WNQN5D1E4HW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A7WNQN5D1E4HW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I knew I'd be reading John Sadler's Blood Divide the moment I stumbled over it. Being a sucker for Scottish history, I'd love to say I was captivated by the premise, but I am honest enough to admit I'm shallow and my initial interest was in fact sparked be the cover art. I know it doesn't really matter, but somewhere there's a jacket designer who is happy their work is being appreciated so let's not debate my offering recognition as part of my review.In terms of content, I loved how comprehensive Blood Divide felt. Sadler has an amazing understanding of the Battle of Flodden and tackles it from a variety of angles which is something I found particularly interesting. More often than not, readers enjoy a single perspective of any given event and I was pleasantly surprised to see an author tackle both sides of conflict from multiple points of view.That said, I couldn't help wanting more from John, Thomas, Alexander and Isabella. I don't mean to split hairs because a lot of the material is really well-done, but I felt character development took a backseat to the politics and grim realities of war. I know I'm nitpicking and I don't mean to overly critical, but there it is.All told, Blood Divide is an impeccably researched piece that proved well-worth my time. Rough edges aside, it is a title I'd easily recommend alongside Anvil of God or Sebastian's Way.","3.0 out of 5 stars","February 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2RITP5R1E0LFZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1782640894#wasThisHelpful","R2RITP5R1E0LFZ","A7WNQN5D1E4HW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A7WNQN5D1E4HW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Every once in a while I stumble over something different, something with a premise unlike anything I've ever seen, something like Linda Bennett Pennell's Confederado do Norte. I was familiar enough with the time period, but the setting and subject matter were fresh, original, exotic, and intriguing. I was hooked in a heartbeat and eager to see where the story might go.I've not dedicated much study to the Reconstruction, but what little I know centers on Northern carpetbaggers and southern resentment, so I was fascinated to learn that several thousand Americans favored emigration to Brazil over life under Yankee rule. I thought Pennell's use of the Confederate legacy in South America inspired and was impressed with the cross cultural perspective her fiction afforded.That said, the heart of Mary Catherine's story is not its framework, but its themes. Her emotional journey is long and arduous, but I liked how Pennell utilized it as a platform to explore concepts such as survival, struggle, family, loyalty and identity. This is a story designed to make its audience think, it is the kind of book that challenges its readers and that really appealed to me.Pennell's writing wasn't easy for me to get into and I was frustrated with the extended time line of the narrative, but I find my difficulties of little consequence when weighed against the novel's strengths. Poignant, bold and ambitious, Confederado do Norte is a must for fans of post-Civil War lit and historic sagas alike. A memorable and thought-provoking piece that is sure to satisfy.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3GIBV1X1U9BR4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LMN5OMI#wasThisHelpful","R3GIBV1X1U9BR4","A7WNQN5D1E4HW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A7WNQN5D1E4HW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Readers often talk about escaping into novels, about stepping into the shoes of another and living a thousand different lives between the pages of their books. It's an interesting concept and one I certainly subscribe to, but it takes new meaning with each installment of The Graham Saga. Where most authors capture a moment, Anna Belfrage recreates a lifetime, an intimate portrait that few of her peers can rival.On the surface, Wither Thou Goest is an adventure. A quest that takes the Grahams from their comfortable colonial home to the turmoil of the West Indies. It is a rescue mission complete with danger, heartbreak and intrigue. Pretty straightforward stuff, until one looks beneath the surface. Behind the scenes, every member of the family is struggling with personal demons, the ripple effects of events seen in earlier installments of the series and while I love the drama created by Charlie's situation, I found the emotional foundation of the book far more captivating.Sarah's plight was a challenge for me, as were Ian's struggle with responsibility, Matthew's private pain and Samuel's divided loyalties. Alex's attempts to navigate the storm while managing her own conflicts represented yet another obstacle, but the dynamic illustrated by the family's interactions created an engaging and intricately complex portrait of loyalty and honor and I love the inherent contrast it bore in comparison to Luke's branch of the Graham family as well as the Burley/Connor relations.Beautifully written, thought-provoking and intense, Whither Thou Goest lives up to its predecessors in every possible way. A must read for any fan of historic fiction.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2YSI6NRPL2PYS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00O87R338#wasThisHelpful","R2YSI6NRPL2PYS","A7WNQN5D1E4HW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A7WNQN5D1E4HW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In a lot of ways, Jay Curry's Nixon and Dovey took me back to my roots. Early America captivated my imagination during my teenage years and played a significant role in my love affair with historic fiction. Curry's work played on those emotions and effectually rekindled that affection and interest.I was not familiar with Nixon's story prior to picking up this book which is why I think it makes such great fiction. I'm a big fan of little known histories and love being able to immerse myself in something that can both enlighten and entertain. Nixon and Dovey takes place in a period many readers will recognize, but its title characters have a certain mystic about them, an enigmatic quality that draws on the imagination and keeps one turning the page.There is also a lot of really interesting thematic material in this piece which is something I found particularly appealing. Race relations, for example, are a topic usually reserved for stories of the latter half of the 1800s and I really liked Curry's ability to tackle the subject in a nontraditional setting. Nixon's story is part of a larger picture and I admire the manner in which Curry wove that type of intense subject matter into the fabric of his story.A fun read that broadens one's understanding of the past, Nixon and Dovey is a delightful novel of love, loyalty and spirit.","3.0 out of 5 stars","December 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R137BB1OGGV450/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OBIS324#wasThisHelpful","R137BB1OGGV450","A7WNQN5D1E4HW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A7WNQN5D1E4HW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm not sure what I expected from William Peak's The Oblate's Confession, but the book proved a pleasant surprise. I found the introspective tone of the narrative intriguing, but I felt Peak's decision to write from a child's perspective a stroke of genius. The questions Winwd asks about faith and the things that capture his interest within the monastery are fascinating, but watching him piece these concepts together as his understanding matures allowed me unique insight to his situation.On that note, I really appreciated Peak's treatment of religion. I feared the subject might overwhelmed the narrative, but was delighted to discover the author's subtle handling of the material allowed it to flow naturally through the story as easily as the social hierarchy of the monastery or the politics of the day. I was similarly impressed with the Winwd's inner conflicts and appreciated the authenticity in his emotions over the course of the narrative.Peak's writing was a little difficult for me to get into and the pacing was tad slow for my particular tastes, but I certainly enjoyed the time I spent with this story. The Oblate's Confession isn't my usual fare, but it is a thought-provoking piece that I'd certainly recommend to fans of medieval fiction.","3.0 out of 5 stars","December 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2FZJ1Q8DGF4T0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0990460800#wasThisHelpful","R2FZJ1Q8DGF4T0","A7WNQN5D1E4HW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A7WNQN5D1E4HW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I put little thought into taking on Rhoda D'Ettore Newborn Nazi for review. I don't mean to minimalize the book in any way, but drawn as I am to WWII, it wasn't exactly a hard sell. In fact the only aspect that gave me pause was the cover. Not to get too far off track, but I don't feel the image does justice to the narrative and strongly urge readers to look below surface when considering the title themselves.In looking back, there were a lot of things I really liked about this piece. D'Ettore achieves a great balance between the masculine and feminine elements of the story and that's not something I can say about many fictional accounts of the period. She put a great deal into chronicling the experiences of Germans who opposed the Nazi Party both in America and the fatherland and crafted a very tangible sense desperation around those caught in the crossfire.I liked the insight she offered to the Hitler Youth program and felt the contrary allegiances suffered by Edmund particularly well-drawn. I appreciated the contrast in characters like Gustav and Johann, Hedwig and Heidi, and even Jacob and Alois. Through her complex characterizations, D'Ettore challenges readers to think in shades of grey and I personally found that rather extraordinary, especially in an era that is commonly painted in black and white.There are moments in which I felt there was simply too much happening at once, but those were few and far between. Ideally, I'd also have liked to see an author's or historical note. I thought D'Ettore's incorporation of the Hindenburg disaster fascinating and would have enjoyed reading more about her decision to utilize that material, but I questioned her treatment of Ramsay MacDonald and feel an explanation might have put that uncertainty to rest.All in all, I found Newborn Nazi a surprisingly enjoyable read. An intense, but moving piece about family and sacrifice.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RXOUXJ2XQZPV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1500293989#wasThisHelpful","RXOUXJ2XQZPV","A7WNQN5D1E4HW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A7WNQN5D1E4HW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Dead New World was an odd choice for me. I like zombie movies, but I've never been much for zombie lit and while I've enjoyed titles like Mortality and End Dayz in the past, I'm convinced my decision to pick up Ryan Hill's work had more to do with the void left by the mid-season finale of The Walking Dead than it did anything else. Still, a book is a book and books are what I do.For the record, this piece had several elements I really enjoyed. The militaristic society Hill crafted from the remnants of the United States brought an interesting dynamic to the book as did the fanaticism seen in the Reverend and his horsemen and I love the proactive nature of the hybrid community, the prejudices they face and their unusual and unexpected abilities.That said there were things I wasn't as impressed with. Holt's relationship with Nancy is the catalyst for the entire book, but their feelings never felt authentic in my eyes and the climatic final sequence seemed unnecessarily drawn out. Not to sounds nitpicky, but I wasn't a fan Holt's flashbacks either. The scenes weren't horrible, but the nonlinear timeline impaired the pacing and only served to reiterate information available elsewhere in the story.Bottom line, Dead New World was a fun diversion. It isn't deep by any means, but Hill touches on some intriguing subject matter nonetheless.","3.0 out of 5 stars","December 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1CIM9M5VCNFP1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NS1ILAO#wasThisHelpful","R1CIM9M5VCNFP1","A7WNQN5D1E4HW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A7WNQN5D1E4HW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Picking of Devin Brown's Tolkien: How an Obscure Oxford Professor Wrote the Hobbit and Became the Most Beloved Author of the Century was a self-indulgent decision. I've loved Tolkien's work since I discovered it in high school and though I know a lot about him, I've never read a biography and was curious to see his life presented in a single volume.To get straight to the point, I liked this book. It is a quick read and rather entertaining for what it is. Brown's voice comes through very distinctly and while I think the tone somewhat bias, his views don't detract from or overwhelm the material.Not having experienced Shippey or Carpenter's larger biographies, I can only speculate on how Brown's effort compares, but I can say this particular volume is very brief and perhaps best suited to those looking at Tolkien for the first time. I feel the information comprehensive, but cursory and can't help feeling there is room to elaborate further than Brown did here.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RV17KEGKEVSZO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1426796706#wasThisHelpful","RV17KEGKEVSZO","A7WNQN5D1E4HW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A7WNQN5D1E4HW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I discovered C.W. Gortner entirely by accident. I'd accepted an offer to review The Queen's Vow and The Tudor Conspiracy as part of two coinciding book tours and quickly fell in love with his work which is why I didn't stop to think when offered the opportunity to review The Tudor Vendetta. I simply said yes and jumped into the third installment of the Spymaster Chronicles.As with its predecessor, I was struck by the complex intrigue Gortner created and his ability to surprise readers with unforeseeable twists and turns. This is no small achievement, but it takes on special significance when one recognizes how much Tudor literature is on the market. It is a very popular period and it's rare to find someone who can infuse a story with as much originality and imagination as Gortner.Another thing I love about this book is how natural it felt. The author has a very keen understanding of court life and how tangled loyalties might have become as the crown passed from one head to the next. Blending this concept into the fabric of his fiction, the reader can recognize a tangible uncertainty in many of Brendan Prescott's relationships and in turn develop an authentic understanding of the precariousness of his position.Though I appreciate many of the characters, I actually found Dudley the most interesting. I've never been particularly fond of him, but Gortner's interpretation proved something an exception. Details would spoil the story so you'll have to read the book to understand what I'm getting at, but suffice it to say Gortner's multifaceted caricature exceeded my expectations.Though slow to start, I very much enjoyed the time I spent with this piece. There is an air of suspicion about it and glorious deception that keeps the reader on their toes up till the final page. Highly recommended as both a standalone and series read.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJTXCP6BPH7C6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IQOJC9M#wasThisHelpful","RJTXCP6BPH7C6","A7WNQN5D1E4HW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A7WNQN5D1E4HW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Personally, the subject matter in A Simple Mind made it the most difficult of the Great War Centennial series. Private Sharp is slow, but the bullying he experiences and the consistency with which hes taken advantage of because of his condition took a lot out of me. Much more than Id anticipated with a piece only twenty-three pages in length.More than the rest of the series, A Simple Mind illustrates the brutal realities of life on the front and the mentality of those struggling to survive the trenches. Taylors portrayal is unapologetically crude and carnal. Again, there is no Authors Note to verify Taylors intent, but I found the contrast in the savagery she created and Private Sharps nave innocence striking on a number of levels.And as much I deplore the idea of someone being victimized as Sharp is here, I cant ignore the fact that the prejudice he suffers ultimately saves his life and immortalizes those who fell in No Mans Land. Like the other books in the series, A Simple Mind has an acute and stirring message that rivals those seen in fully developed narratives.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2EIGF04U2M3PY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KO96HOA#wasThisHelpful","R2EIGF04U2M3PY","A7WNQN5D1E4HW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A7WNQN5D1E4HW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Taken as I was with the Great War Centennial series, I jumped straight from Poppy Lane into Old Grey. The books are not taxing by any means, but tackling three in a row evidenced I was sacrificing sleep for these books and despite my reputation and voracious appetite for literature, that doesnt happen as often as you might imagine.Loss is poignant and popular theme in war time literature, but Ive never seen it handled quite like this. Though we only meet one character, Taylor employed a variety of voices in Old Grey. The result is remarkably affective and memorable and highlights a gift few storytellers can claim to possess.Ive seen firsthand the camaraderie that exists between those whove served together and appreciate the authenticity in Taylors interpretation. Old Grey is a somber story, but a moving one that captures many aspects of loss in the line of duty.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R18D41MYDRDD17/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IEOXNSA#wasThisHelpful","R18D41MYDRDD17","A7WNQN5D1E4HW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A7WNQN5D1E4HW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Jordan Taylor's Young Blood is one of four short stories that make up the Great War Centennial series. I don't know what prompted me to buy the books, I wasn't looking for WWI fiction at the time, but something about the titles intrigued me so without fanfare or recommendation all four became part of my ever-growing library.Initially I felt Young Blood fluffy. It moved quickly without any real insight to the characters or material and I wasn't at all convinced it worth the short amount time I'd set aside for it. Then of course, the story settled. Taylor's light tone was meant to imitate the youthful exuberance of a generation who didn't understand the gravitas of death, war and sacrifice.Her approach shook me to my core, but the final scene is what clinched it. I'm not one to spoil a good story so you'll have to read it to discover what I mean, but suffice it to say Taylor's work is a truly touching testament to the youngest defenders of the British line.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3AFPSA26LCKUP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007KT6PEO#wasThisHelpful","R3AFPSA26LCKUP","A7WNQN5D1E4HW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A7WNQN5D1E4HW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'd planned to read a few pages before putting myself to bed, but the unexpected emotion elicited by Jordan Taylor's Young Blood prompted me to put my plans aside in favor of Poppy Lane. For the record, the Great War Centennial series can be read in any order, I simply tackled them as they appeared on my kindle.Loyalty and compassion take on special meaning in this piece which is rather remarkable as it's told from a dog's perspective. The comings and goings of the various divisions, the mixed reactions to Poppy's presence on the line and the ultimate revelation of her motivation is quite touching and paints very intimate portrait of the traditionally bleak backdrop of life in the trenches.Unlike Young Blood, there was no author's note to anchor Poppy Lane and while I understand the dramatic difference in subject matter, I felt the absence and wished Taylor had left some record of her inspiration. Poppy's is a simple story, but it resonates a sentimentality that is absolutely timeless and I'd have liked to know more about it.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RXGKM2Q09N45U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IR1377M#wasThisHelpful","RXGKM2Q09N45U","A7WNQN5D1E4HW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A7WNQN5D1E4HW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I knew I'd be reading Davina Blake's Past Encounters the moment I stumbled over the artwork. I didn't need to read description, I was hooked by the period alone and while I don't recommend selecting books this way, I'm happy to report the odds were in my favor this go round.For those who aren't aware, Davina Blake also writes as Deborah Swift. It's not something I'd usually bring up in a review except that I think Past Encounters is favorite of her novels and that statement wouldn't make sense if you couldn't make the comparison. The subject matter spoke to me, but I also loved how layered this piece felt and while I don't dislike her earlier work, I don't remember appreciating the construction of A Divided Inheritance or Shadow on the Highway the same way.Blake's manipulation of the timeline was truly inspired and I liked how the format allowed her to reveal buried secrets and historic details in a nontraditional manner. Her characters are fairly straightforward, but the way they interact with one another and the complexity of their relationships made them incredibly interesting and lent a degree of intrigue that I hadn't anticipated. Where the novel shines, however, is in it's underlying themes. The questions it poses about patriotism and duty, love and honor.Historically speaking, I knew of the Great March, but I'd not studied it. Being American I'm much more familiar with the Bataan Death March so I often found myself researching the facts behind Blake's story and isn't that in and of itself a sign of good historic fiction? I also took time off the book to watch Brief Encounter which proved a delightful and thought-provoking old movie. While not required, I think the picture added something to Rhoda's story and really emphasized her side of things which was great because I was naturally drawn to Peter and his experiences while reading the book.Emotional, but highly recommended. Reminiscent of The Railway Man, Past Encounters is a brilliant exploration of the psychological effects of war and their lasting impact.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1K3DDSUBL9A65/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1499568258#wasThisHelpful","R1K3DDSUBL9A65","A7WNQN5D1E4HW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A7WNQN5D1E4HW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I don't read a lot of anthologies. In point of fact I actually make serious effort to avoid them whenever possible. I know it isn't fair, but these collections drive me crazy. The authors are rarely matched, the stories usually bleed together and by the time I reach the end, I usually want to scream.Now I know what you're thinking. If I hate these publications so much, why did I not only pick up, but actually spend money on Grand Central? The answer my friends is simple: World War II. I'm a sucker for any fiction set during the conflict. The fact that three of my favorite authors happened to contribute to the collection didn't hurt, but the truth is, if it connects to the war, I'm in. No questions asked.Fair warning friends, what follows promises to be a long review so please make yourselves comfortable. On the rare occasions in which I've consented to review an anthology, I've made a habit of offering thoughts to each author and with ten contributors on the docket... you get the idea.Before I get too far ahead of myself, however, I do want to note how well each of the stories fit together. Though each entry touches on something unique and often times profound, Grand Central is very much a collective narrative that highlights the individual style of each author as well as their ability to work collaboratively. Reading this book was everything experience has taught me not to expect from such collections, but the attention to detail and mutual respect shown by each contributor made discovering these stories a rare pleasure.Going Home by Alyson Richman:Alyson Richman was one of the three authors whose contributions prompted my notice of Grand Central and as usual, she did not leave me disappointed.The nature of the anthology requires that Gregori and Liesel's story be brief, but I loved what Richmond did with it. I found the concept of two people connecting through music amid the hustle and bustle of Grand Central quite romantic and I loved her nod to the old world masters and the comfort cultural compositions might have brought those who escaped the turmoil and devastation of the war. I also appreciated the addition of historic references such as those to Carl Laemmle and Terezin as these facts anchored the story to the period and added depth where I didn't expect to find it.The Lucky One by Jenna Blum:This being my first experience with Jenna Blum, I had no idea what to expect from The Lucky One, but was both pleasantly surprised and thoroughly impressed with her contribution to Grand Central.A powerful short, the story centers Peter, a German Holocaust survivor who is haunted by the ghosts of loved ones lost in the genocide. Though notably less atmospheric than Going Home, The Lucky One is remarkably emotive. Blum taps into something incredibly poignant in her deft interpretation of Peter's experience, his personal loss and his struggle to move forward in a world whose prejudice and perceptions find him socially displaced.The Branch of Hazel by Sarah McCoy:Sarah McCoy's The Branch of Hazel is factually interesting, but I admit I found the piece something of a challenge. Historically speaking I loved the material in Cata's story, but I couldn't help feeling as though I were missing something.It is my understanding that both Cata and Hazel were introduced in McCoy's The Baker's Daughter, a fact which probably explains my bewilderment as I've not yet had opportunity to read the title. Still, I was drawn to McCoy's use of the Lebensborn program and the varied emotions and ideologies she attributed to the mothers who took part.The Kissing Room by Melanie Benjamin:I was more than eager to get into Melanie Benjamin's The Kissing Room. Already a fan of her work, I was intrigued by the title of her piece and couldn't wait to see how it played into the anthology.Several things about this chapter really appealed to me. One, it incorporated an aspect of the terminal as a major component in the story. Two, the lead was not an immigrant and had a mindset that was very different from the characters I'd already been introduced to. Three, Marjorie's naivety is fun to read and offers a nice break from the heavier drama in McCoy, Blum and Richman's contributions. And four, the ending. I wont ruin it for you, but I loved the one-eighty Benjamin pulled off and how that moment stood in such contrast to the rest of the short.I'll Be Seeing You by Sarah Jio:Confession: The title of Sarah Jio's contribution made poor first impression. No joke, I actually stifled a groan. I adore Sinatra as much as the next girl, but the nod to his iconic tune is such a clich. Don't believe me? Ask Suzanne Hayes, Margaret Mayhew, Benita Brown, Jerry Borrowman...Now my initial reaction aside, I loved this story and not just because I need a Grace in my life. This whole idea of standing at a crossroad, needing closure, being intimidated by the decisions one is faced with - the whole thing spoke to my soul. I'm not much of a crier, but if I were I would have been reaching for a tissue over this one. Sentimental and stirring, Rose's story isn't one I'll soon forget.I'll Walk Alone by Erika Robuck:This sounds ridiculous, but I'm actually speechless. Like Sarah Jio, Erika Robuck tapped into something raw and relatable. I know I shouldn't make this about me, but there is a moment in this piece where I literally saw myself and had to do a double take before continuing.Josie's story is heartbreaking, but it is also hopeful. There is something very authentic in Robuck's submission, something intimate and emotional. Again, I'm not one to blubber, but I really liked how Robuck harnessed such an intense theme and molded into something that is both meaningful and thought-provoking.The Reunion by Kristina McMorris:Moving back into period specific fiction, author Kristina McMorris' The Reunion tackles two birds with one stone. Touching on both female pilots and the loss of a fellow service member, her submission adds new dimension to the collection for its incorporation of topics yet seen in Grand Central.I don't want to downplay the historic content in this piece, but I truly appreciated McMorris' depiction of feminine friendship. Maybe it's just me, but I found the complex dynamic she created between Millie and Virginia refreshing for its accuracy. At risk of looking the fool, I'll also admit to developing a bit of a literary crush on Taz. I know the adage, boys are better in books, but the simple charm in McMorris' portrayal of her romantic lead added much to the story.Tin Town by Amanda Hodgkinson:War brides are easily one of the most romantic plot points in war fiction, so I figured it was only a matter of time before one appeared in Grand Central and while it took longer than expected, my assumption proved correct with Amanda Hodgkinson's Tin Town.Interestingly enough, this piece proved one of the more intriguing submissions in the collection. Traditionally, we think of young women, running into rushed affairs with dashing soldiers, but Hodgkinson threw readers a curve ball in matching a widowed English mother with a New York lawyer turned officer. Told from the perspective of a child, Hodgkinson turns the romantic stereotype on its head while examining the magnitude of what happened to those women who crossed the Atlantic for their GIs.Strand of Pearls by Pam Jenoff:Strand of Pearls was a fun piece for me. Jenoff has been on my favorites list for a while, but the fact that I read Grand Central while reading The Winter Guest marked the first time I'd ever attempted two works by the same author at the same time.Does this mean I favored her? No. In fact I was probably harder on this piece than I was any other as I couldn't help cross-comparing the two, but that's neither here nor there. What I liked about this piece is how Jenoff used Ella and David to examine micro level issues like survivor's guilt and faith, as well as macro level points such as global politics and cultural change in the aftermath of World War II. The ending hit a little close to home, but even so, I liked the piece and can't help wishing there were more to Ella's story.The Harvest Season by Karen White:Of all the contributors to Grand Central, Karen White was the only name with which I was entirely unfamiliar. I checked her out before opening the anthology and I wasn't exactly sold so the fact that her submission is my favorite is as much a surprise to me as it is anyone reading this.There is so much in this piece that I hardly know where to begin. White's treatment of Germanophobia by itself would have hooked me, but the story she created between Will and Ginny was so wonderfully unpredictable... It sounds like a cheesy pitch, and I don't mean to sway anyone as every story in this collection is worth reading, but if you limit yourself to one, let The Harvest Season be the one you choose","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2EXSJVBGPQ9M0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0425272028#wasThisHelpful","R2EXSJVBGPQ9M0","A7WNQN5D1E4HW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A7WNQN5D1E4HW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have a hard time with anthologies and collaborations, but Grand Central proved such a wonderful experience that I swore I'd keep an open mind if another struck my fancy. Four months later A Day of Fire caught my eye and here I sit, once again amazed at the result.Taking their cues from the graffiti littered walls of its ruins, these six authors set out to tell the story of a city's final moments, to chronicle the tragedy of Vesuvius' first century eruption through the experience of her citizens as a torrent of rock, pumice and fire rained hell from above.Their characters come from all walks of life and offer extensive insight to the intricacies of life in the Roman Empire, but it is the drama they imagined and the intrigue they coaxed from the ashes that make A Day of Fire impossible to put down. From the Herculaneum Gate to the Garden of the Fugitives, their combined efforts culminate in a highly compelling portrait of Pompeii and her people.The Son by Vicky Alvear Shecter:I liked Vicky Alvear Shecter's Curses and Smoke, but I loved The Son. I'll grant comparing a young adult piece to general fiction is an apples to oranges association, but the tone of the contribution, the mature nature of its themes and the dynamic Shecter created between Gaius Caecilius and Gaius Plinius Secundus really appealed to me.Those familiar with the history know how significant Gaius Caecilius is to Pompeii which is why I got such a kick out of Shecter's portrayal. Far from the respected historian, here is seventeen year old boy, plagued with insecurities and grappling with his first taste of romance. The resulting contrast is both authentic and amusing and represents a creativity I can't help but admire.The Heiress by Sophie Perinot:It's been a few years since I tackled Sophie Perinot's The Sister Queens, but The Heiress reminded me why I hold its author in such high esteem. Taking inspiration from the frescos that grace the Villa dei Misteri, Perinot delves into the wedding traditions of ancient Rome and presents a surprisingly nontraditional love story that cuts straight to the heart.I wasn't sure about Aemilia Lepida, but the passion she harbors for Faustus quickly showed her as more than the poor little rich girl she initially appears to be and I adored the parallel Perinot created in Aemilia's experience and the famous imagery that graces her walls. That said, it was Gnaeus Helvius Sabinus that made the greatest impression on me. A historic figure of no particular importance, the highly educated would-be aedile proved my favorite of all the characters that appear in A Day of Fire.The Soldier by Ben Ken:I selfishly hoped Ben Kane would tackle the gladiators and the Amphitheatre of Pompeii when I realized he'd contributed to this project and I'm happy to report I wasn't disappointed. I mean no offense to the other authors, but after reading Spartacus: Rebellion, I felt Kane and his particular expertise best suited for the material.The action in the arena was brilliantly done, but I loved how Kane balanced the physicality of those sequences against the everyday politics of life in Pompeii. Career soldier Lucius Satrius Rufus has enemies both on and off the field and I thought the illustration of his personal relationships and how those affiliations dictated his decisions during the eruption quite fascinating.The Senator by Kate Quinn:I've read enough of her work to know that sitting down with anything by Kate Quinn will leave a smile on my face. Mistress of Rome, Daughters of Rome and Empress of the Seven Hills have graced my top shelf for some time so I was understandably excited about The Senator, but I readily admit Quinn's eye for historic detail and keen sense of comedic timing surpassed even my expectations.Diana of the Cornelii and Senator Marcus Norbanus are a phenomenal pairing and while I have a sneaky suspicion their contrary personalities would prove entertaining just about anywhere, I took particular amusement at watching them butt heads in the Lupanar of Pompeii. I harbored a fondness for these characters prior to reading A Day of Fire and adored the insight this small chapter afforded, but more than that, I appreciated how seamlessly their story fit with the other contributions. All the entries are linked, but I felt Quinn's effort the most coordinated and comprehensive of the collection.The Mother by E. Knight:Historically, the home of Julius Polybius is one of the most impressive and enlightening buildings buried in the volcanic ash of Vesuvius, but the pregnant woman who died there is equally intriguing. A cameo character in several of the earlier contributions, Julilla finally enjoys the spotlight in E. Knight's The Mother.Maybe it's because Anne Seymour was such a firecracker in My Lady Viper, but I associate Knight with the creation of vibrant and passionate heroines which is why I was confused by the happily married and contented Julilla. Eagerly awaiting the birth of her child, the soon-to-be mother radiates maternal joy, but didn't fit the mold I'd envisioned. At least, not initially. As the situation worsens, Julilla's soul-searching reveals an uncommonly complex woman torn by loyalty, honor, expectation, duty, and a desire to be at the forefront of the decisions that determine her fate.The Whore by Stephanie Dray:None of those who contributed to A Day of Fire were unfamiliar to me. I've fond memories of reading many of their solo efforts, including Madame Tussaud by Michelle Moran who supplied the introduction to the six part novel. That said, author Stephanie Dray was something of an anomaly within the group. I've followed her on social media for years, but I've not read her work and so approached The Whore with fresh and entirely unbiased objectivity.Considering her background it should come as no surprise that Dray's story incorporated the Temple of Isis and a spiritual connection to the Egyptian goddess, but it was the personal reflections of Capella and Prima that captured my imagination. The sisters are as different as night and day, but their trials comprise some of the most powerful moments and intimate revelations of the entire book.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1NDS14H4H5TGH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NI5CBXI#wasThisHelpful","R1NDS14H4H5TGH","A7WNQN5D1E4HW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A7WNQN5D1E4HW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I didn't think much about sitting down with Stephanie Thornton's The Tiger Queens. I flopped on a chair in the living room, figured I'd read while the kids watched their Saturday morning cartoons and life would go on as usual, but that's not what happened. In point of fact, I managed only two pages before realizing I'd grossly underestimated the situation.Thornton impressed me with The Secret History and Daughter of the Gods, so my falling in love with The Tiger Queens isn't exactly a surprise, but the prologue alone told me she's outdone herself this time around. Something about that passage struck a chord and teased my imagination in a way I'd not anticipated. I was eager, giddy even, and it was only the beginning.There is a vividness to Thornton's setting that is virtually unrivaled. I'm hesitant to call it beautiful, her descriptions of life on the steppes are often harsh and unapologetically brutal, but for me that's part of its appeal. There is a relentless intensity about it, an inherent authenticity that jumps from the page and illustrates the forces that shaped Thornton's leading ladies into the women they became.Four narrators sound like a lot, but here again, Thornton rises to the challenge. Borte, Alaqai, Fatima and Sorkhokhtani are each given their due, but I what I liked is how Thornton used their individual personalities to her advantage. She goes to great lengths to exhibit their various strengths and weaknesses, throws them into situations that are incredibly challenging, but unites them as a sisterhood. Historically these characters are defined by their association with Genghis Khan which is why I loved this portrayal of femininity how it contrasted with his legend and the heavily masculine society in which they lived.Yes, I sound like a gushing fan girl, but I really don't care. The Tiger Queens is easily one of the best books I've tackled all year and has earned a place of honor among my all-time favs.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RR53AM3CK1HPL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0451417801#wasThisHelpful","RR53AM3CK1HPL","A7WNQN5D1E4HW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A7WNQN5D1E4HW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you're anything like me, you're looking at the cover of C.C. Humphreys' The French Executioner and stifling a groan. Titles like Wolf Hall, Bring Up the Bodies, To Die For, The Secret Diary of Anne Boleyn, The Lady in the Tower, The Dark Rose, Dark Eyed Queen, The Concubine, The King's Secret Matter, Murder Most Royal, and The Other Boleyn Girl are flashing through your mind and you're seriously questioning if you've the stomach for more.Pardon my cynicism, but that's where my association with this title started and it would be difficult to appreciate the depth of my admiration without understanding where I stood prior to picking up the book. Anne Boleyn is a fascinating character, but her story has been done to death and frankly, I'd be hard pressed to give a damn about yet another adaption. Thankfully, The French Executioner is not Anne's story, but that of the swordsman who freed England's magisterial monarch of his second wife... or was it her from him?To get right to the point, I liked this book and not just because Humphreys re-imagined Anne's execution as a beginning rather than an end. I think his characterization of Jean Rombaud inspired and I found the intrigue he created around her famous appendage intensely provocative. Anne's legacy is forever intertwined with the history of the English Reformation and I love the idea that her earthly remains might have fed the fanatical fires that burned after her death.I'll grant there are some gruesome elements to the story and I felt the pacing dragged during the battle scenes, but I've very few complaints overall. The plot itself is fascinating and Humphreys' characters comprise one of the best ensemble casts I've had fortune to come across. Major and minor players have distinctive roles and I loved how Humphreys was able to bring so many different personalities and backgrounds to the table. Supporting figures like Abraham and Da Costa are as memorable as Fugger, Cibo, Beck, Januc and Haakon and that attention to detail made reading this piece a real pleasure.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 3, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1SGLOOIOWMKGS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0752848305#wasThisHelpful","R1SGLOOIOWMKGS","A7WNQN5D1E4HW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A7WNQN5D1E4HW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I think most book junkies can understand the impulse that led me to Karen Aminadra's Rosings. I finished book one, looked the author up, realized she'd written a sequel and quickly succumbed to the enthusiasm that lingers after completing a title you've enjoyed. That's right folks, I am an addict. I'm not at all interested in rehabilitation so don't ask, but I'm always accepting recommendations if you have something you think I should consider.For the record, I liked this piece. Anne is practically a footnote in Pride and Prejudice and I really enjoyed seeing her step into the spotlight. As with Charlotte, I think the premise set forth in the jacket description compliments Austen's classic and I appreciate how Aminadra sought to build on details established in the original text. I'll grant she takes liberties with the material, but all things considered I have only one complaint: Lady Catherine de Bourgh.Anne's mother terrorizes Lizzie for flashing her 'fine eyes' in Darcy's direction and she isn't any kinder to the residents of Hunsford in Charlotte, so why Aminadra attempted an about-face in Rosings is beyond my comprehension. I adore the layers Aminadra gifted Miss de Bourgh, but the effort she put toward reforming her ladyship seemed entirely unnatural considering the earlier incarnations of the character.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RLG4VEVMR6EXH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CM4QZ4W#wasThisHelpful","RLG4VEVMR6EXH","A7WNQN5D1E4HW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A7WNQN5D1E4HW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In the world of Austen based lit, Karen Aminadra's Charlotte was a pleasant surprise. I'd picked it up as a freebie and didn't expect much from the piece, but ultimately enjoyed the author's refreshingly original take on Mr. and Mrs. Collins. Building on Austen's beloved classic, Aminadra chronicles the early days of William and Charlotte's marriage, offering readers the opportunity to indulge their love of Pride and Prejudice while affording two of its minor characters a rare chance at redemption.What I liked most about the piece is how natural it feel alongside the original. As with all spin-offs, I feel it important for writers to acknowledge the spirit of the piece on which their story is based. As such, I truly appreciated that Aminadra allowed the character attributes Austen established in the original to factor in her continuation. The said, the depth Aminadra brings to William and Charlotte is certainly worth acknowledging. The Collinses are fairly one dimensional beings in Pride and Prejudice and  I was drawn to the idea that time, perspective and circumstance might allow them to grow beyond those 'first impressions' and into a mutually compassionate and loving couple.Aminadra isn't as charitable in her treatment of Lady Catherine de Burgh, but every good story needs an antagonist. The indomitable mistress of Rosings caused her share of trouble in Pride and Prejudice, but her campaign against Lizzie has nothing on her treatment of Hunsford and its residents. While not exactly endearing, the character proves an excellent foil for the Collinses and brings an exceptional sense of melodrama to the novel. I have similar feelings regarding Colonel Fitzwilliam, but again, the story needed someone to push Charlotte and really liked how his role furthered the narrative.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1GAEEUSIY25EW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0080ELL9M#wasThisHelpful","R1GAEEUSIY25EW","A7WNQN5D1E4HW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A7WNQN5D1E4HW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"On paper, nothing about Laura Bickle's The Hallowed Ones sounds like it will work. A post-apocalyptic, paranormal fantasy with an Amish twist, I thought the title a joke when I first stumbled across it. Had a friend's daughter not begged me to buddy read it with her I doubt I'd have ever picked it up, but the narrative proved me wrong almost from the start.In a market saturated with melancholy and conscience-stricken bloodsuckers, I was pleased to see Bickle's more traditional interpretations. Her vampires are downright creepy and pose a legitimate threat to Katie and her neighbors. Could they give you nightmares? This Walking Dead fan wasn't fazed, but I'd hazard caution if you're the squeamish type. Personally, I was just impressed that a contemporary young adult author would hold classic horror in such high regard.I'd snickered over the setting of this piece, but looking back I think it a truly inspired choice. The Amish community is isolated from mainstream society so assuming you can wrap your head around the premise, a lot of the situational drama actually makes sense. If that weren't enough, Bickle embraces the lifestyle and culture of the Amish people and manages to explore their faith without standing atop a soapbox which is actually pretty impressive when you stop and think about it.There is a light romantic element to the story, but unlike many of her peers, Bickle doesn't mire her narrative in an overabundance of sexual tension and teenage hormones. In point of fact, Bickle's heroine is both practical and level-headed, an individual who can actually be admired that's not something easily found in this particular genre.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R182N2QSKXUO38/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0547859260#wasThisHelpful","R182N2QSKXUO38","A7WNQN5D1E4HW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A7WNQN5D1E4HW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Ask Historical Fiction Virtual Book Tour coordinator Amy Bruno, acclaimed author Anna Belfrage or B.R.A.G. host Stephanie Moore Hopkins and they'll tell you my name is synonymous with one thing: coffee. I wont waste time denying it, the ambrosial beverage is my life blood, the fuel that keeps me writing reviews at all hours of the night. It's no exaggeration, I can rarely be found without a steaming hot cup at my side so when I heard author Piers Alexander had incorporated the robust bean and the coffeehouses of seventeenth century London into the plot of The Bitter Trade, let's just say I sat up and took notice. I've picked up novels on less, but few have impressed me as much as Alexander's debut. Richly atmospheric, the narrative plunges readers into the cutthroat world of England's capital, immersing them in a deliciously dark climate of suspicion and intrigue.Calumny Spinks, the unfortunately named son of an ill-favored union, proves a captivating and charismatic protagonist. Young though he is, the resourceful seventeen year old develops a bold, ambitious and passionate persona over the course of the narrative. A cheeky, foul-mouthed rogue with a propensity for trouble, the boy is memorable for all the right reasons and he isn't the only one. Across the board, Alexander composes a host of engaging and thought-provoking characters, individuals who illustrate what it meant to be outsiders, subject to English law but beyond its protection.The explicitness of Alexander's language might offend more sensitive readers, but personally, I liked his wickedly sharp and biting prose. Fast-paced and quick-witted, one can't help being swept into Cal's world and the conspiratorial schemes of which he finds himself a part. There were several instances where I felt Alexander might have done more with the story, but by and large I've no significant complaints over the time I spent with his work.Food for thought, The Bitter Trade is set against the Glorious Revolution, a period that is not well-known this side of the Atlantic and I while I certainly appreciated the historic scope of the novel, I'm not above suggesting readers familiarize themselves with the Huguenots before delving into this debut. It is not a requirement by any means, but a basic understanding of events might prove beneficial, especially to those who've never studied the overthrow of James II.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2WQUAPGWK2Y1B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=099286450X#wasThisHelpful","R2WQUAPGWK2Y1B","A7WNQN5D1E4HW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A7WNQN5D1E4HW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"When I first stumbled over Alison Altee's The Typewriter Girl, I got really excited. The jacket art is beautiful and I'm just shallow enough to get charged up over that sort of thing. The comparison to Downton Abbey didn't hurt either and by the time I got the book I was dying to get started which is funny, because I only made it through chapter three.Marketing didn't do this piece any favors and I for one think it a travesty to liken Atlee's work to the Masterpiece hit. Now, before you get your panties in a twist, hear me out. I went into this book with a distinct expectation and was both confused and disappointed to discover that anticipation misplaced. Upset, I stepped away from the book and came back to it after clearing my head. I started over at chapter one, ignored the sales tag and took in the story with an completely open mind and discovered a truly intriguing take on turn-of-the-century life.There is more grit in these pages than in the halls of Downton, a palpable desperation Lord Grantham couldn't begin to comprehend and an emotional quagmire that puts Lady Mary to shame. There is a vulgarity I found unnecessary, but I truly enjoyed watching Betsey come into her own over the course of the story. She is an atypical heroine in world of strict social order and I found that fascinating as a reader.A suggestive and striking novel, The Typewriter Girl isn't your average Victorian era fiction, but Atlee makes it work, ultimately creating something both unconventional and entertaining.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1R5MG0JC81KBL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1451673256#wasThisHelpful","R1R5MG0JC81KBL","A7WNQN5D1E4HW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A7WNQN5D1E4HW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Shadow on the Highway marks my second encounter with author Deborah Swift. I read A Divided Inheritance last year and really enjoyed it so I was pretty excited about taking on her latest release when it was offered by both Endeavour Press and Historical Fiction Virtual Book Tours.I've never been one to shy away from giving my honest opinion and I'm not about to start now, so I have no trouble admitting it took me a few chapters to get into this one. Swift lays a lot of groundwork early in the novel which is probably why I had trouble losing myself in the story, but once it takes off, the book proved quite interesting.I can't believe I'm writing this, because I rarely find authors who can pull it off, but Swift's handling of the political situation in England was my favorite aspect of the novel. She explores the subject matter naturally, explaining the essentials without bombarding the reader with excessive exposition.There is nice contrast between Abigail and Lady Katherine which I really liked. I wasn't sold on the romantic elements of the piece, but that's just me. It isn't bad or poorly executed by any means, I just don't think it added a whole lot to the piece. Still, it's its early in the series and Swift might turn it into something really interesting moving forward.Shadow on the Highway is young adult lit, but I found it worthwhile. Definitely something I'd recommend to younger fans of historic fiction or even those interested lighter fact-based narratives.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R20DY5XC8VVMNB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00M7N24UM#wasThisHelpful","R20DY5XC8VVMNB","A7WNQN5D1E4HW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A7WNQN5D1E4HW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Anna Belfrage never ceases to amaze me. Revenge and Retribution is the sixth novel in her Graham Saga series, but the events of the story are just as fresh as those of its predecessors. I know it isn't professional to gush, but I really can't help myself. There aren't many who can revisit a story so regularly and sill maintain a sense of originality.Take for example, the Graham children. Far from being carbon copies of their parents, they follow their own paths, manage their own trials and respond to life's tribulations in their own unique ways. The older generation is not immune to this evolution either, though their growth is less noticeable, they also mature and change with the passing years, giving the reader the opportunity to get to know them in different ways.Belfrage doesn't shy from darker material and I personally think that one of the strongest elements of her work. Things don't always turn out the way the reader hopes, characters get hurt, relationships are strained and not every plot point has a happy ending and while I can see where some might see this as a betrayal, I applaud the effort wholeheartedly for the authentic quality it brings to the emotional landscape of these novels.Historically, I think Belfrage tapped into two very interesting chapters with Revenge and Retribution. I was initially concerned that colonial superstition and captivity among the native tribes were concepts too large to share the same book, but Belfrage balanced them nicely within the scope of the Grahams' experiences.A dark and addictive tale, Revenge and Retribution proved impossible to put down. Highly recommended to both fans of the series and those discovering it for the first time.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RXHTT0S9HUVZL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1781321752#wasThisHelpful","RXHTT0S9HUVZL","A7WNQN5D1E4HW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A7WNQN5D1E4HW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Teresa Neumann's Bianca's Vineyard was a surprise from the start. The cover art gave the impression it'd be something of a love story while the description hinted at war era fiction. Neither is entirely wrong, but for me, the book is more family saga than it is anything else.Why is this important? Because at its heart, the book isn't about Egisto's snap decision to marry Armida, Armida's insecure and troubled nature, or even the war that forever changed their homeland. No, Bianca's Vineyard is about family, the ties that connect its members and how our actions ripple across those bonds.Historically, I loved Neumann's description of Mussolini's Italy, but the atmospheric details paled next to her characters. Each individual has a unique personality and with so many cast members, that's a real achievement. More importantly though, her characters are authentically flawed. They struggle and hesitate, they make mistakes, suffer anger, jealousy, remorse and uncertainty. Maybe it's just me, but the pragmatism in that approach held genuine appeal.The author's dedication to Italian culture and traditional values is also worth noting. There is an attention to detail throughout the narrative that creates a real sense of the lifestyle and customs of Italy and how those norms evolved between generations and geographic local as individuals emigrated around the world.All told, I found Bianca's Vineyard an eloquent and detailed story of secrets, compassion, betrayal and forgiveness. A refreshingly original read that illustrates the true meaning of family loyalty.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1KQKU1KBC0KS9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0983121001#wasThisHelpful","R1KQKU1KBC0KS9","A7WNQN5D1E4HW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A7WNQN5D1E4HW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Andrea Zuvich's The Stuart Vampire was one of those titles. When I first stumbled across it, I wasn't convinced it was something I'd enjoy, but the idea stuck with me. I'd circle back to the book from time to time, but it wasn't until last week that I finally threw caution to the wind and picked it up.For those who aren't familiar with Zuvich, understand she is a professional historian who specializes in the Late Stuarts of the Seventeenth Century. Why is this important? Well, I hate to point fingers, but few paranormal writers put the same emphasis on historic detail when blending these genres and ultimately, I feel the balance Zuvich created is what sets The Stuart Vampire above similar crossovers.Is the book perfect? No. I noted the odd typo here and there and I wont deny wanting more from the story in terms of character development, but neither proved a significant deterrent in my overall enjoyment of the story. In point of fact, there is only one aspect of the piece that truly bothered me and that is the artwork.Readers really do judge books by their covers and I mean no offense in admitting this, but if I hadn't read this author before, I wouldn't have risked buying the book. The current imagery simply doesn't pique my interest and after finishing the story, I don't think it does justice to the content either. It sounds ridiculous, but I actually spent a lot of time thinking something akin to the promotional material for 2004's The Libertine would make a more accurate and striking impression on potential readers.An intriguing historical with a darkly gothic twist, I enjoyed The Stuart Vampire and would recommend it to anyone with a taste for period horror.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2W6SBNPB93OWJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GBN90O2#wasThisHelpful","R2W6SBNPB93OWJ","A7WNQN5D1E4HW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A7WNQN5D1E4HW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The fifth installment of Jones Viennese Mystery series finds Karl Werthen and Dr. Hans Gross puzzling over a peculiar succession ritualistic of murders in the close-knit village of Graz. In her husbands absence, Berthe Werthen has stumbled onto a mystery of her own, a conspiracy that threatens to destroy one of Austrias most recognized treasures: the world renowned Lipizzaners of the famed Spanish Riding School. Following a complex series of leads, the Werthens soon discover themselves in a high stakes web of violence, scandal and corruption.A brilliantly atmospheric novel, A Matter of Breeding paints a remarkable portrait of Vienna at the dawn of the twentieth century. The city literally comes to life in a radiantly authentic display of pageantry and prejudice, effectively drawing the reader into a bygone age. Cameo appearances by Archduke Franz Ferdinand, artist Tina Blau, and author Bram Stoker deepen the illusion and bring genuine flare to the narrative.The mystery itself is elaborate and thought-provoking and though I felt it somewhat overwhelming, I honestly appreciate the underlying themes of Jones intrigue. The characterizations are rather thin, suggesting it best to read the books chronologically, but all told I found A Matter of Breeding both enjoyable and entertaining.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 31, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2E4CW2RH7TLQA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0727883801#wasThisHelpful","R2E4CW2RH7TLQA","A7WNQN5D1E4HW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A7WNQN5D1E4HW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Patricia Bracewell's Shadow on the Crown marked my first encounter with Emma of Normandy. The historic record is sketchy at best, so it isn't as if there's a lot of information for those looking to learn more about her, but even the basics were new to me. Naturally this blank slate mentality made it difficult to discern where fact met fiction, but it also made reading the book a unique experience as I was able to really lose myself in the narrative.Bracewell's interpretation of Emma is wonderfully dynamic. She is passionate, resilient and astute, but there is a vulnerability in her make-up that rounds out her character and draws on the reader's sympathies. I found the fire and spirit Bracewell folded into Elgiva of Northampton equally fascinating and enjoyed watching the two vie for power in thelred's court.I admit Bracewell's depiction of the Anglo-Saxon king didn't make much of an impression on me, but his eldest son is another story entirely. Little is known about Athelstan and his siblings, but the romantic arc she constructed for thelred's sixteen year old heir was highly satisfying and speaks volumes about the author who imagined it.Finally, I thought the world these individuals inhabited beautifully developed. Though the novel is character driven, the reader is afforded a thorough understanding of the period, the lifestyle of the court, and the political stage on which Emma's story takes place. I personally believe atmosphere an essential factor in any fiction and can't help but appreciate the effort and research Bracewell put into crafting such an authentic setting.Impossible to put down, Shadow on the Crown captivated my imagination from the start and left me itching to see how things will unfold in future installments of the trilogy.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 31, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3O3BQPJU51GX7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0670026395#wasThisHelpful","R3O3BQPJU51GX7","A7WNQN5D1E4HW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A7WNQN5D1E4HW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My nose for World War II lit led me to Lan Fang's Potions and Paper Cranes, but my appreciation for the novel has nothing to with global events of the period. Shocking as it sounds, it was Fang's depiction of individual experiences that captured my imagination.The main story shifts points of view between Sulis, Sujono and Matsumi, something I liked as the role of each character alters with each narrative voice. It is an approach few could manage, but I felt Fang handled it beautifully. Another thing I liked was contrast in Fang's approach to Chinese, Indonesian and Japanese culture and how those influences might have interacted during the uncertainty brought on by the larger conflict.A deeply intuitive tale, Potions and Paper Cranes is a naked assessment of human nature, a haunting narrative that touches something in the reader's soul and shakes them to the core.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 31, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RR08RI4L9L6G0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0983627339#wasThisHelpful","RR08RI4L9L6G0","A7WNQN5D1E4HW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A7WNQN5D1E4HW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I stumbled over Eugen Ketterl's The Emperor Francis Joseph I: An Intimate Study by his Valet in the bibliography of another resource. I believe it was The Emperor & the Actress: The Love Story of Emperor Franz Josef & Katharina Schratt by Joan Haslip, but don't quote me on that. It took me months to track down a copy. There are few available in the United States and most belong to University collections, but thanks to the efforts of my local librarian I was able to get my hands on the rare volume.I personally found the biography interesting for a couple of reasons, but the one that stands out in my mind is Ketterl's tone and command of prose. The text is clear, straightforward and unpretentious. He talks about his insecurities and fears as he does his strengths and personal triumphs. He has nothing to prove and isn't nearly as self-righteous as Marie Larisch or H.R.H. Princess Stephanie of Belgium, Frstin of Lonyay & Ex-Crown Princess of Austria-Hungary.Ketterl's position gave him a unique perspective on the Emperor and those he associated with. The pages dedicated to Emperor Franz Josef's meeting with President Roosevelt was particularly interesting to me, as were his description of the valet's duties and muted critique of the Emperor's love life. The picture he paints is that of a simple man with modest needs, a flawed and compassionate individual who struggled to balance his nature against the duties and responsibilities of his station. It is a sympathetic view that lacks the pomp of most biographies and while I certainly think it bias, I can't help but admire Ketterl's attempt to characterize the Franz Josef he knew and so obviously respected.A rare firsthand account of the Emperor by someone who followed his daily movements, I feel Ketterl's work essential to anyone looking to understand the man who ruled Austria for nearly sixty-eight years. I caution, however, that it be taken with a grain of salt in acknowledgment of Ketterl's relationship with the Emperor and his tenancy to trade in gossip when discussing events and affiliations to which he did not bear witness.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 31, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQV5J67PIMQO9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00087XCT6#wasThisHelpful","RQV5J67PIMQO9","A7WNQN5D1E4HW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A7WNQN5D1E4HW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Fiona Carnarvon's Lady Catherine, the Earl, and the Real Downton Abbey fell into my lap. My mother had learned of and recommended the book's predecessor after I'd turned her onto the television series, but I hadn't found time to pick it up. That said, my curiosity had been sparked, so it wasn't all that surprising when I jumped at the opportunity to review book two. Unfortunately, my optimistic expectations crumbled when face to face with reality.To be clear, I don't think Lady Catherine, the Earl, and the Real Downton Abbey a bad book. There is a lot of great information for those whose knowledge of the period begins and ends with the British costume drama, but being slightly more acquainted with the details, I can't say I found the text particularly enlightening. I appreciate getting to know Catherine Wendell, Lord Porchester, and the events that marked their lives, but in looking at the bigger picture, I confess I found myself bored and disinterested.I found Carvarvon's prose dry and often felt the narration formulaic. As much as I hate admitting it, I had to fight my way through this one and on completion can't say I'm inclined to rush into Lady Almina and the Real Downton Abbey: The Lost Legacy of Highclere Castle.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1KN3U4EVZZT7I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385344961#wasThisHelpful","R1KN3U4EVZZT7I","A7WNQN5D1E4HW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A7WNQN5D1E4HW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I felt I'd come late to the party when I picked up Susan Spann's Blade of the Samurai. Every review said her sophomore release was better than her debut and there I was jumping into book two, one eyebrow raised, wondering what the hell everyone was going on about. I'd never heard of the author, wasn't familiar with the series, was slightly wary of all the praise, and wasn't feeling it as I moved through the first few chapters.I don't know if it's because I was unfamiliar with the cast, was still getting to know Spann's voice or that I'm just a stubborn skeptic, but I struggled to get into this book and was half-convinced I'd be penning a lukewarm commentary when Spann threw a curve ball I didn't see coming.Moving forward after that was an entirely different experience. Spann had caught me off guard and in so doing, engaged my interest. The general levity of the narrative was still difficult for me to digest, but the mystery at the heart of the novel more than made up for it. Shrewd, sophisticated and imaginative, Spann constructs a riddle that keeps her audience on their toes.From a historical perspective, there is a lot of interesting detail, particularly that pertaining to the samurai code and the Jesuit missionaries operating in Japan during the sixteenth century. There are also some rather lovely representations of Japanese architecture if ambiance is something you look for in literature.In hindsight I wish I'd read the books in order as there are several elements that seem to build on concepts from the previous installment, but I can't say I regret the time spent with Blade of the Samurai. I ultimately enjoyed the story a great deal and would definitely recommend to anyone with an interest in culture based fiction.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R554C3AACOKRK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250027055#wasThisHelpful","R554C3AACOKRK","A7WNQN5D1E4HW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A7WNQN5D1E4HW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Unravelled, M.K. Tod's debut novel, made quite an impression when I read it last year. Moving and emotionally authentic it was unlike any wartime romance I'd yet encountered and if I'm honest, it set an expectation that was unusually high for an newly published author. Naturally, I was both excited and nervous about tackling the follow-up, but Lies Told in Silence proved just as eloquent and emotive as its predecessor.Written as a complimentary stand-alone, Lies Told is Silence incorporates faces and events familiar to those who've read Unravelled, but the story is in no way dependent on Tod's original publication so one needn't worry over reading the books in any particular order. That said, I personally enjoyed picking out those details that connect the two and appreciate the effort Tod put into crafting continuity despite the varied motifs and themes of each piece.A multi-generational story, Tod's chronicle of a French family during the chaos of WWI intrigued me for a number of reasons. First and foremost, I liked seeing the war from the perspective of those who bore witness to the destruction of their homeland rather than those who sought glory in its defense. I also enjoyed the contrast Tod created not only between the male and female characters, but among the different age groups represented within the narrative.Historically speaking, Tod offers a wonderfully detailed glimpse of the period, but as with Unravelled, I felt her understanding of what it means to be human amid the terror and torment of such hostilities outshone the fact-based elements of the book. Set against the backdrop of war, Tod writes of lives transformed by combat and the vitality of those left standing when the dust finally settles. Her books make wonderful war stories, but she is in her element writing of those caught on the tides of battle.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R35C2V5AY7ZTVU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LEYV2PI#wasThisHelpful","R35C2V5AY7ZTVU","A7WNQN5D1E4HW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A7WNQN5D1E4HW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have mixed feelings about Anna Castle's Murder by Misrule. On one hand I found it entertaining in an amusing sort of way, but on the other, I must admit the story didn't grab me the way I'd hoped it would.Castle's characters are a diverse collection of individuals. The socially awkward and disgraced Bacon, the rogue Tom Clarady, the pretentious Stephen Delabere, the stately Allen Trumpington and the earnest Benjamin Whitt make a well-rounded team and though somewhat predictable, I found I enjoyed following their exploits.There are several scenes that boast great tension and intrigue, but that sense of suspense often waned between key points in the narrative. It isn't a bad story, but I think I might had appreciated it more if the momentum established in the early chapters had been maintained through the final page.A humorous tale, Murder by Misrule is brimming with levity and mirth. A lighter historical the book is sure to enchant those looking for airy and upbeat fiction.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3F5DB04C1DH1J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0991602501#wasThisHelpful","R3F5DB04C1DH1J","A7WNQN5D1E4HW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A7WNQN5D1E4HW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In terms of a wartime romance, Cara Langston's Battle Hymns is exactly what I expected. I'll be the first to admit there is a certain predictability to the plot, but I found Langston's treatment of the material and the themes she incorporates into the story balanced the more typical elements of the narrative, ultimately transforming it into something both memorable and moving.Charlotte in particular stands out to me. A volunteer nurse, she joins the war effort in order to keep busy, but discovers a tangible passion for the profession. This personal journey, her growing self-awareness, wasn't something I'd anticipated, but I really liked the contrast it brought to the larger story. Like a phoenix, Charlotte finds strength and rises from the ashes of the conflict in a beautiful display of fortitude and perseverance.Parallel to John and Will, Charlotte carries wounds that will never truly heal, but here again Langston managed to surprise me. Set in an age before PTSD was understood or really even acknowledged, the author took great pains to illustrate how varied the disorder can be. I've seen authors struggle with this, too often defining the condition by the extremes, which is why I sincerely appreciated Langston's more intuitive handling of the material.Peppered with authentic detail, Battle Hymns is an eloquent historical that offers rare insight to the intimacies of lives touched by conflict. A poignant debut that holds much promise for Langston's future efforts.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R14GFUF35KGW1J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1499180373#wasThisHelpful","R14GFUF35KGW1J","A7WNQN5D1E4HW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A7WNQN5D1E4HW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Victoria Dougherty's The Bone Church is not an easy read. It hits the ground running and never lets up. Paired with decidedly heavy material and themes, the narrative is more than a little challenging, but that said, it is easily one of the best historical thrillers I've had fortune to come across.Those who follow me know the WWII references in the description are what drew me to this piece, but it was Dougherty's application of history, how she utilized and built her fiction around it that captivated my attention. Both storylines are sculpted from verified truths making it difficult to determine where fact meets fiction. The resulting seamlessness enhances the tension within the narrative and generates such excitement that the novel is practically impossible to put down.Dougherty's treatment of Magdalena and Felix also stood out to me. It would have been easy to paint these characters in bleakly sympathetic tones, but Dougherty didn't go that route. There is an authenticity to this couple. They are trapped and hunted, but there is a tenacious intensity in their make-up that draws admiration rather than pity. An edginess in their story that plays on the reader's emotions in a way that is both inspired and unexpected.A deliciously dark and addicting foray into a world of mistrust, betrayal, paranoia and deceit, The Bone Church was a wholly unexpected pleasure. Yes, I had to work for it and familiarize myself with previously unknown chapters of historic detail, but when push comes to shove, I can't say I regret a moment spent with this piece.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R252H9WSM95T0U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=061598052X#wasThisHelpful","R252H9WSM95T0U","A7WNQN5D1E4HW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A7WNQN5D1E4HW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"No you aren't imagining it. That is a five star rating up there. I understand it's a bit of a shock, but books like The Devil in the Marshalsea don't come along every day and even I give credit where due.Hard as it might be to believe, this one sucked me from the start. Author Antonia Hodgson hits the ground running, setting a blistering pace that kept me engaged to the final page, but momentum was far from the deciding factor in my opinion of her work. She also took full advantage of London's disreputable history, creating a chilling and deliciously authentic picture of lower class life in eighteenth-century England.The story itself is part social commentary and part good old fashioned fiction, but the deft complexity of the novel's construction make it impossible to determine where one ends and the other begins. It's layered, but in such a way that one is hardly aware of its elaborate intricacies.The heavy themes and details were balanced by an array of well-defined and distinctly original characters. These individuals were both captivating and memorable despite their questionable virtues and served as a nice counterpoint to the grit of Tom's surroundings and the heightened tension of his situation.I could gush all day, but there's really no substitute for firsthand experience. A clever tale of debauchery, villainy and corruption, The Devil in the Marshalsea isn't to be missed.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R26E3CVX3I0ASW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1444775413#wasThisHelpful","R26E3CVX3I0ASW","A7WNQN5D1E4HW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A7WNQN5D1E4HW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It is a truth universally acknowledged that once one has fallen for Pride and Prejudice, one will be inexplicably drawn to spin-offs and re-tellings of Jane Austen's classic and I am no exception. Every so often I'll find a title with just enough promise to tempt my interest and away I'll go. Such was the case with Reina M. Williams' Most Truly.What I liked most about the piece is that Williams did not try emulate Austen too closely. Naturally there are similarities, but she didn't suppress her individual voice in an attempt to mimic her predecessor which is something I personally found very appealing. All too often I find authors of adaptations force a false note into their style, story or characters, but I liked that Williams wasn't afraid to highlight her own technique and spirit.Another thing that appealed to me was the shifting point of view. Rotating between James and Kitty allowed the reader to see both sides of the equation and though Most Truly is a short, I think Williams' approach exceedingly well-plotted and executed.A light romance, Most Truly sets the bar for the Love at Pemberley series. An enjoyable period piece for any fan of Austen based fiction.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2HADQJ8N96HEQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00H07FW5E#wasThisHelpful","R2HADQJ8N96HEQ","A7WNQN5D1E4HW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A7WNQN5D1E4HW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've a confession to make folks. As much as I hate to admit it, I had no idea who Sylvia Brooke was prior to picking up Philip Eade's biography and to be entirely honest, I couldn't've found Sarawak on a map if my life depended on it. I knew nothing about this volume except that it sounded interesting.Flying blind, I had no idea what to expect in terms of subject matter and was pleasantly surprised by the colorful eccentricities of Sylvia, her friends and relations. Eade's depiction of her dysfunctional home life, unconventional lifestyle and colorful personality illuminate much of her character and make a lasting impression on the reader.That said, I found Eade's writing difficult to appreciate. The material is entertaining, but his prose is both dry and plodding. The most engaging passages are quotes lifted directly from family journals and/or correspondence, a fact which made the book quite difficult to get lost in. I was also irritated by Eade's tendency to recap every detail of his extensive research as his inability to streamline his findings made navigating the text rather tedious.When all is said and done, Sylvia, Queen of the Headhunters proves an interesting biography, but the format and style fail to deliver the engaging and richly provocative story its cover suggests.

"I had a lot of fun reading Henri de Weindel's Behind the Scenes at the Court of Vienna. The book itself is not a particularly accurate volume, but it is amusing for its exploration of contemporary gossip.A French editorialist, the most important thing to remember in looking at this piece is that Weindel collaborated with an unnamed source some sixteen years after the death of Empress Elisabeth. Best taken with a healthy measure of salt, much of his work contradicts firsthand accounts of the royal court as well as the investigative records pertaining to Crown Prince Rudolf and the affair at Mayerling.Weindel paints a sympathetic portrait of both Empress Elisabeth and Crown Princess Stephanie which I found interesting as the two were so famously incompatible. The author is far less gracious toward Franz Josef, Crown Prince Rudolf and the Archduke Franz Ferdinand, but his conclusions are still fairly interesting when considered in context.Akin to a grocery store tabloid, Behind the Scenes at the Court of Vienna is not something I'd recommend to those unfamiliar with the Hapsburgs, but it is noteworthy for its depiction of popular opinion regarding the Imperial household immediately prior to the assassinations in Sarajevo.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R10NQX9MC9Y3QF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1289806446#wasThisHelpful","R10NQX9MC9Y3QF","A7WNQN5D1E4HW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A7WNQN5D1E4HW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Want to know something funny? I don't really want to write this review. I don't want to write it because once I put down my thoughts, I'll have to say goodbye and Melanie Dobson's Chateau of Secrets is the kind of story I hate to let go of.I suppose the most amazing thing about the novel is that both story lines - Chloe's in the present and Gisle's during WWII - are equally compelling. Maybe I've been unlucky, but this is practically unheard of in my experience. More often than not one period will read much stronger than the other and I end up skimming whole chapters to pick up the more interesting half of the narrative, but that didn't happen here. The stories complement one another, but are unique enough to be appreciated in their own right.Religion plays a noticeable role in the story, but it flows naturally and is applied to the characters in very realistic ways. I abhor preachy fiction with a passion and was stunned at how effectively Dobson was able to utilize faith as a primary theme without pontificating.Riley's story was a little much and I wasn't convinced Austin would have exited as quickly as he did, but these are minor quibbles at best. Thoroughly engaging and entirely unpredictable, Chateau of Secrets isn't to be missed.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1WCESARGAXB53/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DPM7TN6#wasThisHelpful","R1WCESARGAXB53","A7WNQN5D1E4HW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A7WNQN5D1E4HW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Del Rey Books had the rights to adapt the Star Trek animated series into book form.  The earliest books in the series adapted three episodes per book.  After the sixth book, they realized that there were only four episodes left to adapt.  What could they do?  They could have switched to two episodes per book and gotten two more books out of the series.  But that's not what they did.  Instead, they chose to adapt ONE episode per book and get four more books out of the series.  So, how do turn a 30 minute TV episode into a 180 page novel.  Well, in the case of this particular book, you adapt the TV episode in the first third of the book and then tell a completely unrelated story in the last two-thirds of the book.  Or I should say that the new story seems unrelated to the TV story, but the author does manage to tie them together in the last chapter.  In the TV part of the story, the crew of the Enterprise ages backwards when the enter the anti-matter universe.  In the new material, the Enterprise and a Klingon warship come into conflict over a man who allegedly invented a doomsday weapon.

It's not funny (intentionally or otherwise) and it isn't completely successful as a serious album.  The fault probably lies with the production.

"Roky Erickson was the leader of The 13th Floor Elevators in the 1960's.  This was his first album after the group broke up.  He trades the psychedelic sounds of The 13th Floor Elevators for a hard rock sound here.  The album has a lot of songs inspired by monster movies.

"This autobiography of Roy Campanella was published in 1959.  It's quite good in covering Campy's boyhood, life in baseball and life in the year after he had the accident that left him a quadriplegic.  Roy comes across as a great guy and quite inspirational in dealing with his tragedy.  However, there is no mention of his feud with Jackie Robinson.  Also, Campy writes in glowing terms about his wife Ruthe, but she left him the year after the book was published, so she must not have dealt with his handicap as well as he portrays.  Campy writes about his adopted son David being arrested, but says that he learned his lesson and will stay out of trouble from now on.  Well, he was wrong about that, because David was arrested several more times and died of a drug overdose.

"After Elvis got out of the army, their was an attempt to turn him into a ""serious"" actor.  Flaming Star was one of his serious films.  Unfortunately, his lightweight movies like Blue Hawaii did a lot better than his serious movies, so that pretty much killed off Elvis' ambitions to be taken seriously as an actor.  Since Flaming Star is NOT a musical, their were only four songs recorded for it (or five songs, if you consider ""Flaming Star"" and ""Black Star"" to be different songs, which they are not). ""Flaming Star"" and ""Summer Kisses, Winter Tears"" are very good songs and the other two songs are silly novelty songs.  This is a 75 minute CD, so there is a LOT of bonus material, all of which is alternate takes of the four songs.  The alternate takes are fun, because you can hear Elvis laughing and clowning around.  He especially has a hard time getting through the novelty songs without laughing.  Of course, the price of this CD will keep anyone except for hardcore Elvis fans from buying it.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1H40DUTRYO8EG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QPM9W6K#wasThisHelpful","R1H40DUTRYO8EG","A2INX8B6VXUVW6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2INX8B6VXUVW6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Their ages range from 16 to 19.  The main thing to know about these stories is that they are quite funny, with most of them ending with a humorous surprise.

This Belvedere is a self-centered, self-proclaimed ""genius"" .  The book takes place during World War II.  Babysitters are hard to come by, with most women working in plants for the war effort.  Tacey King has the idea to take out an ad in a literary magazine, looking for an aspiring novelist to live with her family and help out a little around the house, but leaving a lot of time to write.  Lynn Belvedere answers the ad and turns out to be a man, much to Tacey's surprise.  Hilarity ensues, needless to say.

"This novel for boys by Curtis Bishop is one of several that he wrote about Little League Baseball.  I don't know if the books have recurring characters, but several of them seem to take place in the author's hometown of Austin (as this one does).  In this book, Carlos, a refugee from Fidel Castro's Cuba, joins the Giants of the Austin Little League.  Will Curtis adjust to living in America?  Will Carlos and his father be allowed to stay in Austin?  Will the Giants win the championship?  Actually, you don't find out the answer to the last question, because the book ends in the middle of the season.  This is an enjoyable enough book for boys, although possibly too dated for the boys of today.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RGGM28XC5OHZX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0006BLXUO#wasThisHelpful","RGGM28XC5OHZX","A2INX8B6VXUVW6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2INX8B6VXUVW6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Marston was a fascinating character; a self-promoter, a polygamist, a feminist, an inventor, a psychologist, a comic book writer.

"This book reprints the Robin comics from Star Spangled Comics #87 to #105.  As other reviewers have pointed out, the production quality here is much lower than it was in Robin Archives Vol. 1.  The stories were NOT recolored with fresh, vibrant colors like the first volume had.  Instead, we get the faded colors from sixty year old comic books.  That's disappointing, but if you can get past that, the stories are pretty fun.  From issues #88 to #95, the strip essential became a ""Batman and Robin"" strip, in an apparent attempt to increase circulation.  With #96, Tomahawk (a Revolutionary War hero) took over the cover of the comic and Robin went back to solo adventures (with some flimsy excuse for why Batman wasn't involved).  Fun comics, but it would be nice if the stories had decent coloring.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Q4ZUH3HF5FNP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1401226256#wasThisHelpful","R1Q4ZUH3HF5FNP","A2INX8B6VXUVW6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2INX8B6VXUVW6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Warlock debuted in Fantastic Four as ""Him"" and was finally given a real name when Roy Thomas gave him his own series.  As Thomas admits in his introduction, he was inspired by Jesus Christ Superstar to create a messianic superhero.  He wanted Warlock to be the only superhero on the planet, so he had the High Evolutionary create ""Counter-Earth"" on the far side of the Sun.  The High Evolutionary's evil creation the Man-Beast took the Satanic role in the series.

"This big book reprints the entire John Carter, Warlord of Mars series published by Marvel Comics.  That's 28 monthly issues and three annuals.  This series is surprisingly good.  That can be largely attributed to two of the best comics writers of their generation, Marv Wolfman and Chris Claremont.  Wolfman started the series off with a ten part story and Claremont topped that with a twelve part story.  The artwork is good, too, with Gil Kane drawing more issues than anyone else.  Something worth noting is that Frank Miller's first Marvel work was in John Carter #18, although he hadn't developed his own style yet and his artwork looked pretty much like everyone elses.  This is a fun series for people who are fans of Edgar Rice Burroughs' Barsoom series.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RCT71718OKB2V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0785159908#wasThisHelpful","RCT71718OKB2V","A2INX8B6VXUVW6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2INX8B6VXUVW6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"As far as I know, this is the second album released by Chuck Barris.  The first one was an instrumental album of theme songs from his tv shows.  This is his first album as a vocalist.  Unfortunately, he isn't that good of a singer.  He probably would have been gonged on The Gong Show.  His voice isn't terrible, it's just nothing special.  However, the band on the album, lead by Gong Show bandleader Milton DeLugg, is quite good.  The songs are pretty short, with 16 songs packed into 38 minutes.  Most of the songs are standards, but of course Chuck also does his biggest hit as a songwriter, ""Palisades Park"".  This is a fun enough album if you are a Chuck Barris fan.

"During the recording sessions for Ghost On The Canvas, Glen Campbell recorded new vocals for some of his most popular songs as well as a few other songs.  Some time later, new instrumentation was added to his vocals and this album is the result.  While this album isn't as great as Ghost On The Canvas, it's still great in it's own right.  Glen's voice isn't as strong as it used to be, but the ""catch"" in his voice just makes the songs more touching.  The vulnerability in his voice and the sparce instrumentation bring out the melancholia in ""Rhinestone Cowboy"" like never before.  God bless Glen Campbell.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 3, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2L7I1MAJGDTFW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CSCIZRI#wasThisHelpful","R2L7I1MAJGDTFW","A2INX8B6VXUVW6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2INX8B6VXUVW6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a deluxe edition CD of the soundtrack to Stay Away, Joe.  This is the first CD exclusively devoted to that movie, since there were only five songs recorded for the movie, which would have made for a really short CD.  There were two recording sessions for the soundtrack.  The first session was in October of 1967, where three songs were recorded.  It was decided that the movie needed one more song, so another session was scheduled for January of 1968.  Two songs were recorded for possible inclusion in the film, plus two other songs that had nothing to do with the movie.  That makes a total of seven songs, which would be a very short ""album"".  But have no fear, there are a ton of bonus track incuded here, all of which are alternate takes.  These alternate takes are among the most interesting of Elvis' career, because Elvis was in a ""mood"" during the sessions.  He curses on most of the alternate takes, and jokes around a lot.  As for the quality of the songs, ""U.S. Male"" is one of his best songs of the late 1960's, and the other songs are good, which one exception.  That exception is ""Dominic"", which is one of the worst songs that Elvis ever recorded and Elvis asked that it never be released on a record (oops).  This is a fun CD, but the price and the duplication of songs makes it only of interest to hardcore Elvis fans.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2NLIGPTYRA61A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DNO8QYW#wasThisHelpful","R2NLIGPTYRA61A","A2INX8B6VXUVW6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2INX8B6VXUVW6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This album was assembled by a producer named Pink Bob.  He got Tiny Tim to come to his recording studio on two dates.  Tiny sang and played his ukulele, and Pink later overdubbed other instruments onto the tracks (a band called The Sediments provided the instrumentation).  Actually, only half the songs here are from the Pink Bob sessions; he licensed the rest of the songs from other people.  The first song is an Elvis related novelty song produced by Stuart Hersh.  There are three songs from the still unreleased album celebrating Tiny's marriage to Miss Sue.  Three of the songs were written and produced by Mike Nerlino; I assume these are from the 1970's, because two of them are disco songs.  The final song is a bizarre remix of a Tiny Tim song fragment that Eugene Chadbourne somehow stretched out to almost seven minutes.  The different sources for the songs give the CD diversity, which actually works in it's favor.  This is a fun album which shows that Tiny Tim was more than just ""Tiptoe Thru The Tulips"".","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R155ZAKQNMVSTV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0000038YW#wasThisHelpful","R155ZAKQNMVSTV","A2INX8B6VXUVW6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2INX8B6VXUVW6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Monkees Present was The Monkees third album of 1969, including the original version of The Monkees Greatest Hits.  It included four tracks each from Micky, David and Michael.  Unfortunately, they didn't choose the four BEST tracks from each of them (in my opinion).  Two of Davy songs are actually leftovers from More Of The Monkees and don't belong on the album.  This three CD (and one 45) Deluxe Edition features a whole of songs that were considered from the album but ultimately left off of it (including some more leftovers from More Of The Monkees).  Most of these songs are included in multiple mixes.  There are even some backing tracks which they never got around to recording vocals for, most of which aren't that great to listen to.  This collection is clearly only for Monkees obsessives, because no one else would want to hear FIVE different mixes of ""Mommy and Daddy"" (actually SIX different mixes if you include the 45).","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RL414G9ZD9HIU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EHTA06O#wasThisHelpful","RL414G9ZD9HIU","A2INX8B6VXUVW6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2INX8B6VXUVW6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Clive Barker's Hell Priest, the demon or angel from the higher planes of pain and pleasure, the Cenobite known vulgarly as Pinhead has an ambitious vision.  As he pursues that vision, he attempts to recruit a detective gifted with a sensitivity for evil, and covered with tattoos that help him find his way when he opposes demons and ghosts, Harry D'Amour.  Pinhead wants D'Amour to be his chronicler, the observer who records Pinheads ascent to greater power in Hell and beyond.  Needless to say, D'Amour gives the demon an unequivocal 'no', but still gets drawn into battles and journeys on earth and in hell.I enjoyed the story immensely.  The characters were well developed, the plot moved quickly, and the elements of the story connected well.  By any standard, this was an excellent horror/fantasy story.  But the style wasn't quite what I had expected.The language and story were a departure from Barker's earlier style.  Compared to the book that introduced the Cenobites, Hellbound Heart, or the story that introduced D'Amour, The Last Illusion, Scarlet Gospels seemed less vibrant and less developed.  The descriptions were good, but lacked the intensity and visceral character of the earlier books.  The plot seemed more linear.  At one point, Barker was listing descriptors and ended with 'et cetera', which seemed very out of character. It read like a Barker story transcribed by a mentally and emotionally healthier person.  The book was good, and I enjoyed it, but the feel of it was unexpected, having read many books by Barker.A great horror novel, despite being a departure from Barker's usual style.Edward M.

"Every student of American history (at least those who stayed awake) knows the story of George Washington attacking the Hessians on Christmas Eve.The author of this work was an officer of those Hessians.  Ewald articulates the needs of a conventional force using unconventional tactics to oppose an insurgency.  Just like the Marine Corps' 1940 Small Wars Manual, many books about the US-Vietnam war, a plethora of current articles about Iraq and Afghanistan, and a host of other works.For the contemporary counterinsurgent, Ewald provides a sense of continuity, a sense that you are not alone, and others have shared the challenges you face.  To be fair, there is little said that hasn't been said elsewhere, but that someone described an experience you share in in 1785, 230 years ago, is proof that you are not alone, that others have shared in the trials through the ages.  On the other hand, sometimes historical perspective can offer insights that did not emerge from more recent works, like the 1940 Small Wars Manual.For a student of light infantry tactics, Ewald provides two things.  First, he provides examples of early dispersed tactics using precision small arms, tactics that required initiative, discipline, and dynamic leadership while breaking with Napoleonic tactics in every way. Second, he commiserates with the junior officer who sees a need for change while facing senior leaders who cannot see beyond their comfort zone in obsolescent concepts.  The struggle is real, and goes back centuries, brother.  Don't surrender, and don't back down.For students of the American Revolution, Ewald provides a perspective seldom voiced, that of neither the Colonials nor the British, but a British 'military contractor'.  We hear the voices of American patriots, and occasionally our French allies (since the war conveniently served their interests), and once in a while we hear the thoughts of Brits who were defeated by a pack of Colonials, but the German mercenaries are seldom, if ever heard from.  The bitterness at defeat by a bunch of untrained an poorly equipped peasants stung, and stung hard.  This is a voice who deserve to be heard.For a wide range of historians and theorists, this is a valuable work.  I can't recommend it highly enough.Edward M.

"The Victorinox German Army knife is an excellent tool for adventures off the beaten path.  It has six blades with nine tools (lock blade, wood saw, can opener, bottle opener, wire stripper, awl, two slotted screwdrivers, and a Philips head screwdriver, and the large slotted screwdriver locks open).  The metal parts are all a good quality, corrosion resistant steel, and the scales are green plastic with a good, non-slip surface.  Both the lock blade and saw cut well.  The blade is partially serrated, on the half closer to the point, which is a little unusual, but has worked well for me.  The thumb hole allows easy opening with one hand, and the blade locks open with a click and no play.  The saw is double cut, and the most efficient design you can find on a knife.  The can opener and bottle opener work well.  The slotted screw drivers could be finished a bit better, but despite the slight rounding, they work well enough.All together, this knife is an excellent combination of tools made to a high standard.

"This is a first rate steel water bottle.The intent of this product was to avoid keeping your drinking water in plastics that might be health concerns.  This it does.  The cap screws down tightly and doesn't leak even when shaken.  It is steel, so there are no questions about the bottle.  It isn't clear what plastic the cap is made out of, but I could not detect any odor.  I am curious which steel it is made of, as I know people who are allergic to nickel, and unless it is surgical steel, there is a chance my friends could react to it.Good product if this is what you are looking for.E.M.

"Kelly Link is off to a great start.  Her stories are imaginative and engaging.  The plots range from classic to surreal.  The descriptions are vivid and bring the stories to life.Her style is reminiscent of William Gibsons prose, placing you in the setting quickly and building the milieu around you as the story progresses.  But instead of a grimy future, it is a world of elves and ghosts, sunshine and twilight, innocence and sinster intents.  My favorite was Summer People, a tale of elves in a rundown rural setting.  Many of the elements of classic fairy tales were there, but new nuances were introduced to make the elves contemporary.  The Valley of the Girls puts an ancient Egyptian on modern youthful romance.  And the Lesson, well, you'll have to read it.I forward to seeing more of her work.E.M.

"""Resistance Will Win"" by Truong Chinh is the essential text to understanding the wars in Vietnam from the end of World War II through the mid-nineteen seventies.One of the fundamental problems in understanding the VIetnam wars for Americans and Europeans is that the conflicts are viewed through the lens of the French and American perceptions of the war and the French and American ignorance of Ho Chi Minh's and Giap's mindset and approach to the conflicts.Often referred to as ""Dau Tranh"" (""One Struggle""), the key aspects of Vietnamese military theory were protracted struggle and complete unity of effort.  The Vietnamese saw time as being on their side.  As long as they did not quit, they would win.  The other piece was that political, economic, cultural, and military means were all brought to bear on their war of liberation from outside influences.A very different take on strategic theory and the Vietnam conflicts than most Americans or Europeans hear.Edward M.

"""People's War People's Army"" has more theory than the author's ""Military Art of People's War"", but that is not saying much.  This work is more of a detailed history of the Vietnam war from the 1940s through 1960 or 61, with some commentary on the underlying theory, and a lot of anti-American, and anti-French propaganda.To its credit, this book does an excellent job of describing the strategic and operational level thinking of the Vietnamese communists in the period covered.  I would strongly recommend this book to anyone studying the Vietnam war, so they can get a well rounded perspective of goals and intentions of the Vietnamese communists.I was hoping for more discussion of Vietnamese military theory, but the underlying theory behind the North Vietnamese military plans and actions was not well addressed.  Strategic thinking was articulated, but how they decided on these ends and ways was not.  On the other hand, Giap recommended ""The Resistance War Will Win"" by Truong Chinh, so I guess I know what my next book will be.E. M.

"The comic anti-hero, Doctrine Man flies again.  With his teammates, the Bright Idea Fairy (BIF), the Irish Chaplain, The Great Satan, the ancient Colonel, the Air Force Guy, the guy with the red velvet codpiece, and others, as well as his nemesis, The Blue Falcon, DM shines a light on the foibles of all levels of the Army's silliness.From ""Just livin' the dream"" among the ruins and goats of Iraq, to PowerPoint at the Pentagon, nothing is off the table.  The despised and contemptible U.S. Army Reflective Belt gets the special attention it richly deserves. The crack about the State Department's ""touch rugby league"" was amusing and representative of many service members' attitudes towards State Department.I would toss it out there that if an anthropology student is trying to study the culture of the military, they could do worse than to take this book, and as service members to explain the jokes.

Given that all military operations in the future will be joint, collaborations between two or more services, the need to develop rapport between officers of different services is being forced down to a lower level, and the formal education process should include a joint aspect at lower levels.Excellent scholarship.E.M.

"I purchased General Giap's book trying to understand his military theory and outlook on leadership.  While I found a few nuggets, there was a lot of dross to plow through to get to the parts that answered my questions.While this book didn't do much for me, I can see how someone else might view it as the jackpot.  While it isn't much on the tactical, operational, or military strategic fronts, it is excellent on the political strategic and psychological framework of conflict.  Giap spends a lot of time laying out the arguments used to motivate the North Vietnamese Army, the guerrillas, and the peasants.  He discusses arguments to be directed at the enemy troops and citizens.I found Giap's constant verbal attacks on the United States both interesting and distracting.  No exaggeration; Giap could not mention the U.S. without a negative adjective or attribute in the same sentence.  What was telling was the more effective a given action by the U.S. the more venom was poured on.  To be fair, the U.S. had worked with Giap's boss, Ho Chi Minh, through World War II, and was ready to leave Ho in charge, but knuckled under to DeGaulle, when the French wanted Indochina back after the war.  Rather than risk the nascent NATO, the U.S. threw Vietnam under the French made bus.  But this also suggests that Giap's audience receptive to the demonizing of the U.S. and it served to reinforce the messaging Giap wanted.For me, this book was of limited value, but it is a primary source for the Vietnamese strategic thinking during the VIetnam war, so it is a historical document than should have great value to many scholars.E.M.

"Build Quality/DesignThe speaker itself is a basic compact rectangular design.The build quality is top notch!  Extremely solid, nothing loose or flims.  The weakest point is the grill/mesh but even then it's good enough for everyday use.  Made out of metal and not some cheap plastic.  I've used and traveled with it on my bag for a month now and it still looks new and nothing fell apart.It has a rubber strip of buttons on the top.  Mode, volume down/back track, phone call/play/pause, volume up/next track.  The bottons have a very nice tactile click to them and not mushy at all when pressing them.Functions/PerformanceSoundI've had cheapo Bluetooth speakers before such as targus and rocketfish but these sound soooo much better than those. I've heard a lot more expensive Bluetooth speakers such as UE Boom, Logitech and Beats pill and the anker more than keeps up with them.At max volume, it doesn't distort which is a very big deal as a lot of speakers have that problem. I was pleasantly surprised how loud and the quality when at full volume.There are 2 ways to raise the volume. First is on the phone/device itself and then on the speaker itself. So you set the speaker at highest volume, then adjust it via the device. However if you set it at the lowest volume on the phone, no matter if you press the volume up on the speaker the volume will not go up. Hope that makes sense.You can use it as a ""headset"" while making calls. If a call comes in a quick press of the ""play"" button answers the call. Holding the ""play"" button denies the call. The mic is best used within 3 feet. After the 3ft the quality drops. So don't expect to be able to use it from across the room or anything.***Note, you can set your phone to pick up calls via the phone instead of the speaker on the Bluetooth settings for the speaker**The battery has lasted all day with no problems.ConclusionFor the Price, it hard to not recommend this product.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R215GIKUI6361L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PK4DGO8#wasThisHelpful","R215GIKUI6361L","A3H0DIOS8X1I3L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3H0DIOS8X1I3L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"*Build Quality/Design*The unit itself is very simple and minimal.  Looks just like a flash drive; plug it in and its powers on*Functions/Performance*Setting up was a breeze. Initial sync was super easy and straight forward. Subsequent syncs took less than a second.Sound quality was very good, nothing ever choppy nor was there ever any dropped audio.While using it in the car for streaming music (Pandora, iheart, Spotify) was simply amazing.

"*Build Quality/Performance*Let me go ahead and mention that this thing is a beast.  Rated at 23000 is just ridiculous.  This is meant for true traveling warriors.  This thing has ability to charge youre laptop, tablet, phone and pretty much anything else you could think of.  Its about the size of my Nexus 7 (7 inch tablet).It has a nice two toned appearance.  A faux brushed metal look and a glossy finish.  It has a good look to it and feels like a premium product; which it should.Holding it in the hand, it definitely feels solid.  Nothing bends or creaks that would cause concern.  It has a nice little lcd screen telling you the exact percentage of charge left and the output voltage.  The voltage is more specifically if youre charging a laptop that has very specific needs.  9V/12V/16V/19V/20V are all selectable output voltages.  It pretty much has all the connectors for ever type of laptop you can think of, 10 in total.It also has 2 usb ports, a 1 amp and a 2.1 amp output.The thing about smaller capacity battery packs is that you end up charging the thing fairly often if you use it a lot.  With this.you probably would charge it once a week and thats with super heavy use throughout the week.I was able to charge my Nexus 7 and Nexus 5 at the same time with no problems.  I also charged many different combinations of phones and tablets comprising of Ipad 4 Retina, Nexus 7, Iphone 5, Nexus 5, Samsung Galaxy s2, S3 and Ipad mini.It take 2 whole days to pretty much go from 100% to 0% charging various devices.Nexus 5  63% > 100% = 851mahNexus 7  89% > 100% = 435mahIpad 4  52% > 100% = 5548mahNexus 5  89% >100% = 253mahIpad 4  87% >100% = 1502mahNexus 5  58%>100% = 966mahNexus 7  88%>100% = 474mahIpad 4 -59%>100% =  4739mahNexus 5 -0%>65% = 1495mahNexus 7  85%> 100% = 592mahIpad 4  86%>100% = 1618mahTotal MAH actually charged via devices = 1847318473/23000 = 80% efficiency of the battery to charge other devices.Basically 80% of 23000mah is actually useable.  Which is a really good % compared to other external battery packs.Also, it was able to charge my Lenovo Y510p laptop no problem but I didnt use it in the testing as I mostly used it when I was out and about.*Conclusion*If youre looking for something that small and portable to use around the city this probably isnt for you but if you fly all across the country and dont want to worry about any of your devices running out of juice or having to find a wall socket then this would be.  It is a monster of a battery pack meant to do serious work.  For the price of 100 bucks, the ability to charge me laptop and every other device is a no brainer.  Especially not having to worry if the battery is charged all the time.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQ7LHSKDQZVZ1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HFMUBYG#wasThisHelpful","RQ7LHSKDQZVZ1","A3H0DIOS8X1I3L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3H0DIOS8X1I3L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"*Mpow FreeGo*Over the course of the years Ive tried many, many Bluetooth headsets and VERY few lasted more than a few days of use.  A lot had poor performance, extremely uncomfortable or both.I travel a lot and sometimes its just cumbersome having to hold the phone when talking and trying to multitask.  So I gave the FreeGO a try and Im glad I did.*Performance/Build Quality*When first looking at the unit; I was worried it was going to be too heavy with the size but I was pleasantly surprised when picking it up.  Its a lot lighter than I expected.  Even though it was light weight it didnt feel cheap in the slightly.  Nothing flexed, or creaked to the point where I was worried about it falling apart.The unit itself has a two toned looked to it.  A shiny glossy part and matte soft rubber part.  The soft rubber part is what actually is in contact with your ear.  This makes it extremely comfortable to wear.  So comfortable that Id forget I had it on to be honest.  The silicone ear tip that creates a seal for sound doesnt really create a seal as the tip is oddly flat shaped.  Its not like the tips on earphones/earbuds where you would jam them in your ear canal.  It simply hovers over the opening.  This worried me at first that calls or sounds would be difficult to hear.  Once again it surprised me.  Calls still came in crystal clear, music sounded good and never missed a notification sound.  I think the odd shape and not shoving them in the ear canal is what makes the headset so comfortable.Can be used on either ear.  The earpiece has a 180 Degree Flip-boom arm for both left or right ear.  Which is really convenient depending which ear you want to use it on.The unit has 3 buttons: Volume up, volume down and answer call.  All were easy to access when worn and always responsive.  Pairing it to my phone or tablet was a cinch and took no longer than 2 minutes for initial pairing and subsequent pairings took seconds.Sound quality was just amazing.  Never did I feel like it wasnt clear.  The mic also performed superbly.  The person on the line never had a problem hearing me or asked me to speak louder.  What else can you ask for?Last; it stayed in place.  Im sure everyone had that headset that was just impossible to keep in place and you ended adjusting it all the time.  Not this one; I had it on the ENTIRE day and not once did I have to adjust it.*Packaging*It comes in a simple box.  Has 3 different ear tips, a small faux leather pouch and a micro usb cable (flat cable which is a nice touch).  The micro usb cable is of decent quality which is a plus in my book.  It did not come with a wall plug though.  So either use your phones or plug it into your computer to charge it.*Conclusion*Its a no brainer for me if youre looking for a great value Bluetooth headset.  Good performance, good price and comfortable.  Id recommend it to anyone.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3DW0JR4780B2I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ELCP55I#wasThisHelpful","R3DW0JR4780B2I","A3H0DIOS8X1I3L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3H0DIOS8X1I3L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Anker Portable Bluetooth 4.0 Speaker 4WManufacturer DescriptionExperience your tunes in high definition and surprising fullness realized through a 4W / 2in driver and bass port - outclassing other similar-sized portable speakers.Unrivalled 15 to 20-hour playtime powered by a built-in rechargeable 2100mAh Li-ion battery.Automatically connect to the last-connected device when turned on enables one-step music streaming. Compatible with all Bluetooth-enabled devices (2.1 and over). 3.5mm audio port for non-Bluetooth devices.Outstanding connection range of up to 33 feet. Built-in microphone with a 2-feet pickup range allows the speaker to double as a speaker phone.Package contents: Anker MP141 Portable Bluetooth Speaker, micro USB cable, 3.5mm audio cable, travel pouch, instruction manual. 18-month warranty and free lifetime technical support.Build Quality/DesignThe speaker itself is a basic compact cube design. Like recent Anker products, it's a two toned grippy matte black finish and dark gray. The matte finish is a finger print and oil magnet however.Its built like a tank as nothing loose or flimsy about it. The grill, unlike other speakers, doesn't seem to bend easily when pressing on it. The bottom has a rubber not slip pad so it won't move around so much. Holding it in hand, it has a great feel to it that just screams quality.The side had the micro usb charge port with LED indicator, power switch and the AUX port. The Aux port is for any device that doesn't have Bluetooth. You can attach said device with the supplied 3.5mm headphone cable. The front has three buttons; Volume up, Volume Down and Play. At the top front is a nice blue led power LED that's not annoyingly bright. Last, at the bottom of the front panel is a mic when picking up calls and such.LED indications:Side power Red LED:Blinking Red: low power (the speaker will also announce/say, ""battery low""""Steady solid red: chargingNo light: fully chargedFront Blue connectivity LED:Blinking Blue: pairing mode (device and speaker not connected yet)Solid Steady Blue: Speaker and device are connectedFunctions/PerformanceSoundI've had cheapo Bluetooth speakers before such as targus and rocketfish but these sound soooo much better than those. I've heard a lot more expensive Bluetooth speakers such as UE Boom, Logitech and Beats pill and the anker more than keeps up with them.At max volume, it doesn't distort which is a very big deal as a lot of speakers have that problem. I was pleasantly surprised how loud and the quality when at full volume.There are 2 ways to raise the volume. First is on the phone/device itself and then on the speaker itself. So you set the speaker at highest volume, then adjust it via the device. However if you set it at the lowest volume on the phone, no matter if you press the volume up on the speaker the volume will not go up. Hope that makes sense.You can use it as a ""headset"" while making calls. If a call comes in a quick press of the ""play"" button answers the call. Holding the ""play"" button denies the call. The mic is best used within 3 feet. After the 3ft the quality drops. So don't expect to be able to use it from across the room or anything.***Note, you can set your phone to pick up calls via the phone instead of the speaker on the Bluetooth settings for the speaker**To make a call, hold the ""play"" button until the Google Now prompts you to say the name of the person you want to call.The battery lasts up to 20hrs according to Anker, I'm currently around the 21hr mark and it's still going strong.ConclusionFor the Price, I seriously doubt there is a better Bluetooth speaker. Don't spend a fortune on other name brand speakers and get this one. Trust me, you will not be disappointed.*Note: Sample was given in return for an unbiased review**","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R25B5KZ5EY7TZE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GZC35YK#wasThisHelpful","R25B5KZ5EY7TZE","A3H0DIOS8X1I3L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3H0DIOS8X1I3L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've tried lots of portable speakers. Mostly of the ""budget"" category. Never bought beats, jambox or bose but usually went with the cheaper products. I have to say I was quite surprised by this speaker however.*Build Quality*It has a very rugged design that looks like an ""egg"". Holding it hand it has a good weight to it and feels rock solid. It looks like it could take some abuse from day to day use. Not once did I find anything flimsy or loose. It comes in two colors red and black.All it comes with is a micro-usb charge cable. Which is fine with me.*Performance*Just like the build quality the sound quality is top notch. I was pleasantly surprised by it. A lot of the cheaper bluetooth speakers of similar size sound thin and starts to distort when the volume is raised too high. The Taotronic has a very nice full sound with more bass than I was expecting. I don't think its been noticed but there seems to be two speakers in the unit! EDIT - conformed via Taotronics support. There is 2 speakers! One for highs and one for bass!One at the bottom facing up for the bass and a top speaker facing down for the highs. Please check the photos. I'll contact taotronics and find out.It has a built-in rechargeable battery. So far I've used it for about 5 hours and its still going strong on a relatively high volume.Connecting was breeze. Each subsequent connection is easy.I did try to use the phone mic feature and while it was good when speaking with 3ft; anything past that and its pretty useless.There is a aux 3.5mm jack if using an older mp3 player with no bluetooth.There is a toggle switch that has multiple uses. It can play the next song, previous song, stop and play. Holding it to the left will lower volume while holding it right will raise the volume.*Conclusion*The sound quality can not be beaten in the price range IMO. It will surprise you I believe. Don't expect it to outdo the larger bluetooth speakers that are 10 times the price.Note- I have been given a sample for a fair, unbiased review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R28LCK6HGP93A0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DG0SH7E#wasThisHelpful","R28LCK6HGP93A0","A3H0DIOS8X1I3L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3H0DIOS8X1I3L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Looking for a cheap bluetooth keyboard that's portable, decent build quality for a low price? This keyboard just might be for you.*Build Quality*Pros:lightweightgood tactile feel when typinglow profile and portableCons:plastic not metalquite a bit of flex in the bodyhas some battery rattle when shaking the keyboardThe plastic isn't really a con when you consider its only 14 bucks.The battery rattle was fixed by simply sticking a piece of paper between the battery cover and the battery.*Performance*Connection is quite easy. You need to connect to it and it will prompt you to enter a pass code to connect. Each time you pair it a new pass code will be generated. Since a new pass code is needed each time, you need to ""forget"" the keyboard each time and refind it. The extra hassle is a cumbersome but I Don't use keyboards with my tablet too often.It types real well with no noticeable lag between pressing the key and it showing up on the screen.Not all the shortcut keys work on the Nexus 7. Than again I'm using ParanoidRom.*Conclusion*For the low price of 14 bucks, it seems like a no brain if you will casually use a keyboard for those rare moments you need to get serious work done on your tablet.

"Let's start off by saying I spend a LOT of time at my desk.  Doing paperwork, on the computer, listening to music and everything else.  And I never found a desk lamp that I really liked and always ended up going back to the main light in the room.  Until now that is.*Design/Build Quality*The design has a modern look, with clean sharp edges, simplistic and unobtrusive.  It has a great glossy black finish that goes well with most electronics.  It can be folded in a upon itself to take even less room.  When put in various positions, it never went out of position.  Meaning that the lamp didn't start drooping or sagging or shifting from the position I placed it in.  Which some lamps have a habit of doing.You can bend and position the lamp in almost any manner to get the best light for you.  It has 3 settings on light temperature.  The temp determines how white or yellow the light will be.  Which I like.  Some people prefer older halogen bulbs with a yellow tint and some prefer fluorescent white lighting.The brightness can also be adjusted.  Within each of the 3 preset light temps.  There's even a sleep timer button to automatically turn off.Last, a usb port for charging phones, mp3 players, tablets can be found on the base of the lamp.  Which is find really convenient.*Conclusion*For the money being saved in electricity, the convenience and features it has.  To me this buy is a no brainer.

"So I have a lot of those universal Docks for tablets, phones and mp3 players that require a a 3.5mm jack.  And while the docks are good quality and nothing wrong with them, they aren't as convenient as a bluetooth dock.  I also have an A/V reciever that doesn't have a built in bluetooth module.  This little guy comes and saves that day!First,  Let's talk about accessories!  This guy has everything you would need to connect it to pretty much anything.  It's has a standard aux cable (3.5mm to 3.5mm headphone plugs), also a 3.5mm to rca to connect to A/V receivers.I can connect it to my reciever, unplug some connections, connect it to my car and not miss a step.Yes, the module doesn't automatically turn on bluetooth pairing mode when you turn on your car, AV receiver or whatever else you're trying to connect to But thats the trade off you get for not buying the equipment with bluetooth built in.

It's not the conventional bulb where light shines everywhere but great for lamps that shine up or light fixtures that shine down.I placed them in corner lamps and hard to reach lamps.

"After getting my Nexus 5 and getting spoiled with wireless charging, it was quite troublesome to charge via a usb cable when using my s3 as a secondary phone.  So I wanted to get a wireless receiver to go along with the Nexus 5.*PackagingNot much to talk about here, simple box containing the unit with a small plastic wrap inside.  No frills.*Build QualityThe receiving tag is very thin, I can't compare it to others but im guessing they are all comparable.  I had no problems putting the back cover on.  There wasn't a huge bulge were the tag is.  There is a slight bump but you would really have to be trying to feel for it to notice its even there.*PerformaceUsing my Ravpower Qi Charger it detected the tag instantly.  There wasn't any time where I had trouble with getting the S3 to start charging.  It didn't get any warmer than usual when charging with a usb cable.I have a Diztronic case on my S3 and it charged it just fine through the case.  I've tried other cases such as the ZooGue case had the same results.*ConclusionFor a mere 10 bucks, its sort of a no brainer for the convenience of wireless charging.

"Build Quality/DesignLooking at it; it looks similar to their larger full size charger with their non-slip grey ring and glossy white top.  Playing with it in hand; I couldn't find anything loose and creeks when pulling/pushing on it.  It's fairly light weight, but not so much where it feels like a toy.  It has a good solid feel to it.Like it's bigger older brother, it doesn't have any non slip rubber feet at the bottom.  So it slides around fairly easily.  It's quite compact and intended to be a travel buddy especialy with its attached cord that wraps around the body for storage.  For those with a smaller work space/table/desk this is for you as its less than half the size of the full sized charger.It does have a charging indicator LED thats red when its not charging and Green when it is.Performance/TestingI could write down the numbers but lets just say it charged my Nexus 5 and Nexus 7 as fast as its full sized brother.Another thing, if you have a battery pack, you can attach it'll charge your phone through qi just fine.  I know I know, why not just connect the battery pack to the phone?  Well some people don't like connecting the the micro usb to often as it cant be damaged and doing so would eliminate that risk.ConclusionThis is a great little compact Qi charger that won't take that much space that works just as well as the bigger ful size chargers.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3VC4XUEVOQIE0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GN5U5N8#wasThisHelpful","R3VC4XUEVOQIE0","A3H0DIOS8X1I3L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3H0DIOS8X1I3L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This book has a lot of good pieces to it and the premise is solid. There is one for each country in the world. These pages includes interesting facts and high quality pictures. So, why three stars and not four or five? Because some of the choices for focus really have me scratching me head! One example - using the limited space for the country of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines to include a picture of Johnny Depp as Jack Sparrow and including a short paragraph of Captain Jack Sparrow being marooned on the island twice. Really? There are also pictures of a couple honeymooning on the island - again, really? Instead of focusing on the actual people of the country we focus on tourists and movies? Letting kids know Rihananna is from Barbados is fine, but Johnny Depp - really? Another head scratcher is Brittany Spears being profiled on the pages for the country of Somalia! Why? Because Somali pirates were blasts by ships playing a Brittany Spears song by the Royal Navy.

"This book was really well done. Let's start reading level. This book will be independently readable for any child reading at the 4th grade level or higher. As far as content, I would put this in the tween/early teen category. I might not want my 8 year olds reading it, but it would make a good booklist for the 5th - 8th grade group.I don't want to give away too much of story, but the premise is bullying has consequences, not only for the bully - but for the person being bullied. The message is appropriate - find someone you trust that can help you get through the hard parts of life, of which bullying is unfortunately a part. I want to say if I put myself in the category of a very depressed tween/teen - this book might lead me to be even more depressed because at least these three kids (and one ghost kid) found their ""tribe"" and I might still feel all alone. So, this isn't a story to cheer up a child that currently needs counseling, but, it is a great book for kids that might be entering into the fray of very confusing emotions.All in all a good book.

"I am a solid ""medium"" and normally wear a size 8 petite. I am 5 feet tall, so these pants were definitely too long. However, they aren't marketed as petite, so I didn't take any stars off for that. It is kind of weird, but while these pants fit - I felt ""fat"" in them. I know they are yoga pants, so I should be worried about working out rather than looking good - but I really hated the way I looked in these pants.I roll down portion at the top worked, but it might get annoying after a while. The material felt absolutely wonderful - very soft against the skin. If I didn't feel like a fat blog in the pants, I would wear them all day. I guess the reason why I was so taken aback by how I felt in the pants was that I recently actually lost 16 pounds and almost 20 inches, including 8 inches from my waist. My waist is now in the ""healthy"" range. I had been pulling on everything in my closet and going to the store feeling like a rock star - even in yoga pants type of clothing. So, I am not sure what it is about the cut of these pants the pulls out every hideous feature left for me to overcome. I may also be that because I am so short, I need a pant made just for petite women.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1O0D7E7LOBD0D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00U359JOK#wasThisHelpful","R1O0D7E7LOBD0D","A1FDVT0DLJWV78","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1FDVT0DLJWV78?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Another great project from Playmobil. The kit has 68 pieces total. Another thing that I really like about this toy is the attention to details. There are so many intricate pieces that help to make the vehicle very interactive. While this is a themed toy, it works even if kids aren't really into the show, we had never seen the show, but the kids were still really interested in the vehicle.I will say that playmobil pieces are very small, so I would not recommend this to people with little ones in the house. Stick with the age recommendation of 5+, because there are a number of small pieces that would be chocking hazards for toddlers.The reason for 4 instead of 5 stars is definitely the size. Some pieces are so small that I know if dropped they will be gone forever as they would not be found and would be vacuumed up with ease (never to be found again). Overall a really neat toy.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RYI4W3S1QBYJ6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VLVOIJG#wasThisHelpful","RYI4W3S1QBYJ6","A1FDVT0DLJWV78","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1FDVT0DLJWV78?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This kit was really well done and fun to use. The favorite activity was growing the crystal tree - it actually got amazingly big. Is started to grow within a few hours, but reached full bloom after a couple of days. The crystals started to fall off after about 5 days which was also neat, kind of mimicking the thawing of a tree in winter (the crystals grew white).This would be a great hands on activity for a history unit or just a fun toy to pass the time on a weekend. The included wooly mammoth is very real to life in details.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3J2EWQ1S1FPQT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0039N4JAC#wasThisHelpful","R3J2EWQ1S1FPQT","A1FDVT0DLJWV78","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1FDVT0DLJWV78?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am really frustrated with this kit because it was so close to being perfect, but the things that were wrong made me so angry I took off 2 stars. Let me start by saying the kit is well made, the pieces are great, they are really good quality wood. The kit comes with a nice book on Modern and Post-Modern Architecture. This is where the first start was deducted. While the booklet introduces kids to many styles of architecture and gives really neat details, there are only plans for building 2 styles with the pieces in the kit! Why show kids all these neat forms of architecture with no instruction on how to take this pile of blocks to these beautiful designs? Yes, blocks should encourage free play. However, there is also something to be said for being able to duplicate a beautiful design.Included in the kit is a packet for ""ArchiQuest University"" and where the kit lost yet another star. Why? You are supposed to go to a website where you can become enrolled in a ""University"" and master different levels of architecture knowledge. You can earn the levels of apprentice, mason, master mason, architect, and master architect. Why did I take off the star? There is supposed to be a student I.D. number on the card so you can get access to the university. Well, guess what? Where the number ""should"" have been stamped was blank!!!! Now, this made me particularly angry because my 8 year old son really has a strong interest in architecture. He is currently taking a beginner's course and this would have been a great supplement. We were both so excited for him to start this journey we could hardly contain ourselves. Then we sat there looking at a blank spot where the I.D. number ""should"" have been. I went to the website anyway and while there is a lot of good general information on the card, yup - no access to the information for the ""university"" without a student I.D. number. So, learning about fascinating history of architecture, its language, secret symbols, and incredible feats of engineering. Using you knowledge and building and an amazing 3-D program, creating and building your own architectural structures. And on, and on, and on with all the really neat, really cool, really amazing things that can be done to take this kit from a pile of blocks to true architecture - gone, because someone forgot to actually print an I.D. number on the card!!!","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R36U55M7GRJ9I2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003Y5B764#wasThisHelpful","R36U55M7GRJ9I2","A1FDVT0DLJWV78","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1FDVT0DLJWV78?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a great little kit to allow a kid an opportunity to explore CSI work. You get to solve 3 crimes using various methods, including reading fingerprints.

The major experiments are: Balancing Nail Puzzle, Salt and Marble Challenge, Balloon in a Bottle.

"Let me start by saying I did not use this headphone set for gaming purposes, I used it in an online classroom setting. Granted, one class was actively using Minecraft, but still nothing close to using the headset for Halo or another type of intensive gaming experience.I will compare these headphones with another high quality headphone set, Logitech and found they are similar in quality. The headset is comfortable and can be used for children as well as adults (used with an 8 year old boy and an 8 year old girl). Sound came through clearly and evenly. There are a lot of options with these headphones, but the use isn't intuitive for first timers like myself. There is a quick guide that comes with the headphones with separate instructions for PS4, Xbox One, and PC/Mac use.I used the headphones with a Mac. You will be plugging the headphones into the amplifier, then plugging the amplifier into the Mac for charging. All of the cables needed for the Mac were included.The sound is crisp and the headphones are comfortable. However, they are also a bit heavy and I for me I can't imagine long term use. However, true gamers may be used to this weight for quality and might not mind. I actually liked the padded covering on the mic, it didn't affect the output and I think it is great when things get intense - especially for a braces wearing 8 year old who got a little excited in Minecraft and bumped the mic with her mouth - padding equals no broken braces components.The headphones are supposed to be able to be used for 30 hours on a single charge, I have tested this with 30 hours of use just yet. The virtual surround sound was pretty awesome and definitely something my Logitect headphones couldn't deliver.All in all I think these are great. Might be a bit of overkill for the none gamer, but it may just transform a none gamer into a gamer because these things really do make you feel like you are ""in"" the action","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1WVD4B77QLNVM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YXO5V3U#wasThisHelpful","R1WVD4B77QLNVM","A1FDVT0DLJWV78","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1FDVT0DLJWV78?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I keep this cord with me as a backup so I don't have to take my factory charger from the house when traveling. I also like that it is black, easy to sport.

"I received a Tea Beyond flowering pot as well as a 12 pack of the Fab Flowering Blooms Tea in exchange for an honest review.I'll be honest, I'm I'm not a huge tea connoisseur and have never tried a product like this before, so if you are someone who drinks tea often and/or have tried many different kinds of flowering teas, then my review probably won't be helpful to you. But if you are someone who was enticed by trying something new, and the beautiful presentation of the product, then this is the review for you.The pot itself is beautiful and is nicely put together so that the bloom fits in the inner chamber while the water can defuse out to the rest of the pot. You can also refill the pot to make more tea from one flower.I love the fact that not only is it easy to do, but it's really aesthetically pleasing. You put the bloom in the inner chamber, fill it with boiling water, and watch it bloom. It unfolds in less than a minute and the color of the water becomes a nice amber color. That part itself was entertaining, to be able to see the flower spread in the water, not to mention beautiful.Then the tea itself has a wonderful subtle flavor, tasting of flower and delicate nature.

"I was given this book from the author in exchange for an honest review.Monster Boy by Ruth Sinclair is a refreshing indie middle grade read. I have been sent several indie reads by authors recently and was starting to feel disheartened by the quality of work I had been given. But then Sinclair, who had written the wonderful City of Silver Light, approached me, and I knew I had to give her book a try. And I'm delighted to say that I had a big smile on my face even after the first few pages.Monster Boy stars Zach, who seems to have an ideal middle class life-- he is an only child with parents who adore him, he gets treats whenever he wants, and let's face it, he's pretty spoiled. He goes to school where he's not super popular, but has a best friend Ryder who is a loyal sidekick. The way the first few pages read, it feels like he's almost Dudley Dursley from the Harry Potter series, but gets to star in his own book. But soon, his world gets turned on its head. The town lies adjacent to a town full of foul smelling gas and monsters, only separated by a wall. The mayor decides to tear down part of the wall in a Grand Gesture, but realizes quickly that this is a mistake. Meanwhile, Zach's parents decide they want to adopt a new child, and this is Morton, a monster boy that has come over from the other side and has been placed in an orphanage, and in a sinister turn of events, children in Zach's town start to go missing. Will Zach be able to overcome his jealousy for Morton and be able to figure out what's going on in his town?There is so much more depth in this book than I can do justice to in a few lines of synopsis. I love how the parents play such a pivotal role in this book and serve as such good role models for tolerance and standing up for what's right. I also love Zach's character development throughout the book as he realizes that maybe his preconceptions of what ""monster"" mean aren't right at all. Morton himself is a complex character that intrigued me and has his own arc. The writing is completely delightful and is reminiscent of the style of JK Rowling or E. Nesbitt in the way that it starts off-- the mayor being kind of a foppish caricature, and even Zach as well. But the whole book takes on a whole new level after the halfway point. The end has a series of twists that completely threw me off guard in the best way possible, and ended in the only way it should have.My only concerns is that this book is extremely long, but it does a lot in the space it has. Sometimes the pacing gets dragged down in the middle, but never enough for me to put the book down for good. I always wanted to come back to it and see what happens to Morton and Zach.Overall, a wonderfully written indie MG fantasy that has wonderful lessons about tolerance, growing up, and the importance of family and friendship.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R34P03MH5JIWN5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MZK7C72#wasThisHelpful","R34P03MH5JIWN5","A3RAIR289B2A84","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RAIR289B2A84?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These compression socks really work and they have been very durable so far going through several washes in the machine. They are about as comfortable as compressions socks can get, and the nude color makes them practically invisible, which is nice. Because they are thick stockings, they do get hot in the summer, but I don't know how that would be avoided. Because of the socks, I can fit into my shoes and get through the day with my feet a pretty normal size. It usually helps with pain in my feet as well from the swelling on most days.

"I ordered this dress initially in large. I received it and was really excited because the style is super cute with sleeves, which is really hard to find, in addition to it being for nursing, which obviously is great. But for some reason there is a weird puckering on my body on both sides with the pleat they have sown in and it also flares off my body on my backside, which is really unflattering and makes me look lopsided. On the model in the picture for Amazon, you see that it fits perfectly, but I would have to safety pin either side to make it look flattering like the picture, and the thought of spending the money to just have to alter or ""fix"" it each time didn't make sense.

"I really enjoyed the Testing, the first book in this trilogy because of the fast paced plotting, the great protagonist, and the puzzles she has to go through.The second has Cia at the University being tested in other ways. She doesn't remember anything that happened during the Testing, but she knows it wasn't good. While she struggles with that, she has to do everything in her power to get through the extensive hazing in her group to score the best internship and avoid being kicked out of University. As usual, secrets pile upon secrets, and it's up to Cia to figure out what's going on before it's too late.Like the first book, this isn't a perfect book-- the writing is not polished and Cia does seem a bit too perfect as a protagonist. She thinks of everything and there are no negative consequences to her decisions because she always makes the right one. That said, there's something so addictive about these books. I can't put them down once I start reading because the puzzles that Cia goes through are fascinating, and I'm a sucker for puzzles. These are clearly Charbonneau's strength. Don't expect a compelling romance between her and Tomas. It's never been the strong point of these books, and Charbonneau herself says that she's not good with romance. It didn't bother me though because the rest of her book is so compelling.Overall, a strong sequel to the first installment, and this had me eagerly awaiting the final book in the trilogy.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3GMZVUUO0Z7FH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AUZS6KG#wasThisHelpful","R3GMZVUUO0Z7FH","A3RAIR289B2A84","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RAIR289B2A84?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I received a copy from the author in exchange for an honest review. Thanks!Dirty Little Secret by Jennifer Echols is the first book I've read by this author, but she's been on my to read list for a while now! This book stars Bailey, a girl who has grown up with music-- in fact, her whole family has been in the country music business. The problem is-- she was a duo with her sister, but her sister made it big and she hasn't. Now she's stuck behind while her sister is touring and has been told by her parents that she can't play music. Of any kind. This all changes when she meets a boy, Sam, who wants her to join his band. She can't resist him or playing the fiddle with his band. Will Bailey be able to figure out what she wants for herself and stop lingering in anger in her sister's shadow?There were so many things about this book I loved. Highest on the list was the authenticity of Bailey in her music groups. Every time I read a description, I almost shouted, ""YES!"" I also have perfect pitch, and the way Bailey described it, was absolutely true. It's almost a curse and painful when you hear an off note. I loved all the scenes with the band, but probably my absolute favorite part was the end, when Bailey's sister comes back into the picture and we see some interactions with her family. The prose is well written, and I definitely am going to pick up more of Echols books!I have two main issues with this book. One was the decision about how her relationship with Sam would go. I totally get this, but it was hard for me to like him as a love interest. But actually, this was not the problem, as it was pretty realistic as to how it all played out-- I just wish that Bailey reacted a bit differently to the situation. Secondly, I didn't understand what was going on with her parents AT ALL. I wanted to know more about her relationship with her parents separately and most of all, her sister. They are absent except for her remembering the past until the very end and at that point, it's almost too late to make an impact because we don't understand their relationship at all. I think part of the problem is that what Bailey did to ostracize herself was held back as an eventual reveal, but I didn't think it was too much of a twist. In fact, the magnitude of it was so small, that it made her parents seem like actual villains. I don't think they are, and I'm not sure Echols actually intended it that way.Overall, a beautifully written read with very authentic scenes in music and a terrific main character!","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2D45KVK88MIH1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009K5LIA2#wasThisHelpful","R2D45KVK88MIH1","A3RAIR289B2A84","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RAIR289B2A84?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I award this book 4.5 stars.I really enjoyed the first two books in this trilogy and this last installment doesn't disappoint. Ludaina is on the brink of war and Charlie has to go on a harrowing journey to try to stop it from happening. Once again Charlie doesn't trust Max, which rubs me the wrong way. But he forgives her, so I try to do the same. That said, the rest of the book is so flipping good that I quickly forget about that fact. The pacing is great, the characters are solid, and the conclusion is satisfying. This is one rare trilogy that will stay on my shelf.

"I really enjoyed The Pledge a while back, and knew I had to get my hands on the sequel. The Essence takes place right where the Pledge ends. We quickly learn that Charlie didn't come out of the Pledge as unscathed as we thought. We quickly get sucked into Charlie's new life as queen. Traitors are in their midst and Charlie has to maneuver through treacherous waters.I really enjoyed this installment-- once again, Derting has wonderful writing that kept me captivated with good pacing. The characters are intriguing, and Charlie is likeable, even though she seems a little too willing to play the martyr. The biggest issue that I had was the fact that Charlie isn't honest with Max about the presence of Sabara. And this is one of the biggest plot points in the book. This decision just didn't make any sense to me-- doesn't she trust him?Other than that, however, it's a fun read that kept me engaged and wanting to figure out how Charlie was going to get out of her sticky situation. I definitely wanted to read the final installment after I finished this one!","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RMJU72SV303OP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005C7BQAE#wasThisHelpful","RMJU72SV303OP","A3RAIR289B2A84","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RAIR289B2A84?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought this book at a Dark Days signing because Kimberly Derting's introduction of the book really piqued my interest-- plus, I really love her entire Pledge trilogy! So I knew I had to get my hands on it. Man, I'm glad I did because it's my current favorite of her works.The Taking by Kimberly Derting stars Kyra, who at the beginning of the book just won a key softball game. But while on the way home, arguing with her dad about going off to college with her longtime boyfriend instead of pursuing her own dreams, she leaves the car and suddenly in the flash of bright light, she's 5 years later in the future. Everything has changed. Her parents are no longer together, her father's been chasing aliens ever since she left, and now her mom has remarried and had a new kid. Kyra can't remember a thing about the past 5 years, and honestly, she feel exactly as if the softball game was yesterday. Then, there's the matter of the boy next door... Will Kyra be able to sort things out before it's too late?I loved this book so much. It's fast paced from the opening of the first chapters. You may think I spoiled you a lot, but all of this happens in the first chapter and a half. And it doesn't slow down one iota from there. Derting has lovely prose and she puts it to good use here. And then the relationship with Tyler. There are issues with it, sure, and I am doubtful that no one in her life would be weirded out by it-- but when they are together in the book, I forget about all of that (and so does Kyra), and sparks fly. I don't think I've had a true book boyfriend before, but this guy... yeah. He's the one :-)I thought Derting handled the characters really well, and their reactions to all the events made a lot of sense. She combines some sci fi and paranormal elements to the story, and it doesn't distract but adds to the story. The book feels like a complete first chapter, but it does end in a cliffhanger unfortunately, because now I'm dying to get my hands on the next one.Overall, a must read, paranormal YA which will keep you simultaneously swooning and on the edge of your seat as you race to the finish!","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZYTFOURCIH78/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FJ37ETI#wasThisHelpful","RZYTFOURCIH78","A3RAIR289B2A84","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RAIR289B2A84?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There's just something about Emmy Laybourne and the way she writes. I don't even know if there was really the typical formula of the inciting event, climax, etc. I just know that she writes in a pulse pounding kind of way, a way in which I can't put down her books.I loved the first one, which some people say doesn't have a plot. I see what they are saying, but it's such a window into a psychologically tense situation that I didn't care-- I stayed up late into the night reading it. The second I still enjoyed but not as much because the world suddenly got really big and we lost some of the claustrophobia that made the first book so good. This final book takes the best of both books and gives us an ending we'll never forget.I was really satisfied with the ending and the alternating perspectives of Dean and... well, I won't tell you who the other person is, because in a way, it's a spoiler. Just know that this third and final installment doesn't disappoint.Overall, a terrific and harrowing ending to the Monument 14, and becomes one of the rare trilogies that works as a whole.

"I've only read a few books by Kelley Armstrong, but this high fantasy seemed right up my alley.Sea of Shadows stars two twin girls, Moria and Ashyn who have been destined since birth to be Keeper and Seeker of their town. They each have an animal companion as well. The story alternates between their perspectives in third person. Something horrible happens that separates them near the beginning of the story, after Ashyn's trek into the Forest of the Dead, and during their journey back together, sinister and fantastical things continue to happen. Will they find their way back together and piece together what has happened to their town?I thought this book was well written, and honestly, I've liked it better than the other books I've read by Armstrong. Her craft has definitely improved. Of the two girls, I liked Moria more, because Ashyn comes off a little too dainty and hesitant, and just plain naive. I guess I was a bit surprised at that because you'd think that Moria would have educated her a bit better! I liked their animal companions, and the two love interests were passable. The pace was a bit slow for me, but the writing and plot were solid and kept me going. I'm definitely going to pick up the next installment as I'd like to see where she's taking this.Overall, a solid start to a fantasy with some intriguing characters and plot points.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R36RZEGG544ZJF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DB2WQ6A#wasThisHelpful","R36RZEGG544ZJF","A3RAIR289B2A84","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RAIR289B2A84?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I just finished reading The Archived, another one of Schwab's books, and knew I had to pick up Vicious, which has been on the favorite book of the year list for many of my fellow bloggers. They were right.Vicious by V.E. Schwab is told mostly from the perspective of Victor, who was college best friends with Eli. Victor and Eli dabbled in finding out why some people were E.O. (ExtraOrdinary) with out of this world paranormal powers. Quickly, they discover that near death experiences are important to this, and Eli and Victor cross ethical boundaries in order to find out more.It's so difficult to distill this book into a few synopsis sentences because the book jumps from past to present and back again. Victor is now much older, having had just gotten out of prison, and he's determined to find Eli and kill him. There are secrets upon secrets that hang in the balance, and each is revealed in its due time.The book is dark, twisted, and fabulous in so many ways. Every single character in this book is neither totally good or bad. They actually might all be called villains in some sense of the word. Each of them has reasons for doing what they are doing. You have one character who is doing the ""right"" things for the completely wrong reasons. You have a character doing the wrong thing to try to do the right thing, and you have others who drift along for the ride because they aren't sure what to do. It's such a clever foray into the realm of the anti-hero, and you can't put the book down until you see it out to its ending.Overall, a thrilling ride that makes you question what makes a hero and is a pitch perfect portrayal of insight into the blurred lines of gray between right and wrong. It's a must read.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2B0F4M4P8V1AN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CQY7WBI#wasThisHelpful","R2B0F4M4P8V1AN","A3RAIR289B2A84","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RAIR289B2A84?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I won this book in a giveaway.I've been very interested in reading this book for a while because the premise seemed so intriguing to me. The book is focused on the perspective of Parker, who can't get a good night of sleep because he also gets sucked into the dreams of the person he's looked straight in the eye last in the day. Something about being actively in someone else's dreams prevents him from getting enough sleep. As you might imagine, this causes havoc in his daily life and it becomes clear that he's going to die if he doesn't figure a way out of his situation. There's a new girl at school who he looks at and realizes that night that he is able to sleep within her dreams because they are so simple and straightforward. This leads to him having to stalk her to prevent his own death but then realizes that she is getting death threats from someone else, but when Parker realizes that he doesn't remember everything during the day...maybe... just maybe, it's him.It's definitely a good premise, and I like the idea behind the story. But even though it's understandable how desperate Parker is to stay alive and the fact he'll do anything to stay alive, the stalkerish nature of how he's following this girl all the time is just too creepy. I'm not sure how it could have happened differently, but it made it hard to like Parker as a protagonist. He did redeem himself in the last 20% of the book, but I just couldn't reconcile how he was at the beginning with how he was at the end. However, the end was interesting, so I do think I'd like to see how this will play out in PARANOIA the next book.Overall, interesting premise with some great side characters, but the protagonist was at times difficult to like and his actions hard to get over.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RP97MGEUIKLUR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CS73IHA#wasThisHelpful","RP97MGEUIKLUR","A3RAIR289B2A84","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RAIR289B2A84?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I actually tried to read this book one time before, but couldn't get into it. I thought it was because I wasn't actually in the mood to read at the time, and that is probably a factor for sure. But The Forest of Hands and Teeth is undoubtedly beautifully written with some terrific turn of phrase, and it's clear to me that Carrie Ryan can write. That said, this book just didn't affect me the way I hoped it would. I award this book 2.5 stars.The Forest of Hands and Teeth by Carrie Ryan is about a zombie apocalypse although the word ""zombie"" is never uttered in the book. Mary, the main character, is in bad straits-- she lives in this awful world, her father is missing and likely dead, her mother has lost her mind in grief and gets bitten in the first chapter, her brother pretty much disowns her, and the boy she loves gets engaged to her best friend. Now because no one has spoken for her, including Harry, the brother of Travis, her true love, she is destined to be cloistered away in a convent for the rest of her life. OK so this is the gloomy beginning of her story, and I don't blame her for wanting to run away.But the book, while eloquently written, drags. We get stuck in limbo for a long time. There's action no doubt, but I'm not sure that Mary herself really changes much. I feel like how she is at the beginning (rebellious and selfish), is how she is at the end (rebellious and selfish). She doesn't really care about anyone or anything except herself, and while I get it (see above), it doesn't make me like her that much or want to root for her. There are several moments where I think she'll be bitten, and I'm ok with it. Mary has this preoccupation with the sea after her mom has talked about it her entire life. And she's determined to find it no matter who gets killed along the way. While Mary isn't the most likeable character, I don't really like any of the rest of the cast either. They include a whiny best friend, a guy who loves her and is determined to have her even if it makes everyone else miserable, a brother who has been crappy to her and then suddenly expects compassion, and a wishy washy love interest that doesn't communicate. I had to flip quickly to the end to see what happens, and if it's at all possible, I was more disappointed than I thought I could have been.Overall, a lackluster book with beautiful writing, but unlikeable characters and a dragging plot without any growth in the characters or plot twists. I would look elsewhere.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2HM46XME07OS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001NLL27K#wasThisHelpful","R2HM46XME07OS","A3RAIR289B2A84","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RAIR289B2A84?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've had this on my TBR list for quite some time now, and now that the companion novel is coming out soon, I knew I'd better read this one first. I was completely floored by this book and emotionally spent.Not a Drop to Drink is a tough dystopian YA read about Lynn, who defends her little house and the pond, the source of their water, with her mother. They have tough days purifying their water to protect themselves from cholera and other waterbourne diseases that have been plaguing the rest of the country. From the first pages, we get the immediate sense that Lynn has been taught to shoot trespassers on sight, no questions asked. It's a harsh world, and Lynn knows that their water supply is a precious resource that is worth killing for. But tragedy occurs, and Lynn has to adapt her life in ways she never imagined. She has to be able to trust strangers, and try to change her very black and white mode of thinking. When a little girl, Lucy, comes into her life, everything changes.I know a lot of people thought this book drags a lot in the beginning, but honestly, the way it was written, I was hooked from the start. It almost reads like one of those old Westerns you see, but with tough women being at the heart. Lynn is a great protagonist, and her character development is gradual but totally believable. The description is beautiful, and the story is haunting and emotionally devastating. I thought the pace was perfect and as more is revealed in her little world, each step is deliberate and perfectly placed. The side characters were also really wonderful, especially her next door neighbor and the spunky little Lucy. By the end, you want Lynn to protect her new little family just as much as she does. The choices she has to make and the events that unfold in the last 100 pages just made my heart clench and I know this story will stay with me for days.Overall, a beautifully written and believable dystopian YA that will drain you emotionally, but will be worth the ride, because it really is that good.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R9UCCIQYOQOH6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BATIJYE#wasThisHelpful","R9UCCIQYOQOH6","A3RAIR289B2A84","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RAIR289B2A84?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've loved both The Archived and Vicious, so I knew I had to get my hands on The Unbound as soon as I could. It was absolutely fabulous like its predecessors.We return to the story and reunite with the protagonist Mackenzie, who is still on thin ice with the Archive, and her sexy love interest and partner in crime Wes. But the first thing she has to tackle is... her new school. And it sounds totally cliche, but I really enjoyed all of the scenes at her school, because there's a nice balance between the paranormal and the normal. We get introduced to another possible love interest, Cash, as well as other interesting side characters. At the same time, people that Mac has been interacting with suddenly start disappearing and she's the only link between the missing people. Not to mention she's been having blackouts where she is missing time. Can Mac figure out what's going on before she loses both of her lives at the Archive and at home?I love love loved this book. I possibly loved it more than the Archived because there is so much more at stake, and new great characters. The writing is gorgeous as always, and the pacing superb. I literally couldn't put it down and stayed up two nights reading it instead of sleeping like I should have been! I love the world building, and how we learn more about the structure of the Archive. I do have a soft spot for Cash (I totally would have crushed on him myself!), but Wes is a much better fit for Mac. You'll see who she picks.Overall, a superb second entry in the Archived series. There's much more to explore so I wouldn't be surprised if there is another installment when Mac becomes Crew. That said, these two can stand alone as a duology, and will entice readers for years to come.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3NQCD8FIQ4YJR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CXXEWZQ#wasThisHelpful","R3NQCD8FIQ4YJR","A3RAIR289B2A84","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RAIR289B2A84?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I had mixed feelings about the first book, Sweet Evil, because the protagonist was a bit too sweet and perfect. But I'm glad I made it through because in the last 20% things got more interesting, so I figured I'd pick up the second when I got a chance.Sweet Peril starts a bit after Sweet Evil. Big events have happened at the end of the last book and because of them Anna and Kaidan have been torn apart. We get to learn more about Kopano and what Anna might play in the future fight between good and evil. But will she be able to fight her undeniable attraction to Kaiden and fight against her own temptations to achieve what she needs to?I enjoyed this installment a lot more than its predecessor. Anna has more edge, has to deal with the fact that she has her own temptations, and that a lot of the world is shades of grey not black and white like she initially thought. We learn more about each of the characters, and I ended up liking Kaidan a lot more in this book as well. I really love the twins in London, who we see occasionally, and some new characters are intriguing. The middle of the book drags a bit, but we get enough character development to keep my interest. I really need to get my hands on the last book!","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RWQRIFZ2YT6MX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009NGHNOI#wasThisHelpful","RWQRIFZ2YT6MX","A3RAIR289B2A84","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RAIR289B2A84?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I won this ARC from a blog giveaway, thanks! This has probably been my favorite read in the past few weeks, but I couldn't give it five stars for issues that I couldn't ignore.The Testing by Joelle Charbonneau has been on my list to read for a long time. It's been compared to the Hunger Games, and stars Cia, who is in one of the colonies who have not had any candidates selected for The Testing in a long time. The Testing has been put in place after war has devastated the world to find the best candidate leaders of the country to go to University. No one in Cia's town knows much about The Testing except for her own father, who refuses to speak about it. Cia is chosen with three other people in her class, and she starts a difficult and treacherous journey where either death or glory can await.I admit I was really into this book. Cia is a great main character-- she's humble, gracious, and has a good heart. But at the same time, she is super intelligent and has obviously been trained well by both her school and her father. Other reviewers have mentioned that she may be too perfect, at least in the sense of being able to do things and always being right for the most part, at least about her instincts on traps and puzzles. I agree. It would have been nice to see other characters contribute as well. They obviously were smart enough to get there.Some reviewers were upset with how ""boring"" the testing part was, but actually, I loved that part. I really enjoyed  the section where Cia figures out something key that allows her to pass to the next test and thought it was pretty clever. The test revealed something about several of the characters. I did think it was odd that even though her father gave her the warning not to trust anyone, she seems to have developed a sixth sense suspicion, which seems almost too good to be true. I also liked the descriptions of the other tests. It shows what kinds of things Cia is good at before she gets tested further in the third portion of the test.The journey Cia takes with her love interest, Tomas, from thereon out was gripping, and I wanted to know what each of the characters were hiding. I was definitely surprised by some of the outcomes. This was the first book in a while that I was contemplating buying the next book on Kindle immediately to see what happens next.That said, other than the issues I alluded to above, there were a couple of other problems. I agree with others that the love connection between Cia and Tomas seems kind of quick and unbelievable. There are ""hints"" to the past, about looking longingly at each other during a dance, but we never see that, so we never really feel for them and root for them. And lastly, the world building isn't perfect. I definitely don't get why people have to die during the Testing. And what happens to the people who fail? It isn't clear what happens to them-- but I feel like the book hints to them being executed. It seems to me that people that put their own gain above the needs for others (meaning people who kill to ""win"") would probably not make very good leaders, but hey, that's me. Hopefully, more world building will be revealed in the next book.Overall, there are definite similarities between this book and The Hunger Games, and probably has been in somewhat inspired by that trilogy, but I believe it stands on its own. I don't know if it's because I haven't read a dystopian in a while (I burned myself out like many other reviewers and then took a long break), or what, but I really like the ""test"" aspect to the whole thing, which was definitely lacking in The Hunger Games, which it should, since that wasn't the focus.I think this was a great first novel in the trilogy, and Charbonneau definitely has a talent at keeping us on our toes and glued to the page. Even though I have 20 more books to get through, I may just take a break from my reading list and pick up the second today.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2IHRX4E6EYO9A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008LQ1VGC#wasThisHelpful","R2IHRX4E6EYO9A","A3RAIR289B2A84","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RAIR289B2A84?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was given this book by the author in exchange for an honest review.Isabella Rockwell's War by Hannah Parry stars Isabella who is a courageous twelve year old in a bad position. She lives in India but because of terrible circumstances, she is forced to leave by herself to go to England, a cold, harsh place she's never known. Her choices as she arrives are thus: either become a street runaway and have independence or stick around and be sent to an orphanage where she'd work as a servant. She decides to run away and the group of kids she meets and a beautiful girl she saves changes her life forever.I admit that I got behind on my reading and so I didn't pick up this book until a few days ago. I'm hitting myself, because this is one of the gems in the self publishing world. The tone of the book reminds me of a mix of The Secret Garden and The Little Princess. It's been a while since I read a middle grade book, but this is one that doesn't dumb down the story for its readers. The pacing is great, and I really liked Isabella as a protagonist, who carries the story with her spunkiness. The twists are great too-- I definitely didn't suspect the right person!The only thing I would suggest is having us meet Alix a little quicker since she is even mentioned in the synopsis. Otherwise, I think this is a very strong debut.Overall, a really great middle grade read that I'll definitely suggest to that age group to read.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RWOFXO8GS0RM5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008ZEXRY4#wasThisHelpful","RWOFXO8GS0RM5","A3RAIR289B2A84","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RAIR289B2A84?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I received an ARC in a contest giving away books.Truth or Dare was a pleasant surprise after reading some disappointing books prior to it. I usually don't like more than alternating POV's but Green does a great job getting us into the heads of three very different girls: Sydney, the artsy photographer, with a deadly secret, Caitlin, a pretty and popular but sweet girl who is buckling under pressure to get into Harvard, and Tenley, the mean girl who left town and is back to reclaim her throne. Soon, we realize that someone is playing a very nasty trick on these three girls and somehow, they are connected in ways we don't know. Will they figure out who is playing them before it's too late?I loved the prose in this novel. Usually in books like these that sort of represent the Christopher Pike genre back in the day are not very well written (i.e. the recent Ten), and I can barely get through them. But this book is very well written, and every description is meaningful, every word is on purpose. The plot is very fast paced, and while I figured out who the trickster is about 25% in, I didn't really care because I wanted to find out what happened to the girls, and there are plenty of other mysteries that need to be solved on the sidelines. It was really worth the ride. I started to care or at least be interested in each of the characters and their many secrets and was definitely surprised by many of them.So you are probably asking now, so why only 4 stars? Honestly, I totally would have given in 5 except for the really big fact that this is the FIRST BOOK IN A TRILOGY. I feel like the remaining mysteries could have been resolved pretty easily in the first and made this an extremely strong stand alone. Instead, this story is going to be dragged out for two more books? Of similar length? (this isn't a short book). I can't say that I'm that excited to pick up the next one, although Green is undoubtedly talented, but I think this was not the right move.Overall, a well written, gripping, intense ride in three points of views-- you'll want to pick this one up.

"I received an ARC of this book from a friend who was passing it along (which I will also do to pass along good will!).Dualed by Elsie Chapman stars West Grayer, who is part of a dystopian civilization where every child is born with a twin, but the two twins are raised in different families. At a certain point, they are activated and have 30 days to kill their Alt. This way the hardiest and most killer like people survive in case there is need for an army. Something tragic happens to West (honestly, in a world where tragedy is a norm), and she decides to take matters in her own hands and take on a dangerous job while she's waiting. When she finally gets activated, will she be able to kill someone who looks just like her?First, the prose is solid and the plot fast paced. I liked the idea behind the story, and I liked West enough to stay in the story. I read the whole book in a couple of hours, so that was no problem.But when I reached the end, I just felt... disappointed. I thought there would be more twists. There aren't. The world building, while the initial idea is interesting, just falls apart with holes you could drive a car through. Another reviewer very aptly asked why an Alt couldn't just find out where the other Alt lived and gather data for years before activation even starts? I don't get a good grasp on West, and she makes some decisions that I cannot fathom.MINOR SPOILER: So it's ok to kill other people but just not someone that looks like you?Really? And there are some plot reveals that happen near the end with her Alt that also make no sense to me from what was described earlier on. I just couldn't get behind it.Oddly enough though, I was entertained, so I would totally pick up the next book at the library to give it a shot and see what Chapman has up her sleeve next.Overall, a fast paced first novel with an intriguing premise, but has shoddy world building and character development.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RX07CSIHOJDEV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00957T3JI#wasThisHelpful","RX07CSIHOJDEV","A3RAIR289B2A84","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RAIR289B2A84?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I received this book from the Goodreads First Reads book giveaway, thanks!Dangerous by Shannon Hale is the first book I've read by her. I've heard great things about her Princess Academy and the Goose Girl books, and this apparently is a pretty big divergence from those books. We are introduced to Maisie Danger Brown who is a genius and is the kid of two very bright scientists and is homeschooled. She wins a prize to go to a smart kid camp with one of the greatest scientists in the world. At the camp, she meets a sexy guy, and friends that understand who she is (other than her best friend at home, Luther). But quickly, after a space trip goes awry, Maisie realizes that she's gotten more than she's bargained for at this camp.I'm going to remain vague at this point so the reader can discover the book's secrets for themselves. The premise was pretty entertaining and the plot fast paced. Probably out of all of the characters, I liked Maisie's parents the best. I love that we have a YA book where the parents are still alive and obviously love their kid very much, so I appreciated that.I had a ton of issues with this book, however. The prose is extremely choppy. I'm not sure if that's just Hale's writing style in general, but all of the sentences are short to the point that it was very obvious after a few pages. The characters are not well drawn out so I didn't feel that connected to any of them. The head scientist was supposed to be quirky and maybe on the autistic spectrum, but just ended up being weird to me. And everything just seemed way over the top, and as the pages were turned, the body count piled up, as if there was nothing wrong with that. No one really cared when people died in this book, so that made me less willing to care. The love story between Maisie and other kid was not that convincing and it made her look wishy washy as a character to keep oscillating in her feelings for him. To me, he wasn't that great.Overall, fast paced adventure, but I would not rank this in my favorites of the YA sci fi genre, and the characters are pretty lackluster.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R35Y3FNAVE1WO8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FU40Y1G#wasThisHelpful","R35Y3FNAVE1WO8","A3RAIR289B2A84","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RAIR289B2A84?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I absolutely loved AG Howard's debut novel, Splintered, last year, so I had to get my hands on this beautiful second installment, Unhinged, as soon as it came out. The covers of both books are gorgeous, are they not?Unhinged by AG Howard picks up several months where Splintered left off. Alyssa is struggling with her relationship with Jeb, who seems more interested in starting a career than spending time with her. Plus, he doesn't remember any of their adventures in Wonderland, and Alyssa is wondering if she should tell him. Unsurprisingly, Morpheus shows up in her dreams again and in the living flesh to shake things up. To make things more tricky and interesting, we learn new things about her parents and their relationship, which clarify a lot of things and put a new spin on some of the events that happened in the last book. Will Alyssa be able to navigate her feelings about Jeb, Morpheus, and her parents and save Wonderland again from eminent danger?I have said this before about trilogies. Second books are hard. They just are. Even if you have a kickbutt heroine, there still has to be character growth (or more likely, setbacks) in the second, so that in the third, she can rise to the occasion and show everyone just how far she's come. Alyssa is not as likeable in this installment, but understandably so, because her world has completely turned upside down. She doesn't know who she is, and it doesn't help that she's split between two worlds and two men that are different as night and day. All of her personal relationships have just (for lack of a better word), ""splintered,"" and she has to pick up the pieces and see where she fits into each of their lives and how they fit into hers. She regains some of her momentum by the end, as she should. Jeb and Morpheus are still smouldering as her leading men, but while I've always loved Morpheus, I thought they ended on rather even footing in the last book. This book I feel is essentially Morpheus' book, as we learn more about him and his inner workings. That said, things are never clear in Wonderland or this trilogy, so we'll just have to see how it all plays out in the last book.I love AG Howard's writing. It's dark, twisted, and sinister, just like you'd think this sort of Wonderland would be. She has a deft sense of words, and it plays out well in this installment.Overall, while it wasn't quite as fun as the first book, which it really couldn't be in order to progress the story, it is definitely a wonderful ride all on its own and a deeply satisfying sequel. We get to see some terrific reveals about all of the characters, and reintroduce ourselves to our favorite characters, which is the whole point, right? I am already itching to get my hands on the last book, which I know will be the most fantastic, chilling installment of them all.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RIZUD0BCLTJKF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1419709712#wasThisHelpful","RIZUD0BCLTJKF","A3RAIR289B2A84","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RAIR289B2A84?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've been waiting for a year to read Infinite by Jodi Meadows, the last installment of the Incarnate trilogy. I wasn't disappointed. I received this ARC from Harper Publishers in exchange for an honest review. I award this book 4.5 stars.Infinite by Jodi Meadows takes off where Asunder left us. We are taken right to the action with Ana and Sam, as they frantically try to figure out how to prevent Janan for ascending. Ultimately, a small group of them have to leave Heart to try to figure out their ultimate plan. Will Ana sacrifice her chance for love and happiness for the greater good of all souls alike?I don't want to say too much in the synopsis, because this final installment is chock full of really great reveals that all of us have been wondering for ages. Let's just say that every character you've loved in this series gets their due. Ana really comes into her own, Sam continues to be one of the most loveable characters in YA, and other side characters come in different forms, which really enhances the world building.I really felt the book came into it's own around page 100. It was good up to then, don't get me wrong, but after that point, it became increasingly difficult to put it down. I loved how we got to learn more about dragons, sylphs, and phoenixes. There is one particular reveal that I loved because I never suspected there was more to it. But Meadows never forgot, and it's pretty amazing.I really liked the ending, but it almost seemed too perfect. That said, it was really satisfying and beautifully written, so I just went with it. If a writer can get my doubting self to just disappear, that's pretty awesome.In a world chock full of ending YA trilogies, this one stands out. It started strong and ended stronger, with a great middle installment, so as a whole, it was really great. This is hard to do. I feel like several trilogies have failed on one book or another, or disappointed me in some way. The Incarnate trilogy didn't, and I'm thrilled to add it to my very short list of must read trilogies.Overall, a fantastic and worthy ending to the Incarnate trilogy with great characters, prose, and plot twists. Everyone needs to get their hands on this book as soon as it comes out!","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RE8D1DZRHXGWC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DB2WPBQ#wasThisHelpful","RE8D1DZRHXGWC","A3RAIR289B2A84","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RAIR289B2A84?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I won a copy of this ARC from Disney Publishers, and I haven't gotten a chance to read it until now. What a mistake. This is by far my favorite YA read from 2013.These Broken Stars, written by the duo Amie Kaufman and Meagan Spooner, takes us to space aboard a massive luxury ship, similar to the Titanic. We immediately meet our two main characters-- Tarver, a solider, and Lilac, the daughter of the richest and most powerful man in the universe. Right away, something happens to the ship, and the two of them are stranded on a deserted planet left to forage and survive on their own without help. Slowly, something happens between them, beautiful and fragile. And in the end, Tarver and Lilac will have to make the difficult decision of giving up the wonderful peace they've found with each other to find their way back to civilization.Any plot synopsis won't do this book justice. The way Lilac and Tarver interact is perfect. The prose is gorgeous. The world building is immense and believable. And I even went along with the science, because it's clear that these two authors have done their homework. Just fantastic. I can go on and on about the lush description, the pitch perfect characterization, and the most successfully done dual POV I have seen maybe ever in YA. I actually wonder if each voice was written by a different author, because the two voices are very unique, and I never wondered whose perspective I was in. Each scene is deliberate, ramping up the tension and the stakes, and ultimately, having us care about these two characters so much that one heart wrenching plot twist is entirely a shock to the system. I had to sit stunned for a day before I could continue, and then devoured the pages until the end to see what happened.Overall, this book is a gem. I can't think of a single criticism, and my inner writer is salivating with jealousy. I can't say enough how people must read this book immediately. It's beautifully written, described, and characterized with perfect pacing. My favorite YA read of the past year, and I'll be waiting impatiently until I can get my hands on the next installment.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R13VU4SXRNHQH3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1423171020#wasThisHelpful","R13VU4SXRNHQH3","A3RAIR289B2A84","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RAIR289B2A84?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Erin is a good friend on twitter, so I admit I was worried. I always worry about reading friends' books because you want to be honest, but let's face it, it always sucks reading a book you don't like that was written by a friend. Thank goodness, this wasn't an issue because The Prophecy ROCKS! :-)The Prophecy by Erin Albert is the first book of a YA fantasy trilogy that whisks us away to the nations of the Vanguard and the Ethereals. Layla is our main protagonist, although the perspective of the book shifts from character to character effortlessly, and she is one of the Vanguards. Her adoptive family is worried that she may be the Fulfillment because of her black hair and purple eyes. It's been foretold that the Fulfillment will bring the two kingdoms together in peace.All Layla wants to do is go to the Vanguard celebration and get some sweet bread. She doesn't feel like the Fulfillment, but she's quickly found by a zealot and taken off to become Wil's bride. Wilhelm is the heir to the Ethereal throne. As Layla meets both Wil and a mysterious boy named Nash, she will be forced to decide between her mind and heart on every level, and make a choice that may save or destroy the kingdoms and the hope for piece.I loved this book. It was fast paced, and the world building was seamless. I've seen books that completely fail on that level, but The Prophecy had a wonderful balance between world building, character building, and plot. Each of the characters were well described, and I found myself rooting for each of them. I loved the plot twists, and I found a new book boyfriend in Wil, who is one of the sweetest characters I've met in a long time.Layla was hard to like initially, but she quickly won me over, which is critical in a book like this. I also loved how the older generation of kings and queens played a large role in this book as well.I wasn't a huge fan of Nash, and I felt like some of those scenes were forced. However, this is my only slightly negative comment about the whole thing, and I know this is just a personal preference. There are several people out there who are glad I don't like Nash so they can have him for themselves!Overall, a really wonderful YA debut by a wonderful person. I'm beyond relieved that this book is terrific, because it makes my job as an honest reviewer that much easier! I'm dying to get my hands on the next installment!","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 24, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R12IB04U7B6PH4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GOHOUSG#wasThisHelpful","R12IB04U7B6PH4","A3RAIR289B2A84","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RAIR289B2A84?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was asked by Left Bank Books to check out this book. Man, I'm glad they pointed it out to me. Michael Vey: The Prisoner of Cell 25 was an unexpectedly good read for me. I actually didn't read too much about the book, so all I knew going in was that it vaguely had to do with super powers.Michael Vey seems to be an ordinary 14 year old, but we find out in the first chapter that he has a hidden power. To make matters worse, he has Tourette's, which makes him have the unfortunate habit of saying the wrong thing at the wrong time, and getting himself into trouble because of it. His powers are a secret, however, so he is forced to suffer in silence. When the prettiest girl in school approaches him, Michael realizes that maybe it's not so bad being him after all. The two of them and Michael's best friend Ostin (yes, his mother mispelled the name of the Texas capital) band together to try to figure out the mysterious origin of their powers. They discover deeply buried and explosive secrets (pun completely intended), and Michael has to decide between what is right and what is easy.Okay, so I totally ripped off a promo for a movie or something. Not sure which one that phrase came from, but just let it suffice to say that I totally didn't make that up by myself. Anyway, what makes this book is the characters. We've all read books about kids with secret powers-- it's been overdone. How many books similar to the X-men have we all read?  But Michael is hysterically funny, and has a unique voice, which completely makes this book succeed. Add a feisty, cute love interest and a hilarious sidekick best friend who is smarter than everyone else combined (including the adults), and you get a terrific, fast paced read.This book doesn't reinvent the wheel, and I'd like to see more growth in the main character, which is why it didn't get a perfect score, but this is only the first book, and it sets up the next two in style.Overall, a terrific and fun read, and I can't wait to pick up the next book in the series.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 21, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/REY2V4DV4374C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0052DNX40#wasThisHelpful","REY2V4DV4374C","A3RAIR289B2A84","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RAIR289B2A84?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the first book I've picked up recently that I didn't have to review or read for any reason other than I really wanted to. I loved the first four books in this series, and have been dying to read the rest ever since. This book will contain spoilers from the previous books.Spirit Bound by Richelle Mead picks up where we left off in the previous book. Dimitri is Strigoi, and Rose has returned from trying to kill/save whatever it was that she was thinking of doing (but knowing Rose she wasn't really thinking, just doing). She's just found out that there may be a way to turn him back to a dhampir, but of course, this possibility is riddled with both doubt and also complications to get the answers she seeks. That said, this is Rose Hathaway we're talking about, so she'll do what it takes, no matter how messy it is. Joined by the rest of the great cast, including the sexy Adrian and the golden Lissa, we blaze to the end, which of course is a cliffhanger.I have great admiration for Richelle Mead. She's created a cast of characters that are so real and believable and let's face it, just plain fun, that we WANT to read six books to see where the characters and plot are going. Most series have issues staying good for two books. Mead has also perfected the art of figuring out how to do an entirely first person book, but seeing into the minds of others and getting us perspectives in a third person way. It's a trick that I still marvel about since the first book. Also, all the characters (and there are many) are easy to keep straight. They are so unique, and characters that I haven't read about in a year, I still remember like yesterday. That's darned hard to do. Lastly, she creates a world that is intriguing and unique. Even though it's been several years since the first one was written, I don't have any other stories to compare it to. That's staying power for you. There are definitely some books I've read recently that I wonder if I would have enjoyed reading three years ago when they came out. I don't think it would have mattered when I read this series. I would have loved it anyway.Specifically to this book, it wasn't my favorite in the series because of certain plot points that were necessary. So my rating has nothing to do with the pacing, characters or anything like that. I just personally liked it slightly less than some of the others in this series.That said, I've already picked up the last book, and can't wait to see what happens to these characters. I have conflicting feelings because while I want to see the end, I don't want it to end! And that, my friends, is what every author strives to do. And Mead does that with flying colors. Can't wait to start the next of her spin off series.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 21, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R126UTMJXZVU7Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003NX763K#wasThisHelpful","R126UTMJXZVU7Y","A3RAIR289B2A84","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RAIR289B2A84?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Bloodrose by Andrea Cremer is the third installment of the series that started with Nightshade. I had mixed feelings about the first two books, but once I got past some of the issues I had with them, the third one was much tighter with pacing, writing, and great twists.The story continues with Calla, Ren, and Shay, as they struggle to figure out how to get rid of the Keeper's power once and for all. There are other side plots that I won't go into in case those of you reading this review haven't read the first two books.I think a lot of the people reading this book were dismayed by the ending because of certain events. It didn't really bother me, to be honest with you, because I never really connected with either of the two male leads, so I didn't care which one she ended up with. I still had issues with how everyone just had their designated ""place"" in the hierarchy just because of what role they were born into, but after I got past that, I just sat back and enjoyed the ride.As I stated before, everything was stronger in this story. I got through this one much faster than the first two because the pacing was better, and so was the writing. The ending was actually a surprise to me because I didn't think Cremer would take the story there, but I admired her decision. As the other reviews show, it's not necessarily the most popular decision, but it makes sense, and solidified that I'm going to give this book four stars, the highest rating I've given any book in this series.I'm not sure I would recommend this series as a whole because you have to get through two books to get to the one that's worth reading. That said, I think that Cremer will just continue to get better with each book.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 21, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R11XLDVX1UGL0C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005GSYYB2#wasThisHelpful","R11XLDVX1UGL0C","A3RAIR289B2A84","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RAIR289B2A84?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I got this book from my library, and I award it somewhere between 3 and 3.5 stars.Wolfsbane by Andrea Cremer is the follow up to Nightshade. We once again meet up with Calla and Shay, as they navigate through this new world they've discovered after many of the lies have been revealed at the end of Nightshade. Calla is also still struggling with her feelings of Shay and Ren, the boy she left behind. Will Calla be able to reunite with her pack or will they label her as a traitor after all?There are some great things about this novel. It's overall better written than the first. Cremer is definitely growing as an author. The last 50 pages really pop with some great revelations. I liked some of the twists a lot. We also get a crowd of new characters who add something different to the table.That said, I still had a multitude of issues with this book. First, 300 pages is just discussion of backstory in conversation between characters. I liked how it was done in the first book because it was limited and necessary. This just seemed like overkill. Because of this, the second book almost entirely felt like filler until the last few pages when all the action and twists occur. I discovered a lot about the history of the world, but found my attention drifting because it was just too much all at once. And like in the first book, I find myself irritated by how the whole wolf/alpha thing works. It's as if the people in the story have no say in who they hang out with or who they obey because of their natural wolfie instincts. And Calla does a lot of questionable things just because of her ""alpha"" driving her to just react and not think. I guess but I'm not really into that kind of person, and is likely why I've never really got into Calla as a main character.Overall, a better written follow up to the first with great twists at the end, but needs better pacing for the world building.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 12, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3VA800HD6BWTS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0142420980#wasThisHelpful","R3VA800HD6BWTS","A3RAIR289B2A84","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RAIR289B2A84?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have the ARC for the fourth book in the series, so I figured I'd better get a move on. There may be some mild kissing spoilers.Nightshade by Andrea Cremer is a book about teenaged werewolves. It stars the stuffy Calla, who is the alpha of her pack. She's destined to mate with Ren, the alpha of another pack. And these two packs stroll the halls as the most popular kids. During the very first pages, Calla rescues a mere human, named Shay, and introduces him as the third wheel in the love triangle. With Shay, Calla teaches him the background of her people, the Guardians, and he shows her that not all is how it seems. Will Calla be able to become the individual that she's always dreamed of becoming?I can see why people like this book. It's pretty fast paced, and there's some interesting world building. I like the ideas that stem with the mythology of the Guardians, Keepers, and whatnot. I also liked how Cremer shows us a lot of this as Calla is explaining her world to Shay. There are some pretty good twists that develop throughout the plot, and leaves me interested enough to stick around for the sequel.That said, I had a ton of issues with this book. I wonder if I'd have liked it better three years ago when it first came out. The dialogue is so stuffy and stilted-- all of the characters sound middle aged, especially Calla. And she is way too easy with her lips. She very frequently kisses different boys right after one another. Sorry if that's a spoiler, but if you don't know there's a love triangle by page 5, shame on you! Also, I don't understand why these kids are taking some high brow college courses in high school. Are they in a magnet school or something? Organic Chemistry? Some other crazy philosophical course? Most kids would be lucky to be in a school like that separating caffeine from tea. I'm rather jealous actually. Both of the boys seem pretty pushy, so I'm not really digging either one of them. I wish Calla would just tell them both to take a hike and go on a girly vacation with Bryn or something.Overall, good world building and some interesting twists, but I'm not yet convinced by the characters, how they talk, or where this is going. We'll see how the next 3 books go.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 10, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R12LX8QRUTHBIO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=014241980X#wasThisHelpful","R12LX8QRUTHBIO","A3RAIR289B2A84","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RAIR289B2A84?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've been waiting on pins and needles for Fire and Ash, the conclusion of the series by Jonathan Mayberry that started with the wonderful Rot and Ruin. I was not disappointed. I award this book 4.5 stars.Fire and Ash takes place a bit after Flesh and Bone, the third book in the series. Chong is in dire straits, while Benny, Nix, and Lila are at Sanctuary, finally, but with more questions than answers. The legendary Joe Ledger is also there, who stars in his own books in the adult fiction world. Together, this ragtag band strives to save Chong and the same time, save the world from the Reapers and the completely creepy Saint John.I was thrilled to see Benny finally get his day in the sun. I've been waiting for this last part in his growth (apparently, Nix was too), and while I'll always have a soft spot in my heart for Tom Imura, Benny is a pretty cool samurai himself. The pacing was as good as the previous novels. I've been struggling to get through novels recently, and this wasn't one of them. It's a good size, the size of a Harry Potter book, but I blazed through it just as fast. We also get to see some old friends, and this comes to a wonderfully satisfying finish.It's not a perfect novel-- I'm a little sketchy on some of the details of the science, and it almost seems to wrap up too easily at the end. But that said, that didn't stop me from thoroughly enjoying myself from start to finish. There were some great twists that took my mind away from these small details.Overall, a worthy ending to a phenomenal series. If you haven't read these yet, get them NOW. They'll stand the test of time. I guess I'd better start picking up some of the books on Ledger until Mayberry writes another YA novel.

"I read and enjoyed the first book in this duet- My Super Sweet Sixteenth Century while back. I knew at that point Rachel Harris was talented, and that I'd better continue to pick up her books as I suspected she'd only get better with time.Boy, was I right. I was lucky enough to win this copy in a twitter giveaway. A Tale of Two Centuries takes place a bit after the first book-- and what's wonderful about this book (and I'm enjoying this new trend in YA quite a bit) is that it's a companion novel and a stand alone in its own right. So you can easily pick this one up and read it by itself, but if you've read the first one, it only enhances the second.In this book, instead of getting the perspective of Cat, the fiery protagonist from the first book, we get to see through the eyes of Less. I think I identified a lot more with Less, and absolutely loved her from the first book, so this even made me enjoy the book more. Less has dreamed of the freedom to choose what to do with her life as well as pick who she should love. Fortunately, Reyna, the gypsy, has heard her plea, and Less gets to journey to the modern world to visit her relative, Cat. Although this world is shocking to her in many ways, at the same time, she is able to do so many things she wasn't in her world. She is able to pursue acting and meets a gorgeous guy named Austin, who makes her (and me) blush. Will she be able to leave all of this behind when the time comes?I can't say how much I loved this book. I felt like Rachel took all of the parts I loved in the first book and totally enhanced it in the second. Less is a wonderful protagonist, and it was a wonder and delight to see her grow and develop into the person she always wanted to be. And deserved to be. I've always enjoyed watching her interaction with Cat, and we got loads more of that in this book. Some of her mistakes in this world were absolutely hilarious and totally made sense. And finally, Austin is a very swoon worthy guy. I don't usually go for the bad guys, but he's one of the very rare exceptions. You can't help but fall head over heels for everyone in this book.Overall, the perfect frosting (with depth too!) to my night, and I blazed through it from cover to cover. Everyone needs to read this book and will continue smiling after it's finished for a long time.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 8, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1GPR03UT4Q9Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1622660129#wasThisHelpful","R1GPR03UT4Q9Y","A3RAIR289B2A84","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RAIR289B2A84?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I picked up Icons because I wanted to try something different of Stohl's than Beautiful Creatures, which I could see she had talent, but didn't really get into that story.I chose this book from a blog giveaway.Icons takes place after the world pretty much ends. It's a paranormal dystopian, a combination genre I really enjoy. We are in the perspective of Dol, a girl who has been orphaned by the Icons taking over the world on one Day (and yes, unfortunately, that is capitalized in the book). She and her best friend Ro have unusual powers but are two of the few people to live in the Grasslands, away from the influence of the central government. They are captured and meet up with two other kids, Lucas, the Ambassador's son, and Tima, another girl with powers. For some reason, these particular kids seem to be the key to fighting back the alien invasion, and this book is their journey to figuring this and themselves out.At first, I wasn't sure if I liked this book or not-- but after about 100 pages, I got sucked into the story. I liked Dol, and I wanted to figure out where they got their powers, what the backstory was, and where things were going. Lucas was an atypical love interest as well, so I really liked that. He understandably thought the way his mother thought about things, having grown up that way, and didn't just believe that rebellion was the way to go. Also, there are some hints that Stohl has done some medical research. A lot of the premise is a bit farfetched, but I liked that she took the initiative to at least put some possible explanations that had some scientific grounding.I thought I was going to give this book four stars, but the ending really disappointed me. It suddenly became a very typical book with a typical ending, and it didn't feel like a natural progression as to what happened before.Overall, interesting premise and characters, but doesn't deliver in the end.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 2, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R24RT57RRAZADQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0316205184#wasThisHelpful","R24RT57RRAZADQ","A3RAIR289B2A84","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RAIR289B2A84?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I received this book from Goodreads in exchange for an honest review.A Darkness Strange and Lovely by Susan Dennard picks up where the first left off. I had several issues with the first book, the main one being that I was really confused as to setting and time period-- and the beginning was rather odd. However, I could see that Dennard could write beautifully and it ended at a place that I figured I'd give the series another try by picking up the second book.We return to our friends Eleanor who is dealing with the aftermath of the first book. She's on the brink of poverty, but soon she realizes she has to find the rest of her friends again to deal with Marcus. After meeting a demon, she journeys to Paris, which is a lovely setting, and runs into Jie, Joseph, and her first love, Daniel. At the same time, she realizes she may be more similar to her brother than she ever thought and is tempted by great power. Will she be able to decipher Elliot's letters and control her growing talents before she ostracizes everyone she knows and cares about?Let me be direct-- I do think that this book is an improvement on the first one. The prose is much more straightforward and understandable. I never for a moment was confused where we were or what the setting was. Paris was a wonderful place to set the majority of this book and I think that's the strength of Dennard's writing. There were wonderful moments of description. Also, Jie is one of my favorite characters, so I loved seeing her again.So what were my issues? I'm starting to think any sort of historical fiction may not be my thing. I've never connected to Eleanor, and I know part of it is that she's a girl in the 1800's. Her infatuation with Daniel seems too stereotypical, and both of them throw hissy fits very easily without sticking around for explanations. They are typical of some teenagers, I admit, but not ones I really want to read about. Because of this, I put down the book at 250 pages, and scanned to the end to see if I was missing anything. There are some twists, but not enough to continue this journey with Eleanor.Overall, beautiful description and improvement on the last novel, but overall, I think the time period and characters weren't for me.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 2, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2A8CPBRW27MT7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062083295#wasThisHelpful","R2A8CPBRW27MT7","A3RAIR289B2A84","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RAIR289B2A84?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I won this book from a blogger giveaway.Origin by Jessica Khoury is about Pia, the perfect girl who has been created immortal and who is destined to take over the scientific team who wants to create a new race of immortals. She has been raised in Little Cambridge, which is in the middle of some kind of tropical rainforest setting, but she's never been outside of its walls. One night she creeps into the jungle and meets a boy. She never realized there was life other than what she's experienced and she starts to question everything. This book is her journey on finding some answers.What I liked: I liked the descriptions of the forest, the village in the forest, other natives and their language. I liked Uncle Antonio and Aunt Harriet, who were probably the best characters and the most three dimensional of the lot. Khoury brings up some interesting ethical issues.Why this book was a letdown for me: the science makes no sense to me. These people are supposedly scientists but none of their ""experiments"" follow any sort of scientific method I've ever known. Apparently these people and Pia herself are supposed to be highly intelligent. I work in a laboratory setting and the individuals there (who are graduate students) are way more intelligent than these people. Where are the controls? What are the experiments? What are they testing really? These tests that they are giving Pia are just regurgitation of facts. Sure, she's good at memorization, but she seems not very bright otherwise. I know she's sheltered, but she just seems really slow in general. Not to mention how tired I am of the trope of the evil scientists who have no morals and who are only in it for glory and money from the evil, shadowy corporation. Really? Then there's the insta-love that takes place, which I won't get into, but that seems very groan worthy. And I won't talk about the Wickham tests, but they're ridiculous-- you'll have to read it to figure out what they are.Overall, a beautifully described setting, but with overall lackluster characters and terrible science-- a disappointment.","2.0 out of 5 stars","July 21, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1GZHCLLRV39YD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007HU7RTS#wasThisHelpful","R1GZHCLLRV39YD","A3RAIR289B2A84","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RAIR289B2A84?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I unexpectedly received this book in the mail a few days ago from Penguin Teen and was curious about it, so immediately picked it up. This is my favorite kind of book-- I go in with no expectations, and come out, moved.45 Pounds by K.A. Barson is about every girl Ann, who is overweight, wears a size 17, and is incredibly embarrassed about it. She has a stick thin perfect mother who has apparently never worried about weight her entire life, and has difficulty making new friends. She's struggled through many different diets, but this one is different-- her aunt has a wedding coming up, and Ann is determined to fit into a cute bridesmaid dress. This all seems very stereotypical to teen literature, but this book takes a generic idea and makes it new.I admit that the first 100 pages were very painful for me to read on so many different levels. Ann is the perfect teen protagonist-- very insecure with many flaws, but with so much room to grow. She's like any of us were when we were at the awkward teenager stage where all we wanted to do was belong. I'll be honest-- I almost wanted to put it down because reliving those years was not my idea of relaxation. But then midway, something changes. Ann realizes that her sphere is larger than just around herself and that everyone has their own history, their own insecurities, their own fears. Barson introduces some really wonderful supporting characters-- Raynee, Ann's new friend, was probably my favorite of them all, and they take this book to a new level. The writing is crisp and the pacing makes absolute sense.The resolution of this book is perfect-- and it brought tears to my eyes. In contemporary YA, the characters are the center of stories, and this book is chock full of it.Overall, a book bursting through the seams with heart, courage, and depth that I was not expecting. A must read.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 20, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RKZKEC15RNN5A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AFPVQ6C#wasThisHelpful","RKZKEC15RNN5A","A3RAIR289B2A84","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RAIR289B2A84?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I was very lucky to receive one of these well anticipated ARCs from the author in exchange for an honest review.I loved Black City, so I was thrilled to receive this follow up. In Phoenix, the sequel, we are thrust back into the action, right where we left off in Black City. Ash and Natalie are still in love, and still reeling from the events in the last book. Rose's Law is up for public vote, and unsurprisingly, we get some sinister threats from Purian Rose, the enemy. The basic idea that Ash and Natalie are fighting for is equality among all races, Darklings and humans alike (as well as some other interesting species mixed in). A lot of forces stand in their way.I don't want to give away any more information, because there are several twists that are a delight to find out. Again, this entry is very well written, and I found myself immersed in this dangerous world that seems like a combination between the world of the Hunger Games and that of the Holocaust. Horrific things happen in the name of power, and while at times, it seems almost unbelievable, you just have to look at WWII to remember that such atrocities have happened in the recent past.If I'm completely honest, I didn't like this entry as much as the first-- not because it's not as well written, but certain events had to happen, which make me not the biggest fan of Natalie by the end of the book. But I understand she has time to redeem herself, and another book to get there.Overall, a thrilling and dark second installment in the Black City trilogy. It's a must read, and I'm itching to get my hands on the third as soon as possible.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 4, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R55D3SEL8LFKD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0399159444#wasThisHelpful","R55D3SEL8LFKD","A3RAIR289B2A84","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RAIR289B2A84?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was given this book by the author in exchange for an honest review. I rate it 2.5 stars.The Widower by Ryan LaForge is about Jacob McKinley, a man who has just been widowed at the ripe age of 28. He was only married to Leah for a year and a half before she passed away. Since then, he's been carrying a lot of grief and guilt that he wasn't the best husband as he could have been and now he isn't sure he can move on. Certain events take place after this that change his life forever.What I liked: it's pretty well written from a grammatical and prose standpoint. I love when indie authors heavily edit (or have it heavily edited by pros) and put their best foot forward. Some of the description is spot on and beautifully done.What I had a very big issue with is how trite a lot of the plot is. I felt like this novel tried to be a version of a Nicholas Sparks novel, but every time another plot point occurred, I silently groaned to myself. Because of this, it was very difficult to get through and I would have been okay with stopping after a few chapters.What was worth sticking it through, is that we get introduced to another couple of characters that have a little more uniqueness to them. Rachel was probably the best character in the book.Overall, a well edited book that falls flat with some trite plot choices. That said, this can be worked on and I know that LaForge will just get better with every book.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 31, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R30A6ZKU865MW4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00B6QQD08#wasThisHelpful","R30A6ZKU865MW4","A3RAIR289B2A84","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RAIR289B2A84?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was given this book by the author in exchange for an honest review.The Grave Winner by Lindsey R. Loucks doesn't fall into an easy category. The genre is most similar to a YA horror/paranormal (like the wonderful Anna Dressed in Blood), but I don't want readers who aren't into horror to discount this book. It has a lot of really terrific paranormal elements and is a wonderful read. I'm not a horror buff either and I loved it! This book stars Leigh, a typical rebellious teenager that has just experienced what every other teen hopes not to experience-- the death of her mother. A popular girl at school has just come back from the dead, and Leigh is determined not to have her mother come back that way. But events take an ominous turn and she struggles to keep her family and friends safe as creepy things start to happen. She also gets into a bit of a romantic triangle between a cute graveyard caretaker and the brother of her best friend. Will Leigh be able to work all of this out in time?I loved this book. Every time I thought I could pigeonhole the book, it surprised me in some way. I had some questions along the way that I wasn't sure would be answered, but they were, in a most satisfying way. The characters are terrific-- I think I would have been lucky to have friends like Leigh and Jo in high school. The two love interests sizzle, although I think I definitely have a soft spot for the best friend's brother, Callum. The setting is creepy and appropriate.I have to mention this as well-- Loucks has the best swag I've ever seen any author have. The items she has are pivotal players in the book, and I was delighted to see how those elements revealed themselves. I think it's a talent to have swag that enhances the book even more.Overall, a terrific and creepy read-- make sure you have a warm blanket, pet, or significant other to squeeze during the scary parts! I'll be watching Loucks career from here on out.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 26, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3PUKGYFAZZMWO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CRLM062#wasThisHelpful","R3PUKGYFAZZMWO","A3RAIR289B2A84","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RAIR289B2A84?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I received a copy of this book from Epic Reads, thanks!I tried to read The Selection by Kiera Cass in the past. I thought from the first few chapters that it wasn't the book for me. But when I received it from Epic Reads and also saw some rave reviews from bloggers that I trust, I knew I had to try it again. And for a book I didn't think I would like, I sure enjoyed reading it a whole lot!The Selection stars America, who is a Five, or a lower class citizen. The upper classes are One through Four. She is in love with a Six. But every royal prince goes through The Selection to select his queen out of a group of lucky girls. America turns out to be one of those girls. She knows that she can never love Prince Maxon, because he has to be a stuck up Royal, right? But when she meets him and actually gets to know him, she realized she was completely wrong. Will she fall for him after all?This book is kind of like a mix of the show The Bachelor with a dystopian world. I thought it was a really unique idea, merging the two together. Prince Maxon is a little naive but endearing, and I grew to like him a lot more throughout the book. Aspen, the other love interest, is unfortunate, because we don't get much time to know him like we do Maxon. We get to know Maxon at the same pace that America does, and it's much easier to fall in love with him. The writing is solid and the pace is just right. I want to know a little more about the world, and Cass hints that there are secrets that the monarchy are hiding from us.While a solid book, it was centered on a love triangle, and while I know a lot of other readers will love that aspect of it, it's not my personal favorite plot twist.Overall, a fun and intriguing read with some great characters-- I'll be sticking around for the next one!","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 25, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R9Q0SE9X549EZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006564VQC#wasThisHelpful","R9Q0SE9X549EZ","A3RAIR289B2A84","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RAIR289B2A84?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The author gave me this book in exchange for an honest review.I really enjoyed the first two installments of this series, which is a play on the Persephone story as well as other Greek myths. We have been following Persephone, her husband and fortunately, the man she loves, Hades, and a long list of other characters, all who have their unique spin. We continue the story from the first two books, where Persephone has gotten a lot of attention for her potential for having lots of power. She has been kidnapped and is now being tortured by the powerful being who whisked her away at the end of the second book. We follow her, Hades, and Aphrodite.I was delighted to see that we got to see in Aphrodite's head this time, who has consistently been one of my favorite characters. She didn't disappoint in this entry. The rest of the characters continue to be terrific and interesting, and there are some nice plot twists along the way, with the humor that we've learned to love from Bevis.I wasn't as enamored by this book as the others because there is a lot of torture in it, which was hard for me to read and get through, and the villain is pretty two dimensional. Lastly, I had trouble at times with the very short chapters and going from perspective to perspective.That said, the end was not completely an ending, so I can't wait to see the next installment in this series!","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 23, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1SAXBJKI38WN8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CUFSIIY#wasThisHelpful","R1SAXBJKI38WN8","A3RAIR289B2A84","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RAIR289B2A84?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was given this book by the author in exchange for an honest review.Hockey Player for Life by Howard Shapiro stars (as in all of his books thus far) Tom, a 13 year old hockey player, who goes through the ups and downs of the competitive sport. He is initially very full of confidence almost to the point of arrogance, and thinks that nothing can go wrong with his fledgling career. Something happens, however, and he has to rethink his entire plans for the future and what hockey really means to him.I loved this book. Shapiro is remarkably good at channeling pre-teen and teen boys-- their sense of invincibility but also showing how they can grow and develop as they meet new challenges and unexpected disappointments. This book is not a graphical novel, but is similar in tone to Stereotypical Freaks, again about Tom (but he is 15 years old and in high school), which was one of my favorite reads of the year. The pacing is perfect, and my two favorite characters were his father and his best friend, Terry, who in different ways, teach Tom the true meaning of being a hockey player for life. In a deluge of young adult books where the adults are more infantile than the children, it is so wonderful to see a great parent described.Overall, a wonderful read for young boys, but that will be universally enjoyed by anyone. Another must read from Howard Shapiro.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 19, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RHCVNIK04K6I3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0595517854#wasThisHelpful","RHCVNIK04K6I3","A3RAIR289B2A84","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RAIR289B2A84?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was given this book by the author in exchange for an honest review.The Vampire Code by E. C. Adams is about a young and talented lawyer, Aurora, who is approached by Sebastian Fiscard, a vampire in the most prestigious vampire families, to help him defend his brother in court. His brother is being tried for murder because the vampire that he turned (his wife) killed another woman in cold blood. Aurora learns that the Vampire Code is set up very differently than the human legal system, so she navigates through this new territory as well as fights off her growing feelings for Sebastian. She is also being pursued by the Resistance, who wants to see her dead for showing her face in vampire court. Can Aurora survive in this brave new world?I loved this book. LOVED. I don't say that lightly. And I'm even more happy that this is a talented new writer. There has been a ton of speculation as to where this book lies-- it's either New Adult or Adult (I think it's the latter), but honestly, it doesn't really matter. I think young adult readers as well as adult readers will gravitate towards this book because the characters are great (I think I have my first ever vampire crush, and I've read a lot of vampire books), the pacing spot on, and the world building with the Vampire Code just fascinating. There are also a lot of great plot twists that I won't tell you about so that you can discover them on your own.My one small issue (and this is really just a personal preference that did not change the rating) is with the medical stuff later in the book. The details don't really make sense to me, but I was okay with glossing over that (which I usually am not okay with!) to get back to the story at hand.Overall, one of the best indie reads I've gotten my hands on this year.

I award this book 3.5 stars.Hockey Days by Howard Shapiro is a cute picture book about a boy, Tom, who loves hockey and misses his grandfather, who has passed away recently. A mystery box comes to the door, and what is inside is a surprise to both Tom and his father.This book was a quick, fun read, and a nice preview to the books that are to come. I can quickly sense that Shapiro needs a bigger venue to express some deep ideas, and unfortunately, this packaging makes it very difficult to do that. There are some really wonderful and mature ideas placed into simplified text. I am a little bit biased as I go into reading this one, because Shapiro's Stereotypical Freaks, which is a full length graphical novel, is exactly the solution to the issues I had with this book.

"This book was on sale on Amazon (if you guys don't check out Kindle daily deals you are missing out!) and has been on my to be read list for a while, so I was excited to get started. This book was extremely hard to rate, and I give it 3.5 stars after much thought.Sweet Evil by Wendy Higgins stars Anna, a very sheltered Southern girl, who has never done anything wrong in her life when suddenly, she meets Kaidan, a bad boy who makes girls like her turn bad. She also has always had powers to see people's auras/feelings and has never figured out why or how she has these powers. It turns out that has both heavenly and hellish parents, and with Kaidan, she journeys to find out more about herself.I want to say first that Wendy Higgins can obviously write. Her prose is very clear and beautifully described. I think that she'll only get better and better. That said, let's talk about my difficulties with this novel.There will be some slight spoilers in this review from now on, because I can't help but cite specific issues I had. First, while Anna has a good reason to be sheltered, she is just SO sheltered for half of the book, that it's extremely difficult to be in her head for a long period of time. I almost chucked the book across the room groaning because of all the cliched things she thought or said, and the fact that she was swooning over Kaidan, the stereotypical bad boy. When we got to ""the sword of righteousness"" smack dab in the middle of the book, I was pretty much done and would have stopped there.But then part II started. Instead of focusing on the two dreary lovebirds, we get introduced to a whole new crowd of interesting characters of different flavors. I was drawn into the story like the first half never did for me. We get introduced to Anna's father, who is one of my favorite characters, and Kaidan's fascinating friends. I also very much like Anna's human friends. The pacing was much better and we race to the end.Overall, a very difficult book to read and rate-- the first half very nearly had me stop reading it because of the overly sheltered voice of Anna and stereotypical romance, but the second half really brought the book to a new level and saved the read for me.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 16, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R23EIEUGC70S7Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062085611#wasThisHelpful","R23EIEUGC70S7Y","A3RAIR289B2A84","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RAIR289B2A84?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I don't think I realized it was a middle grade read, but I have to say this is the best middle grade/younger adult book I've read in a long while.My Life in Pink and Green by Lisa Greenwald stars Lucy, one of the spunkiest and smartest 12 year olds I've ever read about. She has a mother that still lives at home and a grumpy grandmother who is trying to hold their finances together. They all work/live in a pharmacy that has been in their family forever. It's barely holding on, and they are struggling to pay the bills. Lucy has a terrific idea to help save the pharmacy and go green (her mom is an activist) to bring together the disparate personalities of both her mom and grandmother and stay lucrative. On top of all that, she deals with first crushes and her new burgeoning makeup side business. Will Lucy be able to pull all of this together to save her beloved pharmacy?Lucy is a TERRIFIC character, and I don't say that lightly. I was thinking while I was reading this book, that she is definitely in the top five characters that I would love to meet in real life. When I have a child, I'd be ecstatic if she had a fraction of the drive, passion, and just overall curiosity and love for life and learning as Lucy does. She is what makes this book-- and her voice definitely sounds 12 even though she's obviously doing a lot more than most 12 year olds (and most growups). I think this book has mass appeal to both the 12 year old audience, and people... my age. :-)My only caveat was that Lucy's personality is so big, and her character so terrific, that she can't be contained in just one book, and at the end, I was so sad to see her go. When preparing for this review, imagine my excitement that there is a followup to this book! I don't actually usually clamor for sequels, but this is an exception to the rule.Overall, a terrific middle grade read that everyone will enjoy with one of the most engaging protagonists I have ever read about. Greenwald puts everything together seamlessly, and I will definitely be watching her career from now on!","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 15, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R21RLL072P4NY0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0810989840#wasThisHelpful","R21RLL072P4NY0","A3RAIR289B2A84","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RAIR289B2A84?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I saw this on sale on Amazon so I knew I had to pick up a copy, especially since I really enjoyed Anna and the French Kiss.Lola and the Boy Next Door by Stephanie Perkins introduces Lola, who is unlike any character I've ever met. She's creative and spunky, but still very much a teenager. She has the perfect rocker boyfriend, two very loving and protective dads, and she wears something crazy every day that she has created herself. But then a childhood crush moves back next door and somehow everything falls apart. Will Lola be able to figure out how she really feels before things really spiral out of control?I absolutely LOVED this book. While I liked and enjoyed Anna and the French Kiss, I loved this book a million times more. I loved Lola, and I loved her character arc. I didn't always like her or agree with her decisions, but she learned a lot and grew, which is the important thing. I loved every description about her awesome gay parents, the details of living on Castro street, and her friends. Lindsey was awesome (can't go wrong with a nerdy Korean best friend!), Cricket was super sweet and hot, and we even get to see Anna and St. Clair again. I think that my favorite character would have to be Calliope, Cricket's talented twin sister, and her arc ended most satisfyingly.At one point last week, I wondered how contemporaries could ever be entertaining since they can't really make up new worlds or magical powers. Stephanie Perkins reminds me how wrong I am-- if a book is written well, regardless of the genre, it can be magical.Overall, a perfectly written book with beautiful descriptions and a unique, unforgettable protagonist. This book is a must read and one of my top reads thus far this year. I will definitely pick up any book Stephanie Perkins writes.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 14, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RH2HE96IP855F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0525423281#wasThisHelpful","RH2HE96IP855F","A3RAIR289B2A84","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RAIR289B2A84?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"After enduring several duds on my list, I decided to treat myself to a book I've been dying to read for a while. I'm not sure what I was expecting, but I loved this book!Unraveling by Elizabeth Norris is about Janelle, a teenaged girl who seems just like any other ordinary teen, until she dies... and is brought back to life by a boy she's never noticed. She believes she has been given a second chance and is determined to live life to the fullest. But she also has a streak of curiosity and wants to find out Ben's secret in addition to helping her FBI agent dad solve a case about several dead people who have apparently been killed by a healthy dose of radiation. To make matters worse, her father has found a device that is ticking down to a certain doomsday. Will Janelle be able to figure out the answers before the clock reaches zero?If I could describe this book in a tagline, it would be Veronica Mars meets Fringe. The first 60% of the book, while beautifully written, doesn't have a ton of surprises. Instead, I would say it is almost an homage of all the wonderful books, movies, and shows that have come before it. In addition to the two I mentioned above, there are shout-outs to X-files, Ender's Game, Before I Fall, and some plot twists that are similar to the teen series and show Roswell. The characters are terrific-- Janelle is a wonderful protagonist-- spunky and smart. Her best friend, Alex, may be my favorite character. Ben is a fascinating love interest, and even though when I realize logically that the way he knows Janelle is kind of creepy, Norris masterfully weaves the story to make it seem normal. The pacing of the story is great, and the last 40% of the book approaches unknown territory, which makes it fun to keep guessing.Overall, a terrific addition to the small but persistent genre of YA science fiction with a great protagonist and plot twists-- I can't wait to pick up the next installment.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 11, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1H6B0PFBHQUL3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00655KLXU#wasThisHelpful","R1H6B0PFBHQUL3","A3RAIR289B2A84","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RAIR289B2A84?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was given this book from Netgalley in exchange for an honest review. Caveat: I feel bad about this review and want the reader of this review to understand that I didn't gravitate towards the first book, so it was highly unlikely that I'd like this one either. If you really loved the first book, you'll probably really enjoy the second book as well because they are similar in content and feel. If I hadn't gotten the book from Netgalley in exchange for a review, I probably wouldn't have read/reviewed it in the first place for those reasons.Point of Retreat by Colleen Hoover takes place soon after the events in Slammed. This time, we see the story through Will's eyes instead of Lake's. Lake's mom has just passed away, and the two of them are raising their brothers simultaneously in neighboring houses. Some events happen to make Lake really question their relationship (and me to question why she is questioning it and punishing Will so much for it), and for Will to get very defensive and whiny, similar to how Lake was in the first book.The strengths of this book are in a couple of places-- a vase that Lake's mom has left for them as a fount of advice, which pulls some heart strings. The second is a moment where we see one of the younger brothers do a very moving slam. It was the first slam that I actually got and FELT.My issues with this book are similar to that of the first book. The YA tropes are again generic and the teenaged issues seem very forced. The Point of Retreat is their label for avoiding sex for the time being to respect Lake's mother's wishes. We see Will overexpressing his feelings physically for her in front of his GRANDMOTHER for peet's sake and he doesn't realize until later how Lake feels about that? There are other forced plot twists that make me want to just shake both characters and tell them to communicate for ONCE, and stop saying ""carving pumpkins"" over and over as if that's a meaningful phrase.OK, end of rant. Again, if you loved the first book, read this one because you'll enjoy it. If you didn't love the first book, pass on this one as well.","2.0 out of 5 stars","May 10, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R31KRMGCFYZ2FW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008TRU9HU#wasThisHelpful","R31KRMGCFYZ2FW","A3RAIR289B2A84","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RAIR289B2A84?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I received the sequel to this book, Point of Retreat, so I knew I had to read this one first. It's been getting a lot of buzz in the blogosphere so I already had it on my TBR list.Slammed by Colleen Hoover stars Layken, a teenaged girl who just lost her father and then was forced to relocate with the rest of her family to Michigan. She meets a handsome boy next door who she realizes later is her teacher. They both battle their feelings for each other as they know their relationship can't happen.We've all seen this movie. Girl falls in love with unattainable boy for some reason-- here he's a teacher. There's some poetry involved, which is rather unfortunate because even though it is the most original part of the book, it loses a lot of its possible effect in text form. We have to imagine the cadence of the words that are italicized for emphasis.I don't really understand why there's so much manufactured drama in this book. Sure, he's her teacher, but she's a senior, and is going to graduate soon. Why can't they wait a year? But there's a lot of crying and carrying on. There are also some plot twists that made me groan out loud-- a trope that has been overdone.The best part of this book was Layken's best friend, Eddie, who was original. I think I would have liked a book in her perspective.I have to say I was pretty disappointed in this book-- I hope that there is a bit more originality in the follow up.","2.0 out of 5 stars","May 9, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R297FFLIF73XH4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1476715904#wasThisHelpful","R297FFLIF73XH4","A3RAIR289B2A84","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RAIR289B2A84?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was given this book from the author in exchange for an honest review.Finding Abigail by Christina Smith stars a woman stuck in an impossible situation. She's fallen in love with a guy who reveals his true nature after they get engaged-- he physically abuses her. She knows she has to escape, and when she does, she starts her life over. Will she be able to get over her past in order to move forward with her present and possibly find love?Finding Abigail treads familiar ground. We have the woman who is stuck in a bad relationship, and a guy who is controlling and beats her. When Abby changes her name and her life, we've seen this before in multiple romance novels. That said, the characters are what make this book succeed. Abigail is a terrific character, and I loved all of the background about her being a writer. I do feel like this is a case of writing what you know, and Christina Smith definitely knows about this. I enjoyed the supportive cast a lot-- Abby has some really great friends that pop off of the page. I also love the grandmotherly figure who plays a key part in her life in multiple ways-- I'll leave the reader to discover her on his own.I have to say, I wasn't too thrilled by the second love interest. Noah is also overprotective and pretty pushy with Abby. I guess she gravitates towards that sort of man, but I love when her confident side comes out and wished I saw that more. I also have an issue with epilogues in general, so everything seemed to resolve a little too easily.That said, this was a great beach read. It's well paced and a quick read with a engaging protagonist.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 9, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R19LK32PK9BDDV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1481247905#wasThisHelpful","R19LK32PK9BDDV","A3RAIR289B2A84","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RAIR289B2A84?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was given this book by the author in exchange for an honest review.Aire by Lena Goldfinch is a historical fantasy that stars a young Italian princess named Anna, who has the power to see the future. This is a power she keeps hidden from everyone because others might not understand. Her hand in marriage is given to a suitor who she doesn't love, and in a burst of rebellion, she flees the dance that would announce this betrothal. As she flees, her boat is caught by mercenaries who mistake her clothmaiden for her. What happens next is a whirlwind of Anna trying to find her missing friend, falling in love for the first time, and learning how to think for herself.The setting of this novel is beautiful-- we get the sense of the vastness and gorgeousness of Italian royalty. There is plenty of intrigue and plot twists. Anna is a good protagonist, and we also get to see in the head of the male protagonist, Jovanni. The supporting characters are strong, especially Ilan, one of her favorite servants. The last 20% of the novel moves at a quick pace and at that point, is hard to put down.I did feel that the middle section dragged quite a bit, as we keep getting told that Anna and Jovanni are looking for the missing girl, and a lot of wandering takes place. I also wasn't a big fan of the Italian words that were plugged into the text to remind us she was in Italy-- but that's more a personal preference.Overall, a beautifully written historical fantasy that introduces us to some great characters.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 8, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJCV8HJ1ME2WG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=148270403X#wasThisHelpful","RJCV8HJ1ME2WG","A3RAIR289B2A84","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RAIR289B2A84?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was given this book by another blogger in anticipation of the sequel coming out. I figured I better get caught up with this first installment.The Serpent's Ring by HB Bolton is a middle grade fantasy that reminds me at time of Percy Jackson and his adventures or The last of the really great whangdoodles by Julie Andrews. We join two siblings, Evan and Claire, as they find the magical Serpent's Ring and are swept away to another world by a couple of imps. Quickly, the ring is stolen, and the two siblings have to use their newfound powers to get it back. They meet some wonderful friends along the way who help them on their journey.I really enjoyed reading this first installment. Bolton has a great imagination and she makes up some great new creatures as well as new recipes (that you can even make at the end) to entice the reader. The two siblings are very likeable as well as their companions that they meet along the way. The pacing is good, and we are whipped from place to place as they strive to find the ring.Overall, this is a fun quick read, and I look forward to reading the sequel!","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 8, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3WLYM0UCKZ0M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1478332573#wasThisHelpful","R3WLYM0UCKZ0M","A3RAIR289B2A84","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RAIR289B2A84?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I want to thank Winterhaven Books, a wonderful blog, who hosted a terrific interview with the author, Tabitha Suzuma. I would also like to thank Tabitha, for sending me a beautiful hardcover and signed copy of Forbidden. It has made its way into my heart and also my favorite books bookshelf.Forbidden by Tabitha Suzuma is about two siblings, Lochan and Maya, who are closer than most. They have been placed in an impossible situation-- a father who has abandoned them and a mother who is an alcoholic who tries to forget they exist as well as three younger siblings that they take care of in addition to their heavy load of schoolwork. It is clear that they can only depend on each other and that no one else can understand their situation. But this abnormal situation leads to an even more dysfunctional outcome-- they fall in love. As their feelings for each other accelerate, they strive to keep their home life as normal as possible for the other children. It is a tricky balance to maintain, and unsurprisingly, everything starts to fall apart.I have to give major props to Tabitha. This book was an extremely risky one to write with its very taboo subject of incest. She took a very repugnant topic that most people can't even think about without gagging, and introduced two very compelling and relatable characters who are caught in a situation that they never wanted to be in. You can't help but fall in love with both Lochan and Maya and almost root for them, knowing that this relationship can't end in any good way. The prose is absolutely beautiful, and devastatingly so. Suzuma writes gorgeously, and I felt swept away by both the emotion in the alternating voices of her protagonists as well as the rich description she embodies in her text. The pacing is pitch perfect, and the supporting characters are deftly drawn.Overall, this book is a risk that pays off-- Suzuma has written a masterpiece--a novel that will stand the test of time. This story will haunt you for days to come.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 7, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R18VOZ191PZ1DK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1442419962#wasThisHelpful","R18VOZ191PZ1DK","A3RAIR289B2A84","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RAIR289B2A84?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I won this book from Keely of the wonderful blog Realms of an Open Mind. Honest disclosure: I've heard great things about this book on the internet, but the cover is not my favorite-- so I really wasn't sure I'd like it. Once I cracked open the cover and started the first few pages though, I was hooked.The Collector by Victoria Scott stars Dante Walker who is the bad of the bad. He collects souls for the Big Boss (I think we all know who that is alluding to). To get the promotion he's been waiting for, he has to lure a girl, Charlie, to the dark side. Charlie is a teenaged girl-- but unlike a lot of our typical heroines these days, she's nerdy, unattractive, and gangly. Dante doesn't know why she is so special, and he has 10 days to get her soul. But a few days with Charlie shows him what he's been missing his whole life-- what will he risk for this girl he just met but strangely, starts to care about so deeply?The Collector doesn't have a whole lot of unique ideas-- we get the good girl seeing the ""good"" in the bad guy and changing him slowly to the good. We have devils and angels. And yet... Dante is a very unique perspective. I've never heard anything like his voice, and he is truly what makes this book work and succeed. Dante is a hugely flawed character, but you can't help but like him (even when he is crazy full of himself and flaunting his assets). Usually, I don't like expletives in YA, but for Dante, it just fits his voice, and honestly, I didn't even notice it, I was so drawn to his character. OK, and yeah, he's a bit hot. I thought I was over the whole bad guy craze, but apparently, not so much. :-)And don't even get me started on Charlie. She's the other unexpected surprise in this book. She is so atypical for a heroine but so honestly good that you can't help but love her. She reminds me a lot of myself when I was her age-- just very awkward and definitely not popular and sheltered, but at the same time, very firm in her beliefs.Overall, The Collector is the first terrific entry in the Dante Walker series. The characters are truly what makes this book sing-- they are unique, fascinating, and above all, likeable. Victoria Scott is an author to watch.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 7, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1P892KUY683QR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1620612429#wasThisHelpful","R1P892KUY683QR","A3RAIR289B2A84","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RAIR289B2A84?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was given this book by the publisher in exchange for an honest review.Too Much Blood is the second Toni Day Mystery book by Jane Bennett Munro. Toni is a pathologist who works in a small town and finds herself caught up in the mysterious death of a slimeball that enrolled most of the doctors in the town in a Ponzi scheme, which lost them most of their savings. Needless to say, plenty of people wanted this man dead. At the same time, Toni is struggling with her marriage-- it seems that her husband is drifting. Will she be able to solve the murder mystery and save her marriage at the same time?OK. I give this book props for having a lot of accurate medical details, because I'm really into that. But what sorrows me is that I really wanted this to be a book I liked, since this is my kind of genre. Unfortunately, I was seriously disappointed.I had a ton of issues with this book.1. In the very first chapter of this book, Toni's home phone rings in the middle of the night and her husband picks it up. First, what about a pager? A pager on vibrate? A cell phone? How has this never occurred to her through medical school, residency, and now her job? If I were her husband, I would have lost it much sooner.2. Toni Day is extremely nosy and a really unlikeable character. If a character is going to carry a whole set of books named after her, she'd better be someone people want to read about. I was hoping she would grow and develop over the book, but she was the main reason I couldn't finish it. She is pushy, arrogant and says the most inappropriate things like she is on the autistic spectrum. I personally would want to divorce her too.3. Toni uses the excuse that since she did the autopsy on the dead man that this gives her the right to ask all sorts of invasive questions to people she barely knows. In what universe is this okay?4. Toni looks up confidential medical information on several people who are definitely not in her care (she's a pathologist for crying out loud, she doesn't take care of live patients) in order to ""solve the case."" Again, HIPAA laws anyone? That is completely inappropriate and really puts doctors in a bad light, because it suggests that we think this is okay. It's NOT. People get fired for doing things like that all the time.5. Pacing. This book just could not keep my interest.In the end, I just had to put it down. Because of the unlikeable protagonist, the plot devices that just didn't make any sense, and the lack of good pacing, this book was definitely not for me.","1.0 out of 5 stars","May 3, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R15ZBIFSCJNWTP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1475929188#wasThisHelpful","R15ZBIFSCJNWTP","A3RAIR289B2A84","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RAIR289B2A84?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

" 4:11 Mins Just so you know, me and my wife are not pros on toys, and this is the first one of this kind that we get a hold off. So we are just reviewing this one based on how we feel the first time we got this.Ok, I always wanted to have one of this style cause it was sooo famous on japanese porn.. lol!! I was so curious on how powerful this thing is. However even with full charge I think I have seen some vibes before which is much powerful than this one, although those have different design. However, this hitachi thing can focus all those vibration power in 1 place.You can check my video to see more, however here are few more things:On the video, I wasn't able to play with the small purple button, I was just able to learn about it after I finished doing the video. What it does is it gives a pulsing kind of movement to the vibe. However you need to hold that down to work (which is a good and bad thing, good if you want control, bad if you are too lazy to hold it)Seems smaller than those I saw here in amazonIt's wireless and rechargeableYou can really use it as a massager as well.. yeah, I tried it, hahaha. well almost 80% of massagers give vibration anyway, This vibrates and works.4 stars - cause it will be great if its waterproof and has better power.Just check my video to see more.DISCLAIMER: I Got this product for FREE or DISCOUNTED RATE for my unbiased and HONEST REVIEW.My opinions are of my own and never manipulated in any kind.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3Q9W7NA7HQZ8F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HVSWXAE#wasThisHelpful","R3Q9W7NA7HQZ8F","A1F7KVCPJ7HC85","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1F7KVCPJ7HC85?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

BUT NOT THIS ONE.This one is a magical wand that stimulates the ""oh so magical g-spot"" where everyone debates where it is or if it actually exists.. lolOk aside from the fact that you can insert it to your ""vajayjay"" here are the things you need to know:Wash it before using it, there are instructions included.Instead of just vibrating non stop.. it has a ""up and down"" movement which mimics the ""come here"" movement with your finger that experts suggest you do to stimulate the g-spotIt's battery operated, so it's wireless, use it anywhere you want... (keep it private. lol)It's not so big, not so small, which I think is great unless you are the ""SIZE MATTERS"" kind of girlIt has 6 modes of speed, demonstrated on my video.Just see my video to know moreDISCLAIMER: I Got this product for FREE or DISCOUNTED RATE for my unbiased and HONEST REVIEW.My opinions are of my own and never manipulated in any kind.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1W2KA3HTG76CF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AT0S9RW#wasThisHelpful","R1W2KA3HTG76CF","A1F7KVCPJ7HC85","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1F7KVCPJ7HC85?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 5:14 Mins For beginners, newbies or just someone who wants to turn the cube. Its great for you guys. Comes out of the box ready to play cause its lubed already. Better than other regular cubes you buy out there in local stores which are not lubed.Now for wannabe speedcubers, speedcubers already or someone who just wants to be faster. Here are the much more needed info you need to know:Its a standard color scheme cube - meaning red is on the other side of orange , blue to green, yellow to white. (its no japanese scheme)Stickers are already placed on the cube (not like other cube wherein the sticker needs to be placed by you)Its a bright set stickers, more of like reflectorized. The effect differs on each cuber, some cuber practice with bright set then go to normal set and get their times faster or slower.. its a case by case basisIts a white base cube, again.. if you are used to black base cube the effect can differ on each cuber.. you can become faster or slower.. the thing here is we dont know if its gonna be better for your ""look ahead"" ""recognition"" which is the key to be faster.. The faster you see what your next step in solving the cube is, the faster you will be.The center caps can be removed so you can adjust the tension of your cubeIts a modern design cube, meaning the edges and corners are rounded from inside for more smooth movement and monster cutting corners.Its good for one hand cubing as wellfor 12 solves, I didnt popped it once. I am not saying its not gonna pop on you, but mine so far is not popping, but just in case if it does in the future, I will not be surprised since its normal anyway.Overall, this is a great cube from beginners to advance.DISCLAIMER: I Got this product for FREE or DISCOUNTED RATE for my unbiased and HONEST REVIEW.My opinions are of my own and never manipulated in any kind.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3LTCGBN964BPO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OTI8KCE#wasThisHelpful","R3LTCGBN964BPO","A1F7KVCPJ7HC85","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1F7KVCPJ7HC85?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

You might be wondering why I gave it 4 stars even after I said 3 or 3.5 on my video.Here's Why:We've been gardening a lot and I gave the 2 other pairs to my 2 Aunts who are doing landscaping with me. When I gave them the gloves, they were amazed on the design. But they still smelled the rubbery thing and sticky feeling on the palm area of the gloves.After wearing for quite sometime, they commented that gloves are great compared to those regular plastic kind, yellow or green gloves you see on hardware store because your hand can actually breathe from the back.Also the smell starts to wear off and the sticky thing is almost gone (Im thinking cause of the dirt it got already)I myself is helping pick up the twigs and other branches that has some thorns and this thing protected me, I got no splinters or anything.I'm still not giving it perfect 5 cause of the smell though, it gave me headache!DISCLAIMER: I Got this product for FREE or DISCOUNTED RATE for my unbiased and HONEST REVIEW.My opinions are of my own and never manipulated in any kind.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2IU89CV0UDNNM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YAZDHDI#wasThisHelpful","R2IU89CV0UDNNM","A1F7KVCPJ7HC85","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1F7KVCPJ7HC85?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Surprise!However its a good thing, cause the box of the scooter itself is damaged so the amazon box protected it.Upon opening the box you will find 3 things, a manual, a basket and the almost assembled scooter. Why almost? Because its basically done and all you need to do are few things to assemble it (check video)Things I like about it;Its packaged well, a box within a box.Its easy to assemble, I was able to assemble it within minutes with just glances on drawings on the manual.Its actually comfortable to ride on. Good breaks and high quality stainless steels are used.The knee cushion is comfortable as well and removes the stress on your knees.If you are not using it for your knees, the kids will be so happy to ride with it and play! :)If you have problem playing the video here, pls go to : https://youtu.be/2FDC8oITQTEDisclaimer: Got the product for free or with great discount in exchange of my honest and unbiased review.

"I actually highly recommend these books for older kids (maybe 10 and above) when planning trips.  This came just in time for a trip we are planning to Italy in the spring.  It allows my kids to see pictures and help plan with some of the things they are interested.I learned when we planned a trip to Brazil that allowing the kids to search on the Internet for things they might want to see was a bad idea.  Other than trip advisor, there was too much garbage to sift through. It was too overwhelming.I still like to search the internet, but find this a great starting point.  As with all these types of books, much of this data can be obsolete quickly, which makes the internet a nice resource, but your kids can still cut up and use the books for school projects etc.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RN87B58EGCGWS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1101878363#wasThisHelpful","RN87B58EGCGWS","A1XVF5DU3N05OM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XVF5DU3N05OM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am elated about this product.  I have been using the Eucerine moisturizing (heavy) cream on my 9 year old for years.  It is hard to work into the skin and is very sticky, but has been the best product I have found until now.This is a heavy lotion, not a ""cream"". It too is sticky, although not quite as sticky, and the feeling goes away decently fast.  Within a few hours his dryness was noticeably less.  I will continue to use this.The only thing that was crazy was the tube was so full that it kept spilling out.  I wish they would make the tube bigger.

"I really like this product.  It comes with several items, including little boxes that hold all the stuff for 2 different little girls, with the idea that two best friends can use it.Pros:1 - Household items are easily obtained (baking soda, dish soap, lemon juice, water etc.)2 - Teaches you how the cool things work. (I also like that it gives you alternatives - Yellow highlighter3 - It doesn't just give you all the products, it teaches you how to make some of them (cabbage paper)4 - Well constructed kit.  Everything didn't just fall apart, and a lot is includedCons:1 - My one con is a little unfair, I will admit, I don't like that it is only marketed to girls.  Boys have the spy products, but this is one of the better kits I have seen, and it is marketed only to girls.  My boys do a lot of this secret code stuff on their own, and this would be fun to have for them too.  I don't mind it being marketed strictly to girls, but why not have a boys version too?  My boys don't mind the pink/purple, or the hearts, but almost every page in the book has just girls on it.

At first I was a little disappointed that there were no step by step instructions, but then I thought through that.  First, it would take a lot more pages, and would either miss a golden price point because the book was too expensive, or there wouldn't be as many ideas.  I also like that it sparks creativity, instead of the step by step instructions.  The more I got into the book, the more I liked it.  It seems that Lego sets these days are built once, and put away.

"To start off, this is built so much better than the old hot wheels sets.  Those sets would come apart before you even had a chance to try them.  They have the new tongue and clip pieces to keep them together.  I do think however that if you took this apart it several times it might start to come apart easier.  This is definitely a toy that you will have to setup and store setup.  The dimensions on the website are for the box only.  I would recommend a 3 x 2 foot area for good play.The coolest part about these sets, besides going back to the old school track packs, is that you can add additional sets.  You could build a huge track.  I remember as kids we just had the track packs as kids and would set up huge racing courses. That was so fun.I will mention that this only comes with one car.  I wish it came with more, but as these are reasonably priced toys, that is okay.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1RS5I9WKFJBL7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00T03TFLI#wasThisHelpful","R1RS5I9WKFJBL7","A1XVF5DU3N05OM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XVF5DU3N05OM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is just the absolute best grill cover ever! I have had several grill covers to try and review, and while I thought I had found the best cover on my last one, this is far superior.As with all grill covers, time will tell, but this material is just amazing.  I have loved my canvas covers, but they seem to last two seasons at most.  I have tried some of those light weight covers and they get shredded in the wind within a couple of months.  There have been some blend materials that I have loved, and we are still watching those.  This one is a heavy duty PVC with double stitching.  I will be interested to see if it loses shape in the heat, or if the stitching tears.  With the canvas, I have always had tears before the stitching breaks.This cover is dark black, so it is hot to pull off.  It is also decently heavy.  It has side mesh vents on the bottom, as well as velcro for a tight fit.We have a kenmore grill that is 58"" across and this fit nicely.  I generally buy a medium grill cover, but this one fit nicely in a large.

"We started off loving the Spirit Animals series.  But like the past couple of books, this one falls short.  This is a new series spinning off of the Spirit Animals.  It has a similar story line...bad guys, good guys, animals. I didn't feel like there was any one character that you fall in love with and want to follow through an adventure.  My kids also struggle as they switch off authors and writing styles from book to book.  I have two animal lovers (in fact one loves animals so much he is a vegetarian), and neither really felt interested enough to read another one in the series.I do wish this series would have resonated more with my kids.  It is so hard to find age appropriate books for advanced readers, and these are it.  If they just held their interest better.  I do hope they get better, and I will try the next one in the series.I love what another reviewer said...you don't love this book, but it isn't the worst either.

"If I were to review these books I would give them a zero star review.  They are crass and silly, and perfect for boys in first and second grade, their target audience.  With that in mind, my kids, having loved books 1-10 (they hated 11), give it a one or two stars.  This review is composed of my children's opinions:It is boring.  (The potty jokes are actually pretty minimal in this one.  The ones that I saw in there, I don't think the kids understood.)  The book has the characters going to the future and becoming parents.  This created many adult themes that kids mentioned and didn't care about.  They don't like to think about being parents.Flip pages didn't work.  It was a good idea, but my kids tried, and they just didn't work with their smaller fingers, and such few pages.At the end of the day these books have always been written to a second grade audience.  The potty humor is great for kids, I think most adults are just thrilled their children are reading.  But in this story they go into the future, and they are grown-ups, talking about grown-up things.  My kids lost all interest.  In the past the books were about their silly escapades at school and other kid realms.  This book is touching on hot button issues that don't seem to resonate with the kids.  They are touching on going to a mental hospital, one of the characters is gay in the future, ladies are drawn in their underwear.  The themes just weren't anything my young kids relate to. I personally would rather talk to my kids about some of these things, especially mental hospitals, in a more sensitive manner.  Our world is in crisis, and it just felt like a strange arena to be touching on sensitive issues... in a potty book.**I gave it two stars, instead of one because he made a note that it was going to be more adult because of the complaints.  It was what he watned to do, it just misses the target audience.","2.0 out of 5 stars","June 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R31204AL7MXSP6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0545504929#wasThisHelpful","R31204AL7MXSP6","A1XVF5DU3N05OM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XVF5DU3N05OM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I love this.  I will never buy a non ceramic iron again.  I have long, thick hair, about three inches below my shoulder (It takes over 15 minutes to dry with a blow dryer). The iron  heated quickly and I could curl a fair amount of thick hair in a quick time.  In less than five minutes I had my hair just the way I like it with heat rollers, only those don't curl evenly.  The roll function worked great, but it takes some getting used to.  You have to make sure you don't get other hair tangled up while it rolls up. It comes with a hot pad so you don't burn your hand, but I don't find that very useful.  The tip did get fairly hot which surprised me a little.I would recommend this product, I liked the large size of the barrel.  It was easy to use, and heated quickly.  While this brand of products is of high quality, I am thinking this would really just be beneficial to someone that styles hair all day long, but I am thrilled with it for every day use.Pros:Ceramic barrelSizeEven heating of hair.  Less than 30 seconds for strand to curl.Heats up in secondsElectric roll function was nice and easy.Cons:I don't really understand the heat/function buttons, but it doesn't seem to change the functionality of it.PriceI will update my review as I continue to use it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R232VC1DDB49ZD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RLRCA0I#wasThisHelpful","R232VC1DDB49ZD","A1XVF5DU3N05OM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XVF5DU3N05OM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a supposedly a more natural approach from Miracle Grow.  I thought from their website, and the product description it would be ""organic"", but they never actually say that.  You still cannot use it on the vegetables the day before, or the day of harvesting.  It is still considered a pesticide.  You still have to be careful how you treat with it, and dispose of the bottle.  It still has chemicals in it.  That being said, the stuff seems to work. I put it on some small rose plants that had aphids on them and took care of them right away.We have several beehives, and year after year our bees are taken out by pesticides.  We lose at least one hive a year.  The very best thing you can do for your plants is get some bees.  Our neighbors love it.  Their fruit production has at least doubled from the work of the bees.  You will still get bugs, and in cooler climates, you may need vitamins and things in fertilizers to beef up your plants before winter.  Having said that, it is important to be careful.  We have used a liquid soap spray on our fruit trees, some people spray oil, and try not to use anything on our plants.

"We own almost every nerf gun that was ever made, and this one is an average gun.  The price point is pretty low, which is good.  Most of their guns are 20+ dollars.

The aim was off, and it didn't shoot very far.  I don't know if it was just ours, or what.  Also, the extension broke off in the first battle.All in all I wouldn't pick this gun unless you need a cheap birthday present.

"Love the hat. I have one of those heads which always falls between sizes, and this hat was no exception -- according to the measurements, my head was exactly between medium and large. Based on other people's reviews here, I went for the medium, and it turns out to have been a perfect fit.I know the chin strap is considered a selling feature, but honestly I don't like how it looks and there's no easy way to tuck it out of the way without complicated and unsightly looping around the brim. So I just removed it.Even though the hat is labeled as men's, it looks just fine on me and yesterday when I was out shopping, I received two different compliments on it.Pros: Weathered but not tattered look. Comfortable to wear and not too hot. Overall, an attractive hat that looks like it'll keep its shape, and it seems pretty durable overall.Cons: Not all might like the weathered look, and whatever one gets is going to be somewhat random. Mine looks most artificially worn near the top of the crown, but it's even and doesn't look fake or like I dumped bleach on it. Another downside is this isn't a hat I'd take where it's going to need to be crumpled, because it pretty clearly wouldn't handle that well -- the wire shaping the brim, for example, doesn't seem like it'd take being crushed that often before breaking.Overall though, this has become my new favorite hat, and it was very reasonably priced, too. Even if I only get a few years' wear from it before it needs replacing, it will have been worth it, I feel certain.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2K08FTO9377UM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002BTUCKG#wasThisHelpful","R2K08FTO9377UM","A1AHII2R0R6FAE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1AHII2R0R6FAE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm a total convert to 'BoreSnake' gun cleaners now, after decades of using those screw-together aluminum rods. I've done side-by-side comparisons of cleaning guns from .17 varmint rifles to shotguns between traditional cleaning kits and the BoreSnake method -- and in every case, the BoreSnake results are faster and visibly cleaner. It's my opinion as well that it's a whole lot easier using the BoreSnake than it is to try to force cleaning patches through the smallest caliber long-guns, such as the aforementioned varmint rifle.I have noticed at times though that it can be a little rough pulling the cord through. So one thing I've done with my cleaning kit, is I've added a notched dowel rod about an inch in diameter and about four inches long. I wrap the end of the BoreSnake's cord around that and it's way easier to pull it through the barrel. Easier on my hands anyway.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R247TQ5ETIPN8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0014VTW12#wasThisHelpful","R247TQ5ETIPN8","A1AHII2R0R6FAE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1AHII2R0R6FAE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Nice key holder to solve that problem of ""Ow, my keys keep jabbing me in the leg."" It does a nice job of holding keys securely and compactly.Pros:- Expandable from 2 to 8 keys- Includes lots of spacers and also some screw-in extenders to make change the base model from 2-4 keys up to 5 to 8 keys.Cons:- There are no instructions provided. You have to go online to find them and even then they are extremely sparse and not very clear. Basically, the idea is you need to have an even number of keys and/or spacers (or the lanyard holder) on both sides in order for the thing to screw back together again. And the stacked keys and spacers must be flush with the top of the pivots.- You cannot use any plastic-coated keys inside the unit, as they will be waaaay too wide to fit. Also, there are some keys with plastic or rubber inlays, such as one of our Kwikset keys, which doesn't fit...I had to switch to a spare one we'd had cut at the hardware store.- For the price paid, it would've been nice to have the expanders and the spacers in something other than a plain tear-open plastic bag.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R31HYNL5BQJIMT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JXQQRJ0#wasThisHelpful","R31HYNL5BQJIMT","A1AHII2R0R6FAE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1AHII2R0R6FAE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The Nebo Big Magnum Larry is a really nice area/worklight that is crazy super-bright. It came with 3-AA batteries already installed and I about blinded myself when I first turned it on. I'm both surprised and impressed by the sheer lumen output of the light, which is this newer COB (chips on board) LED technology. Instead of just a point source, the whole yellow area on the front of the light shine evenly. The illustrations don't totally make it clear, but it's about 7 1/2 inches long and roughly 1 inch in diameter (wider at the light part).Pros:- Very well made out of machine-grade aluminum for all parts but the rubberized push-button switch on top and the plastic lens in front of the LED stripe.- Not kidding, on the high setting, it's like a bright lightbulb in your hand and it really floods the entire area with light.- Has three settings -- 400 lumens super-bright, 150 lumens dimmer (still enough to see by in many circumstances), and a red flashing mode (honestly, I'd trade this for three brightness settings, like 400, 200, and 100...I cannot ever see a need for a flashing red flashlight for my intended uses).- According to the box, it should be good for about 4.5 hours on high, 15 hours on low, and 40 hours on flash. That's really good for just three AA batteries.- The fact it uses standard AA batteries and not some specialized or rare type.- Magnet on the base is strong enough to hold the flashlight in a horizontal position, but it should be noted that it can slide if on a really smooth surface (learned that when I knocked it off the metal waste basket I was testing it on).Cons:- It is heavy, not the kind of flashlight one could easily carry in a shirt pocket.- Bit of a shame there isn't any kind of clip or hook on the light. It'd be awesome otherwise, and I think the only major problem with this particular flashlight. However, given the price I paid, it's not enough to consider deducting a star. (I'm thinking maybe if I could stick a metal cup-hook of some kind onto the magnet, that might do the trick for times when I need to hang the light.)- I do have some concerns that it might be possible to scratch or break the plastic lens over the LED strip. Let's just say I won't be tossing this into my toolbox.- Noticed the batteries rattle a little bit inside when the flashlight is shaken. Shouldn't be a big problem though, and the light itself doesn't flicker when I do this. Still, I might make myself a thin cardboard spacer to run down alongside the batteries to hold them a little more firmly.""Just Is"":- The yellow strip you see on the upper front of the flashlight is all there is, which makes this a great area worklight, but it doesn't have any kind of focusable beam LED like I've seen on some other models.Would I buy again? Absolutely, especially for the price I paid. I do a lot of computer hardware work and DIY work around the house, and this little worklight is exactly what I needed. Would I recommend it to others? Yes. Flashlights sure have come a long, long way since I was young...","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3VRK8NTEUGRFB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012DH2KG4#wasThisHelpful","R3VRK8NTEUGRFB","A1AHII2R0R6FAE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1AHII2R0R6FAE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Hopefully this is reasonably accurate, but the meter arrived with dead batteries, which weren't that cheap to replace. On the other hand, the numbers it read from the well water and rain water I needed to test appeared to be about right, so I can't complain too much. Nevertheless, shipping with dead batteries is why I rated at one star only.If there's a chance of discharge, the batteries should've been protected by a removable plastic tab or something.Update: 21 July 2015 -- The seller reached out to me and sent me replacement batteries. As a consequence, I've upgraded this particular review from 1 star to 3.

"Easy, hassle-free home lighting automation in a box -- and at a decent price. I'll be honest and admit I had no great desire for app-enabled part of the Hue system. I do not carry my smartphone with me all the time. This, plus the extra light switch unit seemed too much money for no real added convenience.But pair this with an Amazon Echo? ""Alexa. Office lights, sixty percent."" ""Okay."" Instant techno-squee. (If Amazon ever adds Hue's 'Scenes' support to the Echo, it'll be perfection.)The other nice thing about the Hue hub system is many other lights and devices appear to be compatible with it, including the very affordable GE Link LED bulbs. I started with just the two bulbs in this set. Then added two more Lux bulbs for my Tiffany-style desk lamp. Then added several GE Link bulbs in other lamps and light fixtures. I think we're up to ten bulbs total now, and Alexa can control them all. I love it.One day I might add some of the actual Hue bulbs to the setup...but for now, just having voice-controlled lighting is awesome. As for the Hue unit itself, setup was dead easy. Plug it in, pair it with the lights and name them, create some scenes for group light control. The one suggestion I have is to add just one light at a time -- the hub seems to get confused when several bulbs are attempting to pair at the same time. The only complaint I have/had is the included instructions do not make it clear that in order to complete the setup, you MUST go to the Google Play or Apple App store and download (and use) the Hue app. The app is also required when adding more lights to your setup. The hub's blue LEDs are kind of bright, too...probably best to hide it somewhere out of sight. You also need to have a home network to use this product (as in, the hub needs to be plugged into your router).Pros:- Easy setup (once you have the app installed and running)- Seems quite good at finding new lights when we add them, but sometimes it's necessary to press the pairing button on the hub- Very good, natural light color from the Lux bulbsCons:- Not clear at all from the instructions you have to have the app- Can't control your lights if your home network is down, but it does seem you can at least turn on/off your lights from the switch they're already on- If you have a very large house, there might be hub range issues (although we haven't encountered these, as our place isn't that big)Wish list:- Wish they had a brighter A19 style bulb. These emulate an old-style 60w incandescent and are bright enough for that, but in some places it'd be nice to have a 100w equivalent, as in a 15w LED type.- Wish the Hue bulbs and LED strips were less expensive.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R20VUX53O6AP57/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ME9CDQE#wasThisHelpful","R20VUX53O6AP57","A1AHII2R0R6FAE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1AHII2R0R6FAE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As I've remarked in other food-related reviews, taste is subjective. Chances are you'll either really like the Shin Noodle Black or really not like it. I fall into the former category. I found a case of this instant soup at our local Costco about six months ago...and then never again. Found individual cups available at our local grocery store...and balked at the ridiculous price for it. We're talking nearly four bucks for a single cup.To heck with that -- I looked on Amazon and almost instantly added two cases of six cups each to our bi-monthly Subscribe & Save list.In terms of portion, this is a rather hearty size, larger than the usual instant noodle cup, although it may look like less of a portion because the dried noodles only come up to the halfway point or so in the cup. There are two 'flavoring' packets to be added before the boiling hot water. Although the fill line is only around the point of the dividing line between the top black stripe and the middle red one, I usually fill to within a half inch of the top -- just because I like the broth. It's rich, spicy, and flavorful...and light years better tasting than the usual chicken or beef-flavored (emphasis on the 'flavored' part) instant noodle cups.I also rather like the fact the cups aren't styrofoam, but waxed cardstock.For what it's worth, if the cost is still too much, there are less expensive Nonshim Noodle Cups, with smaller portions and just one flavor packet. Tastes almost as good...but I like to splurge a bit on these Black cups instead.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RY5XCNORWRE8M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BEIKRBY#wasThisHelpful","RY5XCNORWRE8M","A1AHII2R0R6FAE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1AHII2R0R6FAE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Got expensive drill bits for drilling into metal? Buy this cutting oil. Not only does it help to protect the drill bits and hole cutters, it also makes the drilling go faster.We bought a set of cobalt bits for putting up a metal pipe-frame structure, because much of it required putting in so-called 'self-tapping' screw-bolts -- where the 'self-tapping' part was a joke, especially on curved steel pipes. The cutting fluid/oil made a world of difference for drilling pilot holes.I also used the CRS 03400 on some Greenlee hole cutters for going through the side of a steel building and it helped a lot.

"Gets the job done, nothing fancy though. Clamping the cable can be a bit tricky because the thumb screw isn't very precise. But basically you clamp the cable, squeeze the cutter with one hand to bring the cutting disk into contact with the cable, and give the handle a few turns until it spins freely. After that, you can slide the cut metal part off the end of the cable.Main caveats as I saw them are twofold: (1) After cutting, you have to slide the outer cladding off the end of the cable; there's no way to remove the cladding from the middle of a line. (Not sure why one would want to do this, but I just thought I'd mention it.) (2) The edge in the cladding left behind can be jagged and sharp.

"The Melita #2 natural brown is a really good filter for pour-through coffee. Does the job and is compostable, which was a requirement for me. Only advice I have for folks not familiar with these kinds of filters or using a pour-through cone is you HAVE to fold at the creases or else risk a seam rupture and a ruined mug of extra lumpy coffee. First fold the bottom edge just above the pressed-seal crease, then fold the side at that crease. Put into the cone and fill with appropriate amount of fresh ground coffee. (I have a large mug; for me it's 3 1/2 scoops.)For the best coffee, drizzle not-quite-boiling water over the grounds until they're reasonably wet, then pour a bit at a time, taking care not to flood the grounds too much. Seeing a light layer of foam appear on top of the grounds is a good thing.

"I needed a set of lag screws and tar pads to install a tripod mount at the peak of our metal roof and these were perfect for the job. I did drill some pilot holes to start with, but the screws went in just fine and securely. And with the tar pad, I feel confident the holes I just put into my roof won't leak. My only advice would be to be sure you can order these via Prime or otherwise free shipping, because they're worth what I paid (about six bucks) but not more than that.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R7UZZBEG184MG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003EB3C4S#wasThisHelpful","R7UZZBEG184MG","A1AHII2R0R6FAE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1AHII2R0R6FAE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We needed a good sturdy and stable mount to move a WAN WiFi receiver from a dormer roof up to the peak, in preparation for installing solar panels on a nearby garage which was going to otherwise block the receiver. Further complicating matters is we have a fairly steep-pitched metal roof. This tripod mount seems to have been perfect for the job, with the L-shaped feet able to rotate so as to lay flat against the slope, with one leg on one side of the roof and two legs on the other. I had been worried I might have to bend the feet to fit the roof, but that turned out not to be the case.The construction of the mount is solid and the brass nuts at the middle and top allow for pretty easy leveling of the post once installed. The post itself is steel apparently, which meant I was able to just use a small magnetic bullet level for that part. It was a little fussy to get the post perfectly vertical, but not that bad. You might need a wrench to loosen them a bit to start with.If installing permanently like I was doing, you will need mounting bolts, and in our case we wanted a some protection and sealing. For that reason, I also ordered the 'Ambient Weather EZ-46-3 Tar Pad Kit for Roof Tripod Installation', which comes with six appropriately sized lag screws and three tar pads to go between the tripod legs and the roof. The whole thing took me maybe 30 minutes to install and it seems really solid.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R31QLXMJNJKVTR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0043OAI9M#wasThisHelpful","R31QLXMJNJKVTR","A1AHII2R0R6FAE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1AHII2R0R6FAE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've had my Echo since February, and it's just become part of my home office. From news, music, weather reports or general information, Alexa is just right there. I've already forgotten how to set our oven timer because I just ask Alexa to tell me when the time is up. Amazon has been on top of adding new functions, too, although to be fair there's still a ways to go yet.Pros:- Very good news and weather summaries, and they just added Google Calendar integration and Audible books reading- Increasing integration with other 'smart home' devices...makes me want to buy a WiFi thermostat just to be able to ask Alexa to change the temperature for me- Excellent support for streaming music, including Amazon Prime music, Pandora, iHeart, etc.- For the most part, the Echo is pretty good at hearing what I'm saying, even when music is playing- Good overall sound from the Echo unit itself- Love both the timer and alarm functions (but needs multiples of these, not just one of each)Cons:- I so want a second unit for the bedroom, and my spouse wants one too, but we can only have the one so far.- The To Do and Shopping lists are really limited, in that you can only have one of each. Sorry, but I have work-related To Do items and household, and my shopping lists are usually specific to the store involved.- The Bluetooth connectivity is sometimes wonky, and only goes in the direction of Device --> Echo. In other words, if you pair your phone or computer to the Echo, the Echo can play your transmitted music, but it can't do things like sending your streaming Prime music back to your computer or Bluetooth-enabled stereo receiver, nor can it operate your phone to make hands-free calls.- Amazon needs to continue to do work to improve the general questions recognition. Very often I'll ask a rather plain question and I know if I were to type it into Google or Bing, I'd get a sensible result -- but Alexa says, ""I'm sorry, I can't understand that request."" Still, it's not bad.Wants:- Really wish the Echo had a small LED display just to show status, current time, perhaps even current timer or alarm settings- As I indicated, it'd be great if the Bluetooth was more advanced and able to push audio and/or to operate as a phone hands-free device","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3PZXAJBNSJWCT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00L9EOQCO#wasThisHelpful","R3PZXAJBNSJWCT","A1AHII2R0R6FAE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1AHII2R0R6FAE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Very quiet fan on the lowest settings. Price may be more than some are willing to spend. I deducted one star for three reasons. First, although well-built in my opinion and easy to assemble, I should think the Rowenta table fan should be around fifty or sixty bucks and this floor fan around eighty or ninety-ish. However, after having read the reviews and having had personal experience with the usual cheap floor fans on discount, I decided to spend more and hope for better results.Quiet is very important to me, so much so when I built my computer, I used ultra-quiet components and sound-insulated the case. I hate loud fans. For example, I have an older model Vornado circulator fan (280SS, which isn't made any more...a real shame), bought back when they still had the (almost) infinitely variable speed dial; it's a good fan, has lasted forever, and I like how much air it can move, but I don't like how noisy it is. In this respect, the Rowenta is clearly the most quiet I've owned, particularly on the lowest two speed settings. On the highest or on Turbo-mode, yes, it's going to be loud, but that's to be expected.The second reason I deducted a star is because the assembly instructions were very difficult to locate. I finally found them wedged between the two halves of the wire fan-cage, which was in a semi-opaque plastic bag which made the instructions even less obvious to find. The assembly instructions should be the first thing you see when you open the box.A remaining reason for the one star deduction was their not bothering to include a couple of AAA batteries for the remote. C'mon, a fan like this at a premium price ought to come with the batteries.Pros:- Well-packaged and arrived undamaged -- product box inside another sturdy brown cardboard box (probably would've sufficed for shipping, but Amazon went ahead and put this inside yet another box, along with a couple other items I'd ordered).- Really heavy and sturdy pancake-shaped base, unlikely for the fan to tip over unless you plow into it.- Good construction quality in general, although the fan blades seem flimsy...but I'm sure that's part of what helps make it more quiet than other fans. Other than that though, nothing about the fan looks cheap.- I like the goose-neck design, so that you can see the controls from any angle, even standing at the fan. Too many fans I've owned either put them on the front (meaning you'll have to crouch or bend over to see them) or else on top, in which case you can't see them unless you're looking down right at the fan.- Remote control (alas, the remote doesn't turn the swivel on/off, which would've been really nice).- Significantly less expensive than a Dyson (which, to be honest, I actually found rather loud the last time I checked them out).Cons:- Expensive. A bit more expensive, in my opinion, than the fan is worth, but I needed a quiet, decent quality pedestal fan and there weren't any others which I felt met my needs and required quality standards.- Probably doesn't move as much air as other fans, due to the attempts to make it more quiet.- For obvious reasons, I wouldn't recommend this or any other pedestal fan for homes with small children or large unruly pets, although in terms of being 'tippy', this fan is far less so than most.- Some might not like the beep the fan makes when changing settings, and there's a blue LED which could bother some (but this latter could be taken care of with some electrical tape easily enough, or even just some colored plastic).Observations & hints:- Ultra-quiet on the lowest setting (just the air movement and a little bit of a hum), pretty quiet on the 2nd (louder whoosh, and the sound I refer to as 'plane prop' just barely evident). Significantly louder at high and turbo, but not quite as noisy as most fans I've heard; still I doubt I'll be using those settings often, except maybe for a minute or two if I need an urgent cool-down after working outside.- To maximize the quietness, don't put the fan too near objects or walls which can interfere with the airflow (thus making it uneven because turbulence = noise). Also, it's not going to seem super quiet if you're right up next to it. Halfway across a room though, on low, I can barely hear it; the refrigerator is actually significantly louder.- The fan base does not have wheels, meaning it's not really intended to be portable. It sits flat on the floor on three rubber feet, under the heavy circular base. If on a hardwood or fancy stone floor, I'd recommend putting a rug or something like that under it to avoid marks or scratching due to the fan vibration.- The instructions say not to engage/disengage the swivel motion while the fan is on. Makes sense. Also makes sense never to try to move the fan or adjust the fan positioning while it is running. That's just asking for trouble. My suggestion is if planning to move the fan to another room would be to (1) unplug the fan, (2) loosen the knob attaching the fan head and assembly to the base and remove it entirely, (3) carry the base and fan head ass'y to the other room separately, and (4) reassemble in place, then plug it in.- The knob that holds the fan blade assembly to the motor shaft is reverse threaded (meaning lefty-tighty, righty-loosey, opposite the normal directions). Just something to keep in mind when assembling or disassembling the unit.Summary: If you want a good quality and nice-looking pedestal fan, one which is really rather quiet compared to its competitors, the Rowenta VU5551 is a good choice. On the other hand, if quiet isn't important to you and you want to save some money, some of the less expensive fans may suit better, but the 'you get what you pay for' maxim comes into play.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R30CJY2JRS3J4Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00C4QP8N2#wasThisHelpful","R30CJY2JRS3J4Y","A1AHII2R0R6FAE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1AHII2R0R6FAE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The more I've used my Fire TV stick, which I originally purchased last year during its $20 intro price for Prime customers, the more I've come to like it. I use it for Amazon programming (mainly Prime and free, but occasionally purchased on-demand series like The Walking Dead and Orphan Black), as well as Netflix and Plex. The picture and sound are quite good and the user interface pretty easy to maneuver within. Not long ago, I upgraded to a new Kindle Fire and have been discovering the benefits of the integration between the two devices.More recently, I was on a vacation and although the hotel where I stayed was pretty decent, its TV left much to be desired. It was an older non-smart model paired with a Comcast cable box that displayed a totally mismatched resolution. In the past, I would've just plugged in one of my media sticks and watched some videos from that -- but this TV wouldn't support that either. I'd just tossed the Fire TV stick into my suitcase on impulse at the last second, but was happy to see it worked just fine with this not-new-enough-or-smart-enough television. Even more impressive was the fact it was able to connect to the hotel wifi and stream through it. I think there were just two times when the message popped up about there not being quite enough bandwidth for good streaming, but these were both at bad times of the evening; before long again, all was fine and I was able to entertain myself with MY viewing choices, not just what was available on squish-distorted viewing via the cable box. All I can say is if you do want to take it on the road with you, don't forget the power adapter and remote control.Personally, my feeling is the best value in having the Fire TV stick is when you also have Amazon Prime, because it opens up the whole Prime library for viewing or listening.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R14Y34ON6SF0H0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GDQ0RMG#wasThisHelpful","R14Y34ON6SF0H0","A1AHII2R0R6FAE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1AHII2R0R6FAE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Pretty nice tablet stand with only a few drawbacks. I've been wanting a tablet stand for a while now, ideally one that holds the tablet up high enough so that I can have the power cord plugged in from the bottom (check) and to be adjustable (check). I do still have one of those leather folding covers that if you futz with it can hold a tablet at an angle -- but only in landscape mode and in that position, it can't be plugged in to the charging/data cable.I rather like the adjustability of the Aleratec mount, especially how the tablet can be positioned in a variety of angles and rotations (including portrait or landscape). The mount arm also rotates on the bottom base, although it's not a terribly useful feature. The large disk shape that sets on the back of the tablet is actually a hand-hold with an adjustable velcro strap on the back.As I said in the title, yes, this does fit the Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.5 tablet, but you have to use the larger of the two sets of rubber holders, and it does take a little more work to get them around the opposite corners of the tablet.Pros:- Highly adjustable and clearly will work with a wide variety of tablet sizes- Pretty sturdy and will hold a tablet at a good height- I could easily see pairing this with a Bluetooth keyboard and mouse for travel and basically having a fairly light computer availableCons:- It can be tricky getting the rubber straps around the corners of some tablets- As the two-star reviewer noted, the stand can't be folded down to a flat position, which would've been nice if it had been possible- The unit (stand plus mount) is going to be heavier in many cases than the tablet they're meant to hold...which makes it not terribly travel-friendly- On a tablet the size of the Galaxy Tab 10.5 (or similar), the holder is rather close to the middle of the back of the tablet, which could make long use somewhat uncomfortable- No way to set the tablet down flat and have it be usable that way without removing the holder first- I wouldn't expect to be able to do a whole lot of touch-screen action with the tablet in the stand because while sturdy, it's not that sturdy. Repeated touches cause it to start to wobble. However, it's probably okay for turning pages in an e-book.Would I buy this again? Sure -- I got a terrific deal via an Amazon Lightning Deal on it a few days ago and it was certainly worth what I paid at the time. It does something I need. However, I can already tell it's not going to be a 100% replacement for the leather cover I normally use. So I 'Like' the stand-mount, but I don't 'love' it. I think one thing that would've taken me over that line would have been if there was a way to use the mount without the holder on the back. I'm actually giving some thought to how I might add a shelf to the arm, so that I could just set the tablet on it easel-style.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RA24IOH9R63QF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HZOHUMK#wasThisHelpful","RA24IOH9R63QF","A1AHII2R0R6FAE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1AHII2R0R6FAE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"In the introductory section on opposing commanders in his latest book, The Naval Battles for Guadalcanal 1942, naval historian Mark Stille makes an important point: [Japanese Admiral] ""Yamamoto never realized that Guadalcanal was the decisive battle that he had been seeking."" This cuts to the heart of the matter, in regards to the months-long battle for naval superiority around Guadalcanal in 1942. While the United States Navy treated this area as a priority for resources, Imperial Japan nickled and dimed their forces in the region, and were defeated piece-meal. Readers familiar with the author's other volumes on US and Japanese battleships, cruisers and destroyers will find familiar threads here, but no redundancies. The section on opposing fleets is beautifully written, providing just the right level of detail and insight. The Japanese had better torpedoes and night tactics, but the US advantage in radar was increasingly important. As usual, the author's text is complemented by stunning period photographs of the warships involved. The author also uses his intimate knowledge of  naval operations and technology to good advantage, explaining how things happened and why. After the obligatory introductory sections, the volume is sub-divided into the five major naval actions near Guadalcanal fought between August - November 1942. I like the fact that he provides a specific order of battle for each action and a map, which makes each action very easy to follow. The artwork by Howard Gerrard is good and highlights key moments in the battles. The author's battle descriptions are superb and I like the fact that he points out mistakes made by each side, such as failing to report contacts or communications problems - this is the kind of detail that often shapes the outcome. Although all these battles were essentially gun/torpedo actions, the author concludes that it was US airpower (in preserving Henderson Field) that determined the campaign's outcome. American and Japanese battleships met in battle for the first time off Guadalcanal, but only in one action of the five actions. As the author notes, the appearance of the Yamato and Musashi off Guadalcanal might have made a major difference in the outcome, since US battleship strength was still much inferior to the Japanese. Given what we know about how much punishment these ships could take, it is doubtful that a dozen dive-bombers from Henderson Field could have seriously damaged a Yamato-class battleship. Had the Japanese Navy made a major effort, with air support, the US offensive in the Solomons might have been temporarily halted. Yet therein we come back to the author's observation about Yamamoto - the Japanese commander did not recognize the moment for decisive action had arrived.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 30, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1TF5HAK93BGPT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1780961545#wasThisHelpful","R1TF5HAK93BGPT","A34ZM36508LG9G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A34ZM36508LG9G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Over the past several decades, the historiography of the American Civil War has been taken over by eager amateurs/buffs, who are often passionate about some aspect of the conflict. Indeed, we have been bombarded by an unending avalanche of new studies on the American Civil War, that cover heretofore neglected aspects, such as women in the war or the economic aspects of the war. There have also been many new books on battles and campaigns, although most have a worrying level of sameness, in discussing Regiment X attacking Regiment Y. Actual military analysis on the operational level of the Civil War has been Missing in Action. This new account, by authors Clayton and James Donnell, on the famous Shenandoah Campaign of 1862, is clearly an effort to deliver an operational-type summary of the series of battles between ""Stonewall"" Jackson and a coterie of Federal armies led by political dilettantes. Typically, this campaign is presented as a great triumph for the Confederacy and proof of Jackson's genius. On the surface, this is an attractive study, with some nice color plates and 3-D BEV maps, but the actual level of military detail is anemic and the level of analysis swims only in the sea of blatantly obvious. Thus, if you generally like how current Civil War history is written, then this volume should satisfy you, but if you are looking for insight, it won't. The authors spend the first third of the volume with introductory and background material. I was let down to see space wasted on basics like the Union defeat at First Bull Run, Scott's Anaconda Plan, Lincoln's call for volunteers, etc. This part of the volume appears written for people with almost no prior knowledge of the Civil War and is too basic for Osprey readers, most of whom likely already have other volumes on the Civil War. Having written many volumes in the campaign series myself, I know that space is at a premium and that you have to focus laser-like on your subject in order to deliver and you can't waste space on fluff. There is too much fluff here. The section on opposing forces is remarkably bland and the authors would have best focused on a few individual units to provide some detail about typical unit strengths, level of experience, etc. Once the authors get into the campaign narrative per se, the pace picks up a bit, but essentially the tale is told on two levels: (a) operational-level communications between commanders and their subordinates and (b) tactical-level movements on the battlefield. The authors feel the need to discuss many letter-writing exchanges in some detail, when a simple sentence on the results would have sufficed. As usual in Civil War books, the text regales the reader with tales of regiments advancing hither and yon, occasionally firing a volley and then one side or the other retreats. The better efforts at military history don't settle for this banal method, which tells us nothing about the who, how or why of a battle, but this account settles for just that standard. They don't even bother to provide information on strengths engaged or casualties for all the actions described, and given the few regiments involved, should have been able to provide more breakdown on individual unit losses. Logistical issues are also given short shrift. Readers may wonder why Stonewall even won some of these actions, since his tactical performance was more hit-or-miss. Indeed, I believe that Stonewall may be the most over-rated commander of the American Civil War and he was lucky to make his reputation early in the war and against the Union's third-string generals. Far from winning out-numbered, the Donnell's point out that he actually had numerical superiority in most of these battles, except Kernstown (which he lost). The author's contention that Jackson's Valley Campaign had major impact on McClellan's Peninsula Campaign is very contentious (after all, even Jackson left the valley to go help save Richmond,rather than make a feint toward Washington as Lincoln feared). The fact is that Mclellan's campaign failed because of his lack of fighting spirit, rather than due to events in the valley. Overall, a rather so-so volume and not up to the caliber of even earlier Osprey Civil War campaigns. It will please if you really like the Civil War and are a voracious reader of all things concerning it, but it lacks quality and detail as a piece of military history. Unless you have a short attention span, readers would be better advised to read Peter Cozzen's book, instead.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 30, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RFEYINTQHUXBQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1780963785#wasThisHelpful","RFEYINTQHUXBQ","A34ZM36508LG9G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A34ZM36508LG9G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Battle of Manzikert in 1071 is one of those events that echoes through the halls of history, yet there are not a lot of books written about it. As typical of Medieval warfare, there are limited primary sources on this battle and what exists is not exactly replete with military details. Dr. David Nicolle, Osprey's resident Medieval Mideast specialist, handles Manizkert in his usual erudite fashion. As is his bent, the volume is full of cultural and political insight, but very sparse in terms of military details. For example, the back cover of the book states that, ""much of the fabled Varangian Guard was killed [at Manzikert]"" but they are never mentioned once in this volume. While the author does provide a general lay-down for the Battle of Manzikert, the level of detail is minimal and his exposition on how the Byzantines were defeated is based heavily upon conjecture. Thus, for a book about a major battle, Manzikert 1071 is a great disappointment. The first one-third of the book covers the general political-cultural situation in the Near East in the mid-Eleventh Century. Only bits and pieces of this lengthy discussion are useful for understanding the battle itself and the rest is just long-winded digressions on Islamic cultural issues. The section on opposing armies says essentially nothing that is useful for understanding the forces or tactics used by either side. The only section with any merit is opposing plans, which at least points out that the Turks were more focused on Fatimid Egypt than the Byzantines. A lot of the content is incomprehensible - photos of the Great Mosque in Isfahan, or modern Turks fishing in the Bosporus or scenes of the Crucifixion - I just don't get what this adds other than useless filler. On the other hand, the author does provide some really nice photos of fortresses in the Mideast and he should really consider doing a coffee table book on that subject. As the battle approaches, the author's narrative does become a bit more focused, but the reader will sense that important pieces are missing (like the strength and disposition of the opposing forces).  The artwork by Christa Hook adds very little to the volume. The 3-D BEV maps are decent and allow the reader to follow the author's version of the battle, but again, the events are very generalized. The author doesn't even bother to speculate about Byzantine losses at Manzikert and there is no attempt at military analysis of the battle. Instead, the author seems satisfied that the Turks won and that's good enough for him. He believes that it was not the battle that hurt the Byzantine Empire so badly but the civil war that followed, although he has little to say about that. This section desperately needed expansion and a full discussion to place the battle in its proper historical context, but he seemed eager just to wash his hands of this nasty, brutish battle and move back to discussing Islamic culture. There is more in this volume about raki, a Turksh drink, than there is about the Varangian Guard.

"I wish that the U.S. film industry would learn some lessons about how to make an excellent character-driven drama from the Australian Film Industry. In Beneath Hill 60, the Australians continue to demonstrate the art of fine film making. It is not about non-stop special affects or ridiculous love triangles, but developing characters so that they seem like real human beings. Even though the film focuses on an Australian Tunneling Company at the Battle of Messines Ridge in June 1917, where thousands died, the film manages to evoke empathy for each character and deaths are thus more painful. The story is dramatic and well told, of how the Australian company assisted in completing a tunnel underneath a key German position on Messines Ridge. Interestingly, the film also depicts several German characters and their attempts to detect and defeat the Australian tunneling effort, so there is a cat 'n mouse aspect which adds tension to the film as well. There are some cliches in the film, such as displaying British senior officers as pompous and careless with men's lives, or the father-son team that you just now will end in tragedy. Nevertheless, Beneath Hill 60 is an excellent war film and succeeds in highlighting an aspect of the First World War (tunneling) that has not been covered in any detail before.The film starts with the entrance of Lieutenant Woodward to the Australian mining company, presumably in early 1916. Initially not like \d by the senior non-com, Sergeant Fraser, Woodward eventually wins the men's loyalty by his caring attitude, technical competence and willingness to stick his neck out for his men. This aspect of the film is basically a primer on effective small unit leadership. Once all doubts are removed, Woodward (now captain) leads the company on the next asssignment to Messines Ridge. I was a bit surprised how the company was depicted - always the same 8-10 men and the unit can all move in one truck. The film mentions briefly that hundreds of men are working on the tunneling project and surely Woodward's company had more men, but they simply aren't depicted. It's also odd that he has no second-in-command (CPT McBain appears, but is commander of another outfit). The film goes to great lengths to depict how tuneling was done and the difficulties of dealing with the wet clay around Ypres. Viewers may not understand why the British/Australians were going to all this effort, since the film really doesn't discuss previous efforts to dislodge the Germans from this terrain. While the frequent flashbacks to Woodward's past in Australia are useful, a flashback that explained the missing ""why tunnel?"" aspect of the film might have been useful for viewers.The final part of the film focuses on Woodward's efforts to complete the project before the Germans discover it. One German sergeant is depicted as identifying the Allied tunnel and makes a last-minute effort to destroy it. As with most Australian film efforts, the quality of the cinematography is gernerally excellent - they have a talent for displaying wide tableaus. The combat scenes are generally good, particularly an early effort to destroy a German machinegun position. Some scenes - such as the final detonation of the mine and the British bombardment - are a bit underwhelming. The special affects - such as artillery explosions - are not that realistic and look like TV affects. In the First World War, soldiers differentiated between mortars, light artillery and really heavy artillery and acted differently, based upon the particular weapon's lethality. Like most movies, the actors run around like wet hens whenever any shell lands in the area. I think that both All Quiet on the Western Front and the Price of Glory addressed this issue more realistically. It would also be great if film's like this tried to use more ""soldier dialogue"" specific to the time period - read any account of the Western Front and they are loaded with jargon, but the films avoid it. Jargon could be explained to the audience by using the ""new guy"" as a device to explain lingo. Without the soldier jargon, it's sort of like the film Troy's efforts to depict Ancient Greeks with all references to the gods removed.Nevertheless, an excellent film and well worth watching.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 23, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R21V28G6GPWMLM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004SJVQ4I#wasThisHelpful","R21V28G6GPWMLM","A34ZM36508LG9G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A34ZM36508LG9G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Aside from the German victory at the Battle of Tannenberg in 1914 and the legendary mismanagement of Tsar Nicholas II, the Eastern Front in the First World War has barely been covered in English-language historiography.  Norman Stone's book, the Eastern Front 1914-1917, was a landmark book when it appeared nearly four decades ago and still remains one of the best available baseline narratives on this topic. By design, Stone's book is a survey account and it tends to view events from the Russian perspective, although he is even-handed with the Germans and Austrians. Throughout the book, the author makes great effort to expose oft-repeated canards about the Eastern Front, particularly the claim that Russia's economy was too backward to sustain a modern war. The book is divided into thirteen chapters and begins with a discussion of the army in the Tsarist state (oddly though, he makes no mention of its role in regime protection). Contrary to the stereotype about Russians officers deriving solely from the aristocracy, Stone reveals that about 40 percent actually came from peasant or lower middle class backgrounds. Unfortunately, the regime did not know how to make best use of its human material. It is also evident that Tsarist Russia was never capable of harnessing Russia's vast pool of manpower in the manner that the Soviet state achieved in the Second World War. The Tsarist Army was also dominated by a backward-looking cavalry elite who resisted technological and doctrinal changes, to the detriment of Russia's military effectiveness. In particular, the author notes the devotion to spending the bulk of the army's modernization funds in 1906-1914 on upgrading fortress artillery at the expense of field artillery. In the chapters on the campaigns of 1914, the author exposes the inherent inability of the Stavka (Supreme Headquarters) to conduct effective operational-level planning or even to coordinate multiple fronts. Indeed, the primitive state of Russian C2 in 1914 was criminal. The Russians did perform well against the Austrians, who were even more poorly led. Several chapters cover the campaigns of 1915, culminating in the Russian retreat from Poland. As the author continually hammers home, the Russian soldiers were not as poorly-armed at this stage of the war as often portrayed, but the real problem was incompetent senior level leaders in 1914-1915. This did begin to change in 1916, when military technicians such as Brusilov were finally given a chance to show what well-led Russian armies could achieve. The author covers the Serbian front in passing, but devotes a complete chapter to the Romanian Front. He does discuss deliberations in the German and Austrian war councils, but at a high level. He spends a chapter on the Russian war economy which was very difficult to digest. His points about the impact of inflation on the Russian war economy were certainly germane, but since inflation affected the war economies of each combatant, I could not really discern what was unique for Russia in this regard. He did make clear that Russia's preference for foreign arms deals was a huge mistake. My only real disappointment was that the author's narrative drops off suddenly in early 1917. Although he devotes a chapter to the Russian Revolution, he does not discuss revolutionary agitation in the Russian army or navy, or the disintegration of military discipline. Several major events, like the German capture of Riga and the Kerensky Offensive are completely omitted. Nor is there any real discussion of air warfare on the Eastern Front, naval operations or the Russian war against the Turks in the Caucasus. Thus, the perspective is narrower than it should be and fails to capture key facets of Russia's war. In short, this is a good but dated history, in urgent need of expansion and revision. It should suffice for readers seeking an affordable and easily-accessible introduction to its subject, but will fall short for readers in need of greater detail.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 20, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZ3P75E5AOA1E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0140267255#wasThisHelpful","RZ3P75E5AOA1E","A34ZM36508LG9G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A34ZM36508LG9G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Battle of Salerno in September 1943 is one of those battles of the Second World War that has really never found a niche, like D-Day, Guadalcanal or El Alamein. Even among the battles fought in Italy, Salerno tends to get crowded out of Second World War historiography by Anzio, Monte Cassino and Sicily. In Osprey Campaign No. 257, author Angus Konstam provides a summary of the Allied landing at Salerno and the German counterattacks. The battle was notable in deciding nothing, which is one of the reason that it was not notable, except for the participants; the Allies got ashore in mainland Italy but took enough of a drubbing to not taste like victory. The Germans simply fell back to the Volturno River, waiting to inflict more pain and humiliation on the pursuing Allied forces. The volume focuses squarely on the ground fighting in the period 9-19 September 1943, to the determinant of air and naval operations.  The Salerno landing was a joint Anglo-American operation where the mechanics of inter-Allied coordination were still being learned, but the author steers clear of any controversy and sticks to which battalion moved where. In short, it is a useful, but plodding narrative. Looking at the sources, it is amazing that the author failed to use Rick Atkinson's recent Day of Battle or any German sources. Indeed, very few of the sources used were written in the last twenty years and this volume has a distinct 1960s-feel to it (e.g. no mention of the role of Ultra in pre-invasion intelligence). The author begins by sketching out the strategic situation with Italy about to switch sides and the Germans swooping in to take control of key points in Italy, including the coastal defenses at Salerno. If the author had bothered to consult Atkinson, he would have learned how the Italians turned over a mass of information about the German units in Italy to the Allies and how the Germans shot the Italian general in charge of the beach defenses at Salerno. The section on opposing commanders is far too high-level, with too much about remote commanders like Alexander and Kesselring, while saying very little about the men who made the real decisions. I'm kind of annoyed with the space wasted on Mark Clark, who could have phoned in his performance. Very few Anglo-American historians have yet dared to speak the truth that many of the senior military leaders of 1942-44 were simply low-capable buffoons who had no business being put in charge of large operations (granted, there were few alternatives, but even Montgomery looks like Napoleon next to Clark or Alexander).  The section on opposing forces is inadequate, with no mention of either the Luftwaffe or Allied naval gunfire support/air support. Even German armored strength - which was critical - is not discussed in any detail. On the plus side, the 3-page order of battle is nice. The Allies had big advantages at Salerno - there were no beach obstacles or coastal artillery and they had a fair idea where the German 16 Panzer Division was located. However, the Allies failed to use their firepower for fear of killing Italian civilians and the British and American beaches proved to be too far apart to link up soon after landing. Although the author does not notice, it is obvious to this former staff officer that the Allies failed to appreciate the terrain and obstacles behind the beaches. As he notes, the US Rangers and British Commandos performed spectacularly in their secondary landings, but the main landings were less than spectacular. It is clear that the British divisions were very slow in advancing, while the American 36th Division was clueless. Although the author notes that the British got tanks and 17-pounder anti-tank guns ashore just a few hours after landing, the Allied troops seemed to be victimized by even small groups of 2-3 German tanks.  Both the British and Americans failed to establish proper defenses around their beachheads, failed to link-up and sent individual battalions inland to get demolished by the Germans.  Indeed, the number of Allied prisoners taken by the Germans at Salerno was shocking - 1,500 in one day - and speaks volumes about the unpreparedness of the landing force and its commanders. At Salerno, the Germans fought a combined arms battle, putting in a very good performance and inflicting 3-1 losses. As a delay operation, Salerno is a great model. On the other hand, the Allies did not fight a combined arms battle and were unable to use their superior numbers or firepower. For example, the author notes how one German battalion defeated four US battalions. There are too many omissions in this volume for this to be considered a balanced coverage. For one thing, the author fails to mention that Clark seriously considered evacuating the beachheads - which would have given a clear victory to the Germans. He also only mentions the air-sea situation at the tail end of the book, but the German introduction of the Fritz-X guided missile was nearly decisive and had a major impact on Allied naval support.  Montgomery's march through the boot of Italy is mentioned, but there is no map and no real detail about their rate of progress. The maps are difficult to use, since they are split between the US and British sectors, so you are forced to constantly flip pages. I found the photos to be very bland, but Steve Noon's artwork added a splash of color. Overall, this was a low-ball effort with no new research or insight, but if you are looking for a basic summary of the operation, this should suffice.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 19, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R39M6B75ML034A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1780962495#wasThisHelpful","R39M6B75ML034A","A34ZM36508LG9G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A34ZM36508LG9G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Erich Barenfanger is not one of the names that is often mentioned in most histories of the Second World War, but his career neatly encompasses the story of the Third Reich. Franz Kurowski,who has put together many German-language  East Front and Wehrmacht histories authored this book, using a variety of sources. It provides only scant information on Barenfanger's career before the war began (he joined the Nazi Party and the SA), but focuses much of the book on his wartime exploits. This book is entirely in German.The first section of the book covers Barenfanger's opening combat experiences as an infantry platoon leader and then company commander in the 50. Infanterie-Division, during the French and Greek campaigns. The middle section of the book deals with Barenfanger's career in the Crimea in 1941-42, where he really made a name for himself. It is a sad fact that war is very good to some people and the Second World War was very good to Erich Barenfanger. He managed to get command of an infantry battalion while still an oberleutnant and distinguished himself repeatedly during the Battle of Sevastopol. He was promoted and received the Ritterkreuz, which started him on his rise.The final section deals with Barenfanger's career in 1943-45. He ended the war in Berlin, where Hitler promoted him to generalmajor and he played a major role in the defense of the Reichstag. Unable to accept defeat, Barenfanger committed suicide in the ruins of the Third Reich. This book is a Greek tragedy in three parts.

"It is an exciting time for those interested in the history of the war on the Eastern Front in 1941-45 right now, because Russian historians like Valeriy Zamulin are ripping the shroud off decades of misinformation and white-wash to reveal heretofore unavailable detail about well-known battles like Kursk. Zamulin set out to write an honest account of the action at Prokhorovka on 12 July 1943 - which most historians have long-regarded as the climax of the Battle of Kursk and the moment where Germany's best panzer divisions were shattered. Traditional historiography for years has told tales about ""the largest tank battle in history"" that ""involved up to 1,500 tanks on both sides"" and describes a vast meeting engagement with Soviet T-34s charging in to fight German Tigers at close range. Professional historians with access to German WW2 records have known that this version was incorrect for years, but the ""myth"" has developed a life of its own and continues to be touted as truth in secondary sources. Zamulin is in a unique position to bust this myth, since he likes in Prokhorovka and worked for the Battlefield Museum, giving him access to the terrain and Soviet unit records. This is a landmark book on many levels, including the degree of honest accounting of Soviet mistakes and fact-checking. For those wondering how Zamulin's book compares to David Glantz's earlier book on Kursk, I would say that Zamulin displays far more rigorous attention to detail (e.g. Glantz rarely bothered much about what kind of tanks were involved in a particular action) and critical eye, whereas Glantz often accepted Soviet-era claims at face value. Zamulin does include some German information and accounts as well, more than previous Soviet-era histories. This book, Demolishing the Myth, sets the standard for assessing the portion of the Battle of Kursk that it concerns - be advised, it only focuses on the southern portion of the battle and does not cover the struggle on the northern side of the Kursk salient. The translation by Stuart Britton is excellent - the book reads as if it were written in English. Also, the physical quality of the hardcover Helion edition is superb. The first three chapters, which consist of about 60 pages, provides an overview of the Battle of Kursk, the defensive preparations of the Voronezh Front and an overview of the 5th Guards Tank Army (5GTA) and its commander, Pavel Rotmistrov. A key point that the author makes here is that the German commanders were not certain that they would be able to break through to their strategic objective (Kursk) but instead pinned their hopes from the beginning on finding and destroying the Soviet armor reserves, which they believed would appear around Prokhorovka. Both sides planned to commit their main armor in this area from the beginning. The next several chapters deal with the initial German attacks against the Voronezh Front on 5-9 July, the steady advance of the II SS Panzerkorps and the commitment of the 5GTA into the battle. The 200-km long march of the 5GTA to battle is quite interesting and the author provides details on how each unit performed, which provide valuable insight into the Red Army's operational-level mobility. The author gets into the Battle of Prokhorovka proper about one-third of the way through the book and aside from some digressions to deal with the flank attacks of Armeeabteilung Kempf against the Soviet 69th Army, stays on target.  In a nutshell, fewer tanks were involved at Prokhorovka, which was not really a meeting engagement at all. Rotmistrov's 5GTA was hastily thrown into an all-out counterattack as soon as it arrived, despite lack of reconnaissance, air or artillery support. The German II SS Panzerkorps saw the Soviet punch coming and reverted to a hasty anti-armor defense, on good terrain. On 12 July, the 5GTA attacked in a very poorly-planned and uncoordinated fashion and two of its corps lost most of their tanks. German losses were significant, but not crippling. Zamulin reveals that one tank corps commander was relieved after the battle and that Stalin sent a special committee to investigate the heavy losses. Thus, the Germans were indeed stopped at Prokhorovka, but 5GTA was nearly wrecked in the process. It is amazing to read in these pages about Soviet commanders or troops abandoning their positions without orders, incidents of fratricide and just plain stupid mistakes. That is war. For decades we have been presented with white-washed Soviet version of the war that lionized Red Army heroes but ignored losses or mistakes. German histories have done this to some extent as well, tending to blame Hitler for mistakes that were often made by operational-level commanders. German-based histories are still loath to discuss wartime atrocities or misbehavior of Wehrmacht troops. The amount of information packed in this volume is impressive, including very detailed orders of battle and tables on losses. Make no mistake, this book is not intended for general readers or history novices, but readers who already have a good background on Eastern Front warfare. This book is likely to remain the best Soviet account of the battle for some time.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 24, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2BBXLTLXQRNFI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1906033897#wasThisHelpful","R2BBXLTLXQRNFI","A34ZM36508LG9G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A34ZM36508LG9G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the first multi-player strategic game on the First World War that can be played by a broad range of people (eg the entire family, not just a few war game grognards) that I have seen, overall, it is excellent.I number of other reviewers have noted the limited numbers of counters, which we noted as well the first time that we played the game. This was easily rectified by purchasing a few spares on-line, now we can play without shortages.Overall, the game mechanics function well - it is a very playable game. However, the game balance is really tilted toward the Central Powers, and the Allies have little ability to win. I suspect that this game will be updated in about a year with some rules tweaks. For example, the Germans can initiate unrestricted submarine warfare to take away production points from the UK and the US, but the Allied naval blockade is completely ignored. The German economy is simply too strong and in real life, the German army was nearly starving and running out of ammunition by 1918.Austria-Hungary is also too strong in the game and overruns Serbia in one turn - in real life it took nearly a year and required help from Germany. I think the Serbs need a replacement rate of 1 infantry per turn to make them more of a player.Given that this is a WW1 game, I think it odd that there are no trench markers or forts, like Verdun. This is essentially to increase the power of the defense in certain key areas, because in WW1 more infantry did not always equal victory. A fort marker could absorb two losses and a trench marker one, or something like that.There should probably be zeppelins, AA and bombers, to make the air war a little more interesting, too.However, I think the biggest thing that the game needs is better political rules. The Russian Revolution is simply too easy and certain to induce, whereas I think it should be a die-roll if certain conditions are met. Also, the fall of the Tsar did not mean the end of Russia in the war, since the Kerensky government continued to fight for another six months. Turkey also needs some political limits, since the idea that they would invade India and overrun all of Africa - which is quite possible in this game - are ridiculous.The game also needs a strategic movement to reflect railroads. In real life, the Germans could transfer forces from the East Front to the West Front in a matter of weeks or months, but here it would take 4-5 turns. That's a lot.I suspect that a number of these points will get worked into a revised issue of the game, just like the basic WW2 Axis & Allies game has been updated many times. Nevertheless, a very enjoyable game.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 26, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R20OS7M51B18PS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00B0EMNB4#wasThisHelpful","R20OS7M51B18PS","A34ZM36508LG9G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A34ZM36508LG9G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Too many kits today are adding $20-30 for optional parts that aren't even used or other little perks, rather than selling them as add-ons for the few people that want them.This kit has a few photo-etched parts for the engine grill and two sets of tracks, so you can use either the block-by-block method or one-piece track.There are three crew figures, but only one is head-to-toe, the others are just upper torso figures.

"Conventional wisdom tells us that Germany began the First World War as an act of aggression and that the Schlieffen Plan, drafted around 1906, was the basis for their conduct of the war.  Dr. Terence Zuber, who is well-known for his in-depth German archival research and controversial revisionist theses, says in The Real German War Plan 1904-14 (2011) that conventional wisdom is wrong.  Zuber advances two theses: that the so-called Schlieffen Plan was not used in 1914 and that German pre-war planning does not indicate a predilection for aggression.  This is a detailed, thoughtful piece of military history, intended for military theorists, not general readers. The author's theses are critical for understanding the beginning of the First World War, but his methods of mowing down all previous theories is not going to win him many friends. Further, the author's pro-German chauvinism - which was evident in his previous books -undermines his objectivity even when he is clearly correct. For any serious student of the First World War, this is a must-read book and there is no doubt that Zuber has succeeded in redefining what we ""know"" about the beginning of the war. However, parts of the book are offensive and indicative of a brutal and coarse approach to scholarship. The first fifty pages of the book focuses Alfred Schlieffen's planning during 1904-1906. The author uses official records, German intelligence estimates, wargames and memoranda to make his case about exactly what Schlieffen's plans represented. There is little doubt that the author completely succeeds in validating his first hypothesis, in conclusively demonstrating that Schlieffen's plan was designed around a one-front war in the West and that the driving concept was a German counteroffensive after an enemy declaration of war against Germany. Ergo, the 1906 Schlieffen Plan does not fit the events of 1914. During this section, he does make some mention of how he thinks conventional wisdom got the story so badly wrong, but it is difficult to follow and since the official Germany history of the war endorses the Schlieffen Plan as legitimate, one has to accept a certain amount of the author's conspiracy theories. The next 90 pages covers German war planning under von Moltke during 1907-1914. This is a dense read, filled with sketch maps. Herein, he makes his main point: ""Obviously, in 1907 the Germans were planning to fight a two-front war in which both the Russians and the French would be attacking. Just as obviously, Moltke had wholeheartedly adopted Schlieffen's counter-attack doctrine. There is no trace of the Schlieffen plan to be seen.""  He also depicts German pre-war planning to invade Belgium as a defensive measure to ""meet the French offensive head on."" He claims - with no proof other than a few French opinion pieces - that France would have invaded Belgium even if Germany hadn't, so it was best for Germany to get in there first. No mention that Belgium was neutral and not allied against Germany and somehow their resistance at Liege is depicted as unsportsmanlike. The author spends great effort to point out that Russia was re-arming after the Russo-Japanese War and that their ""rising"" strength was an existential threat to Germany. The use of a ""rising Russia"" was part of standard German arguments for a preventative war before the Bear became too strong and was similarly to Hitler's justification for invading the Soviet Union in 1941. You see, poor Germany had to act before they were overwhelmed by the Slavic hordes. Zuber betrays anti-Slavic racism at some points, particularly when he fails to comment about German intelligence estimates stating that Slavs were ""mentally slow and lacked initiative."" He also has the audacity to claim that, ""Germany, which had no other continental goal than the preservation of the status quo, was politically on the defensive."" Kaiser Wilhelm's truculent outbursts were certainly not regarded by anyone else as defensive and if Germany wanted to preserve the status quo, it should not have declared war on France and Russia. The author claims that France's aggressive war plans and Russia's ""secret mobilization"" warranted the declarations, which in no way proved aggressive German intent. At this point in the book, the level of double-talk and deliberate omission of fact goes from annoying to downright weird. The author claims that by 1911, ""the German military situation was becoming critical,"" due to Coalition war planning against Germany. He states that the French expected a German attack through Belgium and that the Germans had no hope for a quick, decisive victory, but a few pages later, they needed a quick victory in the West so they could transfer troops to the West.  There is a major flaw evident in Zuber's thesis about the German counter-offensive strategy that he depicts, since there appears to be no way for Germany to successfully conclude a protracted war against a stronger Allied coalition. While German armies might win impressive operational-level victories like Tannenburg, he does not indicate how they could force the Allies to the peace table. If this is the case, Germany should have avoided war at all costs. Furthermore, he does not address how Germany could prevent long-term strangulation by the Allied naval blockade or what they could do if the Allies simply sat on the defensive and let the Austro-Hungarians implode. In the end, Dr. Zuber paints Germany as the victim of aggression and says that they never intended to take Paris. He never uses the word ""invasion"" when describing German moves into Belgium or France but instead depicts them as defensive measures. He concludes the book by low-class mud-slinging against historian Holger Herwig and Wikipedia! A serious author does not stoop to debate the relative merits of a Wikipedia article.  Dr. Zuber is making some important contributions to First World War historiography but his methods are quite coarse and lack objectivity.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 15, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3GI00R5Q8XC1O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0752456644#wasThisHelpful","R3GI00R5Q8XC1O","A34ZM36508LG9G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A34ZM36508LG9G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When you think of naval operations in the First World War, usually the Battles of Jutland or Coronel come to mind, or perhaps Gallipoli, but the Adriatic is certainly off most reader's radar screens - which is the appeal of Paul G. Halpern's The Battle of the Otranto Straits. This book covers an Austrian cruiser raid against the Allied anti-submarine barrage flotillas in the Otranto Straits on 15 May 1917, which resulted in a dramatic but forgotten naval action. The book is well written and very well researched, making it a pleasure to read and it almost flows like a novel at points. The action in the Otranto Straits was a small-scale thing, no Jutland, but it nicely illustrates the difficulties of coalition naval operations and naval command and control of dispersed forces, as well as the early influence of aviation and submarines upon surface warfare. This book is a must-read for anyone attending a naval academy. The author begins by outlining the strategic setting in the Adriatic Sea that led to this naval action. In a nutshell, German and Austrian submarines used Austrian naval bases in the Adriatic to conduct anti-shipping operations in the Mediterranean, which led the Allies to try and erect a complicated anti-submarine barrier of nets and minefields across the narrow Otranto Straits. A large flotilla of converted trawlers, mostly British, was used to service the barrier, while the Italian and French navies provided warships to protect the trawlers. However, the level of inter-Allied coordination was poor, which impaired their ability to respond to Austrian raids. The author also makes a good point that the French and Italian navies had not properly evaluated their likely wartime missions, which resulted in them building too many heavy ships at the expense of light forces. Neither the French nor Italians wanted to risk their heavy ships to save trawlers that operated in submarine-infested areas. A considerable amount of effort is focused on the Austrian raiding force, consisting of three modern light cruisers, which were faster and better-armed than most of their Allied opponents. Nikolaus Horthy, later leader of Hungary in the Second World War, also made his reputation in this action as a cruiser captain. Essentially, the Austrian raid served no great purpose, other than to ""do something"" with a fleet that was sitting out most of the war. The Austrians caught the Allies completely by surprise and shot up 18 of 47 trawlers before turning for home. Allied aircraft and several surface groups pursued, resulting in a running naval action across the Adriatic. Although a British cruiser scored some lucky hits that immobilized Horthy's cruiser, the timid Italian admiral in charge opted not to close in for the kill in fear of enemy submarines. The battle ended as a draw, although it had propaganda value for the Austrians. Again and again, the problems of coalition naval operations are highlighted in this book. The British, French and Italian warships all used different codes and map systems, as well as different time zones, which made effective coordination in battle well-nigh impossible. Some lessons were learned from this action, but many of the same mistakes were repeated in the Second World War.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 12, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3F0532FLEYTQ1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0253343798#wasThisHelpful","R3F0532FLEYTQ1","A34ZM36508LG9G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A34ZM36508LG9G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Histoire & Collections runs a series of short historical books known as the Men and Battles series. In this series, author Philippe Naud has written a 82-page volume on Kharkov 1943, otherwise known as ""Von Manstein's Backhand Blow."" Among history aficionados, this is a popular subject and this colorful book appears to nicely fill a niche for readers who don't want to read the longer books such as George Nipe's Last Victory in Russia or David Glantz's From the Don to the Dnepr. Superficially, Kharkov 1943 looks like a volume in Osprey's campaign series, but it lacks the sub-sections that deals with opposing leaders and plans or a campaign chronology. However, the most serious deficiency of this volume is that it was poorly translated from French into English, with numerous spelling and grammatical errors. The narrative flow is very poor, made worse by an uninspired translation, which makes reading this volume quite tedious. To say that this is a summary, the author does not seem to know how to summarize and tries to walk the reader through every little action that resulted in a couple of tanks being knocked out. Nor are the four lackluster maps provided much use for following the campaign. Consequently, the volume reads poorly and is difficult to follow - it is only the generally good assortment of photos provided that make it possible for the reader to make it to the finish. Overall, this volume is useful for someone who doesn't want to read Nipe or Glantz, since it does summarize much of what they wrote, but the journey will seem longer than 82 pages. The volume begins with the continuation of the Soviet Winter Counteroffensive in early 1943, with several Soviet fronts pushing toward Kharkov and the Dnepr river. The Germans were reeling after Stalingrad and this was a tense moment on the Eastern Front. The author outlines German efforts to reconstruct a new front, while the Soviets believe that a strategic victory is within sight. In a nutshell, the first half of the volume deals with the Soviet offensive that liberates Kharkov and the second part deals with von Manstein's counteroffensive that recaptured the city in March 1943. At center-stage in this volume is the SS-Panzerkorps, which just arrived from France with the LSSAH, Das Reich and Totenkopf divisions. To be frank, too much of the volume focuses on these three Waffen SS divisions, while the equally important contribution of several army panzer-divisionen is barely mentioned. Much of this portrayal apes Nipe's depiction of the campaign, which is very detailed but close to SS hero-worship at times. This volume is also too focused on tanks, while virtually ignoring artillery, air support, engineers and infantry - all important parts of the combined arms battle. The author spotlights the role of Tiger tanks in the campaign, even though their contributions at this point were modest. I found this volume to be sloppy in many regards (the map on the back cover is in French, but others are in English) and I didn't see a whiff of original research in it. Since I have both Nipe's and Glantz's books on this subject, this volume really serves no purpose beyond some nice photographs. The tortuous writing style further reduced the value of this volume.  Quite frankly, it is not up to the standard of even the mediocre Osprey Campaign series volumes.","2.0 out of 5 stars","May 20, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2LBF91ZO9STSS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=2352502373#wasThisHelpful","R2LBF91ZO9STSS","A34ZM36508LG9G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A34ZM36508LG9G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The number of personal memoirs by survivors of the Battle of Stalingrad are quite rare, so each one has considerable historical worth. Wigand Wuster, who served as a junior officer in the 71. Infanterie-Division during the period of May 1942 to January 1943 is the protagonist of An Artilleryman in Stalingrad. This memoir is also unusual since the author was an artilleryman, which offers a very different perspective on the Battle of Stalingrad. As memoirs go, this one is darn near the top and certainly better than more air-brushed accounts like In Deadly Combat. The author is honest enough to show us his quirky side and his real opinions, instead of post-war sanitizations. At one point, he admits that he admired Hitler and another point he drops in some Nazi propaganda about American Zionists, which seems much more likely for that time than Germans who try to pretend in their memoirs that they were part of the ""silent resistance."" Like many young lieutenants, Wuster was impetuous and apparently didn't think that he could be killed - many of his actions, particularly his decision to fly back into the Stalingrad pocket, appear almost suicidal. Yet it is his honesty and candidness that make this such a wonderful memoir. Adding on top of that, Jason Mark has added photos and maps that really bring Wuster's account to life.  Overall - excellent. Wuster begins with his artillery battery arriving at Kharkov just as the Second Battle of Kharkov was beginning. He was a shutterbug and took numerous photos, many of which appear here. He gives a good introduction to battery life, his early combat experiences and his trouble with his battalion commander.  This part of the book, about one-third, is really great. He gives great perspective on the German army's mobility problems and the necessity of acquiring Russian farm tractors to pull their howitzers. Everything in the German advance to the Don river seems based on expedients, rather than real planning. The author was involved in a number of minor skirmishes before Stalingrad, which he details. Once his unit reaches Stalingrad, Wuster provides great detail on how he selected positions for observation posts and his guns, which were quickly dug in and then never moved again. Some of his photos of Stalingrad's streets in September 1942 are chilling. He makes it clear that artillery could play little role in the street fighting and that the infantry-artillery coordination was not always so good. Just before the big Soviet counteroffensive in November 1942, Wuster went home on leave and missed being caught in the pocket. His description of the furlough trains at Kalach are one of the most poignant aspects of this book - apparently the once-great Wehrmacht could not even properly organize transport or housing or food for troops going home on leave.Amazingly, he spurned advice from other officers to simply attach himself to another unit and made repeated efforts to fly back into the pocket, which finally succeeded. He said as soon as he saw how bad things were, he realized that he'd made a big mistake. He makes an interesting point toward the end of the battle when he gave an order to his men and noted that, ""I suddenly realized that my authority over my men was waning."" Wuster's description of the conduct of senior German officers in the pocket is also very interesting, and he says that he didn't consider officers who blew their brains out with their pistol while in a drunken stupor didn't seem particularly heroic. The author criticizes Goering for his failure to keep the airlift going, but reserves most of his criticism for Paulus, commander of the trapped 6. Armee; his depiction of Paulus' complete apathy and indecision seems well-deserved. He also discusses the onset of despair, as his division commander seeks death in battle and most of his regimental staff committed suicide. His description of the final days in the Stalingrad pocket make for gripping reading. Wuster was one of the lucky ones, who survived Soviet captivity and returned to tell the tale, of the late great 6. Armee. It is a very interesting tale, as told by Wuster.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 15, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1WT2LL3ZVOUKJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0975107658#wasThisHelpful","R1WT2LL3ZVOUKJ","A34ZM36508LG9G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A34ZM36508LG9G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Military memoirs can be a tricky thing, based upon how long after the event they describe that they were written, any agendas the author may have and how the memoirs were edited. In Deadly Combat, written by German army veteran Gottlob H Bidermann was written in the 1950s after the author had returned from three years in the Soviet gulag. Although the memories were still fairly fresh, no doubt the years of malnutrition had an impact on the author's ability to recall certain details or episodes - this appears sporadically throughout the book. It's not immediately apparent that the author has any real agenda, although throughout he is only willing to point fingers at the Soviet enemy, various Nazi big shots including Hitler, and the Western Allies. The editing, done by American military veteran Derek S. Zumbro, is good in most appears, but lags at one point in the center. Biderman's memoirs depict his unit, the 132. Infanterie-Division in three set-piece battles: the Crimea in 1941-1942, Leningrad in 1942-1943 and Courland in 1944-1945. The book benefits from the author's rise through the ranks from enlisted to junior officer during the course of the war and his participation on the Eastern Front from July 1941 to May 1945. Such accounts are rare, particularly from front-line soldiers. Overall, In Deadly Combat is a very good memoir - with a few odd exceptions - that offers considerable insight into the German perspective of East Front combat in 1941-45. The book begins with the author's unit marching into the Ukraine in July 1941. Initially, he is an enlisted men in charge of a 3.7-cm Pak gun in a regimental-level anti-tank unit. I thought that the book started a bit too abruptly, with no mention of the author's background or even hometown (later revealed to be Stuttgart) and he does not provide much information on his peers until the last page of the book. It would have been useful if the editor had provided some of this in his introduction, since people seem to come and go in the narrative without much context. The author sees sporadic action in the pursuit across the Ukraine, but then things shift into high gear when he reaches the Crimea. Here, the author was involved in the first assault on Sevastopol, the counterattack at Feodosiya, the fighting around Kerch and the final assault on Sevastopol - all very good material. The author generally maintains a first-person narrative format in the Crimea section, but sometimes starts slipping in information he gathered from post-war secondary sources, such as technical information on the Karl and Dora heavy artillery pieces - information he clearly did not know in 1942. On another occasion he discusses Stalin's pre-war purges, which were also outside his purview. Nevertheless, the Crimea section was a satisfying, if not always insightful, read. Around August 1942 the author was selected for officer training, but he provides almost no detail on this, which is a pity. It is often argued in history circles that German officer training declined quickly after 1941 and Bidermann could have provided interesting perspectives on this. The second section of the book covers the transfer of the author's 132. Infanterie-Division to the Leningrad Front in September 1942. However, the author missed much of the Leningrad action because he was in France in an officer training course, so this section shifts to a very high-level coverage of events, rather than the first-person style used in the Crimea. The Leningrad section was disappointing and the period from January 1943 to June 1944 is covered at a much quicker pace, with the emphasis on repeated Soviet attacks that are defeated one after another. Frankly, the editor really needs to re-work this middle section because it flows poorly and doesn't mesh well with the rest of the book. The third section covers the author's last year of the war and his unit's ordeal in the Battle of the Courland Pocket. This section was easily the best and it is clear that the author's memories were sharper here. There are some excellent combat vignettes in this section, including the author getting surprised by Soviets while sleeping and later, knocking out a Soviet tank with a Panzerfaust. The author also had a number of interesting experiences in the last few months of the war, such as being given a rare furlough in December 1944 and crossing the Baltic on a fishing boat to return to Germany.  At the end, the author surrenders with his unit in May 1945 and spends more than three years in Soviet prison camps before returning to Germany. The author himself is an elusive character throughout the book. I had the impression he was a decent front-line officer who had the respect of his troops, if not always his superiors. He frequently criticizes Hitler and the Nazis, although he does not reveal until the end of the book that his father was a police official - meaning that the criticism was likely retrospective. As a number of reviewers have already mentioned, Bidermann says that he never saw any mistreatment of civilians or prisoners. I'm willing to take him at his word, but he later criticizes the Nazis for harsh measures in the East so if he was unaware of atrocities, why bother condemn the Nazis for them. I don't think the author was covering up anything, but he appears to block out anything that would make the Wehrmacht look bad. Overall, In Deadly Combat should be taken as an honest effort to provide a first-person perspective of the German experience on the Eastern Front in 1941-45. It does have some flaws, but admirably conveys the emotions of a valid combat memoir.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 8, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3K5HTTOGALXJG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0700611223#wasThisHelpful","R3K5HTTOGALXJG","A34ZM36508LG9G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A34ZM36508LG9G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Osprey's Men-at-Arms series has become a very mixed bagged, with some volumes actually trying to provide a good summary history of the unit(s) in question and others settling for being a list of obscure uniform details. Unfortunately, the recent volume on Polish Armies of the Partitions 1770-94 falls into this later category. As a Polish-American, I was hoping that this volume would actually provide some insight on Polish military forces in this period, but like many of the recent MAA titles, it is little more than a uniform pictorial. To be fair, the author does provide some historical context in the first few pages, but it is very brief and of little value unless one already has some background in Eighteenth Century East European Military History. I can't imagine that there are too many re-enactors out there who cover this period and model-building for this era would also seem marginal, so I'm not sure who the author thought was his intended audience. As expected, the color plates are excellent, but the captions provide few details beyond uniform descriptions. The list of regiments does include battles that each unit is known to have fought in, but that's it. Here and there, there's some skimpy data on what authorized unit strengths were supposed to be, but little indication of what the various units really did. Chart after chart lists the coat color, facings, buttons and lace for each regiment, which is the kind of information that gets me flipping through pages quickly. In short, there was very little meat in this volume.  While written as an introduction to its subject, it barely suffices as a drive-by.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 17, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RI6LVRW7U7U94/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1849088551#wasThisHelpful","RI6LVRW7U7U94","A34ZM36508LG9G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A34ZM36508LG9G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Naval historian Mark Stille's USN Destroyer vs. IJN Destroyer 1943 is an excellent addition to Osprey's Duel series. In this volume, the author details four actions between American and Japanese destroyers in the Solomons region during August-November 1943. The author expertly combines  a good mix of combat narrative, technological discussion and doctrinal analysis in order to deliver a very nuanced and insightful picture of why U.S. destroyermen were able to learn from prior defeats and ultimately achieve tactical dominance over their opposite numbers. Given that much of the Pacific War historiography tends to revolve around carrier battles and major fleet actions, a volume like this is very helpful for depicting the more day-to-day kind of naval activity going on in the South Pacific. Overall, a very solidly-researched and constructed volume. The volume begins with an interesting analysis of how U.S. and Japanese naval doctrines shaped the designing of their respective destroyer forces in the 1930s. The Japanese viewed destroyers as primarily an offensive platform for their superior torpedoes, while the Americans emphasized multi-role ships and gunnery. The author notes Japanese investments in optical developments and night training, which gave their destroyers a significant edge in night combat for the first year of the Pacific War.  This section has color plates on Japanese and American destroyer armament. The author also notes that the US Navy completely missed the significance of the Japanese Type 93 (`Long Lance') torpedo and did not fully comprehend its capabilities until late 1943 - surely this was one of the more costly American intelligence failures of the Second World War. On the other hand, the US Navy had a big advantage in radar, which he estimates was the ""single most important factor leading to the demise of the Japanese destroyer force.""  He then proceeds to provide a brief summary of each major destroyer class in both navies. The section on the naval actions has a map for each engagement, making the action fairly easy to follow. The integration of first-person accounts increased the realism of the battle narratives, and the author provided his usual insight on naval operations. This was a satisfying volume that clearly demonstrated how American forces `won' the destroyer duels in the Solomons and defeated the heretofore invincible Imperial Japanese Navy.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 17, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2YTYOJ6794Y6A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1849086230#wasThisHelpful","R2YTYOJ6794Y6A","A34ZM36508LG9G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A34ZM36508LG9G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Fallen Timbers 1794 is the follow-on volume of John F. Winkler's history of the conflict between the nascent U.S. Army and various Indian tribes in Ohio in the first decade of American expansion. Winker's previous volume in Osprey's Campaign series, covered the Indian victory at the Wabash in 1791. The author covers the Fallen Timbers campaign - which is not well-known today or even taught in classrooms - in great detail, perhaps too much at times. While the artwork by Peter Dennis is first-rate, the narrative is rather plodding and the author does not begin to discuss the actual battle until page 61 of a 96-page volume; the actual text is equivalent to less than 10 pages. Much of this volume focuses on Major General Anthony Wayne's efforts to pull together an effective army, the intense political machinations and conspiracies attempting to thwart this effort and the recurrent Indian raiding along the Ohio river that necessitated a response from the Federal Government. Along the way, the author also tosses in Citizen Genet's efforts to enlist American volunteers to fight the English and Spanish, various frontier political issues including the Whiskey Rebellion, and British discussions about pursuing their territorial objectives in the area. Simply put, this was too much diversity for a volume this size and led to clogging up the narrative. Consequently, this volume does not read as well as the last volume on the Wabash and lacks the ""tightness"" of other Campaign-series volume. Overall, it is worth a read, and the portrayal of Wayne is excellent, but this volume was a bit disappointing. The author begins with a 12-page introduction that sketches the strategic situation in the Ohio valley after the American defeat at Wabash and the creation of the Legion of the United States. The Indian tribes were feeling their oats after their victory at Wabash and they murdered two U.S. peace envoys and escalated their raiding against American settlements north of the Ohio river. When the U.S. Government tried to resume peace talks, Indian leaders attempted to dictate the boundaries of the United States, which clearly led to a resumption of warfare. The section on opposing leaders starts well with a spotlight on Anthony Wayne, but then degenerates into a dissection of all the various sub-unit commanders within the Legion - a line and block chart would have been better suited. The Indian leaders get less than a page. In the opposing forces section, my main take-away was that Wayne was the first American army leader to train with an OPFOR (Opposing force), dressed like Indians and instructed to use Indian tactics - the first use of realistic training in U.S. military history.  The section on opposing plans was a bit overblown, given that Wayne's plan was not particularly complicated and the Indian plan was to wait and see. Wayne's march into Ohio is covered in 20+ pages in a rather rambling narrative, that veers between describing Indian raids, American, French and Spanish conspiracies, Wayne's supply problems, political matters in the East, etc, etc. This part of the volume became rather tedious and I grew tired of reading that ""Wayne's army reached its fourteenth camp,"" then its fifteenth, then its sixteenth, etc. Nor were the maps in this section particularly helpful - I had  difficulty following Wayne's advance. When he gets to the actual battle of Fallen Timbers, the author encounters his true nemesis - which is a preference for discussing tactical dispositions down to the Nth degree. Paragraph after paragraph was spent detailing where each unit stood in relation to its neighbor, while discussion of the actual combat and maneuvering was overly-succinct. After reading this, I only had a vague impression how Wayne used his artillery and his reserve, which appeared to be committed too soon. Describing a battle in a way that reduces the chaos and makes the key aspects discernable is no easy task, but here the author achieved only a partial success. He does effectively make the point that Wayne deployed his army in a way that made it difficult for the Indians to surround and that he was able to defeat their efforts at envelopment. However he fails to mention Indian casualties, which is an important point - no more than 2-3 percent of the Indian warriors were casualties at Fallen Timbers, so the ""decisive"" aspect of the battle appears more contentious than it would seem. Unable to surround Wayne, 97 percent of the Indians succeeded in disengaging and living to fight another day. Perhaps if less space had been devoted to tangential issues, the author could have spent more time discussing the impact of the battle and why it should be regarded as a great American victory, rather than a large skirmish in the woods. In truth, there were no decisive battles in the long Indian Wars, only skirmishes of various sizes - the defeat of the Indians in any given area was a process, not an event.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 17, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R23S5UQIEG4UU8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1780963750#wasThisHelpful","R23S5UQIEG4UU8","A34ZM36508LG9G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A34ZM36508LG9G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Thumbing through Benjamin Lai's The Chinese People's Liberation Army Since 1949: Ground Forces, a recent addition to Osprey's Elite series, it's clear that China has some very eye-catching uniforms and equipment. Of course, the author does not mention that the only successful major combat action conducted by the PLA in the past thirty years was murdering 3,000-or-so of their fellow countrymen in Tiananmen Square in Jun 1989 (referred to as an ""episode"" herein). That's the basic issue with this volume: excellent photos, thorough soup to nuts summary of PLA organization and equipment, but accompanied by a subtle whitewashing of history. The author mentions that the PLA crushed the Tibetan revolt but chalks it up to a CIA plot - the idea that Tibetans don't want to be part of China is not mentioned. This volumes serves to highlight the progress that the PLA has made in modernizing its ground forces and does not want to look at anything that detracts from that - like the fact that the PLA has far less combat experience than any other major army on earth. Lots of toys, no experience.  The whole question of mission is also conveniently ignored (if it's strictly defensive, why all the paratroopers, marines, tanks, missiles, etc). Nor does the author discuss PLA doctrine, although that would have been more relevant than all the space that he devoted to the People's Armed Police (PAP). Overall, this is an interesting volume but it leaves a faint aftertaste of propaganda. The volume begins with a discussion of the origin of the PLA  - as the ""armed wing of the Chinese Communist Party - and spends ten pages summarizing its major activities since 1949. He provides only two short paragraphs on the Korean War, which is not much considering that this was the PLA's largest operation since it was created. The 1962 Indo-Chinese Border War gets two sentences, even though this was the only clear-cut victory achieved by the PLA over a foreign adversary and it demonstrated the tactical adaptability of Chinese troops. In contrast, the author gives more coverage to the brief Sino-Soviet skirmishes in 1969 than he does to the Korean War. He does spend about 1  pages on the 1979 Sino-Vietnamese War, but tries to put it in a positive light (no mention that China attacked Vietnam in support of its genocidal ally, Pol Pot).  Most accounts suggest that a much smaller Vietnamese force roughly handled the PLA invaders and that it was China that was ""taught a lesson."" By the time that he gets to 1989, the author refers to Tiananmen Square as a ""controversial internal security operation"" - oh that's right, its censored in China, where the author resides. Nor is there any mention that a good part of the PLA is deployed to invade Taiwan, if that proves necessary. In the next section, the author discusses the higher-level organization of the PLA and then delves into tactical structures down to battalion, company and squad level. I was actually surprised how many cooks were in a PLA infantry battalion - at least 25. He then discusses key combat arms, including armor, aviation, special forces, airborne and missile troops. Most of the photos in the volume are in color and very nice, but too many of the troops look posed. The author's captions indicate that many were taken during military open house events and even the ""tactical"" scenes look staged. Looking at the uniforms, a soldier's eye can note that the uniforms and equipment all look brand new - no wear and tear. An infantry squad moving next to an IFV is horribly bunched up -looks like a `human wave assault' - and despite their new helmets and camo uniforms, they are wearing 1950s rubber shoes and white socks. An infantry patrol is shown with every member of the patrol having untied boot laces - did they have to borrow the boots for the photo? I love the ZTZ-99 tanks with white road wheel rims - that sure makes them easier to spot! In the U.S. Army, when you see all polished equipment like this, it's recognizable as a ""Dog and Pony Show"" to impress visitors and the military-ignorant.  The discussions of the SF troops and airborne border on comical, giving the impression that these units are all very highly capable and equivalent to the best Western units when in fact, the PLA has no combat airborne drops to its credit and precious few peacetime ones either. In the final sections, the author discusses recruitment and uniforms. He suggests that the PLA is moving to a professional force, but adding 600-1,000 NCOs a year for an army that size is a drop in the bucket. He states that NCOs can marry but that their wives are only allowed to visit once a year - that sounds more like prison than a professional army.  Despite its modern Western affectations, the PLA is still very much a party-dominated conscript force and it may have 21st Century weapons, but it's still using a 1950s approach to its soldiers. I hope the author does volumes on the naval and air forces, but readers should be aware that this is a very glossy coverage, without any attempt at a balanced assessment.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 8, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R22NMMO2ECXU4K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1780960565#wasThisHelpful","R22NMMO2ECXU4K","A34ZM36508LG9G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A34ZM36508LG9G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Generalfeldmarschall Erwin Rommel, commander of the Deutsches Afrika Korps, once joked to his Italian allies that Italian tanks had five gears  - one forward and four in reverse.  Perhaps Rommel would have benefited from reading Pier Paolo Battistelli's Italian Medium Tanks in Osprey's New Vanguard series, in order to learn more about the capabilities of his allies' tanks. As the author notes, Italian medium tanks quickly acquired a reputation as poorly armed, poorly protected and not very fast, but Italian tankers learned to make the best of their equipment in North Africa. While the M-series tanks never matured into truly effective medium tanks, the Semovente self-propelled guns remained useful up to the end of the war. Overall, this volume is well-written, beautifully illustrated and chock full of useful information; it is easily one of the best New Vanguards in the last several years. The volume begins with the first Italian medium tank, the unsuccessful M 11/39 tank, but the bulk of the coverage is on the M13/40 and M14/41 tanks. A number of interesting points are brought out by the author, including the inability of Italian industry to manufacture welded armour plate in the early stages of the Second World War, which forced the use of out-moded riveted armour on their tanks. Specific technical deficiencies, such as problems with the intercom system and the hydraulic pump that traversed the turret are addressed, as well. The author also notes German efforts to assist Italian industry in either building licensed-versions of German tanks or improving Italian-designed tanks with German engines and weaponry, but how these attempts all failed. He also details the use of Italian tanks in combat in North Africa in some detail, as well as the German use of captured Italian tanks after the Italian surrender. A great deal of information was packed into this small space.The volume has nine very good color plates (M11/39, M13/40, M14/41, M15/42, P40, Semovente M40 75/18, Semovente M43  105/25, tactical markings and symbols), a very detailed Interior cut-away of a M14/41 tank and two battlescenes depicting an M13/40 of the Ariete Division in the Western Desert in August 1942 and a Semovente 75/18 in the Western Desert in January 1942. The photographs in the volume are excellent and include excellent period B/W photos as well as modern color photos, including a number showing the interior of tanks. Indeed, the graphic quality of this volume seems to be well above the norm for Osprey's New Vanguard series. The author also provided a very useful table on tank production, by model, from 1940-45 and another on specifications for the three main medium tanks. Altogether, the graphics and data presented in this volume make it an excellent reference on Italian tanks in the Second World War and certainly the best at this price.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 3, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3N4PSR6TXW0BO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=184908775X#wasThisHelpful","R3N4PSR6TXW0BO","A34ZM36508LG9G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A34ZM36508LG9G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"In standard World War Two historiography, the Imperial Japanese Navy's carrier force was destroyed at Midway, completely swinging the initiative in the Pacific to the U.S. Navy. Unfortunately, this standard view tends to ignore the two carrier versus carrier actions that occurred just 2-4 months after Midway: the Battle of the Eastern Solomons (24 August 1942) and the Battle of Santa Cruz (26 October 1942). As naval historian Mark Stille notes in the latest Osprey Campaign volume, Santa Cruz 1942, ""it is noteworthy that, four months after midway when the Japanese carrier force was supposedly smashed, it was able to defeat its American adversary."" This volume details both the Battle of the Eastern Solomons and the Battle of Santa Cruz, which occurred when the issue of naval supremacy in the waters around Guadalcanal were still very much up for grabs. Like Midway, the U.S. carriers were out-numbered in each battle but unlike Midway, the U.S. Navy did not have a big advantage in terms of intelligence or surprise. Consequently, these two battles make for excellent case studies of Japanese versus U.S. carrier doctrines. Overall, this is a fine volume in the series, written by a historian who is intimately acquainted with his subject and who can also integrate his own naval service on U.S. Navy carriers to provide useful insight for the reader. The volume begins with the usual sections on opposing commanders, opposing forces and opposing plans. In the section on the U.S. carrier forces, the author notes that, ""a continuing weakness of the U.S. Navy's carrier force in 1942 was its difficulty in conducting coordinated air operations."" Even after Midway, the U.S. Navy's ability to coordinate the strike of multiple carrier air groups against a single target was negligible.  American radio intercepts and code-breaking, which had proved so valuable at Midway, suffered when the Japanese changed their radio calls signs just before the Battle of the Eastern Solomons.  The author notes that, ""the intelligence provided to Nimitz and Halsey before Santa Cruz was not only vague, but turned out to be incorrect."" In contrast, defeat at Midway forced the Japanese to adapt and in many respects, their remaining carriers were even more potent during the Solomons campaign. The Japanese had improved their ability to conduct area reconnaissance as well as generating multi-carrier strikes, and their air defense had improved somewhat. As the author demonstrates, in his blow-by-blow style battle narratives, the Battle of the Eastern Solomons was an American tactical victory because an important Japanese convoy to Guadalcanal was stopped, but Santa Cruz was a clear-cut Japanese victory that ended with a U.S. naval retreat. The author's dissection of U.S. and Japanese carrier tactics and doctrine in both battles stands in contrast to Parshall and Tully's views in Shattered Sword, which only analyzed this in terms of Midway and unequivocally claimed that U.S. carrier doctrine was superior. Here, Japanese carrier doctrine looks better in both battles and Midway looks more like an aberration. In any case, this volume provides a useful starting point for professional discussions on this subject, in light of two carrier battles that get much less attention. Overall, this is a very good volume in the Campaign series and the photographs are excellent.  The volume has five 2-D maps and three 3-D BEV maps; the BEV maps depict aerial attacks on carriers and have altitude markings. The three color battle scenes by artist Peter Dennis are up to his usual standard (the US attack on the carrier Zuiho, the Japanese attack on Enterprise and the end of the USS Hornet).  A very well written and professional piece of naval history, useful for both the general and specialist reading audiences.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 12, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3553AT4T817C2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1849086052#wasThisHelpful","R3553AT4T817C2","A34ZM36508LG9G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A34ZM36508LG9G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"David Stahel, an Australian researcher working in Berlin, wrote a dissertation on the ""crisis"" in the German high command in July-August 1941 over how to accomplish the objectives of Operation Barbarossa, the invasion of the Soviet Union. Now in book form, Stahel argues that Germany irretrievably lost the Second World War in August 1941. At points this book reads like a dissertation, but it is fairly well-structured and meticulously researched, unless you count the fact that it includes virtually no Russian sources. Up front, the author states rather defensively that combining Soviet and German archival material ""should not be mistaken for the benchmark of good research."" Instead, he asserts that his German-centric approach to understanding the outcome of Operation Barbarossa is perfectly legitimate and then proceeds to air-brush the Russians out of most of the book. The author also regards military history as linked to ""peace studies"" and has been influenced by current German attitudes toward military historiography, which seeks to affix blame upon members of the German military for participating in Hitler's criminal aggression, rather than analyzing military operations in detail. In his calculus, which he argues relentlessly from beginning to the end of the book, Barbarossa was ""doomed to fail."" Readers looking for a straight-up military history or an insightful piece of military analysis will not find it in these pages, although the author does present a great deal of information. I give him credit for laying out his case and for readers not familiar with the Eastern Front, it might even be convincing. However, rather than asking `could Germany have defeated the Soviet Union?'  the author employs a Reductio ad absurdum approach that leads to no useful conclusions. In his calculus, the Third Reich lost because it had to lose. Complex historical events, like a war between two great powers, are not usually determined by single causes, nor is it so easy to announce ""this was the moment!"" that a conflict became irretrievably lost.  However, the author makes reference to Clausewitz's theory of the culminating point in an offensive - the point at which the attacker's capabilities no longer exceeds the defender's - to claim that the Battle of Smolensk in July 1941 was that point in the Second World War.  To be fair to the author, David Glantz's has been making some similar claims for the importance of Smolensk in frustrating German plans, but without the same level of totality expressed here. Unfortunately, the author does not understand Clausewitz's theory of culmination very well; once an attacker has culminated, his forces are no longer strong enough to achieve any significant victories. However, the Wehrmacht won huge victories at Kiev, Vyazma-Bryansk and then advanced to within 10 miles of Moscow months after the Battle of Smolensk - clearly demonstrating that the Wehrmacht's combat power still exceeded that of the Red Army's until late November 1941. Yet the author minimizes these German victories, claiming that they had no real bearing on the outcome of the war.  The author also spends a great deal of time on Franz Halder and the German failure to take Moscow in 1941. It has been a truism in warfare for centuries that no plan survives contact with the enemy, but the author holds Barbarossa's intended goal of the rapid destruction of the Red Army as the only possible favorable outcome for Germany, while neglecting to mention that the Red Army never even came close to meeting its MP-41 plan's goal of fighting on foreign soil. In other words, the Wehrmacht failed to accomplish all of Barbarossa's goals and the Red Army failed to accomplish any of MP-41's goals, so Germany lost the war. How is that logical? A large part of the author's hypothesis rests on his contention that the offensive capability of German panzer divisions declined rapidly soon after the beginning of Barbarossa and became critical after the Battle of Smolensk. He presents selected statistics to buttress his arguments but misses several key facts. First, it is true that most German panzer units were down to about 50 percent strength in tanks after Smolensk, but all of the pre-war Soviet mechanized corps were gone after mid-July 1941 and the Red Army had even less tanks on the battlefield after Smolensk. Second, the author completely misses the arrival of the 2nd and 5th Panzer Divisions from Germany in September 1941 - both at 100 percent strength - which gave the Germans a numerical edge for Operation Typhoon.  The new Soviet rifle divisions raised after Smolensk had so little artillery and anti-tank guns that even depleted panzer divisions had little difficulty punching through them.  The author tends to exaggerate all German losses, eventually claiming that Army Group Center was ""crippled"" at Smolensk, while disregarding Soviet losses and problems, stating that Soviet production could make good any losses. In fact, in 1941-42 the Germans were destroying Soviet tanks as fast as they were being produced and the Red Army did not gain a real edge in armor until 1943. Conventional wisdom suggests the Barbarossa was a darn close thing and that the War in the East was not irrevocably lost until Stalingrad. Although well-argued with the facts and narrow perspective he chooses to use, the author's hypothesis remains unconvincing. Throughout the book, the author single-mindedly pushes his hypothesis like a political candidate trying to stay on message, rather than as a historian who objectively analyzes all relevant data, from multiple angles.  The entire idea that only German actions and decisions really mattered and that Soviet victory was a given due to a superior production base is more representative of the author's a priori agenda, than objective historical method. In order to win, the Red Army had to do more than just absorb punishment - it had to demonstrate the ability to conduct successful large-scale offensive operations, which did not occur until November 1942.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 5, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2VIJRHCFIV523/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=052117015X#wasThisHelpful","R2VIJRHCFIV523","A34ZM36508LG9G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A34ZM36508LG9G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The vitality of Great Britain's economy in the Nineteenth and early Twentieth Centuries depended upon international trade and the Royal Navy played a vital role in safeguarding the global trade routes from adversaries. Several classes of armored and protected cruisers were developed with a primary mission of trade protection beginning in the 1870s and continuing until the First World War. However, the intense naval combat of the First World had a profound impact upon cruiser design, with a recognition that cruisers might have to take on more heavily-armed opponents than previously envisioned. Consequently, even before the war had ended, the Royal Navy had begun constructing the large Hawkins-class cruisers, weighing nearly 10,000 tons and armed with 7.5-inch guns. After the war, when international naval disarmament talks began in the 1920s, the Hawkins class became the standard for a new type of warship known as a heavy cruiser, displacing 10,000 tons and armed with 8-inch guns. The British Admiralty estimated that it needed 70 cruisers of all types to fulfill its strategic requirements, but financial constraints prevented the Royal Navy from attaining this force level. Instead, between 1924 and 1931, Great Britain built a total of 13 heavy cruisers in five classes (Kent, London, York, Norfolk and Exeter). The heavy cruisers were assigned a primary mission of trade protection, but were also tasked with supporting the main battle fleet in surface operations and providing naval gunfire support. During the Second World War, these thirteen heavy cruisers served for the duration and four were sunk in battle. Angus Konstam provides a succinct look at these warships in the Osprey New Vanguard title British Heavy Cruisers 1939-45. He begins with the Hawkins class and the factors that shaped the design of the succeeding five heavy cruiser classes in the 1920s. It is clear that Washington Naval Treaty restrictions and cost had a major impact on limiting the armored protection, firepower and speed of these warships. Every navy had to make compromises in designing their heavy cruisers; the Royal Navy opted to skimp on protection and firepower in order to get cruisers with the range to accomplish their trade protection mission. The author begins by describing the genesis of each class, then provides data plates on each class, then provides capsule histories, then provides a section on armament and other equipment. The volume has color plates of HMS Cumberland, HMS Suffolk, HMS Norfolk, HMS York, HMS London, HMS Sussex, HMS Exeter and HMS Frobisher, as well as a 2-page cutaway of HMS Cornwall  and two battle scenes (HMS Berwick at the Battle of Cape Spartivento on 27 November 1940 and HMS Exeter at the Battle of the River Platte on 13 December 1939). This volume is a decent introduction to British heavy cruisers of the Second World War, but it suffers from inadequate technical details. To begin with, the author failed to discuss the troubled development of the 8-inch Mark VIII L/50 gun, central to the heavy cruiser's firepower. It took over four years to develop this weapon and it was not ready when first emplaced on the new heavy cruisers. He fails to mention that one of HMS Devonshire's 8-inch guns exploded during gunnery trials in 1929, killing 18 of her crew and requiring extensive modifications to the weapon. Even afterward, the Mark VIII suffered from a low rate of fire compared to other cruiser guns.  Improvements in British gunnery due to the partial introduction of DCTs in the 1930s is only briefly addressed, without indicating its significance. Although the author makes it sound that these cruisers were little modified during the 1930s, improvements in gunnery/range estimation technology dramatically improved the accuracy of their firepower over their First World War predecessors. Nor does the author fully explain the armor layout, with a box protection scheme of 4-inch thick armor around each of the four turret barbettes and magazines and just 1-inch of armor on the rest of the hull - he mentions it, but almost in passing. Readers might also wonder why the Royal Navy stopped building heavy cruisers in 1930; that's because the author failed to mention that it was the tonnage limits of the London Naval Treaty of 22 April 1930 dissuaded the Royal Navy from building any further heavy cruisers. In sum, this volume is attractive and engaging, but ultimately too superficial to render an effective portrait of its subject.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 8, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3136EVDE2XBX4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1849086869#wasThisHelpful","R3136EVDE2XBX4","A34ZM36508LG9G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A34ZM36508LG9G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Dr. Pier Paolo Battistelli's Albert Kesselring, No. 27 in Osprey's Command series, offers a succinct look at Generalfeldmarschall Albert Kesselring, one of the most unusual German commanders in the Second World War. As the author notes, Kesselring rose very rapidly in the German army, transferred to the new Luftwaffe in the 1930s and then occupied key joint-service command slots during the Second World War. Aside from his own memoirs and one dated biography in English, Kesselring hasn't been covered much in English-language history so this volume has merit. However, the 64-page format is tough to pull off (as I can attest personally, having written three previous volumes in this series) and in this case, is only a partial success. I suspect that a good amount of information that fell on the cutting room floor and the volume seemed to lack continuity at parts, which could also be indicative of too much editorial meddling. In any case, this volume is a decent introduction to Kesselring and his role in the Second World War, but essentially just scratches the surface. Kesselring's early life and career are covered in a few pages in the introduction. One thing that struck my eye was that, ""Kesselring did not serve in the trenches or even the front line [in the First World War], he was awarded the Iron Cross first and second class..."" Instead, he spent much of the First World War as an adjutant in various artillery units. Afterwards, he spent much of the 1920s in Defense Ministry postings, with only minimal command time. It is also interesting that Kesselring never really served in the hardcore staff position so exalted in the German military - operations officer. When he transferred to the Luftwaffe in 1933, Kesselring continued to occupy high-level ministry positions. All this begs greater insight into Kesselring's political instincts and ability to climb the career ladder so successfully, but without the usual credentials. However, this volume provides no insight into how Kesselring achieved such rapid career success. The author then spends a bit more space discussing Kesselring's role as Chief of Staff of the Luftwaffe and then commander of an Air Fleet in the 1939-41 campaigns. Nothing really new here. He then spent the period 1942-44 in the Mediterranean theater, where he made his most noteworthy contribution by the tenacious defense of Italy. As another reviewer noted, the volume actually says little about Kesselring's command style. A good approach might have been to zoom in on a particular battle, like Monte Cassino, and review key decisions made by Kesselring during a day or two of combat. The section on opposing commanders is little more than capsule bios, with no real comparison of how Kesselring stacked up against opponents like Harold Alexander or Mark Clark. The final section focuses heavily on Kesselring's alleged role in war crimes in Italy - thought there was a bit too much on this for a volume this size. The author only partially sums of Kesselring's individual contributions and faults, citing his excessive optimism in particular. I'm not sure that characteristic was either unique to Kesselring or necessarily pernicious. A good commander has to be optimistic even in the most critical situations; what was he supposed to do in 1943, throw up his hands and say `we're all screwed! The war is lost!' The ability of commanders like Model, Rommel and Kesselring to inspire their troops with optimism in 1944 was a critical combat multiplier for the Wehrmacht and not a fault from their point of view.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 2, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1CYNP286HL19P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1849087350#wasThisHelpful","R1CYNP286HL19P","A34ZM36508LG9G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A34ZM36508LG9G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When I heard that Osprey was including The Battle of Borodino in its line-up for their 2012 Campaign series, I was both interested and worried. For true Napoleonic fans know that Napoleon's hash was settled in Russia, not on the fields of Waterloo, so any new books on Borodino in English are welcome. However, I was concerned that Osprey would make the same mistake it did years ago with Stalingrad and try to cram too much into a slim 96-page volume. After finishing Borodino 1812, I felt that some of my concern was justified - trying to jam Napoleon's entire Russian campaign into one volume weakens the value of the final product - although the author, Philip Haythornthwaite, had the skill to carry it off with great aplomb. In short, Napoleonic aficionados will appreciate the artwork but probably bristle that barely twenty pages of text were given to the actual battle. On the other hand, general readers who don't want to tackle the 1,000+ pages of Austin P. Britten's 1812: The March on Moscow (1993)will appreciate this as a good introduction to  the Russian Campaign. Overall, the author provides a good narrative with excellent supporting artwork, although the maps are not always adequate for following his narrative. The initial sections of the volume, on opposing commanders, plans and forces, are a bit brief. The author provides capsule bios on eight French/Polish and nine Russian commanders, which should be more than sufficient for general readers. The other two topics are lumped into one 8-page section, which does not flow particularly well. There is no real discussion in this section about the strengths and weaknesses of the opposing forces, merely a general laydown. The author does provide a 3  page order of battle, which extends down to regimental-level. Napoleon's initial invasion, the Battle of Smolensk and Kutusov's assumption of command are covered in 12 pages, which is quick but adequate. The Battle of Borodino is the main part of the volume and the coverage is fairly decent. There is more detail in this section about what specifics units and commanders are doing, although still mostly at the division-level. The final section covers the fall of Moscow and Napoleon's retreat to the Berezina; here and there, the author inserts something I haven't read in the last 4-5 books I've read about this campaign, but nothing terribly unique. The author's account of the retreat is solid, if brief.  As for analysis, the author suggests that Napoleon underestimated the task in invading Russia, which would seem blatantly obvious. The last section, on the battlefield today, was disappointing, with no photos of any current monuments at Borodino and precious little information about the museum. Looking at the bibliography, I was struck by the fact that all the sources listed were either English or French - apparently he made no effort to find any Russian sources. Taken together, it would appear that the author neglected to make use of the Internet in researching this volume, which marks it as an Old-style approach to history, seen primarily through English eyes. Borodino 1812 has three colorful battle scenes by Peter Dennis (Murat at Borodino, fall of the Great Redoubt, the retreat from Moscow). The maps in Borodino 1812 are not very effective. The five 2-D maps (strategic situation at the beginning of the campaign; the line of Napoleon's advance to Borodino; the Battle of Smolensk; Borodino, the opening dispositions; the retreat; the Berezina) are OK as far as general movements and dispositions, but primarily depict corps and division-size formations. The three 3-D BEV maps all depict the Battle of Borodino at various stages during the day, but again, depict mostly corps and a few divisions. The problem is that the BEV maps are too ""zoomed out,"" with gridlines 1-km apart, so that even key features like the Raevsky Redoubt (which is smack-dab in the machine fold of the volume, as usual) and the fleches are lost in the map. The BEVs should have been used to show tactical actions down to at least regimental level (since the text covers this) by zooming in on the key terrain, not trying to show the entire battlefield (and thereby showing little). In an otherwise fine volume, the maps were a disappointment.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 27, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2OO3M0RPVHQJF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1849086966#wasThisHelpful","R2OO3M0RPVHQJF","A34ZM36508LG9G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A34ZM36508LG9G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"While most Americans are familiar with the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941, relatively few know anything about the man who ordered and directed the attack - Admiral Yamamoto Isoroku. In the past fifty years, there have only been a handful of books in English on Yamamoto and earlier works failed to incorporate Japanese insights. Noted naval historian Mark Stille provides an excellent introduction to Yamamoto's career and his impact on the Pacific War in one of the latest additions to Osprey's Command series. While popularized depictions of Yamamoto tended to cast him as a great admiral and a man who sought peaceful relations with the United States, the author makes an excellent case that, ""while gifted in many ways, Yamamoto was no military genius."" This is one of the better volumes in the Command series and belongs on the shelf of anyone with a serious interest in the Pacific War. The volume begins with a discussion of Yamamoto's origins, which can be confusing (since he was born under the family name Takano). The author discusses Yamamoto's quick rise through the ranks of the Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN), his wounding in the Russo-Japanese War, trips to America, diplomatic experience and staff roles. In particular, the author notes Yamamoto's opposition to the construction of the Yamato-class battleships and favored greater investment in naval aviation. Instead of battleships, Yamamoto pushed for long-range bombers like the ""Nell"" and ""Betty"" bombers, which would prove their worth against the British battleships Repulse and Prince of Wales in 1941. Yet the author successfully argues that while Yamamoto had positively influenced how the IJN was configured and trained for war, he was a less than optimal choice to lead the fleet in war since he was essentially a ""political admiral"" with ""little command experience."" Yamamoto was the kind of officer, perhaps like an Alfred Thayer Mahan, whose best role was in an intellectual capacity rather than battle command. When Yamamoto was chosen to command the IJN in 1939, he became involved in the politics leading up to Japan's involvement in the Second World War. Yamamoto became involved in arguments with the General Staff and developed a pet theory that attacking Pearl Harbor could cripple American resolve, even though other senior Japanese leaders believed that America might not intervene to stop a Japanese attack on the Dutch East Indies (probably correct) and even if it did, a raid on Pearl Harbor was too risky. The author notes that Yamamoto began employing his tactic of threatening to resign unless he got his way - not exactly an effective command style, more like a politician. Throughout, the author shows inconsistencies in Yamamoto's behavior that led to later disasters, such as failure to listen to alternative views or to incorporate any degree of flexibility into his planning. If anything, Yamamoto comes across as overly-rigid, inflexible and willing to allow preconceived ideas rather than battlefield realities to guide his decisions. After Pearl Harbor, Yamamoto was looking for an off-ramp for Japan to get out of its predicament of being in a war with the United States that it could not win. The author notes that Yamamoto regarded the period after the fall of Singapore as the optimal time to negotiate, but was disappointed that Japan's leaders made no diplomatic overtures to the U.S. This was actually rather a moot point on two counts: first, Japan's political leadership was unwilling to compromise on its conquests in any way and second, the Americans would not consider any political deals with Japan after the diplomatic deceptions employed prior to Pearl Harbor. Yamamoto apparently didn't get the memo: after Pearl Harbor, it was a fight to the death. Nowadays, Japan's decision to attack the United States is generally regarded as an act of national suicide and Yamamoto was the man holding the knife, just without much self awareness. Yamamoto ""succeeded in hijacking the formulation of Japanese naval strategy,"" which led to the debacles at Midway and Guadalcanal. His operational plans were too complex and his battle command style too loose and remote, content to remain isolated on ""Hotel Yamato"" (his flagship, the battleship Yamato). Even when his forces scored a success, like the Battle of the Eastern Solomons in October 1942, Yamamoto failed to capitalize on it. Indeed, his behavior became increasingly fatalistic and passive after Midway, allowing the U.S. Navy to grab the strategic initiative. In the last part of the volume, the author contrasts Yamamoto with his primary opponent - Admiral Chester Nimitz, and Yamamoto does not come off very favorably. The author makes a good point that Yamamoto was not really a modern admiral, for a number of reasons, and remained mired in old-style thinking (as in regard to battleships). In the final section, the author covers Yamamoto's death in some detail and his post-war reputation. The volume has five maps and three battle scenes by Adam Hook, as well as a short bibliography. Overall, a very compelling assessment of Japan's principle naval commander in the Second World War.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 24, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R22Q71QDLBZZ05/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1849087318#wasThisHelpful","R22Q71QDLBZZ05","A34ZM36508LG9G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A34ZM36508LG9G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The book entitle ""Knights Cross Panzers"" is an anthology of German first-person accounts, usually written either during the Second World War or during the 1950s, concerning the operations and personalities of Panzer-Regiment 35. This regiment was normally an integral part of 4. Panzer-Division, but one panzer battalion was detached to the 11. Panzer-Division in 1942-43. The accounts are not always polished because they were not intended for publication - rather, they were written for post-war regimental reunions. Consequently, some of the accounts are quite good and others are not. This book was lightly edited, with occasional explanatory notes, but the continuity between chapters is very loose. There is little or no effort to put the regiment's activities in perspective with the ""big picture"" and even the rest of 4. Panzer-Division is only rarely mentioned. The accounts begin with the invasion of Poland in September 1939 (32 pages), then the 1940 French Campaign (32 pages), but spend the majority on the Russian Campaign until the regiment was finally crushed in 1945 (360 pages). It is also important to emphasize that this book is not a proper unit history with exact dates and numbers; large chunks of time or some events are just not covered. Overall, I would say that the book starts out fairly strongly, with the best accounts in the period 1940-41, but it starts to skip around a lot in 1942-43 and becomes quite tedious and obtuse by 1944-45. In the Polish Campaign, Panzer-Regiment 35 was involved in a costly effort to capture Warsaw on 8 September 1939, which was repulsed with heavy losses. The accounts mentioned here mentioned some of the losses, but fall short of criticizing the poor decision to use tanks in city fighting. Instead, the contributors vent spleen on the Polish ""not keeping their word concerning Warsaw being an open city."" Typical German wartime attitude - anger at people defending their capital from German invaders.  The section on the French Campaign is fairly decent, with brief accounts of the tank battle at Hannut and the Somme offensive. The accounts of the Russian Campaign are best for 1941 and it was interesting the Panzer-Regiment 35 was running out of fuel on just the second day of the invasion and forced to request aerial resupply. It is also interesting that the regiment was dealing with significant problems with heavy rain and muddy roads in early July, well before the official start of the autumn rasputitsa.  Indeed, the regiment seems to struggle more with the terrain in the early stages of Barbarossa, than the Russians. Most German tank losses in PzRgt 35 in the early days of the invasion were caused by Soviet artillery or anti-tank guns, not Soviet tanks.  Interestingly, by D+30 of Barbarossa, the regiment only had 44 operational panzers out of an authorized total of about 170. The period July-September 1941 is the best covered in the book, with considerable detail on individual actions. While the battle accounts are interesting, they are not always accurate and this becomes noticeable with the account concerning the Battle of Mtensk in October 1941; these accounts were written before access to wartime records and material from both sides were widely available and often represent narrow viewpoints, based on incomplete information. I also began to notice an annoying tendency for many accounts to incorporate anachronistic, American-style phraseology that appears inserted afterwards to enhance readability for American audiences. It is also noticeable that nowhere in these accounts do you see German attitudes toward the Russians or the war, even though most German wartime memoirs make it clear what these attitudes were. In other words, this is a ""sanitized"" narrative, not intended to offend anyone. Instead, we see just a bunch of clean-cut, German comrades having the time of their lives and getting lots of medals. Indeed, there is a subtle ""fake"" quality to this book.  It is apparent that German tankers exhibited some bizarre behavior sometimes. After a tank raid into the city of Orel, all the crews of one company parked their tanks and went to sleep soon in a nearby building. Soon after, Soviet tanks counterattacked into Orel and the German tankers had difficulty getting back to their tanks. The idea of leaving one's tanks unguarded in a hostile city and going to sleep seems like comfort trumping good judgment. The German habit of digging foxholes under their tanks so they could sleep safe from sudden artillery barrages also seems a bit foolhardy; it is noticeable how many German tankers were wounded outside their tanks. On the other hand, some accounts provide interesting details on how German tanks figured out how to defeat the T-34 in 1941-42. During the Winter of 1941/42, Panzer-Regiment 35 lost almost all its tanks and only had one panzer company left for months. There are many interesting accounts in this period on logistical shortfalls, winter expedients and the impact of disease on the regiment. However, much of 1942 just falls off the radar screen and before you know it, the book arrives at the Battle of Kursk. From Kursk to the end of the war, the book begins to trail off into a mushy mish-mash, with less detail and insights. Lots of tanks moving around through villages or woods, knocking out some T-34s, but all rather incoherent. The fact that the Germans were getting their butts kicked is coolly ignored. There are quite a number of B/W photos included, many of which are unique, but their quality is exceedingly poor. A good number of maps are provided in the middle of the book, although I did not find them particularly helpful - most of the time I had difficulty finding the right map to go with particular accounts (this is where an editor could have helped).","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 21, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1YSG1WTIRW27G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0811705927#wasThisHelpful","R1YSG1WTIRW27G","A34ZM36508LG9G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A34ZM36508LG9G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Storm of Steel is a historical analysis of the development of German and Soviet armored warfare doctrine in the period 1928-1941, written in 2003 by Mary R. Habeck, a history professor at Johns Hopkins. This is a dry, academic-style doctrinal study, but it is rewarding for those readers with more than a passing interest in how both country's created and developed their tank units in the Interwar Period. Storm of Steel is well organized and very well footnoted, as one would expect from a university professor, although the use of tables and charts would have been a useful addition. The book is well-written, if a bit wooden at times, and the author's main thesis that both country's doctrine was shaped by similar factors is sound. There are issues - such as the evolution of tank technology - which the author spent little time upon, even though germane to doctrinal development. Overall, a decent academic history, although the narrative lags at times. The Storm of Steel is divided into seven chapters, beginning with the period immediately following the end of the First World War. During 1919-23, both the post-war German Reichswehr and the Soviet Red Army had no tanks and spent this period trying to decide what future role tanks might provide. As early as 1923, the Soviet Union became interested in developing a large tank force in order to match Western capitalist armies, although the author notes that the Red Army initially devoted only one percent of its budget to tank development.  The second chapter covers the debate over mechanization, which occurred in both armies during 1923-27. The author discusses how conservative cavalry officers in both countries opposed the tank and mechanization for a variety of reasons. In addition, the advocates of ""moral"" power (as in Napoleon's maxim, that `the moral is to the material as three is to one') argued that reliance on tanks rather than the willpower of their infantry was a mistake; this argument still retains some saliency even today. In the third chapter, the author discusses the beginning of covert Soviet-German technical collaboration at the Kazan Tank School and the weaknesses that led both sides to cooperate with each other. Due to the weakness of Soviet industry, the Soviets needed foreign technical help in developing tanks and due to the Treaty of Versailles the Germans needed a quiet place to (illegally) test new weapons and tactics. This chapter is very rewarding in that the author effectively demonstrates that the Germans did not influence subsequent Soviet tank doctrine and the relative backwardness of Germany's inchoate tank doctrine in comparison to Soviet Deep Battle theory. The author also details the success of Stalin's First Five Year Plan in rapidly building up the Soviet Union's tank production capabilities in an amazingly short period of time - something Hitler would have been wise to emulate. Important developments, like the Soviet creation of a Tank Directorate (UMM) and new field regulations, are discussed in some detail. Chapter four, covering the period 1930-31, discusses the development of Germany's first tanks and Soviet efforts to refine Deep Battle theory into a workable doctrine. The fifth chapter covers the end of Soviet-German military collaboration and doctrinal evolutions in both countries. Whereas the Soviets had a fairly uniform view of tanks by 1933, the Reichswehr was still very divided about tanks when Hitler came to power. When Hitler's plans to expand the Reichswehr were first discussed, there was no provision for panzer divisions, even though the Red Army had already formed its first mechanized corps. However, the Red Army had difficulty actually conducting Deep Battle in its summer maneuvers, and learned the difficulties of supplying a large mechanized formation (with no solution in sight). Interestingly, the author contrasts the Soviet preference for creating a checklist-like playbook for Deep Battle versus the German preference for a more ambiguous doctrine that left room for lower-level initiative in combat. Chapter six discusses the role reversal of 1934-36, with the Red Army losing much of its advantages in tank development and doctrine due to the Stalinist purges of the military, while Hitler's newly-formed Wehrmacht formed its first panzer divisions. However, the author makes an important point when she states that, ""despite these triumphs, the Germans would never catch up with their Soviet counterparts in one vital area: the mass production of tanks."" Just as the Red Army enshrined Deep Battle as official doctrine in the PU-36 Field Regulations, Stalin imprisoned or executed all its key advocates, effectively strangling it at birth. On the German side, the author spends considerable time on the Guderian-Lutz-Beck debates on tanks, but misses the creation of the Sturmgeschutz (assault gun) by Manstein as an effort to keep some armor in the infantry support role. Likewise, the book is weak on assessing the impact of new technologies on doctrine, such as the Soviet development of the V-2 diesel tank engine and incorporation of sloped armor in designs. This would have been a good time to discuss how Hitler - who had some good ideas about tanks, such as better armament - was ignored in designing Germany's panzers. In contrast, Stalin had a major say in the development of individual Soviet tanks. The final chapter discusses the impact of the Spanish Civil War, the Chaco War and other small conflicts on tank developments in both countries. Two other topics which I felt the author skimped on was on how the first tank units were created in each country (mentioned only very briefly) and how personnel were trained in each country. Developing doctrine is one thing, but the question of how it was taught to tank crews was essentially ignored. Overall, Storm of Steel is informative, erudite and persuasive, although certainly only for those with a strong interest in doctrinal studies.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 29, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RKHOEEEMMP7AA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0801440742#wasThisHelpful","RKHOEEEMMP7AA","A34ZM36508LG9G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A34ZM36508LG9G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The historiography of the 1944 D-Day invasion has been so shaped by the iconic images of Allied paratrooper/glider assaults and amphibious landings that it is often easy to forget about the French population, the people we were trying to liberate. The history of the French resistance or Maquis is also very controversial and thus, is often omitted from standard works on the campaign in Normandy. In Das Reich, written in 1981, British historian Max Hastings shows Anglo-American readers a completely different version of what was going on in France in June 1944, from the point of view of French Maquis and civilians, as well as a handful of British and American special operatives. The main antagonist is the German 2. SS-Panzer-Division Das Reich, which was stationed southeast of Bordeaux. As Hastings lays out in the book, the Allies anticipated that the Germans would attempt to move the Das Reich toward Normandy as soon as the invasion began and they hoped that the French resistance - with help - could slow it down. This book is the story of that effort, told from both the French, Anglo-American and German viewpoints (Hastings wrote this when far more veterans were still around). At times I found that the author wandered a bit, discussing some personality feature of some French resistance leader who actually played no major role in this episode, but on the whole reading the book was quite rewarding. In particular, the author's narrative of the massacre at Oradouor and the SAS Operation Bulbasket are first-rate. As usual, the author is both incisive and pithy, as a good British historian should. In the first several chapters,  the author describes how the badly-depleted Das Reich Division was sent from the Ukraine to France to rebuild, as well as the British effort through the Special Operations Executive (SOE) to establish espionage and sabotage networks with the French resistance. The author puts in a lot of detail about the training and background of SOE agents before they were parachuted into France and the idiosyncrasies of the pro-Gaulist and pro-Communist resistance factions. Some of this can get quite Byzantine. On top of that, many Frenchmen mentioned in the narrative were also collaborators with Vichy and the Germans. The author paints a pretty woeful picture of the French resistance, describing many as unmotivated and little better than bandits, with their priority being to avoid forced labor in Germany - not fight Germans. Indeed, the author claims that, ""Without SOE, Resistance could have achieved nothing.""  This might be a trifle Anglo-centric. While the first third of the book focuses on clandestine operations, once D-Day occurs, the Resistance mobilize en masse to cause problems for the Germans, particularly in disrupting the rail lines. Then the Germans made a major mistake - one that is rarely credited in other D-Day histories - they decided to commit the Das Reich to suppress the partisans in southern France, rather than heading directly to Normandy. Infuriated by recurrent small-scale sniping and sabotage, the Das Reich began their two-week march to Normandy with the primary intent of conducting a show of force against the French resistance. However, not all the French resistance got the message. In Tulle, a small town northeast of Bordeaux, the local French resistance defeated most of the local German garrison and proclaimed self-liberation. Within hours, the vanguard of the Das Reich arrived and put paid to the liberation and hanged 97 local civilians in retaliation for the alleged murder of German prisoners. The author spends two chapters on Tulle, which give a very good tactical feel for partisan and anti-partisan actions. The Resistance members showed a total lack of tactical skill, including the non-use of surprise, so it was no surprise that Das Reich handed them their heads. The author then discusses the Jedburgh teams, which included American OSS types, which were sent in to organize attacks after D-Day. The commentary by one American Jedburgh team leader, about the near-total uselessness of the resistance, are quite revealing. The last couple of chapters deal with the grisly massacre at Oradour and the failed SAS operation Bulbasket. At Oradour, the author believes that a local German commander made the snap decision to murder everyone in the town, but that the ethos of the Waffen SS and the climate of retribution encouraged this type of decision. He also notes that after the Oradour massacre, resistance activities against the Das Reich fell off to zero - indicating that harsh measures can be effective at intimidating insurgents. At least that was the German take-away. As for Bulbasket, the decision to parachute an SAS squadron into France armed only with pistols borders on the idiotic, as the author notes. Although the SAS troopers had one clear success - directing an RAF raid on German fuel tankers - their base camp was eventually discovered and overrun by the Germans. All the SAS prisoners were executed, making this a very expensive fiasco. Overall, Das Reich adds a good deal to D-Day historiography, although hardly flattering to the participants on both sides.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 13, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1H17YR4F9Z75D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=003057059X#wasThisHelpful","R1H17YR4F9Z75D","A34ZM36508LG9G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A34ZM36508LG9G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Although ground warfare in the First World was characterized by indecisive, static trench warfare, there were moments of mobility and decisive combat. One such moment was the German-Austrian Gorlice-Tarnow Campaign in May 1915. A joint German-Austrian force, under the command of Generalfeldmarschall August von Mackensen, was able to achieve a major breakthrough that had two major strategic effects: it removed the Russian threat to Austria-Hungary in the Carpathians and eventually led to the collapse of the Russian line in Poland. Yet, the Gorlice-Tarnow Campaign is not well known in First World War historiography and Professor DiNardo's book Breakthrough represents a significant leap forward in scholarship on this important battle, at least in English. However, the book is fundamentally undermined by its maps, which are grossly insufficient for readers to follow the author's campaign narrative. Another key problem is the lack of balance - the book is overwhelmingly told from the viewpoint of the Central Powers, with only the briefest nod to Russian circumstances Overall, this is an important book, but one which fell far short of what it could have been. Breakthrough is divided into nine sequential chapters. The first two chapters cover the strategic setting and the problems of coalition warfare.  The author provides good perspective on both the Austrian and German senior leadership, Conrad and Falkenhayn, and their professional relationships. It was Falkenhayn who made the key decision to commit the small German strategic reserve (barely eight divisions) to the Eastern Front to prevent an Austrian debacle on the Carpathians.  The new units were formed into the German 11. Armee under Mackensen and as the author notes, these were picked troops, including the Prussian Guards Corps. German leadership was excellent, with Hans von Seeckt serving as Mackensen's chief of staff and Major Fedor von Bock (future Army Group Center commander in 1941) as operations officer. Wilhelm von Leeb, future commander of Army Group North, was also involved as a staff officer. As the author notes, ""the true power of Mackensen's army lay in the additional artillery attached to his component corps."" For the first time, the Germans decided to use 21-cm and 30.5-cm heavy howitzers against field works. However, German logistics behind the offensive were insufficient, with only 300,000 shells stockpiled for Mackensen's offensive.  This was not much by 1916 standards, but both the Allies and Central Powers were very low on artillery ammunition in early 1915 (the ""shell scare"") due to failure to anticipate wartime demands. The author's details on the planning for the offensive and the movement of German troops to Galicia is very good. Mackensen's initial offensive in May 1915 is covered in the fourth chapter. The 11th Army achieved all its objectives - which were rather limited - in the first week and pushed back the Russian 3rd Army. However, the Germans quickly ran into logistic difficulties after an advance of even 20 miles and the operation degenerated into something of a ""stone soup offensive,"" with the Germans pausing every few weeks to reorganize and wait for supplies to catch up. The Russians were pushed back and large numbers of prisoners taken, but no decisive encirclements occurred. The author provides a decent amount of detail on German-Austrian operations, but the reader will not be able to follow this on the sketch maps, which are hopeless. The maps lack major terrain features like rivers, as well as important towns, fortresses and hills mentioned in the text, nor do they have a scale bar. Furthermore, most units (armies and some corps) are simply depicted with a flag in their general location; the location of division-size units and below remain a mystery throughout.  The lack of first-person tactical accounts also makes the text fairly dry, lacking a feel for tactical action. The remaining chapters discuss the subsequent German capture of Lemberg and the eventual Russian withdrawal from central Poland. Mackensen's tired army is eventually broken up in September 1915, having accomplished its task. The author concludes that German success was dependent upon three factors: air reconnaissance, heavy artillery and communications. Even though the Germans did not have a great deal of artillery ammunition, they used aerial reconnaissance to spot Russian positions, so rounds were not wasted. Superior communications enabled Mackensen to react more quickly than his Russian opponents. The author also notes that the Russian failure to defend in depth and their insufficient artillery support seriously compromised their ability to stop Mackensen. All in all, this is a good book and the author is to be applauded for his trail-blazing effort, but more work needs to be done on this topic to add more on the Russian perspective and to develop a more coherent campaign narrative, complete with map references.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 25, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3F7LG1MRKPF9D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0275991105#wasThisHelpful","R3F7LG1MRKPF9D","A34ZM36508LG9G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A34ZM36508LG9G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Barbara Tuchman has always been one of my favorite popular historians because she wrote better than many scholarly historians and she had a knack for capturing important facets of history and transducing them into simple but captivating themes. Some would say that she possessed Herodotus' skill at sifting through events and determining their greater meaning. In The March of Folly (1984), Tuchman decided to examine the role of folly - which she defines as a conscious decision to act against one's own best interests - in government, from Ancient times to the Vietnam War. As usual, the March of Folly was a darn good read; coherent, well-argued and studded with pithy observations. I felt that I learned something new or learned to think differently about something I already knew on almost every page - which is a rare quality in books today. On the other hand, I can't say that the author has really proved any grand hypothesis about the role of folly in human history - although her comments about how leaders make faulty decisions does ring true for our current leaders, as well. Nor was I so sanguine about all of the author's analysis of each of the three epochs involved, particularly the final section on Vietnam. Unlike her previous efforts on the First World War and the Middle Ages, the author strayed into personal bias about a period that she lived through and lost some of her objectivity along the way. It is easy to be wise after the fact, but Tuchman's deconstruction of how past leaders always had an alternative to the course of folly that they actually chose may not be valid in the real world. The March of Folly is divided into three main sections, which discuss the Renaissance Popes and the beginning of the Protestant reformation, how Britain lost the American colonies and the United States in Vietnam. Tuchman uses these three examples to build her case that there is a common theme of political misjudgment in high-level decision-makers, particularly in powerful states or organizations. The section on the Renaissance popes in the period 1470-1530 is the shortest in the book, at about 72 pages. She certainly hits the nail on the head in depicting the corrupt antics of six of the worst popes, who through their vile behavior incited resentment and revolt against the Church. Tuchman notes that a large part of the problem was that these popes adopted the mores of medieval Italy, which was violent, corrupt and self-aggrandizing. However, the popes were hardly unique in their corruption, since most secular leaders at the time were just as self-serving. Marxists would say that this was the ideology of the ruling class in pre-modern Europe. It's not like the Reformation brought peace and prosperity to Europe - it brought war, persecution and ethnic cleansing. I also detected a bias by the author against the Church; she condemns the later revocation of the Edict of Nantes by Louis XIV in 1685, but says nothing about the policies of religious intolerance by English Protestants against the Irish that led to mass migration to America. The section of Britain and the American colonies was particularly fresh because Americans tend to view this period through our lenses, but pay little attention to how and why the British made the decisions that led to a break. Tuchman views the period entirely through British perspectives and it reveals a great deal that is omitted from standard accounts. She quickly dismisses the whole `taxation without representation' argument deftly by pointing out how few Englishmen were actually represented in Parliament and that American agitators were not really interested in token seats in Parliament even if offered. She also does a great job with the hard numbers on revenue the British expected to raise with the Stamp Act and the cost to the British economy of American non-importation boycotts. Most of the British politicians are shown as amateurish twits, more interested in drinking themselves to death and fox hunts than serious policy-making. British policies against the Americans are revealed as a series of incoherent and ad hoc efforts, not part of any coherent strategy. It is particularly revealing when she relates that no senior member of the British government bothered to visit the colonies or discuss issues with American opinion-makers in the decade leading up to the Revolution. As Tuchman concludes, the best British choice was not to try and impose a rule upon the colonies that they could not enforce, but to adopt a laissez-faire attitude that would have eventually allowed the Americans to move toward self-rule. While the American Revolution certainly served no British interest, it's hard to see how resigning oneself to the loss of a continent serves British interests, either. The final section on Vietnam covers the period of US involvement from Truman to Ford, with the emphasis on LBJ's War. It's clear from the beginning that Tuchman wants to absolve Kennedy from any serious guilt, even though the establishment of MACV and the surge in advisors occurred on her watch. As Tuchman sees it, all the US leaders in this period either misread or ignored the tea leaves and plunged us into a no-win situation in Vietnam. However, her depiction of the war grows increasingly shrill throughout this section, beginning with an obscene generalization about ""napalm amounted to official terrorism"" by targeting civilians. She displays anti-military attitudes by writing that, ""the military misleads from habit."" She suggests that the US military could not adjust to counterinsurgency warfare, but fails to note that spectacular growth and resources devoted to Special Forces. The author is quick to grasp at any straws, such as various UN overtures to Hanoi, as a means that we could have ""gracefully exited"" the conflict. In short, Tuchman's conclusion seems to be that when faced with poor alternatives, leaders should take the path of least resistance and run away. This is not leadership.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 9, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1979CEV4B9V6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0345308239#wasThisHelpful","R1979CEV4B9V6","A34ZM36508LG9G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A34ZM36508LG9G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"While the Forbes Expedition to western Pennsylvania in 1758 may not appear to be one of the most fascinating chapters in American military history, Rene Chartrand delivers a gripping narrative about it in Osprey's Tomahawk and Musket. This entry in the Raid-series is designed both to tell the story of two raids during this campaign of the French and Indian War, as well as to illustrate the nature of forest warfare tactics in the Eighteenth Century. Although the volume has a definite slant toward the French side, the Anglo-American side of the story is also told very well. The overall high quality of the narrative, combined with excellent graphics, maps and eye-catching cover make Tomahawk and Musket a must-have volume for readers interested in military history.  The volume begins with a rather lengthy introduction that sketches the relationships between the British, American colonials, French and the main Eastern Indian tribes. The author's research - as always -is impeccable and he manages to provides new facts and insights even on familiar topics. His main point is that before the French and Indian War even broke out, the French had forged close military-economic ties with all the major Eastern tribes except the Iroquois confederation and that together, the French and Indians had developed a very deadly tactical doctrine for forest warfare. In contrast, Anglo-American relations with most of the tribes was antagonistic and the British were smugly confident that regular troops could operate anywhere, even in the wilderness. This smugness resulted in the 1755 Braddock disaster, which caused the Anglo-Americans to seek a re-match in the Ohio Valley, but in more controlled circumstances. The author then outlines how the Forbes expedition, intended to eliminate French-held Fort Duquesne in the Ohio Valley, was part of an overall British strategy to mass superior force against key French positions in North America and seize them. The planning for the Forbes expedition and the march through western Pennsylvania occupies  about one-quarter of the volume. The raid sections consist of Grant's raid on Fort Duquesne and Aubry's raid on Fort Ligonier, each of which has a 3-D BEV map and a battle scene by Peter Dennis. The volume concludes with the French decision to abandon Fort Duquesne and the British occupation of the Ohio Valley. Overall, this is first-rate historical writing and presentation, of interest to both special readers and a general audience.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 1, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3C2JZ24TL0QAA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1849085641#wasThisHelpful","R3C2JZ24TL0QAA","A34ZM36508LG9G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A34ZM36508LG9G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"While the battles of Marathon, Thermopylae and Salamis from the Graeco-Persian Wars are still well-known today, the climactic Battle of Platea (479 BC) is virtually unknown.  This obscurity is a bit surprising, given that the same Spartans who have received such adulation in popular film and fiction for their stand at Thermopylae played a central (and more successful) role at Platea. Despite winning at Salamis the previous year, a large Persian army still threatened the Greek homeland in 479 BC and succeeded in burning Athens. Most, but not all, of the Greek city states rallied together for a great land battle to drive out the invaders, once and for all. Here in William Shepherd's Platea 479 BC, we see Spartans and Athenians fighting side by side, which creates a captivating image of Hellenes in their finest hour. The volume is based upon the author's interpretation of Herodotus, as well as field research on the actual battlefield in Greece. The splendid artwork of Peter Dennis, accompanied by nice maps, makes this an attractive and erudite addition to the Osprey Campaign collection. The volume begins with a rather lengthy 11-page introduction that outlines the origins of the Graeco-Persian Wars. The relatively brief section on opposing commanders focuses on the Persian Mardonius and the Spartan Pausanias. The section on opposing forces is quite longer at 16 pages and is well suited to explaining the Hellenistic and Persian forms of warfare to newcomers. The section on opposing plans is much briefer. The next section covers the beginning of the campaign and initial moves by each side, although there was no real combat in this phase there was considerable diplomatic action with the Persians attempting to divide the Greeks with bribery. The actual Battle of Platea is covered in a 28-page narrative, but once illustrations are deducted, the fighting per se is covered in just 8 pages. Those expecting a straight-in battle narrative like Thermopylae will be disappointed; the first two weeks of Platea were characterized by `sitzkrieg' and posturing and both armies seemed reluctant to come to blows. The maps support the text very well, particularly for an Ancient battle, where sourcing is difficult. There are a total of 6 2-D maps and one 3-D BEV map. One pleasant surprise is that this volume has four battle scenes instead of the usual three and Peter Dennis does his usual excellent work. Three of these battle scenes involve birds-eye view representations that depict hundreds of soldiers in action, which is truly an impressive amount for any artist to complete. The volume concludes with actions at Mycale in Asia minor and then a discussion of the battlefield today. The author provides a useful bibliography. Throughout the volume, the author's approach is quite conservative. He tells the story from trusted sources and offers analysis only when necessary. However, he does stick too close to Herodotus and could have tried a bit more personal analysis. Overall, a very good volume in the series.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 20, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2L5F41UDAZPUJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1849085544#wasThisHelpful","R2L5F41UDAZPUJ","A34ZM36508LG9G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A34ZM36508LG9G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Although the 105-day siege of Kholm in January-May 1942 was one of the most dramatic and intense defensive battles of modern military history, it is virtually unknown in  the English-speaking world, except among a handful of specialist readers. Jason Mark, an inveterate researcher who has previously written landmark books on the Stalingrad Campaign, provides a wealth of information about the Kholm Campaign in his new book, Besieged: The Epic Battle of Kholm. Besieged provides a chronological, day-by-day account of the siege, primarily from German primary records from NARA, but also with some interesting accounts from the Russian side as well. The book is pricey and will no doubt triple in price once out of print, but well worth every cent due to the content of its research and high production values (quality paper and binding, excellent photos and maps, multiple appendices). The book does have some limitations, since it tends to focus so heavily on the tactical German eye-level that it sometimes glosses over or omits important details about events that were beyond the outskirts of Kholm. For example, although the author often mentions problems with the German effort to supply the garrison in Kholm by air, he barely mentions that the Luftwaffe had an even bigger responsibility to supply the nearby Demyansk pocket, which had twenty times as many encircled troops as Kholm did. Indeed, Kholm and Demyansk are really inseparable and readers will have to consult other sources to get the ""big picture."" Besieged is divided into five chapters, one for each month of the siege. Each day is covered in considerable detail, relying heavily upon the official daily reports submitted by Generalmajor Theodor Scherer, commander of the Kholm garrison, to XXXIX Armeekorps (the relief force). The book also have even superb appendices (myths and misconceptions; numbers; officer biographies; Oskars Perro; German Units in Kholm; glider landings in Kholm and plane landings in Kholm). The level of detail provided - down to how much food or ammunition was provided on each glider - is astounding. That's one of the really great things about Jason Mark as a historian - he's a detail guy and does not write in the kind of generalities that other authors use. On the other hand, the book is very German-heavy, with no Soviet order of battle or biographies provided. If he could have provided a similar kind of detail on the Soviet side, sources permitting, this book probably would have been the definitive tome on this subject. As it is, it is darn good. The fighting Kholm was intense and virtually non-stop for four months and that comes across on page after page in this book. The narration on the fighting around the GPU building, where the German defenders used up to 1,000 hand grenades in a single night, is gripping. The desperation of the encircled defenders, running short on food and ammunition, and with nearly half the garrison dead or wounded, is palpable on each page. Scherer's pleadings with corps to deliver supplies and speed up the relief effort tends to focus much of the narrative on him and make him a sympathetic character. Scherer has always been at the center of the Kholm story because that is the way that Nazi propaganda wanted it - he was a soldier's soldier and an admirable figure (although the author does not mention the Soviet partisans/civilians he hanged). Many of Scherer's subordinates come to life on these pages, too, which is exceptional. Here and there, some Soviet soldiers are singled out. As battle narrative, this book is impeccable. One item that caught my attention was the relatively callous attitude that the German High Command had to many of the survivors after they were relieved; many of the walking wounded were forced to remain on the line in Kholm for weeks after the relief before finally being sent home. Awards for a number of key indivuduals in the garrison were denied, which seems incredibly petty. Scherer was fetted as a hero, but many of his men were treated rather shabby. As military history, Besieged does fall a bit short, primarily due to the lack of sufficient analysis. After amassing all these great facts, the author makes absolutely no effort to assess why the Germans succeeded in holding Kholm or why the Soviets failed to take it. Indeed, German casualties are listed in considerable detail, but no similar effort is made to assess Soviet casualties. In fact, the failure to capture Kholm prevented the Soviet Northwest Front from inflicting a catastrophic defeat on the Germany Heeresgruppe Nord in its Winter counteroffensive by driving even deeper into the German lines of communication in northern Russia. The German airlift really needed assessing, as well.  Overall, this book is a superb piece of research but it seems to be missing some vital components - the Soviet view, the `big picture' and analysis - which make it feel a bit ""hollow"" as military history. Nevertheless, Besieged is still an impressive book on a battle that deserves greater attention and hopefully this book will help in that regard.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 13, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2JQ9HHPXD4PD2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0975107690#wasThisHelpful","R2JQ9HHPXD4PD2","A34ZM36508LG9G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A34ZM36508LG9G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Men in War (1957) is a standard small unit war drama film, which depicts the remnants of a platoon from the US 24th Infantry Division during the opening stages of the Korean War. All of the events occur on a single day, which is listed as September 6, 1950. The main protagonist is Lieutenant Benson (portrayed by Robert Ray) and the main antagonist is a Sergeant First Class Montana from the First Cavalry Division (portrayed by Aldo Ray).  The film begins with the aftermath of a North Korean attack on Benson's unit, which has left him isolated from his normal chain of command. Apparently the rest of his battalion `bugged out' or was killed and the sole radio is soon knocked out by a sniper. Ray shows up with his catatonic colonel, in the process of `bugging out' himself. This film was produced without DoD cooperation and on a very low budget and it shows throughout. Indeed, the quality is about that of an episode of the later TV series Combat! (and since Vic Morrow has a minor role in the film, it really feels like Combat!, just minus LT Handley and Kirby). Overall, Men in War is a pretty mediocre war film, which is why one reason that it is so obscure, but it is mildly entertaining and the other reason for its obscurity derives from the amnesia that the United States has about the Korean War.While the enemy only make rare appearances in Men in War, there are a number of other items that were omitting that greatly reduce the verite of this film. First, there are no Korean civilian refugees, even though this was a major problem for the US Army in Korea in September 1950. Second, there is no indication of US aircraft overhead, even though the US Air Force was pounding the North Korean Army pretty hard at this point. Third, heat does not appear to be a major factor in this film but in the real Korean War in September 1950, heat exhaustion and dehydration were real problems, too.  In addition, the filming location in California is a poor substitute for the mountainous terrain along the Naktong River - it simply isn't even close. Put it all together and you get a rather generic war film, as if Platoon had been filmed in somebody's backyard.The film is obviously set up to focus on the conflict between LT Benson and SFC Montana, despite how silly that appears to anyone with military service experience. This device has been used repeatedly by Hollywood, including in Platoon and later movies, but it usually just nonsense inserted to add dramatic tension. It's a war for Pete's sake, isn't their enough dramatic tension already? Despite what other reviews have expressed, I found Robert Ryan's portrayal of LT Benson as rather weak. Ryan himself was nearly fifty when he played this role, which makes him ludicrously old for this rank. He also spoke pretty good Korean, too, for someone who could only have been in country for at most two months (more than I could speak after a year as a LT in Korea).  I was struck by his casual lack of concern for the welfare for his men and his pig-headed pursuit of a `mission' that was clearly OBE (overcome by events). Aldo Ray's character is far more in tune with the situation and most of what I liked about this film was SFC Montana. He knew the deal and seemed to be the only one with any real combat savvy.  Ryan leads his half-platoon to utter obliteration in pursuit of a ridiculous objective and then seems to shrug his shoulders, ""guess my boys are all dead.""  He reminded me of Rip Torn in Dr. Strangelove: ""My boys let me down."" Not exactly paternalistic leadership.The other thing that's memorable about this film is the sense of defeat and isolation, which is something that modern audiences are not so accustomed to seeing in a film about American soldiers. Most modern war film tend to emphasize technology and how ours is so much better than the opposition's, but in this case, it's just not a factor. The US Army suffered some terrible defeats in the opening months of the Korean War and it was not unusual for small units to find themselves on the run, as depicted in Men in War. Despite possession of atomic bombs and strategic bombers, the US infantry were hard-pressed and often fighting for their survival. Today, war is almost seen as a ""safe thing"" (low casualties, robot drones, minimal risk of defeat, etc), but if Men in War can remind even a few people today that there are no guarantees in war - even that our troops can lose - it may still have some value.","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 23, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1B9AYCZ2B8S2J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=6305010528#wasThisHelpful","R1B9AYCZ2B8S2J","A34ZM36508LG9G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A34ZM36508LG9G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Although the Chaco War between Bolivia and Paraguay in 1932-35 is not usually high on many people's military history read-list, Alejandro de Quesada's latest volume in Osprey's Men-at-Arms series deserves a read by anyone interested in a different type of military operations. When the Chaco War is discussed, it is usually in terms of how modern military technology such as aircraft and tanks were used, although the author shows that there was precious little of that. This is one of the better recent MAA titles, focusing on operations and units, not buttons and service piping. Overall, this is an excellent introduction to this mostly-forgotten conflict and one that deserves attention. The author briefly sketches out the background to the Chaco War and provides a B/W sketch map of the area of operations. Bolivia and Paraguay's military forces are outlined in four pages. The author makes clear that Bolivia had the larger, better-equipped army but Paraguay's forces were better-led and more aggressive.  The course of military operations in 1932-35 is described in 12 pages, with a fair amount of tactical detail about several key actions. In essence, Bolivia lost the initiative in 1933 when two of its divisions were surrounded and forced to surrender, but Paraguay unwisely accepted an internationally-sponsored ceasefire, which allowed Bolivia to avoid complete military collapse in the Chaco region. The maneuver warfare practiced by the Paraguayan forces is quite interesting and worthy of study, which this volume serves to act as an introduction. The author then spends about 10 pages discussing major weapons used and air operations. Unusual for the MAA series, he provides a useful bibliography. The volume has 8 color plates, which are adequate but not great (only three depict field uniforms). The B/W photos are decent. Since so much of the fighting revolved around forts, it would have been nice if the volume had a color plate depicting the layout of a typical Bolivian fort. I enjoyed this volume and found it quite readable and insightful.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 16, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1OFHK4EFSINGI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1849084165#wasThisHelpful","R1OFHK4EFSINGI","A34ZM36508LG9G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A34ZM36508LG9G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor ranks up there with D-Day and Gettysburg as one of the most covered subjects in American military history and Osprey had already covered this subject with a campaign volume in 2001. Thus readers might wonder whether Osprey's new volume in the Raid series entitled Tora! Tora! Tora! is worth buying or reading. Two words: Mark Stille. The author is a professional naval historian (who studied under Gordon Prange), a seasoned analyst and retired naval officer, which makes his narrative far more insightful and useful than many previous efforts. The author skillfully manages to tweak new facts out of existing material and pull them together into a far more coherent conclusion than you will find elsewhere, even in Prange's ground-breaking works. When you add in some of Osprey's best artwork and maps to date, the result is spectacular and this is easily one of the best Osprey volumes of 2011. Overall, a superb piece of naval history.  Tora! Tora! Tora! begins with an introduction that outlines growing US-Japan diplomatic tensions in 1940-41 and the Japanese decision to use violence to prevent U.S. efforts to block their hegemonistic ambitions in Asia. The author spends about twenty pages discussing the genesis of the Japanese plan to attack the U.S. military base at Pearl Harbor, beginning with the strategic concept and then moving into detailed tactical planning. He does a great job both depicting Admiral Yamamoto's thinking on the raid - much of which is show to be far from ""brilliant"" - and the `nuts `n bolts' planning and training accomplished by his subordinates. There is excellent detail on the Japanese training program for the raid, which breaks down torpedo and dive-bomber accuracy levels achieved prior to the raid. The volume also has a very nice color plate of all the aircraft types used in the raid alongside a table that lists units and targets - very nice. The author makes the interesting point that the level of training among the Japanese aviators was not universally high and that the Fifth Carrier Division pilots were not night-certified, so the Pearl Harbor raid had to await dawn to launch to accommodate them. He also raises valid questions about Yamamoto's inclusion of the midget submarine force in the plan, which risked losing the element of surprise. The raid itself is covered in 36 pages and is supported by two 2-D maps and two 3-D BEV maps. The artwork by artist Jim Laurier (torpedo plane attack and USS Ward versus mini-sub) is stunning and captures important moments in the raid. The author dissects the raid in great detail and does so in a manner that goes beyond merely recounting well-known facts. The sloppy execution of the Japanese torpedo-plane attack is carefully analyzed and Japanese performance looks far less flawless when actual numbers of weapons expended are examined. The Japanese expected to get 27 hits out of 40 torpedoes expended, but actually got 19, with most weapons expended on only two battleships. The horizontal bombing attack was also far less effective than often depicted, with only 10 out of 49 hits against stationary warships. Only the lucky hit that destroyed the USS Arizona provided the level-bombers with any major success. Japanese dive-bombers were equally ineffective, scoring only 20 percent hits. Although the Japanese demolished a great deal of US parked aircraft and sank four battleships, the results were far from catastrophic. The author provides an analysis section at the end which spells out losses in detail. As the author concludes, ""it is common wisdom to state that the attack on Pearl Harbor crippled the US Pacific fleet. This is patently untrue."" He views the Japanese raid as a tactical and operational-level success but a strategic failure, which galvanized America's willingness to enter the Second World War. He also puts paid to the notion that a third strike would have made a difference or that destruction of oil storage/repair facilities would have delayed a U.S. island-hopping campaign in the Pacific. Overall, this book offers fresh insights into a well-known battle and does it superbly.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 12, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R31XYMO42GZJT5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1849085099#wasThisHelpful","R31XYMO42GZJT5","A34ZM36508LG9G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A34ZM36508LG9G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Although American troops had seen action in France earlier in 1918 - notably at Chateau Thierry and Belleau Wood - the assault by eight American divisions on the German-held St. Mihiel salient on 12-16 September 1918 is generally regarded as the first real test of the American Expeditionary Force (AEF) in the First World War. Compared to other operations of that conflict, St. Mihiel was fairly short and relatively inexpensive, particularly compared with the subsequent Meuse-Argonne offensive. Thus, the operation is compact enough in time and space to make it well-suited to the Osprey Campaign format. Author David Bonk provides a succinct account of the St. Mihiel operation and is able to delve down to battalion-level accounts. While there is not any obvious original research - particularly on the German side - the author successfully synthesizes existing primary and secondary source materials to produce a coherent narrative of the operation. St. Mihiel 1918 is a solid narrative which First World War enthusiasts should find useful. The author begins with the usual introductory sections on opposing plans, armies and leaders. They are adequate, if a bit brief, and readers may want to consult additional sources for more information on the AEF. The opposing plans section was more detailed and it is interesting how he compares the American planning for the offensive while simultaneously the Germans were planning for a withdrawal. The offensive itself is covered in 55 pages of text, most of which focuses on only 12 September, so the level of detail is comparable to what one might expect in a longer book. Essentially, the Germans began to withdraw just at the start of the American attack, but the Germans fumbled their withdrawal and nearly suffered a mini-disaster. As the author notes, American command inexperience failed to complete the encirclement in a timely manner, allowing 40,000 German troops to escape. The author depicts the ground fighting in each division sector, as well as discussing air operations. He deftly incorporates official reports with various secondary sources to produce a clear overview of the operation. However, the author's writing style is a bit wooden and some sections seem very repetitious at times (e.g. `unit x advanced 1 km'). More use of first-person accounts to humanize the battle would have been a step in the right direction.  Areas where I think it would have been better to have more detail would have been logistics (since that is what made George C Marshall's reputation) and analysis. There is no breakdown of casualties beyond the total of 7,000 American killed and wounded. Seems like with a bit of effort, the author could have gotten more of a breakdown by unit and a more exact death toll.Graphically, St. Mihiel has a high standard of visual presentation, with six 2-D maps (strategic overview of the St. Mihiel salient; German and American deployments, September 12, 1918; American advance, September 12-16, 1918; Operations of the 42nd and 89th Divisions, 12 September; assault of the 90th Division; night march of the 26th Division) and three 3-D BEV maps (89th Division's assault, American tank operations, operations of the 2nd and 5th Divisions). One of the 2-D maps was confusing, with two US divisions denoted as French and some advance lines difficult to distinguish because they are all blue, but these were minor hindrances. The BEV maps are quite good, with 1 km grid lines, which is the perfect scale for this type of depiction. The three battle scenes by Howard Gerrard - some of his best work - are: combined arms attack on Beney, fighting in the Bois de Friere, American tanks at Jonville.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 9, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R28WT60M98N0WZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1849083916#wasThisHelpful","R28WT60M98N0WZ","A34ZM36508LG9G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A34ZM36508LG9G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Nowadays, it is fashionable to depict the American Indian as victims of America's insatiable greed for land and racial prejudices. However, it is a sure bet that none of the folks espousing this kind of rhetoric had to face getting scalped, as so many Americans in the Ohio and Kentucky territories of the late 18h Century did. John F Winkler's book Wabash 1791: St. Clair's Defeat in the Osprey Campaign series takes readers back to a time when the power of the Federal Government was quite weak and the Indian tribes of Indian a lethal threat to American civilians. In a single day, the local Indian tribes were able to unite and destroy more than half the entire US Army at the Battle of the Wabash. This account is an excellent campaign history and provides a detailed look into the savagery of frontier warfare, which should be required reading for anyone interested in this phase of American history.  The author begins by outlining the situation along the Ohio River frontier in 1790, when the United States Government was only one year old. Population pressure was pushing Americans across the Ohio River into the Northwest territories, which had been granted to the Americans by the peace treaty with Britain. However, the British failed to evacuate all their forts in the region and provided covert military assistance to the local Indian tribes to resist American expansion and conduct raids on settlements. In April 1790, the U.S. Army conducted its first military operation into Ohio to counter these raids, but Harmar's small command was defeated. In response, the US Congress raised funds for a larger, 5,000-man expedition into the Ohio wilderness to crush the center of Indian resistance at the town of Kekionga. Major General Arthur St. Clair was picked to lead the expedition, which would include virtually the entire US regular army. This introduction is decently written but the map fails to depict the location of Kekionga or the disposition of Indian tribes in the region (the mix is quite confusing). The author then provides the usual sections on opposing plans, armies and leaders. In the armies section, the author highlights the gross logistical failures that significantly reduced American combat power. In essence, the expedition was thrown together to an army that had virtually no staff and the result was recruiting problems, deployment issues, shortages of key items and untrained troops. On the other hand, the Indians were exceedingly skilled in irregular warfare and received valuable coaching from British advisors on how to eliminate American artillery. The author notes that the assembling of this army was the first major national under-taking in American history, but it was rushed and amateurish. Despite receiving less than half his promised troops and scanty supplies, St. Clair decided to begin the campaign late in the season, rather than wait for a better-planned campaign in spring 1792. Indeed, St. Clair was not even certain where Kekionga was located and had no local guides or scouts to help. I began to notice here that the author was handling St. Clair's reputation a bit too daintily, rather than pointing out that he was making one stupid, pig-headed decision after another. The author spends about 14 pages and two maps detailed the American advance from the Ohio River to the Wabash River, between September-November 1791. St. Clair advanced at the ponderous rate of 2-3 miles per day, cutting a road through the wilderness and building multiple camps. His army began the campaign with only a few days rations on hand - an amazingly irresponsible decision by a commander - and was quickly put on half-rations due to the quartermaster's failures to push sufficient supply convoys up the road from the Ohio River. Although the author does not address this issue, clearly logistics was the American center of gravity and the Indian failure to attack the poorly-protected supply convoys is mystifying, since it would have stopped the American advance. The weather also made the advance a misery for the troops and enlistments for some levy troops began to expire (why would St. Clair began a campaign with troops who only had a few weeks left on their enlistment?). By the time that St. Clair's small army reached the Wabash n November, his troops were already pretty well useless. The actual Battle of the Wabash is covered in 34 pages and is supported by three nice tactical 3-D BEW maps and three excellent battle scenes by Peter Dennis (two of which depict scalping). The author lays out in detail St. Clair's faulty dispositions which allowed his army to be surprised and defeated in detail. Many of the American troops put up a poor fight and the author notes militiamen dying ""like a herd of cattle."" St. Clair himself was so paralyzed by gout that he could not stand or mount a horse, which makes his decision to continue the campaign all the more foolish. Indian savagery is detailed: ""Some Indians were killing and scalping the women and children. Others were throwing wounded men into the cooking fires.""  Finally, just as the encircled American force was about to be annihilated, a junior Maryland militia officer led a breakout charge that allowed about one-third of the Americans to escape. The author's description of the brutal retreat to the Ohio, with the sick and wounded being abandoned along the way, is gripping. Over 1,000 Americans died on a single day - one-third as much as on 9/11 - yet St. Clair's defeat is not something that young Americans learn about in history classes. Amazingly, St. Clair was exonerated by Congress but the defeat was a valuable learning experience for the infant US Army, which led to the victory at Fallen Timbers three years later. Overall, a very good book and one that should remind us of the true history that political correctness has been trying to obscure for decades.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 31, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R209NNRXJ8X2X9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1849086761#wasThisHelpful","R209NNRXJ8X2X9","A34ZM36508LG9G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A34ZM36508LG9G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Naval warfare during the American Civil War was in a period of great flux, with new technology forcing a re-think of tactics. In CSS Alabama vs. USS Kearsarge 1864, in Osprey's Duel-series, naval historian Mark Lardas brings some of these changes into sharp relief through the lens of Union attempts to bring elusive Confederate raiders to heel. The CSS Alabama is at the forefront of this account, but the CSS Sumter, Shenandoah and Florida are also featured. The author mounts his narrative atop two pillars - a discussion of evolving naval technology and a tactical dissection - although other aspects of this duel are covered, as well. Overall, this is an excellent, engaging narrative and should be in any Civil War library. In the opening section on design and development - which is very well written and understandable - the author discusses how three revolutionary technologies (steam power, iron construction and percussion fuses) dramatically changed warships just prior to the Civil War. He notes that although many Civil War warships looked superficially similar to earlier warships, they were in fact quite different. He notes that changes in armament, such as rifled barrels and explosive shells, as well as the shift to fewer but larger guns had a big impact upon naval combat. Ships were also becoming double the size of previous warships, but with smaller crews. He then discuses the specific evolution of Union cruisers and Confederate raiders, and provides a side-view plate of both CSS Alabama and USS Kearsarge. The author provides a 5-page section on the strategic situation, which includes a map of raider operations in 1863-65. Unfortunately, this map is not very useful because it does not depict Union Navy anti-raider deployments or ports where the raiders could expect to purchase coal or areas where Union shipping was attacked. I was also disappointed that there was no discussion of how the Union Navy went about hunting raiders; he simply says that they sent a few cruisers in pursuit, but there is no mention how they went about this. Nor is there any real discussion of efforts by the US Navy to compile information from sightings of raiders from various sources. Indeed, a duel such as this has a vital strategic/intelligence component which was omitted. Following this section, the author discusses the technical specifications (armament, structure, and propulsion) of the major participants. A 10-page section discusses the combatants, including profiles of Raphael Semmes and John Winslow. The section on combat is 17 pages in length and focuses on three actions: Alabama vs. Hatteras, Alabama vs. Kearsarge and Wachusett vs. Florida. There are three color plates by Peter Dennis and one map to support this section. The author's combat narratives are succinct but incisive. I particularly liked the way that he dealt with the controversy surrounding the end of CSS Alabama (Confederate gunnery just not very good, Union ""chain armor"" not a major factor). The combat section is followed by a 6-page section on statistics, which provides data for each action. As the author notes, victory depended upon accuracy rather than volume of fire, as it did in times past. Overall, CSS Alabama vs. USS Kearsarge 1864 is an excellent volume, although there were some areas that I felt came up short. Graphically, the volume is a bit weak, even with the Peter Dennis artwork; the previous New Vanguard title had much better artwork on Alabama. As mentioned, the strategic aspect of the duel was barely touched. Finally, the author makes a big point about the role of gunnery in the duel and cites the CSS Alabama for inadequate gunnery training, but missed an opportunity to discuss gunnery training in the combatants section. It would have been useful for him to discuss how gunnery training was conducted (what ranges? What types of ammunition?) and more specifics about gunnery in combat, such as how do you ""aim"" a weapon with no sights? Issues such as roll of the ship would also seem to be important, since CSS Alabama kept ""shooting high."" Were they timing their salvoes wrong? Nor does he discuss whether guns fired individually or in salvoes or how fire was directed. To be sure, these are tiny distractions from any otherwise excellent volume, but they do invite further research and writing on this topic.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 26, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3GUSYR68K4DBG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1849084920#wasThisHelpful","R3GUSYR68K4DBG","A34ZM36508LG9G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A34ZM36508LG9G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

This book contains interesting characters that are well developed, a plot that entails much emotional struggle, and good Christian messages throughout.  It fell short in some areas.  If you intend to write in a particular era, you need to stick with that era, including language and surroundings.  This author failed at this much of the time and it did distract from the book.  I also found some of the interaction between her sister, Greta, and Greta's admirer rather progressive for this era.

In fact, immigration laws at the time would not allow a woman from Japan to enter the U.S. except as a bride to the existing Japanese work force.

"I'm usually fond of writing at length, but for a network switch there isn't much to really write about, is there? It really boils down to functionality and looks, and most of the functionality isn't really easy to determine. I have WAY too many devices that use internet connectivity. I've finally outgrown standard 6 port solutions, and needed something that I could expand on. Enter this guy. The price was right, it looks nice but not outlandish, and as such it blends in with my other devices without sticking out like a sore thumb. So far I have had zero problems with it.

"Works as advertised. They fit small wires, like one or two standard AC cords, inside. It's a flexible kit that allows for mounting around corners, both inside and outside corners. Like any double-sided tape, make sure you use a bit of rubbing alcohol or a soapy solution to clean the surface before applying. If you use rubbing alcohol test a small inconspicuous area first, as it can discolor some surfaces. I just like it because it evaporates incredibly fast.

"I love LED flashlights, and pretty much any LED technology for that matter. The brighter the better, and as far as I'm concerned you can never really have too many sources of light. Where I'm at there are a lot of trees, and storms with high winds have a bad habit of knocking the power out now and then, so that's when all these lights come in handy. So the TK120 is yet another light I bought.It's constructed very nicely. All metal exterior, I am guessing aluminum, and the coating is anodized so it should last a very, very long time. The two places it screws together, toward the front and the back, have a rubber O-ring so moisture and dust won't be an issue with this light. The switch to turn the light on and off is on the back, and is protected by a thick rubber membrane which also serves to keep out dust and moisture. The light operates in 5 different modes: constant (bright), constant (medium), constant (low), strobe and SOS. These modes are activated by quickly turning the light on, off and then back on.The angle of the light's beam is adjustable. The head of the flashlight slides forward and  backward to adjust it. With it extended all the way out, the  beam is very tight and focused. On the highest setting this is incredibly bright and can easily temporarily put some serious spots in your eye. With it retracted, the beam spreads out in a wide angle, easily lighting up a large area.The metal case has a rough texture at the back, ensuring your grip won't slip even in wet conditions. The head of the light is fluted to provide a surface that's easy to hold as well. The nice thing about the sliding design for adjusting angle is the operation can be done with one hand, which leaves a hand free.The TK120 comes with two long-lasting 3,000 mAh lithium-ion 188650 3.7V batteries, as well as a charger which can charge both batteries simultaneously. It also comes with a wrist strap to help prevent losing the light.So with all that said, I give it a 4 out of 5 stars as there are other flashlights that are built just as solidly, and just as bright, but for half the cost of this light. I bought a different brand for my wife, and side-by-side her's is just as bright as this one. The only real difference is with hers the beam is adjusted by turning the head of the light. But I don't feel that the sliding mechanism of this light justifies the price tag at twice the cost. If they'd drop the price a bit I think this light would be more competitive, but as it stands I'd say the CVLIFE 2000Lm is a better deal.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RY69NR9FEF8C3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00E8UNBQI#wasThisHelpful","RY69NR9FEF8C3","A1QCUMGX7UHFL5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1QCUMGX7UHFL5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"OK I've been using this thing for over a month now, and I can safely say that it's a very nice mouse. It's well built, the clicks on the top buttons are slick and give good feedback without feeling cheap. The middle mouse wheel is a thing of beauty. It's very heavy feeling, and has some sort of mechanism inside it that keeps the wheel spinning for a bit if you give it a very aggressive spin. There's a small button in front of the wheel that toggles the wheel mode. In one mode, the wheel feels like it's riding between the teeth of a gear. In this mode the wheel stops in between the gear teeth (this is the only way I can describe how it feels). In the other mode, the gear teeth disengage, and the wheel moves freely without the feeling that it's riding against a gear. My personal preference is the ""geared"" mode. The other mode feels a bit too sensitive for my taste, but it's awesome to have a choice between the two modes.The side wheel doesn't have the internal weight that the middle wheel has or the ""geared"" feeling, but it still feels like it's a precision-machined part. Really there isn't a thing on this mouse that feels cheap. It's a pretty heavy mouse, so you don't have to worry about one of those light-weight mice which feels like a casual flip of the wrist will send it off the desk. The side buttons are a bit on the small side, and feel a bit awkward. They're basically very small raised buttons in the shape of something which resembles a teardrop. The top one is the ""forward"" button and the other is the back button, at least as far as your browser is concerned.There's a nice deck where your thumb rests comfortably. It's a shame there isn't a deck on the other side too, for a pinky rest. The overall shape of the mouse is one thing I'm not overly fond of. I feel like my palm doesn't sit very well on it, and I find myself gripping the mouse between my thumb and pinky, and my palm is arched up a bit off the mouse. If it was curved a bit more I think I'd find it perfect, especially if there was a deck on the right side for my pinky finger.As for the wireless aspects of it: it's been nothing but a pleasant experience. This is the first wireless mouse I've owned, and it's really amazing how much you notice a wire once you're used to a wireless mouse. As for their claims regarding the battery lasting up to 40 days, that seems more like a claim that could be made of a casual user, not a hardcore gamer. I play for hours and hours, and the weekends are almost all gaming. This mouse lasts me about 3 or 4 days before I need to plug it in and charge it. There is a battery life indicator on the side of the mouse. Would have been nice to have some kind of vibration, beep, or something to that effect that the mouse's battery is low. When it dies, it will just die without warning.So the product was dinged for three things - bold claims for the battery life that don't even remotely approach real world usage, no low battery warning, and the general shape of the mouse itself not being ergonomic enough. But really the bottom line is this is a very high quality mouse, and the build is rock freaking solid. I will most definitely be using this full time.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RRX5UIGMZ0RZL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TZR3WRM#wasThisHelpful","RRX5UIGMZ0RZL","A1QCUMGX7UHFL5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1QCUMGX7UHFL5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you're in the market for something kind of cheap and adjustable to move a mic around, then this is definitely the item for you. It's a very no-frills mic scissor arm. I've used this for months now, and it's held up very well to almost daily use, for hours on end. They were smart and used lock nuts everywhere on it, so looseness is non-existent.The mount used to affix the device to a surface has cushioned foam pieces on the insides to prevent scratches. There's only a single point where the arm can be adjusted, and that's at the mid-point where it bends. Tension applied controls how easily the arm bends at that pivot point. Would have been nice to have more control over this.My one real gripe with this is with the mount point for the microphone. They used some off-sized threaded post that isn't a standard mic post size. There's an adapter you must use in order to screw a mic holder on to the item. And the nasty thing is, the adapter does not screw tightly to the post or a mic holder. My solution: teflon tape, and lots of it. I had to wrap a lot around the post and the adapter so that a microphone is held securely in place. This could have been avoided if they'd just used the standard size for mic stands.That said - the product is only slightly over $30 as of this review. The better alternatives all cost a heck of a lot more. Also - there are other brands which look identical to this one, and only cost a bit over $10. I examined the pictures closely, and everything looks the same as this one. If you're thinking of getting this, you might want to save about $20 and buy the cheaper one as it looks like you're getting the same re-branded item.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1GZN8F7PIWN3Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00K5J1NQ6#wasThisHelpful","R1GZN8F7PIWN3Z","A1QCUMGX7UHFL5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1QCUMGX7UHFL5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you're looking to spiffy up a costume, some props, or other creative uses where lighting could make an impact, then this is for you! The battery pack and electronics are built solidly, and the connections to the EL wire itself are protected by shrink tubing, so I would imagine they'll stand up to moderate abuse. I wouldn't go yanking on them repeatedly though.The wire will be washed out in a brightly lit room, and forget it in direct sunlight - it's a very modest glowing wire, and cannot compete against bright light sources. The ""white"" is actually not a pure white, rather it's got a bit of a slightly blue-gray tinge to it.The electronics do make a high pitched noise, so if you're putting this in a helmet and will be in a quiet area, you're probably going to find it very distracting.

"If you're looking to spiffy up a costume, some props, or other creative uses where lighting could make an impact, then this is for you! The battery pack and electronics are built solidly, and the connections to the EL wire itself are protected by shrink tubing, so I would imagine they'll stand up to moderate abuse. I wouldn't go yanking on them repeatedly though.The wire will be washed out in a brightly lit room, and forget it in direct sunlight - it's a very modest glowing wire, and cannot compete against bright light sources.One thing I have to ding it on - these are very much ORANGE and NOT RED. That is the only reason I am giving it 4 out of 5. Also, the electronics do make a high pitched noise, so if you're putting this in a helmet and will be in a quiet area, you're probably going to find it very distracting.The item can be operated in continuous lighting, strobe, and fast strobe.

"I dabble around helping my wife out making various costumes. I bought this to light up the edges of a sword. Lights up fairly bright, although it will get washed out in a well-lit room. Construction seems adequate, but I'd be a bit careful as I'm sure the connection to the ribbon itself is prone to being damaged if you pull on it too hard. Battery pack and electronics are reasonably sized. It has three modes - continuously lit, slow strobe, and fast strobe. The only thing I wish is an option to not cycle through the 2 strobe modes, although that's really nit picking.When on continuous, the light will remain lit for over 10 hours, and that's using a rechargeable battery (they always go dead faster than regular alkaline). Pretty impressive!

"Talk about built well! This no holds-barred constructed gem is fantastic for desktop usage. Has everything you could want to control the mic gain, headphone volume as well as adjusting the monitor volume.

The fact that it can be used as an extremely low stand, and then convert into a stand which can boost the lights off the ground by a few feet is a plus.

"This is one blazing fast card! I upgraded from my GTX480 just so I could play Farcry 4 without having to crank the graphics down to get a decent frame rate. With this card, I can have everything totally maxed out (except for ridiculous things like screen under-sampling, where a scene is rendered multiple times much larger, and then scaled down to reduce aliasing) and still get great framerates.The only thing that was a bummer is the power supply connectors on this. They use just regular IDE drive style power. My power supply has two dedicated connectors that connected to my GTX480 that is now totally useless. I don't know why EVGA went this route with the power connectors as most cards use the connectors I'm talking about (they're a square 6 pin if I recall), but whatever.So yeah, this card's price at the time of this review makes more sense than the GTX980, and it's still a huge jump in performance if you're using something that's a few years old (or older).

"What a fantastic display! I didn't think it was as large as it is until it was on the desk and powered on. The amount of real estate on it is something to be seen to be believed. The display is crisp, and seems responsive. I do not play video games on this particular monitor, so I am unsure of any ghosting it might have (if any at all). I use this exclusively with my digital audio workstation software. I can see almost every track for most songs with this monitor, without having to scroll. And a heck of a lot of any songs I'm working on are visible, too. Considering that my last monitor that was being used for this was a 24"" and I think you'll understand why it's so exciting to have this huge new monitor take its place.The only thing I can ding it on is the stand. It does not adjust much You can tilt the monitor forward or backward a slight amount, but you cannot raise or lower it at all. It's a shame, too, because I really would like to raise it up a bit.

"I cut the cord with cable years ago. One thing I've always missed though is local morning news before heading off to work. Enter this antenna. I didn't want to run anything outside, so this was perfect. Attached extremely easy to the wall with the command tape strips it comes with. There is plenty of cord to run to your tuner. A breakout box houses the inline amplifier, and the cord needed to power it. It's very convenient that the antenna is USB powered, as I have a cooling fan in my entertainment center which has a USB cord that I was able to leverage in order to power the antenna. If you don't have an available USB device to supply the antenna power, it does come with a wall adapter you can plug in which houses a USB port the antenna's USB cord can be inserted into.I was able to pull in almost every channel in my area with this. The nice thing is I live in a sort of shallow basin, surrounded by a fairly large number of hills. Even so, the antenna does fairly well. Some channels do suffer from drop outs, but really that's no fault of the antenna.I would recommend this just because it's so easy to set up, and the performance on it seems more than acceptable.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RMRRKLK9RIBT0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DIFIP06#wasThisHelpful","RMRRKLK9RIBT0","A1QCUMGX7UHFL5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1QCUMGX7UHFL5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Install is a snap. Plug it in to a free USB 3.0 port, and Windows should pop open the file explorer options. Just choose explore the drive, and then double-click on Seagate Dashboard Installer.exe. Setup will begin, and there are a few steps you have to wade through. Early in the installation an error dialog popped up for me:---------------------------RunSeagateRegister.exe - No Disk---------------------------There is no disk in the drive. Please insert a disk into drive \Device\Harddisk3\DR14.---------------------------Cancel  Try Again  Continue---------------------------I just clicked continue and install kept going. Very odd. It downloaded what I suppose is an updated version of the Seagate Dashboard software. It's pretty quick and setup was complete within 5 minutes or so. When it ran, it wanted through Windows firewall. It seems that the backup software can upload and download your data to and from Facebook and Flickr.One pleasant surprise is this SSD backup drive works with the same Seagate Dashboard as a Seagate 2TB USB3.0 backup hard drive I already have. They're both listed, which is pretty cool. The app itself is really what you're getting an interface for, otherwise this is nothing more than a USB 3.0 SSD drive. So with that in mind - the Seagate Dashboard software is generally serviceable as a mechanism to manage backups to these drives. It's somewhat unresponsive though for some tasks, for instance clicking the Test button to start testing a drive results in a very lengthy delay before the app provides a means to notify you that you actually pressed the button. It could be a combination of the app and the firmware on the drives. Clicking between drives if you have more than one Seagate backup drive is *excessively* slow.As far as actually using this to back things up goes - it's a smallish drive, so you're going to have to pick and choose what you really find valuable. Your photos, music, videos, and games are probably not good candidates unless you really don't have a heck of a lot of these. This drive I could see being used mainly for backing up the operating system, or critical files you want to ensure have redundant copies. I created a backup plan for this drive which only backs up documents and personal files.The other backup solution this drive/app provides is for your social media. I'm actually using this for Facebook, and it's really *really* easy to use. From the Seagate Dashboard home page, click on Social, and then click on Save. I used Facebook here so I click on the Facebook button, provided my login details when prompted by Facebook's website, selected to share with me only, and that was it. It started to download all the media I have on Facebook onto the USB SSD backup drive. Couldn't be easier (well unless they introduce mind reading, but I don't think that will be available for a very long while hehe).The hardware isn't really much to write home about, but there aren't really any complaints, either. It's a very small drive, lightweight, encased in plastic so durability could be a factor. Comes with a USB 3.0 cable also.So for a tiny drive that doesn't take up squat for room, it's a great product for Flickr, Facebook, and a modest amount of video/images/music. If you have a lot of all of these, a larger solution might be a better bet.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R6QK1UFXNGAKR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00I6CVPVC#wasThisHelpful","R6QK1UFXNGAKR","A1QCUMGX7UHFL5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1QCUMGX7UHFL5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It's difficult to *not* like an SSD. They're fast, silent, small, did I mention fast? Well, the OCZ is no exception. It's got good looks to boot, too.Typically most of my work is in multimedia (video editing) or music production. Having fast drives is critical, especially for multi-track video editing where more than one file is being streamed off the drive. Old SATA and IDE drives were OK, but the breakthrough really came with the advent of these bad-boys. Suddenly the choppiness and stuttering was a a thing of the past during edit sessions. I've been using this for months now, and it's still performing every bit as well as it did when I first got it.So, with that out of the way, it's one thing to give anecdotal evidence, and another to provide some statistics. I could either trust OCZ's claims, or do some testing of my own. They're claiming the drive can read and write at around 500MB/s. That's a pretty bold claim. So I put their claims to the test and wrote a C++ app that does a few things to measure raw read and write performance (my day job is a software engineer).So the parameters for the test were important. Windows is a multi-tasking OS, meaning that at any point in time something could come along and impact the test. Need to rule that out with multiple tests. Also, Windows will buffer reads and writes to media, so that will need to be disabled so I'm measuring the drive, not the buffer. Lastly, I'm testing an SSD. You cannot test an SSD using a standard hard drive as an SSD is many times faster than a standard hard drive. That means I needed a way to write from memory directly to disk. Not only did I need to write from memory, but it absolutely HAD to be physical memory (RAM). Windows loves to page things to disk, and if it paged to disk my test would be completely invalidated as I'd basically be reading from a hard drive to an SSD, which is what I had to avoid. So, the app would need to be able to lock pages of physical memory to guarantee that my test app would read and write directly to RAM, and never touch a hard drive (unless a hard drive was the intentional source or destination for the test).So with the test environment laid out, it was time for a program spec. The test app would basically take three args. For measuring write speeds - the amount of RAM to allocate, a destination folder for the file that would be written from RAM to the drive. For read speeds - a source argument which points to a file for reading off the drive into RAM to measure read speeds.With the specs outlined I went to town and hammered out the app. I then ran it against a number of different drives, including the OCZ of course, just to see how things measured up. Here are the results of several drives:The amount of RAM written to disk was 1.25gigs, and then the read test was conducted reading the file back into memory (so the same 1.25gig file read off the drive being tested straight to RAM).Write speeds:---------------------Crucial m4 512GB SSD CT512M4SSD2240MB/SSeagate 4TB 5400 RPM ST4000DM000-1F2168110MB/SWestern Digital Black WD2002FAEX 2TB 7200 RPM 64MB:85MB/SOCZ-VERTEX460 SSD210MB/SRead speeds:---------------------Crucial m4 512GB SSD CT512M4SSD2330MB/SSeagate 4TB 5400 RPM ST4000DM000-1F2168116MB/SWestern Digital Black WD2002FAEX 2TB 7200 RPM 64MB:87MB/SOCZ-VERTEX460 SSD210MB/SNow, I cannot say how OCZ tested their drives. Whatever they used, I cannot imagine it approaches anywhere near real-world scenarios. Heck, even my test is not real-world. Most systems are not even configured to allow pages of RAM to be locked, which is a requirement for my test program, nor are there many apps who commit all their data to physical RAM and write to drives, etc. But for the sake of it being on a real user's operating system, and under at least a somewhat real world environment (I left my PC pretty much running everything it usually does when I start it), it has to be *way* closer to reality than OCZ's testing, which tested twice as fast as my own tests.Now that's more a mark on OCZ's marketing than anything else, but I think most people expect marketing to go over the top and skew things as much as possible. I digress... as you can see from the tests, this drive blows the doors off my fastest SATA hard drive. The only thing which beat it was another SSD.So do I like it? Heck yes I do. The construction is solid, the price is right, and the performance is pretty dang good. I'd recommend it.For those curious about the program I wrote for this to see what standards I used for testing, here's the gory details. The program VirtualAllocs and reserves the chunk of RAM to use for testing based either on the file size passed in for read testing, or the alloc arg for write testing). Next allocates pages of available physical RAM to meet the demands and maps the reserved virtual ram into the physical pages. It then randomizes the newly accessible memory just so there's something there besides a bunch of zeroes. It then opens a file handle for reading or writing, depending on the args passed in, and turns buffering off for the file. Next it enters the timing phase where it starts QueryPerformanceCounter (a high performance Windows timers API), reads or writes to the drive or memory (depending on selecting operation), then checks the performance counter at the end. Calculations are done to figure out how many bytes/second were transferred, and then convert it to megabytes/second. Keep in mind it's the equivalent of having one giant file being sequentially read or wrote to/from, so there's no random access or anything like that. Just a very basic straight-forward test.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2H7M4HM4PJ55X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HZR4EEE#wasThisHelpful","R2H7M4HM4PJ55X","A1QCUMGX7UHFL5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1QCUMGX7UHFL5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I'll prefix by saying I've been playing guitars for over 25 years. I play for fun, and even after all this time I'm not that great. Mostly because I never practice. I can, however, pick up songs and play them by ear. I also write and record my own music. With that in mind, I'm definitely not a beginner, nor am I a virtuoso of the instrument.Ok, so I was excited to check this out. GuitarHero/Rockband/clones were amusing, but if you know how to play guitar it seemed really weird. I figured this would be a great way to learn some new songs, and thought perhaps my wife might like playing guitar with guidance. Popped this in the Xbox 360, and the first thing I noticed was that their idea for a loading icon is a static microphone (or was it a guitar amplifier cabinet? I don't remember.) I wasn't sure if it was actually loading for quite a while. Get used to seeing that icon, because it loads frequently.After loading is complete it goes through a bit of calibration where you strum the guitar and it sets the levels for it. Then it takes you through an electronic tuner which ensures your guitar is in tune. All pretty straight-forward stuff. One annoying thing that is repeated everywhere in the game is how they labeled ""Next"" as ""Skip"". I sat there for a while after a voice over played, wondering if there was more. Nope. You have to click the A button to move on to the next part. I'm sure you can see how this is confusing. You're left wondering if you're skipping something instead of the game verifying that the section has completed.Next up is the ability to dive in and play a song. They tried to do a Guitar Hero/Rockband type of presentation, where notes appear moving towards you from a distant plane in 3d space. Each string is color coded, and the camera will slide to the left or right if the notes are higher or lower on the fretboard. The problem here is that unlike the other games which have a fake guitar that only has 4 buttons on it, you're playing a real guitar with 21+ frets. The way the notes fly out from infinity towards their targeted position on the fretboard can be confusing, especially when the camera starts sliding down to the higher fretboard positions. I felt like I was always struggling to figure out finger placement because of the way the notes were being displayed. Even slow and simple songs left me feeling like it was more of a hassle than it was worth.The other hindrance is latency. When you pluck the string there is a very noticeable delay between the pluck and when the note is played by the game. This makes it incredibly difficult to play notes which appear rapidly on the screen, as what you're hearing doesn't synchronize with what you're playing. There's a tip that scrolls across the screen which suggests that if there's problems with latency, try bypassing internal circuitry on your amp (mine is always direct when playing the Xbox 360) or plug in headphones. So much for being a fun thing to watch if you're a bystander. I didn't try headphones as I spend enough time when recording real music with headphones on, and since this game is more than likely going to be played on the family's TV the last thing you want to do is stand there plucking away at an electric guitar while others can't hear what you're playing against. So I was stuck with latency.Next is the voice-over. There's no way to get the guy to stop talking during a voice-over cut-scene. You will sit through what he has to say from beginning to end, unless you either exit the game or turn off your console.One thing good I'll say about it is it seems to learn how well you're doing, and adjust the experience. If you're starting to do well, it will begin throwing in more notes for you to play. I guess this is good and bad, because if you just start getting the hang of what's happening, the game starts throwing you curve-balls pretty quickly.Just as a test I had my wife, who doesn't know how to play guitar at all, give it a shot. After all, the back of the case says ""Anyone can play guitar"". So she gave it a shot. She was irritated she couldn't skip past the voice-over. She picked a song to play, and started it. All she was able to barely do was hit two of the notes. As soon as the camera slid up the fretboard to play different notes on different strings, she was utterly and completely lost. Needless to say, she didn't want to try it again, and was extremely frustrated by it.This game could have been fun. Marrying a real instrument with a video game console is a great idea. The things they need to do, in my opinion, to fix this:- Don't do this in a Rock Band/Guitar Hero style. That type of interaction simply does NOT work for this kind of experience in my opinion.- Add tutorial modes, where people can practice the types of notes they will be playing in a song. Let the player control the speed during these practice sessions.- Fix the latency, as no matter how fancy the graphics or brilliant the user interface is (assuming they come out with a v2 that has a brilliant interface - because this one does not) the game will remain unplayable.- Don't use ""Skip"" for controlling the UI when what's really meant is ""Next""- Allow people to blow past voice-overs.- Don't make customers have to use a controller. The guitar they just calibrated and tuned should be used to control the game. The only exception would be to cancel a song in progress (and maybe a few other places where the game is expecting notes to be played back.)","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 28, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/RE9KU2DRIS1T7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004S5PBM0#wasThisHelpful","RE9KU2DRIS1T7","A1QCUMGX7UHFL5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1QCUMGX7UHFL5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I use SDHC in my Nikon D80 as well as my Panasonic HMC150 pro-sumer camcorder. I've been able to snap off just as many pictures just as quickly, and record at the highest quality on the camcorder, the same as other class 10 SDHC cards that cost more money. They come mailed in a sturdy cardboard envelope with a bit of padding, and enclosed in the typical SDHC plastic case. Nice since you don't have to gnaw at plastic clam shell packaging for an hour trying to get the thing out like some of the other brands. Other than that, it operates transparently, just like SDHC and other flash memory should. I can't say what difference the transfer rates are between this and other brands, but I haven't noticed anything out of the ordinary such as incredibly slow transfers, etc.Basically it's a good deal, saves you some money, and won't irritate you when the item arrives when you try to open it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 28, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R262TLAXZ96V5T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0058GH2DY#wasThisHelpful","R262TLAXZ96V5T","A1QCUMGX7UHFL5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1QCUMGX7UHFL5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I'll admit I have relied a lot on the web to research many questions and tips for mixing music. I saw this book and thought ""what the heck, maybe there will be some useful things in here."" I'm glad I picked it up! The way the author breaks down the effects, what they've been used on in the past, interesting applications that beginners and novices probably never thought about, and tips on when and where it's appropriate to drop them in the mix and common pitfalls. He covers it all. The end result is a firm understanding of exactly how the various common types of signal processing can be exploited to make a song go from mediocre to exceptional... at least from a mix standpoint, anyway (bad music is still going to be bad music no matter how well mixed it is!)Now, while it does a great job explaining everything, the burden is on the reader to apply the new-found knowledge. It doesn't shortcut experimentation to gain experience, but it does provide a great road map to get you there! Highly recommended for anyone who mixes their own music. I'll bet even pros could benefit from some of the author's knowledge.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 13, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R70F6RH4KPB5D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0240814851#wasThisHelpful","R70F6RH4KPB5D","A1QCUMGX7UHFL5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1QCUMGX7UHFL5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I gave if 4 stars because it's a jalapeno sauce, yet the spicy level is really weak. I wasn't looking for a mouth-on-fire experience, but if they're going to put ""jalapeno"" on the label, it should at least have an OK amount of heat in there. You won't find much of that in this sauce. That being said, I tried this on a lot of different items, and frankly it tastes good on almost everything. Hamburgers, chicken nuggets, and of course tex-mex foods like taquitos and quesadillas. It's a creamy somewhat thick sauce, so be prepared if you were expecting a thinner style. I'd recommend it, but then again I'm not a real sauce snob (is there such a thing?) It was a surprise though, as I've never had any Taco Bell item with this type of sauce on it that I can recall.

"I've got a decent camera, and am always looking for good tips to create better looking videos. I felt like this book might offer something of value, being about film making, and claiming to get ""your movie from script to screen."" I suppose the book delivers on this, but you better have a budget and take movie making VERY seriously. The guy starts off with chapter after chapter about book-keeping, and lawyers, contracts, and on and on. It doesn't touch upon shooting anything at all until way deep into the book. The entire book is focused on small to large budget films. We're talking tens of thousands of dollars to millions on up. It's very difficult to sit there and read through pages of how to organize folders to hand out to crew members so they can see the day's agenda. I mean, I get it, this kind of thing is necessary for serious pictures. I just think I picked the wrong book for the types of projects I work on (aka as close to free as you can get.)Even so, be wary of the editing in this book. The spelling and grammatical errors are pretty laughable, and happen at regular intervals. The book was interesting in some respects though. If you've ever wondered what goes on to create a film this book explains it in great detail. So much so that it will definitely squash anyone's fantasies about film making being even remotely glamorous. The way it's explained makes it one of the most snooze-worthy and tedious processes on the face of the planet. At least you find out what each job does though, so I guess when you're watching film credits you'll know what all those people's job titles mean.So the bottom line is, unless you plan on trying to organize a very serious movie project, stay away from this book. It's meant for people really wanting to crack the industry and make movies with at least a $100,000 budget.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 5, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1L0V7CGGSC7H9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0240817001#wasThisHelpful","R1L0V7CGGSC7H9","A1QCUMGX7UHFL5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1QCUMGX7UHFL5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When I opened the box I was pretty surprised at how small the router was. With no Star Wars looking giant antennas and flashing lights, it's very subtle. All the connections are on the back, which is great since my router sits inside the nook of my home entertainment furniture. I have to admit though, I do like flashing lights, so I kinda miss the blinking from my old router. The other problem this can potentially create is the at-a-glance status verification goes away since you can't see the lights without flipping the unit around (so it does go beyond my enjoyment of shiny lights.) That's the only reason I gave it a 4/5 on form factor. It's a little confusing too since they have a button on the back which allows the LEDs to be turned on or off, so I'm not sure why they chose to put them on the back. This certainly is NOT a deal breaker on this item by any means though. It's the only thing I could think of to criticize on the unit.Set up is very straight-forward. The software guides you in a step-by-step process, making sure you have internet connectivity, then assisting in connecting devices. Very good for someone who's not familiar with setting up routers. There is also a web page interface you can access to make more advanced tweaking, if desired. Things such as DMZ, port forwarding, etc. It may be small, but it is definitely big on features. The web interface is laid out intelligently, and has decent descriptions to refresh your memory if you've forgotten what some of the terms mean. I certainly have no complaints about getting it up and running. I was able to swap out my old router and get this one going in less than 15 minutes.Reliability is good, so far. I have had 0 downtime with this unit, and from what I can tell there's been no change in transmission speed or latency. I have 2 wireless users who haven't said anything about connectivity issues, so it seems the wireless section works very well. I cannot give any details on range performance, since I don't use wireless and the 2 users who do only use their laptops from the couch which isn't very far from the router.Overall I'd recommend this product. It's a great unit that doesn't make it a chore to configure, and once running it seems to do its job. Especially recommended for people who don't want a bunch of flashing christmas lights on their electronics.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 3, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R36EZ7U95UEQ9F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004T9RR0E#wasThisHelpful","R36EZ7U95UEQ9F","A1QCUMGX7UHFL5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1QCUMGX7UHFL5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Well, not sure what to say since I didn't get very far. I bought it based on 1 review from another site and screenshots. I had no idea that:1) The game has an interface like Myst. Yeah. The game was released in late 2009 and the interface is from the mid 90's. It's got the ""hand"" that you move around the screen until it detects a hot spot. The clumsy way you interact with objects in the game is really, really bad. Frustratingly bad. It's not intuitive at all how you do something as benign as open a box at the start of the game. You'll slide the hand across it, up and down, click on it. You might eventually open it, or you might just exit the game and uninstall it first.2) No moving freely. You click in the direction you want to go, and the game moves you from Point A to Point B. Not smoothly, the screen just transitions from where you are to your next step, akin to moving one square at a time on a board game. Want to look around the area? Forget panning with your mouse. You have to click on the edge of the screen to get your viewpoint to change to that direction.3) No help. Literally, there's no help file. In the game, in the install directory, or online.Maybe some people might find this style of game play appealing, but after decades of 3D games where I can move around the world, having to point and click to move across virtual squares is not what I would consider even remotely fun in this day and age. Save your money and go buy something 1,000 times better, like ""Amnesia"" for the same amount of money (the game, not the state of mind, although trying to play this makes me wish I had amnesia just so I could forget I bought it.)If you REALLY feel compelled to pick this up, go look for videos of someone playing it first. I found a few after the fact, and if I had seen the video I wouldn't have made the mistake of purchasing it.","1.0 out of 5 stars","May 18, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1I8955N6SC7DF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0042X9RUU#wasThisHelpful","R1I8955N6SC7DF","A1QCUMGX7UHFL5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1QCUMGX7UHFL5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This game is great. It's a horror survival where you wander through an immense castle, searching for clues as to what you need to do to simply not die. The puzzles make you think, but they're not so difficult that you're left with no choice but to search for hints on the web. The entire time you're struggling just to keep your surroundings lit so you're not plunged into eerie darkness, where your character starts to lose his sanity. You do not fight at all in this game, so don't think you're going to jump in guns blazing. Your character needs you to use your wits and figure out how to unravel the mystery of what's happening.I can't really say much more than that without giving away anything.

I think the average cook or baker will also appreciate being able to push a button and have the top pop off for easy removal.

"People like to think they're rational, but really they're rationalizers, jumping on decisions because of (perhaps innate) emotional triggers and then trying to fit reasons to their decisions. We do this so quickly and with so little self-awareness that most of us would disagree with that statement, but the authors of this book share large amounts of compelling evidence that it is so.That means that trying to ask people what they want or to base marketing decisions on what they say may be pointless. The authors of this book recommend using more direct brain-oriented research rather than focus groups.The book is well written, with a conversational tone that makes the large quantities of data accessible.

"You would think that Advent and Christmas would be easy times to pay more attention to our spiritual lives, but it can be the opposite. Not only are most of us very busy with holiday preparations and parties and activities, but it's easy to feel that we already know the story so well we have no new thoughts on the subject.In six chapters, Burkhart weaves together the stories of Zechariah, Mary, Elizabeth, John, the Magi, and a shepherd with a poignant family story of his own. He connects all the threads into a series of questions.There are five major questions:* How will I know?* How can this be?* Why has this happened to me?* What will this Child become?* Where is the Child?These are questions about the Christmas story. But each chapter also has questions for discussion. These questions cover many different experiences readers might be going through at Christmastime, from grief and bitterness to exciting times full of the promise of the future. Many of the questions are deep, asking how the past and the future are connected or how the challenges of justice and oppression can best be met in our lives.But there are also personal questions, such as how are you stewarding the blessings you have in your life, and what can you do to increase your trust in God?This book can therefore be used as a Christmas study for people at many different points in their lives.It's a quick and easy read, too, simple and down to earth. If you like to have a personal devotional book for the holiday season, this is a handy one, and the questions might provoke some important thoughts as you prepare your New Year's goals or resolutions.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R22Y25B60JBELO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1630881295#wasThisHelpful","R22Y25B60JBELO","A14638TGYH7GD9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A14638TGYH7GD9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It's been a few years since I looked at a new printer, and wow! This printer is part of the Internet of Things -- you know the fridge that's supposed to order milk when you're running out? Most of us don't have that yet, but the this printer will order ink for you (or, I guess, for itself) before you run out. It has its own email address, too, so you can network with it more efficiently.While these are the coolness factors, it's a nice little wireless printer. I love being able to print from my laptop without having to physically go and plug something in.It's very small and lightweight... so much so that I wondered how it would stand up to use. I was not disappointed.It's slow, but it turns out a good product. I've printed out stickers, photos, illustrations, and ordinary documents, and the results are excellent. It has a small paper tray and just a little guide for the documents, not a tray, so this is not the printer to use if you want to print out your thesis or something. I really like it for crafts, though -- it prints out a pattern or a photo beautifully from remote devices or your desktop.Setting up the network connection is not difficult. There's an online wizard (step by step by guide) to take you through the process, or you can use the software disc included with the printer. There's a fair amount of sales material included, but you can't blame HP; they have a captive audience and some nice offers, so of course they're going to do their best to get you signed up.For light home use, this is a terrific choice.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R14PEQSCPLOELE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013SKI4LU#wasThisHelpful","R14PEQSCPLOELE","A14638TGYH7GD9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A14638TGYH7GD9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

She's ready for an adventure, but she hadn't bargained on getting involved in a brutal murder, local politics -- and a tentative relationship with a handsome lawman.As the mystery unravels, secrets from the past are revealed, and Charlotte has to face uncomfortable truths about her brother, and about herself. She also has to face the possibility that she might be in danger, and that her curiosity could lead to estrangement from her brother, rejection from the townspeople in her new home, or even death.The descriptions of frontier life are engaging, and Charlotte is likable and smart. There's enough anachronistic language to be distracting (the word ""lifestyle"" was not used in 1919, for example), and most of the characters are sketched in rather than developed, but it's a good story and an enjoyable read. I look forward to seeing Charlotte and her friends and family develop further in the series.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1302FKI288CDX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1496700546#wasThisHelpful","R1302FKI288CDX","A14638TGYH7GD9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A14638TGYH7GD9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This granola is tasty, and it has 3 grams of fiber and 5 grams of protein, which puts it way ahead of the average cold cereal. It also has a mere 3 grams of fat, and just half a gram of that is saturated, which puts it way ahead of the average granola. It has no trans fats and it's certified organic, too.Plus, it has not just oats and raisins, but also crisp rice and almonds, so it's a bit different from the usual. For kids, for a sweet snack, or as a topping for yogurt, this is nice.To eat as a cereal? Brown sugar is the second ingredient, and it also includes evaporated cane juice, apple juice concentrate, and honey, adding up to 15 grams of sugar. That's more than Frosted Flakes. For me, the taste is simply too sweet, and it's more than half the amount of sugar the American Heart Association says we can safely eat in a day. Add a cup of milk and the natural sugars in the milk push you up to the limit of the AHA's recommendations.So this is not a great breakfast choice for me. If you like a sweet cereal, though, this one brings a lot more nutrition to the party than most.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3T2QUJPT547UQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YTYCYW0#wasThisHelpful","R3T2QUJPT547UQ","A14638TGYH7GD9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A14638TGYH7GD9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"However much you love your dog's, you don't love their doggy odor. And cats may not be as obtrusively scented as a dog, but one accidental spot of spray or wee from a cat advertises its presence for months or even years.I used this formula with a Bissell cleaner, trusting the claim that it would be safe with major cleaners even though the machine is labeled with warnings of fires if you use non-Bissell products, and there were no fires.There was also no aggressive cleaning-product scent. Best of all, the doggy overtones of the carpet are gone. It didn't remove an old stain, but it left the carpet clean, no longer redolent of pet odors, and noticeably softer.I had previoyusly used a different brand with this machine, and wasn't impressed with the results.

"Baking cups make the entire process of baking and serving muffins and cupcakes easier, more successful, and more civilized. So when I read that the Reynolds Baking Cups had improved on the concept even further, I had to try them.The colors of these papers survive baking. So often the bright colors of the paper liners become completely transparent once they're baked. I often put finished cupcakes into a second paper liner before serving. With these baking cups, there is no need.They stand up well after baking and make your cupcakes and muffins easy to transport in a lunch box or to a party.

"I was intrigued by the YouTube commercial featuring an elegant young woman discussing bathroom habits in the midst of a cocktail party, a cow pasture, and a crowded office. When I was offered a bottle for review, I just had to try it. And the company says that lots of people try the product out in the same spirit of whimsy -- but keep using it, because it works.Sure enough, it does work. We tried the Juniper scent at our house, and it's not obtrusive like a spray, but it also prevents the natural smells sometimes associated with bathrooms.The packaging is attractive enough to leave out for the comfort of guests and it has clear instructions: sprizt the top of the water in the toilet before you use it.

"The Founders of clothing company Life is Good share their personal and business story with charm and honesty in this inspiring book. They organize the story into 10 Superpower chapters;* Openness* Courage* Simplicity* Humor* Gratitude* Fun* Compassion* Creativity* Authenticity* LoveAll these qualities shine through in the story, along with the narrative of a multi-million dollar business. If you're willing to accept that being fun and loving will bring you this kind of financial success if teamed with hard work, you're set. But you shouldn't expect lots of business tips or a blueprint for business success. A paragraph or two is all that separate selling T shirts on the street and their first $262,000 year, and a few pages is all it takes to get to their first  million dollar year.In addition to a thoughtful and inspiring story, you get plenty of cheery artwork, playlists for each Superpower, and action steps. The action steps are things like going outdoors, unplugging from electronic media a couple of hours before you go to bed, and expressing love in daily life. Not world-shattering, in other words, but happy things to do. And maybe we forget about them too often.So begin with realistic expectations, get the book in hard cover so you can fully appreciate the artwork, take it outside, and read it. You'll be energized and encouraged.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3JV821RM3GEIU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1426215630#wasThisHelpful","R3JV821RM3GEIU","A14638TGYH7GD9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A14638TGYH7GD9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Collagen is the stuff that keeps all the parts of your body together, and the reduction in natural collagen production as we age is the reason for wrinkles, sagging skin, and thinning hair. This conditioner uses collagen and other proteins to hydrate and condition hair.I used this conditioner with its companion shampoo. It feels luxurious in use and has a sweet, almost sugary scent that doesn't linger. That means that it won't compete with your perfume, and also that the whole family including the guys can use it.The packaging is stylish and modern, with a flip cap, not a removable cap that can lead to spills.The conditioner left my hair silky, shiny, and clean, not weighted down.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1KSAYE8YFR1WL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SKEL9XK#wasThisHelpful","R1KSAYE8YFR1WL","A14638TGYH7GD9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A14638TGYH7GD9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Most little girls love dolls, and enjoy making up complex stories and acting them out with their dolls. The story of Mulan, a legendary Chinese warrior, is worth acting out, and the story of her smart and sweet daughter, a Disney creation, is a good one, too -- but this stylish doll can take any part your little girl has in mind.As the mother of Eurasian daughters, I was always searching for dolls that didn't reinforce the idea that being blue eyed and blonde was the definition of being pretty and successful for girls. Barbie dolls, surprisingly, were the most ethnically diverse choices. This Hasbro doll is a fashion doll like Barbie, but without the implausible proportions. The dolls in the series have different faces and colorings, and Lonnie's outfit has elements of Chinese style. It's also modest and age-appropriate.The doll's arms and legs are jointed, and she comes with lots of accessories. She has long hair to play with, and other outfits are available.

"You've got a whole archipelago of mythical tropical islands, and you can gain control over them by building bridges from one to another. However, your opponent can remove your bridges so quickly that the entire balance of power in the game can change in a matter of moments.With cards, an attractive board, and wooden markers, there's a lot going on in the game, but points are totaled just three times, so the rise and fall of fortunes (counted in islands) can be like a roller coaster and you'll gain points only if you're ahead when the cards run out. For my family, this was a nice blend of luck and strategy, but there are alternate rules that allow you to make luck less important. You can also play with handicaps to even the game for different ages or skill levels.This is a two-player game, but it's also fun with two teams of two. Little reading is required, but strategy is complex enough to make this a fun, challenging, and nearly addictive game for adults. It's completely visual/spatial, so it makes a nice alternative to word games if your gang has uneven skills or multiple languages.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2508UWFZYD6HV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00T0GY9GG#wasThisHelpful","R2508UWFZYD6HV","A14638TGYH7GD9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A14638TGYH7GD9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"So many of us like the chalkboard look for our pantries, craft rooms, and parties. But printing out labels in that style uses tons of ink and usually gives streaky results. These labels are true inky black and easy to write on with chalkboard markers.They don't smear once they're dry, either. I like the idea of reusable labels in the pantry, since we might not want to refill that jar of wasabi peanuts with wasabi peanuts again, but the ""whiteboard"" type smear in normal use and there you are wondering whether this is self-rising flour or bread flour. I was able to remove lettering with a damp paper towel and re-use the label successfully, but it stays put in normal use.These are not paper; they're made of sturdier stuff.

"These little tags are perfect for crafts, art projects, showers, gift tags, and labeling things. They punch out smoothly and have a nice hang tab opening. They're tiny and delicate, not intended for high-pressure situations, but very versatile for more decorative uses.Go to Avery's ""print and design"" area at their website and choose the right product number (41566) and you'll find 19 different designs, including a blank template you can personalize at will. The software is very easy if you're used to using this type of software. If not, then it's not going to be that easy, so slow down and experiment a bit. For me, customizing a tag and getting it ready to print out took under 5 minutes.Printing it? Well, I put the tags in upside down first, and then worked too quickly correcting and setting up the second run, so the font was not communicated correctly on the second sheet. I'm sharing this because I've seen reviews saying negative things about the software when it was clearly user error. You're human, so -- unless you do this type of task all the time -- you will probably have a little bit of a learning curve and need to practice a bit.Having wasted two sheets of tags, I now know which way is up and that you can't rush the process, and I can make all kinds of snazzy tags with Avery's snazzy software. The templates print past the edge of the tag, so the end result has a very polished look.The software produces a nice PDF you can save on your computer and print out at any time. You can also set up an account and save your creations at the Avery website so you can keep your design in the cloud and print it out anywhere -- handy if you use them in your work or in your classroom.Of course, you can also write on these easily or use any kind of art supplies.

"Hattie Davish comes home to St. Joseph, Missouri, to a support a school friend at her father's funeral To her surprise, she finds that she has become a local celebrity -- for some, because she graduated from the local secretarial college and has gone on to support herself with her skills at a time when few women do so, but for others because of her involvement in murders. Scandalous or celebrated, Hattie has strong feelings and strange experiences about coming home to the town where her father died and his business was taken over by a stranger.She also has mixed feelings about her old friends from the secretarial college, not to mention some shady characters who seem to be connected with the ""incidents"" that are causing problems for her alma mater. Add mysterious violence, a possible mix-up among corpses, and some famous outlaws to the mix and you have a very lively visit home.This is a place and a period that is not often presented in mystery novels, and I was intrigued by the depth of detail in the presentation of the setting. Hattie is bright and complex and the supporting characters are interesting. The puzzle is complex, too, and the author plays fair and ties up all the loose ends.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RINIKPZBOUCXW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00P53E0L2#wasThisHelpful","RINIKPZBOUCXW","A14638TGYH7GD9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A14638TGYH7GD9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"In an alternative history of England during the Napoleonic wars,  Zacharias is the Royal Sourcerer -- but an unpopular one, primarily because he is foreign and of a different race from his fellow sorcerers. He's troubled by ghosts and magical creatures, but also determined to make positive changes during what he fears might be a short tenure as the most important thaumaturge in the land. England has less magic to go around than it used to, and some blame Zacharias.Prunella is an orphan, a charity case at a special school for girls who are troubled by magic. Magic is considered a problem for women, and Prunella has access to much more of it than most of England's sorcerers can dream of. She's smart and pretty... but much good it does her, stuck away in a backwater.When they meet, each can see that each might be just what the other needs. Adventure, romance, marvelously imagined scenes of Fairy land and the magic-driven court, and complex relationships create a wonderful story.I found this book tough to read at first. When reading Austen or Heyer, you have to be prepared for antique language and casual racism and sexism; I didn't like it in a modern book. The impressively authentic period language slows the pace, and while the racism and sexism are both important parts of the story, it's not immediately apparent. Get past these things and let the story take over, and this is a very satisfying read.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2MQCSUNDZ0B3W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0425283372#wasThisHelpful","R2MQCSUNDZ0B3W","A14638TGYH7GD9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A14638TGYH7GD9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Maybe you've been there... You're sitting correctly in your ergonomic chair working on something and gradually, as you become increasingly engrossed in the exciting work you're doing, you move in toward the computer screen till you're hunching over like an early primate. At this point, if you're using the Lumo Lift wearable,  you get a gentle vibration reminding you to sit up straight.The first couple of times I practically jumped out of my skin, but after a day or two I grew accustomed to it. The fact that I found it so startling just proves that the Lumo Lift is extremely comfortable -- I literally forgot I had it on. It's a small magnetic device and it comes with three other small magnets: one to attach it to your bra strap, which is my choice, and two small squares in different colors which may become coveted prestige jewelry but at the moment will be little squares on your shirt front. I'm guessing people will peer at them and ask you what they are.Download the app and hook it up -- super easy -- and work through a nice little training wizard, and you're set. When you have the coach mode on, you will be alerted any time you slouch for 2 minutes. You can change the length of time you're allowed to slouch, and you can also turn the coach off either through the app or by pressing the Lumo Lift itself. This allows you to loll around on the sofa reading without getting reminded to sit up straight.If you keep the Lift on all day, it will also count your steps for you. 10,000 is the goal. Check the app and you'll see how many hours of perfect posture you attained (4 hours is the goal) and how many steps you've taken. There are also little congratulatory notifications to your phone and email.You can turn all these things off, but if you leave them on you will have better posture and less back and shoulder pain at the end of the day. The coaching seems just right for me in the default settings, but I think it's great to have the configuration options. You can fine-tune the Lift as you go along, working toward ever more perfect posture.There's a handy USB charger that holds the Lift in the correct position for charging, too. All in all, a practical and well-designed wearable.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJSDK5FSMO5GB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N9P8GMW#wasThisHelpful","RJSDK5FSMO5GB","A14638TGYH7GD9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A14638TGYH7GD9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you're expecting (as I did) that you can spend a few minutes in set up, write smoothly just as you do on paper, and then enjoy a search function that lets you find those handwritten notes in moments, you should readjust your expectations.The Jot Script feels nice and smooth, hefty and well balanced. The packaging is nice and has cheery little quick start guides which were not sufficient for me, but they refer you to more complete instructions online. The recharger is a sturdy USB device that holds the Jot Script upright with a magnet while it recharges, which it does very quickly.I tried Evernote and Penultimate for my iPhone and iPad. Registration and downloading and learning the apps took me less than an hour. Then I spent another hour in a meeting scrawling illegibly and often invisibly. Start with straight lines and work your way up is my advice to fellow neophytes -- by the end of the meeting I was able to get words on the screen. I was not able to write smoothly in my normal handwriting and end up with legible notes, but I'm getting better all the time.These apps allow the Jot Script to be used as a pen in many different thicknesses, as a highlighter in many different colors, and as an eraser, to clear up the many many extraneous marks I ended up with, probably because I haven't gotten the hang of it yet. You can choose from many different on-screen papers, including musical notation paper, graph paper, and more, which extends the usefulness.After continued use, I'm finding the Jot Script great for note taking and to-do lists, but it still cannot read my writing well enough to search my notes. I am confident, seeing how far the Jot Script and I have come, that by the end of conference season I will be able to use Jot Script for all my notes, and be able to read them, too.Assuming that my heightened skill will allow me to search my notes and find specific information quickly, this will be an enormous improvement over physical scrawled notes, of which I have notebooks full. Trying to go back and find what I promised to do in some meeting in the past or some piece of data that I know is in my notes from last year is much more maddening than getting used to the Jot Script.Writing notes is faster and more comfortable for me than typing, especially on a phone keyboard, so I will persevere. I expect to love this in the future.If you haven't used this type of device before, like me, then you should be prepared to feel like a kindergartner for a while. It seems unfair to give a 4 star review rather than a 5 star one when it seems so likely that it is my incompetence that keeps me from being able to use all the features successfully, but the initial frustration level keeps this from being perfect.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2BOPKFPTUZ0ID/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XBWT1P4#wasThisHelpful","R2BOPKFPTUZ0ID","A14638TGYH7GD9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A14638TGYH7GD9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
