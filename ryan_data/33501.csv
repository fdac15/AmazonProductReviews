"For the record I know this will be down voted into oblivion, but you should know...I wanted to like this product so much, but it didn’t and tech support from the company was far from satisfactory.Let me explainI was gifted a unit to review and thought highly enough of the concept to go out and purchase a pair of high capacity (3TB) drives. In retrospect, the drives were not the recommended choices for long term use (as they were consumer level drives not meant to be in continuous use), but they were drives that should have worked at the very least in the short term and they weren’t cheap.I installed the drives, downloaded the software, and nothing. I re-downloaded the drivers; I replaced the Ethernet cable; I reset the factory device settings.  All to no avail.Next I contacted customer support. Customer support started though email and was very structured, standardized, and limited. After asking if I had checked the connection I was asked to add customer support on Skype…weird…but ok I’ll try it…. After adding the address on Skype the address was inactive (I didn’t see it online for several days) It didn’t help… from Skype I was asked to download a desktop sharing software. The tech support member asked if I had downloaded the appropriate software (we’d already confirmed I had), pressed the search for device button…which I’d done, and asked me to reset the device again. Each request was separated by 3-5 minutes of silence. After 45 minutes I was no closer to a solution and ready for bed. I promised to keep trying, but haven’t figured it out yet after a week and therefore can’t give a positive review. If and when it works I’ll give it a new review, but for now 1 star.","1.0 out of 5 stars","May 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2YN5ST0DMU52K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ICU134C#wasThisHelpful","R2YN5ST0DMU52K","A2IZ9ZSFBW7JX8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IZ9ZSFBW7JX8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"uNu sent me one of their new wireless chargers to try out and it works. Everything it claims to do it does, but it wasn't anything special to me and I felt like there were some easily avoidable oversights (but we'll get to those in due time).Lets start with the good. The case is nice. I like the matte black finish and the ""soft"" sort of texture it has. Its reasonably grippy and doesn't collect finger prints.The case is thinner than I had expected given that it has a battery in it, but it is about a centimeter longer than the phone itself. Since the iPhone 5(s) is quite long and thin already this exsentuates it and makes it feel a little akward in my hand (maybe its something I would get used to with time but for now its a bit off). The length also causes a problem with the headphone jack not accepting wide headphone plugs. The manufacturer ""fixes"" this by throwing in a cheap extension wire, but for the price I feel like they should have built the extension into the case. I don't want to carry an extra wire.The battery feature works well. It doesn't turn on unless you tell it to which I didn't realize at first and my phone was near dead (~1%) when I finally activated the battery by holding the button on the case. The battery isn't huge. It charged the phone to roughly 80% from dead which got me through the day, but might not be enough for a true power user (yay puns) and definitely won't let you go days without the charger.The charging pad is small (maybe too small). I found it to be light enough that the kinked corder could flip it over when the phone wasn't on it. Its an interesting design, but when it comes down to it, its really an extension cord more than it is a wireless charger. The contacts on the back of the case sit up against the metal plate to allow the phone to charge. The whole thing works and seems relatively safe. I licked both contacts of the plate (... you know... for science) and didn't die or really even get much of a shock, but it wasn't the fancy induction style charging you see in electric toothbrushes.Lastly, while my phone didn't give the ""charging not supported with this accessory"" message that is common with third party unbranded chargers, I didn't see the ""made for iPhone"" logo on any of the packaging which makes me a bit wary. The lightning connector, Apple can block chargers from charging your device if the manufacturer hasn't paid a royalty. Again I have had no issue with this to date and I'll update if I run into any issues with this.If all you want is a no frills wireless charger/battery combo I don't want to dissuade you from this one, but its got its quirks and sits at 3 stars in my book","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3CAZHTS4OZWQ1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GBFQX22#wasThisHelpful","R3CAZHTS4OZWQ1","A2IZ9ZSFBW7JX8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IZ9ZSFBW7JX8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm a graduate student. I give a fair number of presentations and a fair number of them are somewhat impromptu. When I end up giving a talk I hadn't expected I used to be without a pointer or would have to quickly learn a new remote. With the X-Presenter app and pointer, I've always got my pointer on my keys. All I have to do is launch the app, pull the pointer from its holder, plug it into the phone jack and go.The app seems to work correctly on both iPhone 4 and iPhone 5 (the iPhone 5 had the headphone jack moved to the other end and the app orients so that the jack and thus the pointer are at the top), has an intuitive layout and of nice features. I particularly like the built in timer which has helped me keep on pace and timed talks. The app also features a mouse mode that lets you control the cursor on the screen, but I found it to be a little cumbersome to use in the middle of a talk and it it was an option I'd probably just walk back to the computer if I needed to use the mouse.The laser is every bit as bright as stand alone pointers I've used in the past and the dongle for the remote is small enough that I can leave it in my laptop's usb slot without too much fear of it catching on anything.When I'm done the pointer slips back into its rubberized sheath that I attach to my keys with the provided nylon loop. The rubberized sheath is designed to be used as a stylus on your phone and it does a fair job and strikes a nice balance between being big enough to use comfortably and small enough to not overwhelm my keys.Overall 4 stars","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R561SY96IQEAM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FX4KY72#wasThisHelpful","R561SY96IQEAM","A2IZ9ZSFBW7JX8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IZ9ZSFBW7JX8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I like (maybe love) my apple products. The form factor, the power, the interface...I could go on, but they have always failed at making cables. From expensive macbook charging bricks to  over priced and quick to fail iPod and iPhone cables, they just don't seem to have a handle on what customers want.Enter zeetron.The Zeetron light up cable for iPhone is fantastic. It is well built (the plastic holding the adapter and LEDs is attractive, has a nice matte finish, and feels like it should hold up over time) and the cable delivers value both with its price and its bonus light up feature.The light works well. Its bright enough to find the end of the cable in the dark and help illuminate the charger port on your device, but not so bright that it will keep you up at night. I would have preferred that the cable light shut off after some period of time (it stays on all night to show you how charged your phone is), but it doesn't seem like a big deal.I've been using mine with an iPhone 5 in a Pad and Quill Handmade Little Pocket Book case and haven't had too much of an issue with fitting the plug into the phone although I do have to lift the phone just slightly off of the back panel of the case to allow for plug clearance. I don't think this cord is obnoxiously large and I like the light feature enough that I would probably find a new case or deal with removing the case in order to use it.One last note is on the ""made for iPhone"" branding.  I did not see the official ""made for iPhone"" logo on this packaging  which suggests that Zeetron may not be paying Apple's royalty for the use of the lightning head (If I'm wrong in thinking this please correct me). If that is true these cables may not always work with apple devices. Lightning connectors have a chip in them that allows your iDevice to detect licensed cables and can block unlicensed third party cables from working. I've reviewed off brand cables in the past that seemed to have been bricked by the iOS 7 update and quit working outright. That said, with other off brand cables I usually get a warning message about from my phone explaining that an off brand accessory has been detected and that it is not guaranteed to work and I haven't had that experience with these. So it seems that my phone is not detecting a problem.Overall I think this is the best cable I've used with my iPhone 5. Its as well made as apples cable with added functionality and at a price competitive with some of the lesser cables that many people (myself included) seem to have issues with.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 17, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/REK7YXAWY76SD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00G5K3B50#wasThisHelpful","REK7YXAWY76SD","A2IZ9ZSFBW7JX8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IZ9ZSFBW7JX8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've always thought that when food looks good it tastes better and the same can be said about cocktails. These ice balls give a little bit of much needed interest to the look of my old fashioned cocktails and as a bonus they actually work better than small cubes. They are roughly the same size as Tovolo King Cubes and melt about as slowly (you can probably use one cube for a couple of drinks or sip more slowly and have one cold drink most of the night.The molds themselves seem well made. I haven't have any issues with silicone smell which can be a problem with some silicone ice trays.Using the product is easy, just fill to a little above the fill line (I found that the ball did not quite fill if I filled to exactly the fill line) and pop in the freezer. The spherical shape makes finding a spot for them a little difficult if you're low on room or have things stacked up, but I found that I could get a nice level surface by using an old egg carton as a base to hold the molds.After a few hours (6 seemed to get them most of the way frozen for me) you can pop the ice out and use it. I did find that I got a seam around the edge of the ice sphere where the mold came together. This wasn't a huge deal (the seam and the little bump left from the fill hole melted off first), but if I had to mark one are for improvement it would be to make the mold pieces fit a it better so that they come out perfectly round.That said I think this is a product that's worth your consideration. With a lifetime guarantee and at half the price of competitors I'd definitely recommend these.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 11, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3P4HMOO5OH9P0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00COCD6TO#wasThisHelpful","R3P4HMOO5OH9P0","A2IZ9ZSFBW7JX8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IZ9ZSFBW7JX8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought these cables a few months after purchasing my iPhone 5 back in  November 2012. At the time they worked reasonably well (which was a surprise since apple had claimed their new cables contained a proprietary chip that would block unlicensed third party cables from working).The quality was reasonable (although the materials felt a bit cheaper than original apple cables. Each cable would last a few months before breaking (the usb connector would pull back, exposing the wires, if I wasn't careful, but for the price this was ok. I got a bunch of cables for very little money.THEN...This week I updated to iOS7. My car charger no longer works. The cord in my office no longer works. The extra cord I carry in my back pack no longer works. The only cord I have that works is the charger by my bed (which is the one charger that came with my phone).Apple has made their play. They included a chip in all of their cables. The chip allows apple devices to detect un-liscened third party cables and block them from charging the phone or passing data. For a long time they have let these third party cables work, but with iOS 7 (and it wouldn't surprise me if older versions of iOS get updated to block third party cables as well) apple has blocked the use of many thrid party cables including these.I have heard that some iOS7 users have had luck by:1. Turn on USB power.2. Plug in Lightning cable to iPhone.3. Dismiss any warnings.4. Unlock your iPhone.5. Dismiss any remaining warnings.6. Now with the screen turned on, unplug the Lightning cable.7. Plug it back in.8.Dismiss warning again. It should now charge.If you want the latest updates do a search for iOS 7 kills un-liscened cables workaround. It may be that someone overcomes this security. It may be that unlocking your phone or avoiding the OS upgrade will allow you to use any cable...but until that news comes out I'd hold off on making a big purchase (multi cable pack) on third party charging cables for apple devices.If you're desperate and can't/don't want to pay apple for an original cable consider buying a single cable and testing it out. For now proceed with caution. For me these are done.","2.0 out of 5 stars","September 22, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RLA1ODLRQUR3Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CLEDG22#wasThisHelpful","RLA1ODLRQUR3Z","A2IZ9ZSFBW7JX8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IZ9ZSFBW7JX8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I like (love) my bike and I can't live without my tech. I like to know how fast I've gone, what the elevation change was, what my heart rate was during the big climb, and where I'm going. But I've found that integrating tech and riding isn't always easy so I'm always looking for the easiest way to access my phone while on my bike.I've tried my own homebrewed mounting system (Bicycle Handle Bar Mount plus this universal phone mount). It had three major problems1) I needed a screw driver to take the mount on and off2) The phone couldn't rotate a full 3603) I needed a seperate case just to mount the phone (and it wasn't provided)So I kept looking and started using Weanas Roswheel Cycling Top Tube Bag. It was purpose built and had a lot of things I liked (including a bit of easily accessible storage for extra phone batteries, gels, and bars on long rides, but I had issues with my phone overheating due to the lack of airflow (the bag hid behind the headset, but was still in direct sunlight).So I kept looking and when I got the opportunity to review the RideMate (thank you Satechi for providing a review sample) I jumped at the chance. I've had the product a couple of weeks now and I've been quite happy with it so far. It remedied all of the issues I had with my home brewed case.1) The clamping mechanism uses a quick release lever to clamp and unclamp2) The case can be rotated 360 degrees to fit how you mount the phone (or phablet) and how your map or cycling app is set up3) The product is essentially an envelope (neoprene and touch sensitive plastic) so it will fit the phone I have today and whatever they come up with in the futureAdditionally I haven't had any issues with overheating. I'd attribute this mostly to the breathable materials and the superior air flow (a thin packet mounted on the handle bars cools off more readily than a larger bag hidden behind the headset).Cords for both earbuds and charging (although you'll need a separate bag to hold an external battery; I'd suggest the Roswheel linked above) are easily accessible and can be removed or added without pulling the phone out of the mount. I've found the plastic on the front of the holder to be both glare resistant (even in the noon sun I can see the screen as long as it is on full brightness; set your screen to full brightness and turn off auto-dimming if you have issues).Mounting wise I had a bit of difficulty. My bike (a diamondback podium 3) came with 31.8 mm or just over 1.25"" handle bars and stem. The Satechi mount claims to fit 1.43"" bars (and it probably does) but it would be a tight tight fit and you might have to go without the mounting strip. This shouldn't be a problem as 31.8mm is the new thicker standard for handlebars (so yours likely aren't any thicker), but it was close enough that I had a bit of trouble getting the mount on without scratching the bars or rolling the rubber spacer (that is inside the clamp that grabs the bar) under itself. All and all it should fit your bike and even with the difficulty it's still a better mounting system than anything I've tried. It's secure, unobtrusive, and moves with you as you ride.So I'm still not set with a single perfect bag. This one is great for shorter rides, but isn't quite perfect in terms of storage and the mounting system could be just a touch more universal, but its as good as I've found so far (and this is coming from someone who does his research before buying) and its even better if all you want to carry is your phone.Four well deserved stars****","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 30, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1C1F6RM6OPLRU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00D8IRP3G#wasThisHelpful","R1C1F6RM6OPLRU","A2IZ9ZSFBW7JX8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IZ9ZSFBW7JX8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've been able to review several batteries in the last year including the iTorch IMP52D by New Trent and the Sendy 5200mAh  by Sendy. These batteries were small, densely constructed, and worked well as a backup incase you spent a few too many hours on your phone during the day, but they weren't optimized for use outdoors and they weren't built to be your sole source of power over a long weekend or even a day of battery intensive usage.The New Trent PowerPak Xtreme fills those roles a lot better. The size is reasonable for a longer trip (a few times thicker than an iPhone, but roughly the same area on the largest side). Its probably not something you'll want in your pocket, but it was small enough for me to put in a small bag on the top tube of my bicycle allowing several hours of riding with my iPhone 5 (with full screen brightness and constant GPS tracking) without draining the phone battery at all. The four hour ride took the PowerPak from 4 charge indicator lights to 3 lights. I've also used the PowerPak around the house when I know I'll be using my phone for internet and games. Based on  my experience so far I'd be comfortable taking the battery with me for up to 3 or 4 days when I know I'll be without an outlet.I actually have gotten in the habit of using the charger so regularly that I keep it plugged into the power block when not in use and charge my phone through it at night.The block has two ports one 2.1 amp port and one 1 amp port. I'm using the charger mostly with the 2.1 amp port to charge up a bit faster, but its nice to have the option in case I pick up a device that demands a lower (trickle) charging rate.The build quality on the device looks pretty good, but if you have used some of the smaller external batteries in the past you may be a bit confused when you pull it out for the first time. The battery is not densely packed. Granted the unit packs some weight (11.5oz), but it doesn't feel like the entire case is full (the feeling I got with the smaller capacity batteries). The plastic case is mostly hard molded plastic (although some of the pictures make it look more rubberized and I had hoped it would be similar to this type of casing). I would imagine that this empty space may have to do with building in shock protection and water resistance, but I won't know for sure until I see how it holds up over a few years.For now the battery has become part of my daily life. There is always room to improve a product and I think the casing materials and possible added size make up that potential for improvement here, but the battery is solid, it does its job reliably, and if you're looking for a battery that can power you through more than just an extra few levels of angry birds this one is for you.4 stars****","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 30, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RHT6W5M9LX4CJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DUKJ5CQ#wasThisHelpful","RHT6W5M9LX4CJ","A2IZ9ZSFBW7JX8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IZ9ZSFBW7JX8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"How do you rate a product that promises more than it provides, but still provides more than most?I was asked to review the Satechi Active Case i5 and have struggled to nail down exactly how I feel about it.On the one hand the case in solidly built. The materials are nice (the back is a black satin finish that provides just the right amount of grip while avoiding fingerprints and the front half is a vert attractive, shiny, and at least so far scratch resistant plastic). The case has ""real"" buttons that look more or less like the phone buttons they cover and feel like them too (you still get the little click when you press in the buttons like you do right on the phone). I particularly like this over the TPU cases that I've tried in the past that use a little nub thats really just part of the plastic case to ""tell"" you where to press.The phone fits nicely and is easy to take in and out if you use the little gaps near the base (perfect for a thumb nail if you don't have a coin). The camera is unobstructed, the case in general adds very little bulk, and it looks cool.But on the other hand two selling points for the case are the special shield to keep your phone from demagnetizing a credit card you store in the case and increased battery life based on improved reception and I wasn't very impressed with either function.You can fit a single credit card, room key, or ID behind your phone and the manufacturer provides a thing sheet to separate your phone from the card. The sheet is supposed to keep the card from interacting with your phone and demagnetizing. I use an iPhone wallet almost daily (and have for almost a year now) It doesn't have a fancy piece of bendable material that blocks the phone from the credit cards and I've never had a card demagnetized. Before that I would use regular cases but could squeeze a credit card in behind the phone if I was going out. It wasn't an every day thing, but I did it probably once a week for 4ish years and never had a card demagnetize. Now, I'm a scientist and I know I shouldn't rely on my anecdotal evidence (maybe other people with older cards or people that carry hotel room keys often will understand this feature), but for now its not a selling point for me. In addition if you do keep the thin anti interference film in place, removing your card means you detach the front and back of the case, remove the phone, remove the sheet, and remove the card. Its not necessarily a fast process and unless you have a table or extra hands you're pretty likely to drop something.Then there is the claim of improved battery life (10-15% based on the packaging) through increased reception. In theory this makes sense. Your phone constantly sends out little signals to find the closest tower. If it doesn't hear back it pings a bit louder (using more energy) in hopes a tower will respond. If you have better reception you can use less energy to look for signals (if you've ever left your phone on while on a train ride through the middle of nowhere you can attest to how this might drain your battery). My problem though was two fold. First, I tried to map my signal strength with and without the case (I even used the developer mode where you can look at the signal in decibels which is more accurate than bars) and I didn't see an appreciable difference. No difference in signal would mean no difference in battery life. Second, to claim 10-15% you'd have to assume a standard way of interacting with a phone. I use a lot of wifi for internet browsing, I play games, I watch the occasional video from my local itunes library, and sometimes I stream from netflix. I also make the occasional call and text, but some days I'd be surprised if 10% of my total power usage went to searching for signal. I would not expect to see the same improvement in battery life as say my dad who uses his phone just to make calls and probably goes through 90% of a charge over a couple of days with the phone in his pocket. Again here my anecdotal evidence isn't the end all be all and you may see a small increase in battery life, but don't expect miracles here.And that brings me back to struggling with how to rate a product that makes claims you aren't sure hold up, but is all and all a well built product that will work well if you weren't all that interested in some of the claims in the first place. How do you rate an delicious, fresh apple if you can't verify that an apple a day keeps the doctor away? In the end I would rate it based on its taste and ignore the health claim for now and that's what I've done hereMy four star rating is based on what the product is at its core, a case (and a good one). It's light, attractive, well built, and a joy to use. At its price point I wouldn't have had any trouble making this rating had it avoided the add on claims. If you like the look and just want a well built case this is a great choice, but don't expect it to replace your backup charger or your wallet.Four Stars as a case ****","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 26, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R259O2GOBLI0TI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CLYHP88#wasThisHelpful","R259O2GOBLI0TI","A2IZ9ZSFBW7JX8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IZ9ZSFBW7JX8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Windshield mounts are a dime a dozen, but they have to be because you'll need to shell out cash for a new one for each new phone or tablet you buy (and that can get awfully expensive), but this ones different; its one of the only mounts that is guaranteed to work with your device.The reason they can guarantee this is the smart clip. By using a glue patch to mount the clip to a your phone or tablet's case you're able to mount just about anything to the smart mount which in this configuration is used with the suction mount (but it will also work with any screw on to any standard tripod (or Joby Gorillapod Original Black/Charcoal - Joby GP1-B1AM) as well as some bike mounts).The glue pad that comes with the kit is ""one time use"" and it sticks very well, but I suspect that you could scrape it off with a razor blade or a kitchen knife. Then you could mount it to your next phone's case. I don't see it here, but the manufacturer seems to also sell the smart clip separately on its website so you could buy a few if you have multiple devices that you'd want to use without pulling them off the case.The only possible drawback that I see is that the clip is a little large, so you won't want to mount it to your phone's case if you like to keep your phone in a pocket (it could work on your belt though). I have seen a few other mounts that grasp the device and consider themselves ""universal."" You'll have to weigh your options here, but I would feel a little limited with the ""grasping"" mount. Most  are designed for normal phones, but with new form factors like tablets and phablets (giant phone-tablets) becoming popular you're likely to want something that really is universal.Enough about the universalness though. I like the mount in general. The build is great and the two adjustment knobs let it be positioned at just about any angle. It will work sitting on your dash (if you have a smooth surface). or hanging down from your windshield. The build quality is great. It feels like it will last through several phones/tablets/ or whatever they invent next. If you're looking for a mount that will work great today and just as well in 5 years this is it.5 Stars","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 31, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1IBUY9D4N4QD5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BUCPY6C#wasThisHelpful","R1IBUY9D4N4QD5","A2IZ9ZSFBW7JX8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IZ9ZSFBW7JX8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was approached by Satechi to review their 10-Port USB 3.0 Hub and have been quite impressed by it so far. The build quality seems solid, it looks great on a desk with other shiny modern tech, and its got some really unique and useful features. I may not be the exact target audience for a product like this (I'm not sure I even own 10 USB peripherals), but I am getting much more milage out of it than I had expected. When the device arrived I brought it into the office and set it up with my desktop (although sometimes I'll plug it into my Macbook Pro). I've got the normal keyboard and mouse and a few usb drives, but not a ton of items.What I really like this for is charging. I've got a limited number of plugs available to me and AC adaptors for iPods,iPhones, kindles etc can be a bit bulky and more than a bit expensive, but over the years I've built up quite the stash of extra USB charging cables and this hub has let me put them to good use. Charging from this hub is fast, much faster than a car charger and somewhat faster than charging directly from my laptop. Since it is a powered hub it fully powers each port (where the USB ports on my laptop have to split power between them when I am trying to charge more than one device). I also like that the last port (on the end of the unit) is not a data port. This port is designed for charging only and will not connect to your computer. Some reviewers don't seem to like this, but I've always been annoyed that connecting apple devices opens iTunes when all I was trying to do was charge. By using this port I avoid that even when the strip itself is still connected to the computer.I was a little afraid that having heavy cords hanging off of the hub would cause it to tip over. I had noticed when I pulled it from the box, that it is not particularly heavy, but it does ship with a piece of double sided tape and with it fixed to the desk it doesn't seem to matter how many cords I have pulling on it, it stays put.The last feature that I'm slowly growing to really like is the ability to switch ports on and off. The hub comes with three banks of three USB ports each. Each bank of ports can be independently turned on or off. The little bit of environmentalist in me likes to think I'm limiting phantom power usage by switching off unused chargers and peripherals (although I'm not totally sure turning off the ports stops power from flowing to the strip). Organizing the USB ports into banks has lead me towards organizing my peripherals by task. I will normally keep my mouse and keyboard on one bank, my data (usb sticks or drives if I'm using one) on the second bank, and several gadget chargers on the last one (and on the charger only port). When I come in in the morning I'll flick on the mouse/keyboard bank and only turn the others on when I need them.I didn't know how often I would use this hub, but its becoming more and more a part of my daily life and my workflow. It makes keeping all of my devices charged easy and keeps me connected to the few peripherals I need to survive. Its well built, well designed, and has features that set it apart from some of the smaller (unpowered) usb hubs I have used in the past. If you're in the market for a powered USB hub I don't see a better alternative.Five Stars","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 30, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2CXBZVFR2OFYM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00B9KOCYA#wasThisHelpful","R2CXBZVFR2OFYM","A2IZ9ZSFBW7JX8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IZ9ZSFBW7JX8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There are hundreds of good reviews that comment on the great sound and build quality on these headphones. I don't pretend to think that I'm going to add anything there, but I do have a big head and shallow headphone cups press on my ears and get uncomfortable after a while, so I thought I'd throw out my suggestion for that in hopes it might help someone.The cups on these are relatively shallow when they come out of the package, but there is a fair amount of ""extra"" material in them and you can stuff something into the ear pad to puff them out creating a larger space for your ear. I rolled cotton balls into a snake and wrapped that in black duct tape. The ring I fashioned fit in the pocket between the plastic ear body and the pleather cushion that presses against your head. This lets me wear them for much longer periods of time without discomfort.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 28, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R201NVBZ46YRK0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00007E7C8#wasThisHelpful","R201NVBZ46YRK0","A2IZ9ZSFBW7JX8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IZ9ZSFBW7JX8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Ok lets start with the good. This is a piece of FUR!!Cats love chasing fur. It doesn't matter if its full of jingle bells, or cat nip, or juicy bits that you'd rather not think about too hard. Fur is Fur.So its got that. You can attach it to your Da Bird stick (Da Bird Cat Catcher Cat Toy by Go Cat Feather Toys) your cat will chase it, ""kill"" it, and if your cat is like my cat, attempt to eat it (and repeat until I give up and try to hide it).But then there is the bad. This toy will brake. The fur is just glued onto the rubber top. Its not epoxy glue or super glue it really just looks like hot glue and thats disappointing because it will pull off. My cat managed to pull it off before I even got the toy put on the stick.So how do you fix it?Grab the toy. Throw it on a cutting board. Use a paring knife to poke a small hole through the leather sort of in the middle and at one end. Poke the fishing lure connector on the end of the Da Bird stick string through the hole and connect it to itself (the string). This will connect the toy to the string and you're on your way.The last time I did this it lasted for several weeks of near constant play. When it eventually did tear through the toy I was able to cut a new hole and start over. Eventually the thin just looked so sad (missing most of its fur) that I chose to replace it.So if you've already bought this all is not lost. You can get your money's worth out of this toy, but don't expect it to work ""as advertised"" and be ready to improvise.If you're still debating I'd consider your alternatives or maybe buy just one and see if it holds up to your liking.3 stars","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 28, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1TYG5SXF5BBSS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000UUK3T8#wasThisHelpful","R1TYG5SXF5BBSS","A2IZ9ZSFBW7JX8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IZ9ZSFBW7JX8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

She drags it around the house to try to get someone to play with her and more than once I've walked in on her tangled up in the string batting the mouse up in the air by herself (she always tries to pretend she wasn't, but I know what's going on).This mouse is really well built. I'm not sure if the leather tale is directly connected to the nose loop or if its just very well secured, but it has not shown ANY sign that its going to come off despite Meeko's nearly ritualistic gnawing and pulling on it. The nose loop is very secure as well and has not come off of the fishing lure connector that comes on the Da Bird pole once and shows no signs of getting ready to detach from the body (which is more than I can say for most of the name brand Da Bird refills we've tried).The only little bit of mess you get from this one is the bristles that make up the body. They certainly don't litter the floor like an over-loved catnip mouse, but they do pull off at a pretty constant rate (pretty much from the first catch you'll see a few on your cat's face). They aren't bad and in a few weeks haven't made the toy any less mouse like (although the body is getting a little more sparse), but if you're a neat freak you might need to stick to your laser pointer or a jingle ball (but where's the fun in that).For my money I'll certainly be back. This is the best refill I've come across for Da Bird and an excellent buy.*****Five Well Earned Stars","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 28, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1RQDANUDSR2UP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000S120H2#wasThisHelpful","R1RQDANUDSR2UP","A2IZ9ZSFBW7JX8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IZ9ZSFBW7JX8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I received my CISS unit a couple of weeks ago and was really excited to try to get it installed on my Epson WorkForce-3520. Having read the other reviews I was hoping for an easy setup and had even taken the advise of other reviewers and watched the installation video in advance on XPRO's youtube channel.Despite my efforts this planning didn't lead to the easiest setup. First, there are NO instructions in the box. If you go to the website they will direct you to videos on installing your system and on priming your system (getting air bubbles out of the air ink lines), but having only found the installation video on youtube I was blissfully unaware that I would need to prime the system. So after breaking off my printer ink cartridge door, installing the cartridge block, and taping in the lines to allow the printer head to move (for this I had to use my own tape as the foam tape provided was too thick) I got nothing. My printer produced only blank sheets.I knew something hadn't gone right so I checked through the comment threads on youtube CISS videos and found this ""priming"" which wasn't mentioned in the original video. So I went about finding the priming video for this CISS system. In the end I did find it on the XPRO website, but I wouldn't say it was the most obvious thing ever.From there I went about priming the cartridges, but I couldn't seem to get the ink to flow. Eventually I realized that in the priming video they had removed the ink tanks from the holder. It wasn't clear why they had done this and I had assumed that it was just to show more clearly what they were doing, but when I removed my tanks I found that the ink lines were doubled under and kinked (blocking the flow). On a side note this was the first thing I was asked to check for when I contacted customer support (if its that common of a problem then mention it in your instructional video). I fixed this, re-primed the cartridges AND... printed a beautiful test sheet ENTIRELY in blue ink. This is dragging on, but in short it had taken several hours of my time to try to prime the cartridges and the ink heads had dried out. After spending a few more hours troubleshooting thinking that maybe I needed to position the tank better (above or below the level of the printer cartridges) I washed the print heads with rubbing alcohol and distilled water and now I get full color prints.My hands were stained, my printer was more or less covered with drops of ink, I was more than a little frustrated, but it worked.Now that its installed it seems to work well. I feel like I'm actually saving ink (despite having to dump several syringes full of ink during the priming process and mishaps). The prints are near the quality of the original epson cartridges (maybe the pigment ink system would be even closer since Epson uses pigment ink in their cartridges).The build quality isn't great. Most of the parts feel like cheap Chinese manufacturing. The chip that connects the cartridges to the printer software is built so that it blocks the vent plugs you need access to during priming. The syringes provided for priming are incredibly cheap, thin plastic both broke by the time I was finished. The air vents they provide for the ink tanks didn't fit initially with the ink tank cover closed so I had to trim them (in retrospect this may have been because of the folded under tubing that raised the ink tanks 1/16"").Time will tell if I come back and upgrade the ranking on this system. If it runs perfectly from here out then my frustration was worth while and its probably a 4 star product, but if I end up needing to tweak and adjust it every time I want to print I will probably stick with my initial feelings and leave it here at 3 stars.If you really do your homework and saving money is important to you this CISS system could work well for you, but don't expect it to be hassle free. You are ""hacking"" your printer to work with bulk ink systems and the company that sold you the printer (and wants you to buy the ink) would really rather you not do this.So think before you jump.Realize that you are potentially risking both your printer and your money here (I don't think epson will cover bulk ink spills or a broken off printer cartridge door warranty or not).And then decide how you value your time and whether the potential hassle (and mess) is worth the savings.3 stars","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 28, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1TRUUJRFNSA0C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00A99FS4U#wasThisHelpful","R1TRUUJRFNSA0C","A2IZ9ZSFBW7JX8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IZ9ZSFBW7JX8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was approached by Satechi to review their BT Touch Speaker. I have reviewed a few speakers in the past, but for the most part they have been high end home theater and music setups. I assume that this may be why I was approached, but it gives me a little different perspective as while I don't use a lot of small bluetooth speakers, I do have quite a bit of audio experience.So lets start with what I don't know a ton about. The bluetooth component. This speaker was easy to set up. I was using an iPhone 5 (which I had previously paired with a Garmin Nuvi, so I wasn't totally clueless), but the little instruction booklet was very helpful in getting going. The speaker automatically searches out detectable devices the first time you turn it on, and if you miss that opportunity you can just hold down the bluetooth button, it beeps and you get to try again. And thats pretty much it. The speaker shows up in your discoverable devices library on your bluetooth enabled device, you click it, and you can start playing music and making calls.The connection seems stable as long as you're in the room or maybe a room over (depending on what is in between you; my bathroom is next to the kitchen, but putting a large refrigerator and a few pipes between the unit and my phone did give it some issues).I was able to stream both my itunes library as well as pandora. The unit is also set up to make calls and that works reasonably well although I don't think its a function I will use often. It might work well for small conference calls and people on the other end of the line said I was easy to understand. Its just not a feature I'll use on a daily basis, but it could be a nice in certain circumstances.The battery life on the unit seems very good. For now I keep it plugged in by my bed (it comes with a usb charging cord that will fit any old iphone/kindle/and USB device brick you have lying around), but have taken it around the house as well as outside for a few hours without killing the battery. The company claims a 4 hour battery life and I'd say that they're being fairly accurate.The audio component is where I'm a little more comfortable, but that doesn't make this an easy review. On the one hand I am impressed by the sound that can come out of a speaker this size. The whole thing is about the size of a large baked potato and for the size it does incredibly well. But on the other hand its not a super high end setup and won't replace my Klipsch speakers (which cost 10x as much and don't have bluetooth connectivity). The bass is pleasant, although certainly not booming (if you're looking for club base you can feel you need a much bigger setup). The distortion is quite low even at the highest volume settings. The mids and highs feel tight and crisp although occasionally a little tinny. There is no equalizer setting on the speaker itself. The way it comes (and interacts with my iPhone) seem to be a pretty middle of the road setup. It sounds pretty good with any music, but does best with music with clear vocals and tighter bass notes (think rock over rap). You might be able to get a little more out of it if you played your music through an app with a built in equalizer.The volume range is pretty good, but unlike other reviewers I wouldn't say that it ""fills any room"" if you're hanging out at your desk or listening to some quieter music its going to be great for you. Yes you can hear the speaker in any room (so in that respect it does fill a room), but if you are looking for a speaker to use at your next house party or something to listen to while you're at the park playing basketball you'll need something with more power.Overall I'm pretty impressed with this little guy. It gets the job done and is a joy to use. Its certainly portable, the build looks like great quality (I'll let you know if I have any issues over time), but its not the highest quality sound you can get (and I don't think I can compare to many bluetooth speakers so I'll leave that determination for someone else), but its pretty good and for a speaker I can throw in a backpack (or any much smaller bag) I can't help but be impressedFour well earned stars","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 22, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3C3YX6K48Z7S2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BNFPXIU#wasThisHelpful","R3C3YX6K48Z7S2","A2IZ9ZSFBW7JX8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IZ9ZSFBW7JX8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought this drive for my early 2011 macbook pro and installed it in the space that used to hold the optical disk drive. I used this (Hard Drive Caddy Tray for Apple Unibody MacBook / MacBook Pro 13 15 17 SuperDrive (Replacement Only)) mounting bracket. The physical install was relatively easy although if you haven't opened up your laptop before I'd read through the directions on ifixit a few times just so you don't get flustered and lose a screw.The drive is fast. I've uploaded a picture of the blackmagic (free drive speed testing app in the apple app store) showing full read and write stats, but in summary it came in at 262 MB/s read speed and 225 MB/s write speed. The package claims 550 read and 530 write (and the drive may well do that under absolutely optimal conditions), but I think the numbers I got are more realistic for the real world and they seem to be right in line with the read/write speeds of some of the more high end and well known drives (crucial, samsung, etc).In ""real world"" testing (ie when I take an unscientific approach and launch applications that are currently stored on both the ssd and on the regular hard drive) I see drastic improvement with the SSD. Excel takes about 12 seconds to launch from the HDD, but under 2 seconds to launch from the SSD. Restarts take significantly less time when booting from the SSD and compiling and running computationally heavy modeling software (my lab uses a lot of Matlab, Simile, GAMS, super pro modeler, etc) is greatly improved. Granted you'll likely see this sort of improvement no matter what SSD you end up buying, but its nice to know that even though this drive is priced like a budget model it runs as well if not better than the well known brands.My advice would be to get a drive thats big enough for at least all of your applications and your operating system and unless you really think you're in the top 1% of users who really need the extra few MB/s in the read and write stats, don't go for the super high end drives. This drive (at least at the time of this review) is reasonably priced with respectable speed if it looks like its going to fit your needs buy it. If other drives eventually end up being cheaper then go for the cheaper model. This is a nice drive, but very few drives really deserve a premium price and very few buyers will notice the difference in speed.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 7, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RXMGI49F0GLXU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007M7XS94#wasThisHelpful","RXMGI49F0GLXU","A2IZ9ZSFBW7JX8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IZ9ZSFBW7JX8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Strange (and perhaps mildly nerdy) as it may sound I've had my eye on the Missing Manual Windows 8 guide since before Christmas (it finally came out in March). I knew I wanted to upgrade my operating system and would want a guide to help me get up to speed quickly. Having read some of David Pogue's other books before so I knew that his sense of humor, his ability to distill instructions and explanations into everyday language, and the general approachability of his work really appealed to me. Because of that I really wanted to use this book to learn Windows 8.In the end I upgraded earlier than I had originally intended to and bought Windows 8 For Seniors For Dummies to help fill in the gap between when I got Windows 8 and when this book would eventually released. That book was good. It was approachable, it was a start, but it was shallow. So I kept waiting. I knew how to use basic Windows 8 features and I knew where the gaps in my knowledge were.That's where I came into this book, fully expecting to learn some new, more ""advanced"" tips on features that may not pertain to the everyday user. I've certainly gotten that, but I've also gotten great little hints and tips that speed up some of the most common ways I interact with my PC computer, from the new Windows 8 interface that Pogue names the ""TileWorld"" through my desktop and settings.If you come in with a similar skill set you could probably skip Part One, but then again you may not want to as this section covers some of the most common ways you will interact with your PC and every half second saving tip you pick up could save you hours in the long run. Part One's main focus is on getting you comfortable with the new TileWorld interface. Through it I picked up dozens of little tricks that improve my workflow (apparently my knowledge on even the basics was not as deep as I thought). As with all of the sections I've read it was well written, highly illustrated, conversational in tone, and easy to understand (I'm through about 375 pages of actual reading/trying out, but I've also browsed most all of the sections).It should also be noted that if you're running a windows-RT device this is your section. While the remainder book does cover more functions applicable to windows-RT users this is the most important section for you because almost everything you do will launch from the TileWorld.From there Pogue advances through eight total parts:Part Two: The Windows Desktop; this sections covers interactions on your desktop (dealing with files, programs, the task bar, control panel etc.)Part Three: Windows Online; this section covers the internet and everything that goes with it including your initial setup, protecting yourself online, and the provided internet browser and email applications.Part Four: Pictures & Music; this is the multimedia section covering videos, pictures, and music.Part Five: Hardware & Peripherals; this section is a quick 30 pages on tips and tricks for hooking up and running printers, scanners, and other devices through the sometimes dizzying array of ports on your PC.Part Six: PC Health; this section covers tips, tricks, and a bit of common sense to help you keep your hard drive from filling up, your computer running fast, and your data safe.Part Seven: The Windows Network; this section covers the different types of networks and accounts that you can set up, why you might want to set these networks up, and exactly how to do it.Part Eight: Appendixes; the book has four appendixes which cover windows installation, a quick introduction to the registry (more to ease your fears of it than to tell you how to do everything with it), features that were dropped in Windows 8 (or aren't in their old location), and a handy list of keyboard shortcuts.While I haven't finished reading each section I have browsed them quite a bit and picked out topics to fill in things that I already knew I didn't understand well. Each topic has been approached with the same clearly defined style and attention to detail as the first 375 pages were. I'm yet to read a topic that didn't teach me something new and I'm also yet to find a topic I couldn't understand.I give a lot of credit to Pogue for limiting jargon to an absolute minimum, but since I've jumped around a bit I do occasionally see a bit of lingo that I haven't been introduced to, but when that happens I've found that searching the index leads me almost without fail to the first uses of the lingo in question. This makes this a fantastic guide for someone who's not interested in reading a 900+ page manual cover-to-cover. Pogue realizes that nearly no one will use all of the features in Windows 8. He points it out in the book's introduction and acknowledges that because people won't use all of the features, they will skip around in the book (and that's ok). The book is designed for that and the time spent in the index and detailed table of contents to make the book highly searchable make that obvious.With superbly deep content, a refined teaching style, and an approachability not commonly found in tech manuals approaching 1000 pages, The Missing Manual for Windows 8 is an absolute gem. I cannot recommend it highly enough to those who are planning an upgrade to Windows 8, have just bought a device that came with Windows 8, those that are struggling, and even those that feel like they have a handle on everything. You will learn, you will work faster and smarter, and you will spend more time doing what you want instead of wallowing in frustration.*****Five Hugely Enthusiastic Stars","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 6, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R22BAHSKRCR1VS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1449314031#wasThisHelpful","R22BAHSKRCR1VS","A2IZ9ZSFBW7JX8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IZ9ZSFBW7JX8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"About 3 years ago I was having back, knee, ankle, and foot pain so I went to see a podiatrist. He convinced me that the insoles that came with my shoes weren't providing enough support. In his opinion the best thing I could do was get a pair of custom insoles made. At the time I had insurance that would cover it so I did. They were hard plastic and molded to my feet. They fit well and did fix my pain problems. I switched them out every time I switched shoes for over 2 years. I was tired of that. I wanted insoles to put in each pair of shoes I owned so I bought a few pairs of these.I was pretty scared that the pain was going to come back. I couldn't imagine that a $10 pair of insoles would ward off pain the way my $300 (before insurance) pair would, but I have been pleasantly surprised. I've been using these for about 6 months and haven't had any of my former pain return.These don't provide the support of a molded prescription insole. In fact they aren't even as thick as some of the other off the shelf insoles I've tried, but they're better than the thin foam insoles that come in my shoes (mostly Adidas) and apparently they're enough for me. These do provide some (somewhat malleable) arch support and the heal cup does work to absorb shock when I'm on my feet all day.The recommendation I can make here is two fold. First these insoles are far better than what comes in your standard sneakers and they can provide pain relief. Second, if you've been sold on high end insoles but never tried (or haven't tried in several years) the off the shelf insoles, do yourself a favor and find out whether you need to be spending that money. You may find that off the shelf insoles are all you need.Final thoughts:These are reasonable off the shelf insoles for a very reasonable priceThey aren't prescription insolesThey aren't the $70 off the shelf insolesBut they're a quality product that are going to be perfect for a lot of people","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 4, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R21P92NDZLETF7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000NSW2WS#wasThisHelpful","R21P92NDZLETF7","A2IZ9ZSFBW7JX8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IZ9ZSFBW7JX8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"These cubes are near perfect. They are plenty big enough to cool down a glass of scotch and since they have a low surface area to volume ratio they are going to take longer to melt and dilute your drink. They may also not cool it quite as quickly, but for my application that wasn't the point.A lot of people have commented on the off flavor that these can provide. I agree in that when I received my package they didn't smell the freshest. They definitely had some kind of lubricant from the manufacturing process on them. I rinsed them with blue dawn and then let them soak with some dilute vinegar solution (roughly 1:10 vinegar:water). I used apple cider vinegar because its what I had on hand. After a 10 minute soak and a quick rinse the tray had no discernible off odor and the cubes came out tasting like regular ice.I'd also heard that the cubes were difficult to remove, but I didn't have quite that experience. They don't fall out of the tray like an old school plastic tray, but I think thats done on purpose a bit. If you're going to take the time to make perfectly shaped cubes would you want to let them tumble out and chip corners off? A little push up on the bottom of each cube gets it out far enough that I can grab it and lift it out and the mold snaps right back to shape.Overall I'd say these are as close to perfect as you're going to get especially if you fixate on making pretty drinks. The cubes are not only functional, but look amazing and to me thats well worth a quick vinegar rinse and a few extra seconds to take them out of the tray.5 stars!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 11, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2JQ3VE1ZPMTVB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00395FHRO#wasThisHelpful","R2JQ3VE1ZPMTVB","A2IZ9ZSFBW7JX8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IZ9ZSFBW7JX8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a great manual. Its absolutely comprehensive. It focuses on many of the newer features of the iPhone 5 and iOS 6, but touches on nearly every conceivable thing that your phone can do and every conceivable way that you would want to interact with it.I would consider myself an avid iPhone user. I've owned pretty much every other model since the first and would have considered myself extremely iPhone proficient. Apparently I wasn't close. I had no idea that there were multiple ways to change appointment times or that I could customize the notifications center. While I had a general understanding about the icons on the top bar I couldn't have told you the complete hierarchy of cellular networks. When apple launches a new product or OS they add hundreds of features, but the media picks maybe 10 to drool over and you never hear about the rest. To take the time to search out and understand each one could take days, but its all here with full color pictures and easy to follow explanations that both explain functionality and walk you through using it.I found this to be an interesting cover to cover read, but then I'm probably a bit of a nerd. You certainly don't need to use it like that, but I suspect many people will just because its fun to know what your phone is capable of and to discover functionality you didn't know existed. If you don't read it cover to cover or if you do and then need to reference something later, fear not, the index of this book (which is hefty by the way at over 500 pages) is fantastic. If you've heard about a feature you can look it up by name. If you've got an icon you can't decipher the index will direct you to it. If all you know is that you want more functionality with a specific built in app like iBooks or iTunes you'll find where to go quickly and easily.Whether you enjoy learning about the features of your new iDevice or you've got a parent or grandparent that struggling to use the iPhone this book would be more than adequate. Great pictures, great descriptions, easy to use, and well worth the money.*******UPDATE: COMPARATIVE RANKINGSI never intended to read enough iPhone 5 ""manuals"" to truly compare them. First I just like learning about the phone. Then I got interested in the differences in teaching styles and ended up reading 5 really well put together books. I ended up rating them all relatively highly simply because they were all great books that will serve their target audiences very well. But since they're all great books you deciding on star ranking alone may not get you the right book so I'm adding a comparative ranking to each of my reviews to help you identify which target audience you might be in.I still stand by my initial reviews, but with more background my perspective has definitely grown.Overall Comprehensiveness:1) The Missing Manual (iPhone: The Missing Manual) - Covers from the tech in the phone to multiple ways to do almost everything2) My iPhone (My iPhone (Covers iPhone 4, 4S and 5 running iOS 6) (6th Edition)) - Maybe a touch less tech coverage than The Missing Manual, but not by much3) iPhone 5 for Dummies (iPhone 5 For Dummies (For Dummies (Computer/Tech)))- A reasonably comprehensive guide that doesn't bog down in tech detail and covers fewer ways to do things than the missing manual4) Teach Yourself Visually (Teach Yourself VISUALLY iPhone 5 (Teach Yourself VISUALLY (Tech))) - just a how-to usually one method per function5*) iPhone 5 for Dummies for Seniors (iPhone 5 For Seniors For Dummies (For Dummies (Computer/Tech))) - A moderately distilled version of the dummies book with more focus on ""senior specific"" topics(*I thought this should be singled out for its special topics of interest which my override total comprehensiveness for some buyers)Readability and Narrative:1) The Missing Manual - Reads well and the author has a bit of a sense of humor. The lack of walk throughs actually tends to make reading flow more naturally2) My iPhone - The narrative in this book made it accessible and helped disperse any nervousness you might have about learning a new tech device2) iPhone 5 for Dummies - A readable book, but certainly not my favorite read and probably not something I'd read for fun (even if I am a bit of a tech geek)4) iPhone 5 for Dummies for Seniors - Big text make this book ""readable,"" but I wasn't engaged with the narrative5) Teach Yourself Visually - This book is walk throughs its not for light readingWalk throughs and step-by-step instructions:1) Teach Yourself Visually - Tons of brilliantly detailed instructions with pictures that point out exactly where to press2) My iPhone - Nice guides offset from the narrative in distinctive blue boxes with helpful pictures.3) iPhone 5 for Dummies for Seniors - More guided instructions than the regular Dummies iPhone book, but not close to the Teach Yourself Visually book that I would recommend to my parents in terms of quantity or quality4) iPhone 5 for Dummies5) The Missing Manual - Step by step, button-by-button guides are not emphasized. The book isn't void of all instructions, but they are imbedded in text and assume that you read the first chapters and can find the appropriate buttons.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 9, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R16P33JE6L9MTW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1449316484#wasThisHelpful","R16P33JE6L9MTW","A2IZ9ZSFBW7JX8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IZ9ZSFBW7JX8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a good thief for however you want to use it. I generally use it to take liquid out for testing, pH adjustment, back sweetening etc, but it is possible to use it for taking a hydrometer reading and I think that would be more apparent if it came with directions. Its faster than using a siphon for small volumes and I think its less likely to cause contamination just because its simpler and has less little places for nasties to hide. Ive used it with buckets, 5, and 7 gallon carboys. I probably wouldn't recommend it for gallon jugs just because its a little tall and the time to sanitize something so large wouldn't be worth the volume you'd get out.If it had with directions I'd hope they had 2 sections#1 CLEANINGThis is a big item and unless you want to make several gallons of sanitizer or have a very large shallow pan you aren't going to submerge it (but if you can thats certainly the safest route). So how do you clean it? I've found that I can get decent exterior sanitizer contact just scooping sanitizer up with a hand and pouring it on. I think the tip is more likely to harbor bacteria than the smooth tube so I keep it submerged in sanitizer for a few minutes. To sanitize the inside I either scoop sanitizer up and pour it into the top of the tube or apply suction to the top while the bottom is submerged and suck sanitizer up into it like a giant straw. Once you lift the thief up so that the button isn't depressed the sanitizer is trapped in the tube allowing plenty of contact time. If you don't think you got quite enough contact time before it drained just repeat. After a few minutes dump and you're ready to go (at least for all no rinse sanitizers).#2 IF YOU WANT TO USE IT FOR HYDROMETER READINGSThis thief leaks a bit so I wouldn't use it over white carpet, but its not terrible and its about the best you could hope for with a gravity controlled valve. So if you want to use it for hydrometer readings: First make sure your hydrometer is going to fit in the top. Dip the thief into your carboy or bucket and fill it as full as possible. Drop in your hydrometer while you're still in the bucket. Lift the thief out high enough to take your reading. It may leak a little, but its slowly and its going right back into your fermenter. You should have plenty of time to take the reading if you run out of time and the level drops so far that the hydrometer hits the bottom of the jar just lower the thief, refill, and try again. Problem solved.Overall a good product better than anything else on the market, but it could benefit from some education PR.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 8, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2QHEWH6DMMVK3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00186ADYS#wasThisHelpful","R2QHEWH6DMMVK3","A2IZ9ZSFBW7JX8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IZ9ZSFBW7JX8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought this corker when I did my fist batch of homemade mead. I've used it with normal wine bottles of all shapes and sizes including thin ice wine bottles.

There is an adjustment if you're going too deep, but I had much more of an issue with not getting the corks quite all the way in. I had several bottles come out with a 1/4 inch cork sticking out because just as the last bit of cork is ejected from the compression section of the corker it expands and doesn't quite make it into the bottle.

"I had the first Aperture 3 Pro Series training book and I thought it was incredibly thorough. Sometime more thorough than a hobby photographer really needs, but perfect for anyone hoping to gain a very strong understanding of Aperture. The book was designed as a class and not a reference guide so the best way to use it was to read the chapters in order and go through the accompanying examples so that you could not only read about the features, but also test them out and see exactly how they should affect the picture you're working on if you are using them correctly. If you try to use it to look up individual features (I tried to use it that way the first time) it will not be very helpful because the book builds a skill base in each chapter and expects you to have some understanding of those skills in later chapters. Without that base the book can be down right confusing.I got a chance to check out the new edition and have found it to be much the same. It is every bit as thorough as the original was for the first version of Aperture 3 and covers the new features that were released up until 3.3 such as the improved highlighting and shadowing tools and the improved white balance tool. (On a side note the amazon description says that this version was optimized for 3.3 while the Peachpit site description says it is optimized for 3.4. A little confusing, but since 3.4 didn't contain many new user features this probably isn't an issue). Having continued to use Aperture for a while before this guide came out I had a decent grasp on the new features, but my learning curve would have been improved with the new guide and my technique did get a little fine tuning.So is the new guide worth the few extra dollars over the old guide?  ABSOLUTELY.  If you're learning the product for the first time go with the new guide. Some of the menus have changed since the software first came out so your learning experience is going to go a lot smoother with the updated guide and its the only way to get the complete run down on the new features.If you have the old guide do you absolutely need to upgrade?  I don't think so (unless you're applying for the certification)... If you weren't baffled when 3.3 came out and/or you have access to an internet connection you should be fine. When new features come out people are only too eager to try them out and post their experiences. You've already got a strong base and are going to be able to digest whatever directions you find online. So save yourself a few dollars, run a google search, and learn what you can about the new features.With all that said...This is still the definitive book for those looking to learn the ENTIRE Aperture programThere is no more complete guideThere is no guide with better step by step examplesIf you're serious about photography and have settled on Aperture to edit and manage your photos this is the book to buy hands down","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 7, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1LXY9BNH7AW62/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0321898648#wasThisHelpful","R1LXY9BNH7AW62","A2IZ9ZSFBW7JX8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IZ9ZSFBW7JX8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm not a professional by any means, but I like to tinker and always seem to have a home improvement project or two going. So my review is probably going to be most relevant to people that get their tools out a few times a month and just want something thats comfortable to use and that will get the job done.That said... I REALLY like the FatMax Line. The FatMax grips are a little chunkier and for my hands that makes them a little more comfortable than standard tools. If you have smaller hands the larger pliers could be a little intimidating, but my girlfriend hasn't had any trouble handling them so I don't think it is much of a problem. I don't know why they didn't continue that grip coating on the adjustable wrench and the locking pliers but I haven't had any blister issues with those either. Beyond the grips the tools seem incredibly sturdy. I've been known to use the closest tool at hand as a hammer when I'm in a pinch and even with that these show virtually no wear in almost a year in service.In addition to the great build, I think this is just a well thought out starter set. If you're not really sure what kind of pliers you're going to need or if you're buying this for someone thats just putting together their tool box you're going to be pleased with this. The blunt nose pliers cover a lot of prying jobs for me. The needle nose and wire cutters get used when I'm tinkering with household wiring. The crescent wrench is a great all around wrench for nuts and bolts (I pulled apart an old steelcase tanker desk with just it and a screwdriver). And the vice-grip (locking pliers) are my fall back tool to get me out of a jam (broke the hose nob off...stripped a screw half way in...can't get a tight grip on a smooth pipe? locking pliers to the rescue!!). Sometimes I need to borrow an extra wrench to get a job done, but for the most part (at least pliers and wrench wise) this kit has me covered. Everything gets used nothing's really missing. Just a really well put together starter kit.So wrapping up/recap:If you're looking for a sturdy, comfortable, well rounded pliers set thats gonna cover 90% of the around the house needs this is it.

"I'm no professional. I don't have a professional tool set budget. Most of the building and repairs I do aren't huge undertakings, but I think I represent a lot of do it yourselfers and to them I would highly recommend the Ryobi JobPlus.This is a great tool and its what I've started building my cordless toolset around. Originally I wanted a simple sander. I was going to buy a single purpose tool, but for a few dollars more I've been able to get a multi function tool body with the ability to adapt to my needs as time goes on.Essentially the JobPlus is a vibrating handle that can be connected to one of several ""heads"" with different functions. It seems to be sturdily built, powerful, and it runs for over an hour on one of the smaller Ryobi 18v batteries.The tool comes with a sanding head and 2 saw heads. The sanding head was why I purchased it originally and it works great. I was able to strip the paint off an old steel tanker desk in an afternoon without tiring myself out.They can cut through plywood, but they basically sand through it the wood gets very hot and sometimes even starts to smoke.The saws are less amazing.I've only used them for a few small cutting chores, but I can say that I wouldn't want to have to cut anything thicker than a 3/4"" dowel with them, but the great thing is that I won't have to because this tool fits all of the Rigid Jobmax heads. If I have a project that needs cutting power I can choose between the jigsaw head or the reciprocating saw head. These heads were originally designed to work with the 12v so this 18v JobPlus should be able to provide plenty of power to them.The heads are really what has sold me on the product there are drills, hammers, ratchets, and saws and new compatible heads are always being designed.A cordless drill would be nice. I cordless saw would be helpful. A cordless sander would serve a purpose, but if I had to pick a single tool to own for my decidedly non professional home improvement projects I'd go with the JobPlus.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 7, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2EHY7Z4TXVB6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009MRUTJO#wasThisHelpful","R2EHY7Z4TXVB6","A2IZ9ZSFBW7JX8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IZ9ZSFBW7JX8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I got this set for christmas almost a year ago and they have worked out wonderfully. I'm no professional, but I am pretty active with home improvement projects and furniture refinishing projects.I've gone through a fair number of cheap screw drivers who's bits seemed just as likely to strip as a stuck screws. I haven't had that problem with these at all. I used the set to tear apart an old rusty steel case tanker desk without any problems. The handles are on the larger side which might make them less comfortable for someone with small hands, but if your hands are on the average or larger side they'll fit well. The large grips make providing enough torque to break loose a rusty stuck screw relatively easy and having the proper bit sizes on hand makes you less likely to strip it. The kit comes with 3 philips and 3 flat head screw drivers (1 thick, 1 fine, and 1 medium short handle) and one universal handle that fits the accompanying bits. This bit set covers almost all of my needs, but the handle looks to be compatible with bits that have come with some other tools I've bought in the past so I don't think I'll ever have a problem with not having the right bit.I store them inside so I wouldn't expect any rust and I haven't seen any (so no complaints there).This would be a great starter kit for someone just getting into any kind of building project or really anyone looking for a strong base to build a tool set around. Stanley does sell a larger set for the fatmax line (Stanley 62-502 11-Piece FatMax Screwdriver Set) if you think you'll need it, but I haven't felt the need to upgrade yet.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 6, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2NAOYFUBHSEI5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005RTHS1S#wasThisHelpful","R2NAOYFUBHSEI5","A2IZ9ZSFBW7JX8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IZ9ZSFBW7JX8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"To start the kit contains the following:1/2"" 5/8"" 3/4"" and 1"" Spade bits (used for drilling large holes in wood)5/16"" 1/4"" 3/16"" 5/32"" 9/64"" 1/8"" 7/64"" 3/32"" 5/64"" and 1/16"" multi purpose titanium nitride coated high speed steel bits (used for many jobs the titanium coating helps keep them sharper longer)5/32"" 3/16"" 1/4"" and 5/16"" masonry bits (for drilling brick cinder block etc)1/4"" 7/32"" and 5/32"" brad point wood bits (W-point) (these produce a very clean hole when drilling wood and some plastics)The kit also includes a screw head adapter and several screw bitsWith that out of the way...This is a good kit. I'm not a professional by any means. I do mostly little home improvement jobs, but for the most part this kit has me covered. Occasionally I'll need to buy a specialty bit (like a hole saw or other larger diameter bit), but I wouldn't expect those types of bits to be included in a starter kit. If they were included, the kit would have to be entirely bloated and very expensive and 90% of the kit would never get used. For home improvement projects and general handy man type jobs this kit is going to work well for you. It would also make a great kit for a college student or renter to have on hand. Not to big to be a burden and not so small you'd be wanting for more.As for the durability, I have been quite impressed. I am generally quite hard on my drill bits and do tend to break one every now and again, but this kit is holding up great. After more than a year of occasional use (I'm not pounding on the bits every day) not only have I not broken any of the bits, but they all seem as sharp as when they were purchased and continue to make great cuts.I don't see this set wearing out any time soon, but would certainly consider it again if it ever does.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 4, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1WRYRNRQFZ5NE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0081SO8OM#wasThisHelpful","R1WRYRNRQFZ5NE","A2IZ9ZSFBW7JX8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IZ9ZSFBW7JX8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've been using the brewer daily at work for over 6 months now and I'd like to think I have a pretty good handle on where it falls on the coffee maker spectrum.Lets start with the pros.No potSmall basket for just a single cupQuick heating (coffee in 2-3 minutes)Adjustable for use with short mugs and tall travel mugsEasy to clean basket and scoop assemblyGreat if I need something to pick me up before walking into a meetingThen the less goods.It splashes a little even when you set it to the correct hight for your mug, I've found you can fix this by propping your travel mug up on the extra coffee filter basket to limit the space between the drip head and your cupIts not the greatest coffee in the world. The coffee itself isn't bad, but it does tend to let a fair amount of sediment through that can make the end of the cup a little grittyI can't tell the difference between bold and regular brew. Maybe I'm not sophisticated enough when it comes to coffee (thus giving a gritty cup 4 stars) but I couldn't pick the bold cup from the regular cup in a blind test. I guess its not really a negative for the brewer as not all brewers have the option, but it'd be nice if it did something noticeably differentAnd end with the overall.I like this brewer and thats why I continue to use it at work. If you don't have an office pot going or if you like to use your own special roast you'll want your own brewer for your desk. If what you're looking for is an enjoyable cup of coffee to get you through your morning you'll get it here.

"Zicam is a confusing group of products. (If you'd rather read only about this product skip to the bottom)Maybe I just think that because I write this review while taking a day off work with the mother of all colds, but the marketing team at Zicam seems like they're out to catch cold sufferers with buzz words. Things like ULTRA, PLUS, and original formula.Whats the difference and should you shell out extra money for the Ultra version? From what I can gather, all of the Zicam products are essentially zinc salts. Specifically zincum aceticum (ZA) and zincum gluconicum (ZG). The salts are varied in differing amounts, but not necessarily in a consistent way.My confusion is two fold:Active ingredient quantification:First is how they quantify the amount of salts. The crystals have 2X ZA and 1X ZG, but this is a homeopathic medicine and the 1X and 2X refer to dilutions (1X=1/10 and 2X=1/100). You'd think a company selling a product to a consumer in a cold induced haze would use grams or milligrams like every other company. Confusing, yes, but 1X apparently means the product contains 10% of a certain active ingredient where 2X contains just 1%. (So the crystals are 1% ZA and 10% ZG)Active ingredients among different products:The rest of my confusion deals with how the salts are varied between products. There does not seem to be consensus for what zinc salts concentration designates a product as ultra or plus. I also cannot find a trend that would suggest which ""level"" is likely to contain the most active ingredient for a single delivery method. For instance the original RapidMelts contained 2X ZA and 1X GA, the plus had only 1X GA, and the Ultra return to 2X ZA and 1X GA. Similar strange patterns seem to abound across all product lines where ultra and plus are often no more concentrated (and sometimes less concentrated) than original. If you want the highest amount of the active ingredients you want a product with 1X ZG and 2X ZA (the crystals do fall into this group).I'm not sure if confusing system is just poor product development, or an intentionally ambiguous marketing play directed at getting the consumer to try the latest and greatest Zicam even if the last version didn't work well. Either way its a little off putting for me.WITH ALL THAT SAID:You should buy Zicam if you believe the studies that say it works or if you trust your own anecdotal evidence, but base your specific product decision on the product delivery type or the actual ingredient concentrations and not the Buzz words (ULTRA PLUS etc.).I think Zicam shortens my colds and I bought this product when I started feeling cold symptoms mainly because I don't like the lozenges and chewable Zicam. I found the crystals to be a lot better and easier to take. The taste is actually a pretty acceptable lemon lime. Its not perfect, and it does start to develop an aftertaste after holding the crystals in your mouth for a few minutes. The logical thing to do would be to swallow it before it starts to taste bad, but it is important to hold oral Zicam products in your mouth for a while as the zinc compounds are quickly degraded in stomach acid. I didn't find that to be a problem with the crystals the way I had with the oral spray and rapid melts that not only tasted pretty bad, but gave a very strange and unpleasant texture in my mouth. I also liked that the crystals came in easy to carry single serving tubes that I can drop in a pocket with worrying about a spill or a wrapper coming open.I didn't understand the differences in active ingredients at the time of purchase, but in retrospect that would have positively affected my buying decision as these are among the products with the highest ZA and ZG concentrations).The cold I have seems to be wrapping up about as quickly as when I've used other Zicam products (regular plus and ultra) and probably faster than when I've gone without. The only difference is that the application has been more pleasant.Recap:Zicam is doing a lot of marketing to get your moneyBut the marketing really seems to be just marketing and no product substanceI'd base your purchase on the deliver method or the active ingredient concentrations and not the buzz word on the boxI prefer the crystals over other delivery so I'd buy them againUPDATE: The cold that I had while writing this review the first time ended up lasting just 4 days from start to finish. I'm not a double blind controlled study, but if you're looking for an anecdotal account of success you've got it from me.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 29, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3GPOARNUEK8G5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008NM3ABI#wasThisHelpful","R3GPOARNUEK8G5","A2IZ9ZSFBW7JX8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IZ9ZSFBW7JX8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I like these clips a lot. I live in oregon and commute in the rain year round. When its rainy,  slipping off the pedals when charging up a hill or racing to make a light can be a real issue. These toe clips seem to have helped a lot with that.I like them over caged toe clips and clip-less pedals for basically the same reason. My job means that some days I'm in the lab, some days in the field, and some days presenting. Different situations call for different footwear and I'd rather not be locked into a special set of clip-less biking shoes and then have to carry extra shoes in my bag. Caged clips pose a similar problem in that I've found they tend to be rougher on my shoes so I'd have to pack my nice shoes and ride in a designated bike shoe to avoid scuffing them up. With these clips I don't have too much of an issue. They can still scuff up a shoe a bit, but not nearly to the extent of caged pedals.A quick word of caution:You should take a quick look at your pedals before buying. I thought these were so great on my bike that I picked up a pair for my girlfriend's bike without looking at her pedals. Apparently not all pedals are drilled and not all drilled pedals have a level mounting surface (her pedals had inset reflectors that left an uneven mounting surface and made sturdy installation impossible). If you don't have pedals made to accept a toe clip you'll need to pick up a pair of those as well if you want to go this route.Overall: 5 stars for the clip, its design, and construction. I'd buy it again.(2 stars for my apparent smarts in not looking at my pedals before purchasing)Size: L/XL shoe size men's 12/13","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 26, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RFY98XJGOKM9Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0048HWQKS#wasThisHelpful","RFY98XJGOKM9Z","A2IZ9ZSFBW7JX8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IZ9ZSFBW7JX8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"So why would 90+ people review a $4-5 dollar item that you would have probably picked up at a gas station without reading any reviews just because it looked interesting? How about... because its awesome!!I'm a front pocket guy (having stuff in my back pockets causes me back pain). My front pockets are usually responsible for keys, wallet, phone, pens, pencils, and anything else I happen to pick up throughout the day. In short they're stuffed, bulky, and difficult to get things out of. So I'm always looking for a way to limit the amount of stuff I have to carry in my pockets.This S-biner works great I've used it for over a year now and have not had any problems with durability or with the wire gates loosening. I generally clip one end to my belt loop (or backpack etc) and the other end holds all of my rings of keys (I've got 3 rings of a few keys each but it could hold several more). Keeping the keys on a separate ring than you use to attach/detach the S-Biner from your pants keeps them from accidentally slipping off and I have not lost any of my keys in the year I've owned the S-Biner.This configuration (keys on just half of it) also allows you to utilize the bottle opener on the key ring. The opener isn't huge and can be a little finicky and having keys in the end you're trying to open a bottle with can make it nearly impossible to use, but it does work and its a nice add on to have without adding any extra size/bulk to a standard S-Biner.The build quality of the product seems to be very good. Initially I was a bit worried that the finish would scratch and flake off exposing more of the metal beneath, but I have not experienced very much of this at all. The color is fading a little and is worn through in a few spots after more than a year, but its doing it in a very natural way and looks like a well handled piece of metal, not just something painted black and scraped up with your keys.If there was one thing that I wish was added to the S-Biner it would be a locking mechanism for at least one side of the ring. While I haven't lost any keys to date, I would feel more secure about the safety of my keys if there were a locking mechanism to secure the key side of the ring.Final Thoughts:Well builtBottle opener is a nice feature although its not what I would use if I had a full size opener on handI haven't had any gate issues in over a year of ownershipWould like to see a locking mechanism on future versionsStill the best S-Biner for keys and with some added functionality which is why I continue to use and recommend it","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 23, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RG8LQPGNU8QRM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0095MPNXI#wasThisHelpful","RG8LQPGNU8QRM","A2IZ9ZSFBW7JX8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IZ9ZSFBW7JX8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am reviewing a pair of these that came with an iPhone 5. They're nice and certainly an upgrade from what used to come with iPhones and iPods, but if I was going to spend money on a new set of earbuds I wouldn't buy these.The Fit (comfort and noise isolation):Certainly improved. The new design is more natural feeling in your ear and because the buds are not perfectly circular they do hug the contours of your ear a bit better and they do stay in somewhat better. They aren't totally secure (at least in my ear) and they provide little in the way of noise isolation. I know these aren't noise canceling and very few ear buds are, but the soft plastic earbuds offered by many manufacturers (Panasonic RPHJE120A In-Ear Headphone, Blue, JVC HAFX1X Headphone Xtreme-Xplosivs, Klipsch Image S4i Premium Noise-Isolating Headset with 3-Button Apple Control) at all price ranges do provide some degree of noise isolation and (again at least for my ears) hold much tighter than these do. I'm not saying these can't fit your ear perfectly, but even under the best circumstances they won't seal out sound.The Sound:Again the sound in these are much superior to those in the original earbuds, but not better than whats on the market. If you're serious about sound you may want to aim at a higher price product from klipsch (Klipsch Image S4i Premium Noise-Isolating Headset with 3-Button Apple Control) Ultimate Ears(Ultimate Ears TripleFi 10 Noise Isolating Earphones) or another high end brand. If you are more or less happy with the sound quality that you've gotten from your apple earbuds in the past then you're going to be happy with these and will even get a little boost in terms of clarity, bass, and decreased distortion. But if you're looking for roughly that level of sound quality you  don't need to spend $30. I'd check out the MEE M6 ear buds if you're looking for a slightly lower price and as good or better sound quality. (MEElectronics M6P-BK Sports Sound-Isolating In Ear Headphones with Microphone/Remote for iPod, iPhone and Smartphones (Black)). If you're looking for more of a bargain than that look at any of the sub $10 sets available on amazon.Call Clarity/mic remote:I admit I don't make a ton of calls. I have played around with making calls and using Siri through the microphone on these and it works well, but earbud remotes and mics aren't anything special anymore. This one doesn't do anything that the one on any set of earbuds with a 3 button mic can't do everything special about it is in the software in the iPhone so this isn't a feature you should pay more for just because its from apple. Additionally there are some really great bluetooth and wired call devices designed for making hands free calls if thats something you do a lot of. I don't know enough to comment on specific devices, but would look to a specialty product and not here if that was your priority.Overall Design: They're a good looking set of earbuds and do ""go"" with the iPhone and new devices. If thats important to you then by all means stop reading and buy this pair. You know what you're getting and its exactly what you want.Wrap upFine earbudsNothing SpecialAn improvement in sound and fit over old earbudsBut not a big enough improvement to justify the priceIf I was looking for a replacement (i.e. earbuds that I wasn't getting for free with another purchase) I wouldn't use/buy these3/5 stars","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 21, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2NIC62T1HK6LJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0097BEG1C#wasThisHelpful","R2NIC62T1HK6LJ","A2IZ9ZSFBW7JX8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IZ9ZSFBW7JX8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a nice little case. Its not fancy. Its not made of exotic materials. Its not seamless, but it will protect your phone from scratches and dents and it doesn't add much bulk.I've ordered one of the book/wallet cases, but it won't ship until november so I picked this up to protect my phone between now and then and then to protect my phone when I don't feel like lugging around the full wallet case.Its a nice TPU case. I love these newer materials. I still remember the first silicone cases that used to be almost a little tacky and would pull your pocket inside out when you pulled out your phone. Those are long gone. TPU plastic cases are slick and don't tug on fabric at all. The black gloss TPU isn't perfect. Its slick looking and looks great especially when its clean, but it does collect fingerprints like no other. It also has a slight seam where the edge connects to the front lip and back panel. Its not very noticeable, but it is there and if you're a perfectionist it might bug you.The fit of the case is very good. The phone does not have room to shift around and the ports are all fully accessible. Some reviewers apparently received cases with just a single oval outlining the bottom microphones, headphone jack, and power jack. I did not have this issue and the case I received has 3 outlined cutouts in the bottom as in the picture.The volume control buttons (up and down) are covered by the side band and are, while outlined, are more or less flush with the case. I was afraid that this might make them a little more difficult to access, but they still seem to be relatively easy to press. The mute button has its own cutout and is very easy to press. Some reviewers have commented on the camera cutout being ""wrong"" because it exposes a small amount of the aluminum back. I don't see this as a defect and suspect it was done to provide more room for the camera and flash which might prevent flash reflection off the glossy case.Overall I think its a great little case. It won't end up being my every day case, but thats only because I wanted some functionality that a ""normal"" case won't provide. If all I wanted was a normal case I would certainly be able to overlook the very slight seams and finger prints given the price of this case.TL:DRNice case, slick look (when clean)Fit is greatDoesn't add much bulkPorts are accessibleSmall seam around the edgesDoes collect fingerprintsGreat value caseI can confidently recommend it","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 16, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3DEICMRHOD4BP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008UQ8DZ0#wasThisHelpful","R3DEICMRHOD4BP","A2IZ9ZSFBW7JX8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IZ9ZSFBW7JX8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This isn't a small switch. Its probably about as long as a dollar bill is wide (the short way), but its sturdy, made of quality materials, and is relatively easy to install.I picked up an old lamp at goodwill that came with a switch up near the bulb. With a shade on it was difficult to get to the switch so I added this product on the cord to make switching the light on and off easy. As I mentioned before its rather large, but I rather like that. It makes it easy to locate when fumbling in the dark, easier to install (imagine trying to fit a highish gauge lamp cord into a tiny click wheel switch), and generally more sturdy (which is good because mine sits near the floor and has been stepped on once or twice).To install you UNPLUG YOUR POWER CORD and cut one of the two wires in it. Then you make a second cut to remove a small segment of this wire and strip the last 1/2 inch on each side of the cut wire. Remove the screws that hold the switch together and lay the intact wire through the switch. The cut wire is then wrapped around two metal mounting posts, and the switch is put back together. It takes about 4 minutes if you have a screw driver and a wire stripper.Overall:A sturdy switch for replacing an old switch or adding a switch to most home appliancesRather large, but not unattractively so (IMHO)Should handle most household gauge wiresEasy to install with a screwdriver and wire stripperAnd most importantly an easy product for me to recommend","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 16, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RSK0XF2VGPE95/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000SSPHP2#wasThisHelpful","RSK0XF2VGPE95","A2IZ9ZSFBW7JX8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IZ9ZSFBW7JX8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Bar tending can be fun and if you set out bar tending tools at a cocktail party you'll get people trying their hand who've never mixed a true drink in their lives. It can give you some insight into which tools are well designed to do a job and which ones were designed to look good on your bar.Well designed products are easy to use even for people that don't really know what they're doing because they've been designed in a way that makes them more difficult to use wrong than right.I've seen a lot of strainers that come with long handles and look great sitting in a crock with your handled jigger and special stirring spoons, but watching people use them makes you realize how poorly designed they are. The long handle means people hold the strainer far from the glass. Not only does that make it a two handed job, but the long lever arm on the strainer makes it less stable and makes them more likely to slip it off and spill their drink.A good strainer should be difficult to accidentally have slip off your drink when the spring is engaged inside the rim of the shaker glass. But the long handled strainers provide less of a hint about which side should face the glass because you can hold them just as easily with the spring out and the spring in.The Oxo strainer doesn't have a handle (well at least not more than a nub) and the finger rest shows the user where they should be putting pressure to hold the strainer to the glass. By directing the user to face the spring into the glass and place pressure in the middle of the strainer to hold it to the glass, the Oxo strainer becomes much more difficult to use wrong (trying to hold it on by the handle nub would be incredibly cumbersome and turning it backwards would hide the finger indentation) than it is to use right. In my opinion thats just good design.Beyond the design the strainer seems to be made from quality materials. The metal on the strainer's base is closer to the thickness of a bleacher seat or old tanker desk than it is to a tin can (laugh but I've held some flimsy strainers). The spring is stiff so it holds tight to your glass and holds up to being removed for cleaning. The finger pad is heat resistant and seems to hold up fine in the dishwasher.Overall its a great little strainer.Its easy to useIts made from materials that will lastand when someone eventually nabs it from a party as a souvenir I'll be back to buy another","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 16, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1G51I9BM7GA3I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0000DAQ93#wasThisHelpful","R1G51I9BM7GA3I","A2IZ9ZSFBW7JX8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IZ9ZSFBW7JX8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I like this mount a lot. Its been installed in my car for over 4 years and the glue is still holding up despite the temperature swings from freezing winters to hot summer days parked in the sun. I bought it because I wasn't satisfied with the suction mount that would fail occasionally causing the garmin to fall off the dash. This seemed dangerous for both the driver and the garmin. The mount will fit all standard garmins (street pilot, nuvi, etc) and I've used it with a few different models over the years. They all mount securly to the ball mount although some of them did tend to sag over time (this was due to the female mount on the garmin loosening not a failure of this product).Two things I've found is that you should really follow instructions to get the most out of this product. If you are having mounting issues it could be because of a coating on your dash (any plastic cleaning/conditioning product) so you'll need to clean the dash before mounting. I would recommend washing with a drop of dawn soap, rinsing with water, and then rinsing again with rubbing alcohol. The soap will cut oils, the water picks up anything thats water soluble, and the alcohol will pick up alcohol soluble solvents and dry more quickly and fully. When you apply the mount I would put the glue pad down and stick on the mount base and then leave it for a day or two. Giving the glue pad a chance to cure a bit seems to provide a more secure mount. Then go ahead and put on your garmin.Once installed, be sure to unlock the use the button when you rotate the mount. If you force it the plastic can crack. I forgot to mention this to a passenger who was going to enter an address for me. The plastic rim that holds the mounting pole in cracked  and the garmin was no longer secure. It was easy enough to fix with a bit of super glue, but its part of the reason I gave 4 stars and not 5. Yes it was my fault, but I think the locking mechanism should have been designed a little more robustly or should be slightly more obvious so your passengers are more likely to use it correctly.Overall:Sturdy mount (more sturdy if you install it properly)Potentially safer than the suction mount for both the driver and the garminInstall it correctly and use it correctly and it will last you a long time","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 14, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3OXDIV2C2PL4C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000F7689A#wasThisHelpful","R3OXDIV2C2PL4C","A2IZ9ZSFBW7JX8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IZ9ZSFBW7JX8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"About 3 years ago I was having back, knee, ankle, and foot pain so I went to see a podiatrist. He convinced me that the insoles that came with my shoes weren't providing enough support. In his opinion the best thing I could do was get a pair of custom insoles made. At the time I had insurance that would cover it so I did. They were hard plastic and molded to my feet. They fit well and did fix my pain problems. I switched them out every time I switched shoes for over 2 years. I was tired of that. I wanted insoles to put in each pair of shoes I owned so I bought a few pairs of these.I was pretty scared that the pain was going to come back. I couldn't imagine that a $10 pair of insoles would ward off pain the way my $300 (before insurance) pair would, but I have been pleasantly surprised. I've been using these for about 6 months and haven't had any of my former pain return.These don't provide the support of a molded prescription insole. In fact they aren't even as thick as some of the other off the shelf insoles I've tried, but they're better than the thin foam insoles that come in my shoes (mostly Adidas) and apparently they're enough for me. These do provide some (somewhat malleable) arch support and the heal cup does work to absorb shock when I'm on my feet all day.The recommendation I can make here is two fold. First these insoles are far better than what comes in your standard sneakers and they can provide pain relief. Second, if you've been sold on high end insoles but never tried (or haven't tried in several years) the off the shelf insoles, do yourself a favor and find out whether you need to be spending that money. You may find that off the shelf insoles are all you need.Final thoughts:These are reasonable off the shelf insoles for a very reasonable priceThey aren't prescription insolesThey aren't the $70 off the shelf insolesBut they're a quality product that are going to be perfect for a lot of people","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 13, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ACQ01BTVW725/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000NSX61E#wasThisHelpful","R1ACQ01BTVW725","A2IZ9ZSFBW7JX8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IZ9ZSFBW7JX8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I see all the negative reviews and I have to wonder if we're reviewing the same thing.  I bought mine for $20 at Bath and Body because I didn't see it on Amazon until after I'd purchased it there, but it looks the same.  The UPC on mine is 752356794712.  It is called the ""AquaRug Carpet for Your Shower!""  Size 29.5 x 17.25.  I'll try to add a picture of the label/box so you can see that it's the same thing.My husband is 100% disabled due to Agent Orange, Vietnam.  He is very unstable (Parkinson's and end-stage heart failure).  I have tried a ton of  bath mats and they all slip and/or get very gross.  I bought this one IN SPITE of it saying, ""As seen on TV.""  I think the TV things are usually junk.I was concerned because, as others have pointed out, the suction cups don't work all that well.  BUT--at least on my 60-year-old cast iron/porcelain tub, the mat doesn't slip at all.  In addition,we have (adult) girls with hair that clogs the drain, but this goes right over the top of the drain and traps the hair. I was afraid that the hair would get in the little holes, but it doesn't.  I was really afraid that dirt would get in and it would be nasty.  It isn't.Here is our daily routine:After the last shower, I take an old toothbrush and run it over the mat.  That picks up all the stray hairs from the females in the family (my husband is bald).  I do this to the front and back.  I then hang up the mat on our bar (the bar that my husband uses to steady himself). It takes maybe 20 seconds at the most (I actually tried to time it by counting!). It dries out very well in time for the next showers 24 hours later.Several times a month, I throw it in my front loader with some bleach, if I remember.  Otherwise, it just goes in the regular wash and stays clean.For us, it's been fantastic.  I was so afraid that something might happen to it that I bought a second one to have ""just in case.""  It's the only mat I've felt is safe for my husband.

"This subject fascinates me--what happens when identical twins are adopted and raised separately (usually without their adoptive parents' knowledge or consent).  I had expected a fairy-tale-type book where someone else writes a sweet story about the two girls.  Wrong.  This is written first-hand by each twin.  Unlike some reviewers, I wasn't put off by the writing itself.  I thought it was good, and from the heart.The book starts before the women know of each other's existences, and then we are with them as they learn some disturbing facts about their history. The readers also learn unconscionable truths about what went on in times past in the name of ""research.""  Many of us know about the Tuskeegee Study involving adults, but were not aware that even newborns were subjected to that type of unbelievably unethical activity.The book is written, as I said, in the first person.  One twin will write a few paragraphs or pages, and the next one will.  For me, I would have preferred to have separate fonts or italics so I could more easily differentiate which twin was speaking.  I LOVED the pictures, and wish there had been more of them.  I constantly referred back and forth to the photos so I could really get a sense of who was speaking/writing.If you enjoy non-fiction written in a very personal way, this book may be for you. The book is an easy read (that's a good thing--it kept my interest).  At the end of the story I almost felt as if I knew the women and I would love to meet them in person.  I have a son who is adopted and who has been diagnosed with bipolar disease and schizophrenia. He is doing very well, but we really wish we could know more about his birthmother without having to pay a fortune to find information.  When we adopted him as an 8-week-old we were only told that his birthmother had some ""learning disabilities"" or something equally benign.

"My husband, a Vietnam vet with Agent Orange Parkinson's and heart disease, has end-stage heart failure and must be monitored daily.  His blood pressure is extremely low (ranges from around 72/50 to 90/60).  I also have low blood pressure, but don't need to check mine.  When I got this today I decided to try it on me first.  Following the instructions exactly (as well as the suggestions by some reviewers), I lined it up correctly on my wrist.  I took numerous readings throughout the day and my systolic BP consistently was around 30 points above average.More importantly, my *husband's* readings were also 30 points higher than they really were.  We verified this and were shocked by the inaccuracies.  It is crucial to know my husband's BP, and if it's showing a higher number like 110/65, we are lulled into a false sense of security.Perhaps this type of unit doesn't work for people with low blood pressure, but I wish I'd known that.

"I am 5'8"" and don't enjoy bending over to push my husband's wheelchair.  I contacted the Invacare company which made my husband's wheelchair to see if they made extensions for his chair (they don't).  I saw these and decided to take a chance. I was warned by Invacare not to trust anything that just clamped on because it could slip.  I went to the actual Wright Stuff website and looked at the directions online so I could get an idea of how these worked.They arrived sooner than I expected, which was very nice.  The directions were not hard to follow.  The actual welding looks a bit messy (the handle to the clamp), but it's very sturdy.  I installed the handles and was very pleased with the strength of them.  You'll need a Phillips head screwdriver and some pliers to hold the bottom nut as you tighten the screws.I've only had the extensions a week, but my back feels the difference.  I will probably have to tighten the screws periodically, but the extensions seem very good.  The actual hard plastic handles (very solid plastic) are better than what came with the wheelchair. The rest of the extension is made with extremely strong steel.  I like that the handles are easily cleaned, unlike the porous spongy-type material on the wheelchair's own handles (I'm a bit of a germaphobe, and the spongy-type handle material doesn't really get clean).People have stopped me and asked how I got such tall handles.

"I love these--but I'm not using it for kids!  My husband is 100% disabled due to Parkinson's Disease, major heart disease, and early dementia (all caused by Agent Orange/Vietnam, according to the government).  I have him do puzzles every day and it works so well.  I pick the puzzles very carefully based on quality, physical ease of use, and difficulty.As a former paid educator, I can tell you that these particular double-sided-type puzzles would also work well for kids in independent learning stations in the classroom or at home.  I bought four different sets of them and have liked all of them.  Don't necessarily go by grade level or age recommendations.  Go by ability. It's better (in my opinion) to buy something which might be a little too easy at first for a special needs student than to cause frustration.I'll be using this review for other puzzles I've purchased, so don't think you're seeing double if you read almost the same words.

"Being a Downton Abbey fan, and having spent time in my youth in England, I anticipated that this would be a fun book.  I was not disappointed.  If you want something deep and profound, this probably isn't it.  If you want something fun--yet with its fair share of insightful observations, you'll probably enjoy this.  Having been in England six times from 1963-1980, and having grown up with a British mum and grandmother, I related to many of the things she said.This is a very easy and entertaining book to read.  It reminds me of Margaret Powell Books--the ""lite"" version (if you haven't read Margaret Powell, check her out.  She was the basis for ""Upstairs, Downstairs"" and ultimately ""Downton Abbey"" by osmosis.  Try to read several of her books, if possible).  Mollie Moran's book added to the knowledge I gained from Powell's books and was the type of book which could be put down and then picked up later without losing a train of thought.""Minding the Manor"" gives us a brief look at ramifications from WWI (Mollie's father), along with the expectation of servitude for 14-year-olds. We watch Mollie grow and develop into a beautiful young lady.  The book glosses quickly over the rest of her life, but that's okay.  It wasn't meant to be about Mollie as a wife and mother. It's Mollie as she rises from scullery maid to cook.I'm a docent at an American mansion which was built at the turn of the century.  I use all of these types of books to help in my presentations.  Even though they are set in England, they give a glimpse into the mindset of the wealthy and their servants at that time (though in ""my"" mansion, the family did not believe in drawing such extensive cultural lines!). If you read ""Call the Midwife"" as well, you'll really get a picture of England in transition.

"I really like it, but it's unusual.  I mean, it goes on one color and changes to another.  I like both colors so I don't mind the change.  It also goes on shiny, but then 'stains' the lips and the shine kind of leaves. For me, it lasts a long time, but doesn't last as the shiny color I put on.  Despite that, I actually bought three of the same ones (one in my purse and one at home, and one for my 19-year-old daughter also loves it.I bought mine at Ulta (expensive!) because the sales clerk said she really loved it.  An Amazon reviewer mentioned that the smell was kind of 'off' and I agree.  It's not the normal lipstick smell I'm used to, but maybe they don't put additional fragrance in it--I don't know.For me, I love it and it's all I use.  BUT, I gave it four stars because others may not be pleased that it changes colors.  I have taken two pictures (before and after) of my lips when I first put it on and a few hours later.  I hope I can upload them.I can't, but I'll keep trying.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RR56R2Q8RXCTJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006WC7OQS#wasThisHelpful","RR56R2Q8RXCTJ","AWSLSPNVNIPMA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AWSLSPNVNIPMA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"SHORT VERSIONPros: Incredibly moving, crazy connection with the characters, can't-put-it-down-before-2AM kind of bookCons: Too short, ending a little abrupt (but fits with the overall tone of the book).LONG VERSION:I can't stand most ""Christian literature"" (i.e., literature written by a self-professed Christian).  It's fine when you want to waste your time on something saccharine-sweet and easily digestible (kind of like throwing on an episode of How I Met Your Mother), but when it comes to the real world and changing your life or worldview, it's basically useless.A friend recommended that I read The Other Side of Silence and I ignored him for a solid four months for this very reason.  I work in the prison system, and find it hard to swallow books that have no idea how the gritty underbelly (i.e. poverty, addiction, crime) of the real world work.I finally broke down and bought the book and devoured it within a day.  This is a book that sticks with you and makes you think about things LONG after you put it down.  It's the type of book that needs to be read several times.  Like other people have mentioned, the plot runs something along the lines of Crash or Babel, where everyone is interconnected.  It follows people who are desperate in some way, and hear nothing but silence from God - until something comes from the other side of that silence.Make no mistake: this book is not preachy.  The way that the author describes various situations makes me wonder if she's an alcoholic, illegal immigrant, a rich doctor, a seven-year-old child, a yuppie marketing executive, and recently found out she's gay all at the same time, because that's how well she describes what is happening in the minds of all of those characters.  To that end, the author does not pull punches.  She - and her characters - live in the *real world*, and experience God in the *real world*.My only qualm with the book is that it felt too short and ended rather abruptly.  I understand the artistic reasons for ending where it did, and I have no idea what I would have liked to have seen instead (there's a reason I'm not a writer).  This was just my personal opinion and didn't take away from the book in any way.I've already given away one copy, and the friend to whom I gave that book is now buying copies for HER friends.  I just finished it, and I can't wait to read it again.  It's that good.Highly recommend.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 13, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R173HV2NCQGGBZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1620830000#wasThisHelpful","R173HV2NCQGGBZ","AWSLSPNVNIPMA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AWSLSPNVNIPMA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Pros: Bass, bass, bass.  GOOD bass.  Not scratchy bass.  GOOD bass.  Decent mids and highs.  Seemingly well-made.Cons: Not as clear as, say, the ATH-M50 cans.  Microphone useless for Galaxy Note 2.Overall: Wow.------I.  Love.  Music.  I listen mostly to hip-hop and rap, but also enjoy rock, classical, pop, folk, jazz, metal, etc.  I listen to music for about 8-10 hours per day.  I know nothing about frequencies, mixing, or how the sound actually gets to my ears - but I know what sounds good and feels good.I've been searching for the perfect pair of headphones for close to five years.  I can't do over- or on-ear because headbands hurt my head after a few hours, and I can't do earbuds unless they have compatible Comply tips.  I've used Klipsch Image S4i headphones for a few years, but finally got fed up with the poor build quality and the fact that they fall apart within a few months of heavy use.After researching for months and ordering/buying/trying/returning several pairs (including the ATH-M50s, Bose OE2s, and another set of Klipsh'), I tried the V-Pulse based on review from Cnet, Head-Fi, and other random dudes on the internet.  I wasn't expecting to get better sound than my S4s - I would have settled for similar sound if I could just get better quality cables.I am completely blown away by these headphones.  I stayed up an hour later than normal listening to music the night I got them (and nothing gets in the way of me and my sleep!).  The last time I heard bass like this - deep, powerful, shake-your-bones, not scratchy or rumbly bass - was at a Nas and Lauryn hill show.  I'm telling you, you have to hear it to believe it - I have NO idea how the people at Velodyne manage to make this incredible sound come out of earbuds.  Bose speaker systems sound like the Sony Walkman stock headphones of the 1990s compared to what I'm hearing from these.There is negligible sacrifice in the mids and highs for this sound.  I don't notice a difference in the mids and highs between these and the Klipsch S4s (or any other earbuds), but they're definitely less clear than the ATH-M50 cans.  I'm not sure that it's even fair to compare clarity in earbuds and cans, though - especially cans made for mixing.I've been primarily listening to rap to get the most out of these beauties, but I have taken bouts with classical, podcasts, folk, pop, etc., to test out the sound.  It all sounds wonderful.They come with 8 extra sets of tips, a clip for your shirt, and a nice hard case. I have no idea how long the cord is, but it hasn't caused me any troubles.Bottom line: these are so amazing that I'm thinking of getting a second pair just in case (on my public defender I-can-barely-afford-food salary!).","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 4, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R32D9NL9C68MMJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006CVF1P0#wasThisHelpful","R32D9NL9C68MMJ","AWSLSPNVNIPMA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AWSLSPNVNIPMA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This isn't a case that's going to protect your Galaxy from some sort of natural disaster or alien invasion (heh...get it...galaxy...alien...whatever.).  If you're looking for something that will really protect your phone, go for OtterBox.This is a great basic case, though.  This particular color is a beautiful Tiffany blue and it snapped right on and comes off easily.I will note that one reviewer said that her case fell off when she dropped her phone.  She took off a few stars for that, thinking that it reflected the case quality.  However, my engineer brother and boyfriend both say that this is what a snap-on case is supposed to do.  If it can't absorb the shock in the case itself (i.e., if it's not an OtterBox), then it is engineered to come off the phone easily.  That way the shock is absorbed by the case coming off the phone.  I will also note that I failed high school math and science so I have no idea if that's actually true, but I dropped my iphone with a snap-on case onto concrete countless times and never had a problem - so clearly something is working!","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 3, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R4QO37PYAKFJT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009VUHXCS#wasThisHelpful","R4QO37PYAKFJT","AWSLSPNVNIPMA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AWSLSPNVNIPMA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Good: Sound qualityBad: DurabilityTip: Get the Comply memory foam tips!Longer version for those who don't mind reading...I'm not exactly an audiophile and I don't understand a bit of science behind music or what the frequencies are.  However, I listen to music about 8-10 hours per day so I know what sounds good and what doesn't - and what's comfortable and what's not.These have excellent sound - especially for the price.  I bought my first pair when they were in the $100 range, and even at that price range they were a steal.  The lows are low, the highs are high, and the mids don't get lost.  The included eartips were uncomfortable, but I hate ALL tips with all headphones, so I always replace them with Comply tips - extremely comfortable memory foam.What's the problem, then? The build quality.  I had two pairs break on me, and it's inconvenient to send them into Klipsch.  The warranty is good - two years - but you're without headphones for the several weeks that it takes to ship them and get them back.  When I got back one of my pairs, it was still broken.  The cables fray, the sound cuts out of one ear or the other, and the mic buttons stop working.I did use mine a lot, but I almost always kept them in the case.  The cables are simply very thin and unimpressive.I switched to Velodyne V-Pulse after months of researching new headphones, and don't regret it a bit (though the price increase hurts).","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 3, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3K9C08S8NOJVA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00264GYMG#wasThisHelpful","R3K9C08S8NOJVA","AWSLSPNVNIPMA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AWSLSPNVNIPMA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Maybe I have freakishly small ears, but I have the hardest time finding tips that actually fit and sound good.  I have Klipsch S4-i headphones, and the smallest tips worked well for me but were kind of uncomfortable.  When I lost one, I happened upon the Comply website and decided to try them out.  I got the smallest size in a 3-pack for somewhere in the arena of $15.Sound quality: five stars.  I'm seriously impressed.  The noise isolation is great, the basses are low and the trebles are high.Comfort: five stars.  I love deep sound, so I shove 'em in my ears like earplugs.  They only start to ache after at least six hours of continuous listening.Physical quality: three stars.  I've had them about a month, and the tips are starting to rip and lose their form.  I will say that I don't treat them gently - I twist and pinch the foam to get it deeply in my ear like an earplug.Bottom line: For about $5/month (probably less if you don't mangle the tips like I do), you can greatly improve upon the original sound and comfort of your earbuds.  I highly recommend them.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 3, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1MCEOC23SC3WR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0017SF1RQ#wasThisHelpful","R1MCEOC23SC3WR","AWSLSPNVNIPMA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AWSLSPNVNIPMA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"A somewhat tough read that covers the evolution of rhetoric from Aristotle to the present. Olmsted explains how rhetoric develops topics around which arguments are made and built, these topics growing and evolving over time as the world changes.  She touches upon the usual triumvirate of rhetoric – pathos, ethos, and logos – and how each is applied differently and to varying effect by various authors and historical figures.  She explains the differences between Cicero and Machiavelli, for example, in dealing with rhetorical issues.  It is at times difficult to keep track of who said what, but it is fascinating how a seemingly academic and even somewhat esoteric topic can guide think and have an historical impact (Machiavelli’s The Prince in shaping reaction and policy as city-states developed in Europe).  Olmsted also turns to literature and covers how Milton and Austen used rhetorical means and strategies to achieve their ends, one to grapple with the reality of multiple theological world views after the reformation, the other to explore the challenges facing women in British society as they attempted to assert their individuality in a world changed by industry.  Olmsted wraps up nicely with discussion of the role rhetoric played in bringing reconciliation to post-apartheid South Africa, and how rhetoric can drive legal analysis.  This latter part is particularly fascinating, as Olmsted describes how statutory ambiguity allows for development of legal topics over time.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3U3BPYX7WEMET/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000RKVO1M#wasThisHelpful","R3U3BPYX7WEMET","A3F0OFSE2M25U2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3F0OFSE2M25U2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A good book that covers the various ways that creativity via insights can come into being.  The authors provide many examples to show how insight moments can happen, including a lot of material on specific brain states that support their claims.  The most valuable chapter is the last one, where they list and summarize the various techniques and conditions needed to stimulate insight moments, like separating from your problem by distracting yourself with a walk, for example.

"This was a very challenging and difficult book to read as Neiman writes mostly for other philosophers and academics.  Her main point is that the major ground that used to be the focus of philosophy was the problem of evil.  She explanis how this was present in the philosophical works of earlier philosophers.  This all was changed, however, by the earthquake in Lisbon, which caused Enlightenment Europe to recoil in horror.  The intellectual and philosophical response to the earthquake was to bifurcate evil into moral and natural evil.  This, in turn, had a major impact on philosophy as the latter was put on the fringes of philosophical discussions.  Neiman delved deeply into the various interpretations about life that this new perspective caused; the role of God in all this, especially.  Neiman covers extensively the place of Auschwitz and the holocaust as a touch point of the meaning and causes of evil in the modern. There is a lot to be mined here, with much of the material extrapolated from Hannah Arendt's work. Unfortunately, the lay reader will have a hard time wading through the text and absorbing all the lessons given the occasional untranslated French, for example, or reference that assume a deep knowledge of philosophy or literature.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ZXX58208PGA2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0691168504#wasThisHelpful","R2ZXX58208PGA2","A3F0OFSE2M25U2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3F0OFSE2M25U2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The way we measure time and space today is significantly different from not that long ago.  According to this book, man used to see time as circular and did not break it down into segments.  And even these non-regimented views of time varied from place to place.  It was not until the introduction of innovations like the clock that man began to look at time as something that could be divided and ultimately potentially conquered. People like David Allen, author of Getting Things Done, are direct beneficiaries of this change in mindset.  Space was also not conceived in the past the way it is today.  Changes were reflected by the introduction of perspective into painting, which used parallel lines joining in the horizon, with checkered floors to aid the eye, to create perspective.  These are two of the “measures of reality” that Professor Crosby covers; others include bookkeeping and music.  One fascinating bit of trivia: the “Do Re Mi” scale comes from the first syllables of words from a Gregorian chant (sorry Julie Andrews).  The book is scholarly but generally accessible.  Crosby writes with some attitude and humors, which makes a subject that could at times be tedious, more enjoyable.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1XEQ9CVGVVCPL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0521639905#wasThisHelpful","R1XEQ9CVGVVCPL","A3F0OFSE2M25U2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3F0OFSE2M25U2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In an age when no one has reasonable debates, talks past each other and demonizes the opposition, a book like this can be an important corrective.  Professor Gutting uses case studies to teach the various tools of the philosophical trade that can informed reasoned argument.  One of the most important of these tools, and the one most needed in these times, is the Principle of Charity, which requires that you ""render in neutral language the main elements of your opponent's position"".  This is important not just to understand it objectively but to also help you rationally fashion your own counterarguments.  This would be very helpful today in the issue of same-sex marriage, for example, where one side deems the other homophobic for simply objecting and the other side deems the other as destroyers of the values of Western civilization.  Regardless of which side you are on, you need to fully understand the arguments of the opposition.  Another example is the idea of convictions, that is fundamental beliefs from which a person begins that do not necessarily require specific reasons, although they can be rational, similar to axioms in mathematics.  Gutting's case studies include religious agnosticism, the limits of science, and education in a capitalist economy.  For each case study he brings to bear another principle, and teaches how it would be applied for that specific topic.  I do not agree with all his conclusions, but, although it is clear where Gutting stands, the point of the book is not for Gutting to make a case for his positions, but to make a case for reasoned argument.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RAOLO4YAFF4BL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0393242277#wasThisHelpful","RAOLO4YAFF4BL","A3F0OFSE2M25U2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3F0OFSE2M25U2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was at first put off a little bit by this Idiot's Guide as the writing began in a very condescending tone.  There was even an inaccurate statement claiming that philosophy led to the end of human sacrifice.  After this rough start, however, the booked picked up, raising the level of discussion while keeping the material accessible.  The topics covered the usual ground for philosophy introductions - the pre-Socratics, Plato, Descartes, etc.  What was interesting and refreshing for me was the inclusion of philosophers not often included in these overviews, specifically in this case Margaret Cavendish and the post structuralists like Derrida and Lacan and the post modernists like Lyotard.  This book has piqued my interests in these philosopher's works as well as others.  I highly recommend this book for laypeople who want to get a relatively quick and easy overview of the philosophical landscape, just beware the initial speed bump.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RE3H7GKRNJCYQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=161564444X#wasThisHelpful","RE3H7GKRNJCYQ","A3F0OFSE2M25U2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3F0OFSE2M25U2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A terrific novel based on the life of Roger Casement.  Vargas Llosa shows his virtuosity as a chronicler of the human condition via fiction.  The story is about Roger Casement, the Irish Brit turned Irish nationalist by his experiences of colonialism in the Belgian Congo and the Peruvian Amazon.  Vargas Llosa entrances the reader with this descriptions of human emotions and living environments.  One can feel the heat of the Amazon, or the claustrophobia of Casement's prison, or the refreshment on the skin of the cool waters wher Casement swam for recreatoin. One can also experieince the depths of emotion and passions, as Casement confronts the cruelties inflicted on the natives by Europeans or by native elites in the Congo or the Amazon, or as he struggles with decisions over when and how to organize an insurrection in Ireland, or, most poignantly, his struggles over his sexuality, and his actual or imagined exploits.  I recently read a blurb on how reading fiction helps in learning how to interact socially under various circumstances.  I think this book is a perfect example of not just that, but also of how the mind struggles and wins, and sometimes loses, in its daily battles with the challenges of reality, be they personal harm inflicted by nature or others, or by the constant struggle to simply stay afloat, above the sadness and even depression that is sometimes just below ground.  The story itself about Casement's evolution from English knight to traitor is fascinating.  Vargas Llosa masterfully depicts the various players in the drama, from the fauna and flora of the various environments, to the personas that crossed Casement's paths - his mother, his fellow revolutionaries, the various culprits supporting and heroes fighting the injustices Casement witnessed, the priest and Casement's jailer, among many.  This is a novel that will endure in the memory of  its readers.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1QFTE722KLEUH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250033322#wasThisHelpful","R1QFTE722KLEUH","A3F0OFSE2M25U2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3F0OFSE2M25U2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Some philosophers have prescribed an ideal for individuals olive by to achieve a number if things, be they happiness, contentment, etc.  John Kekes claims in his work that ideals can never be achieved and attempting to do so never removes the conflict in values that causes someone to reach for an ideal as a solution.  He has a chapter for each ideal theory, introduced by an excerpt against the ideal, followed by a brief introduction to the ideal, then a story of a person faced with a situation of conflicting values attempting to apply the ideal, concluding with Keke's refutation of the ideal.  For example, their is a chapter on Narrative Unity as an ideal for behaving and structuring one's life.  Keke's presents his protagonist and goes on to refute most if not all of the claims of living by this ideal.  He does so in a very systematic and easy to understand manner, taking each main claim about or for the ideal, and dissecting it and exposing its flaws.  Occasionally his illustrations seem forced, like the protagonist for the Absolutist Morality, who came of as a bit of a caricature. For the most part, however, Keke's does a good job of presenting fairly the ideal in question, before tearing it down.  Keke's prescription is the Practical Approach, which acknowledges the conflicts in values but allows for different responses depending on needs and circumstances. On some level, he seems to be advocating situational ethics, but I think he is calling for more than that.  What struck me how often the everyday examples resonated with my own everyday living and conflicts, and how even when some seem to be addressed satisfactorily, their is always a lingering feeling that a better approach, mindset or attitude would have provided a better result.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3FVHVCJ7LRXVL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=022615565X#wasThisHelpful","R3FVHVCJ7LRXVL","A3F0OFSE2M25U2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3F0OFSE2M25U2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This book discusses the major political insights and practices from the Greek and Roman era, how they evolved and how they impact us today.  Democracy, for example, in Greek society is not like democracy today.  Back then its practice was restricted to male citizens of the polis, with perhaps others who had special status.  Some even saw democracy as a bad thing, possibly resulting in mob rule, or at least rule by the ruffians.  Plato's republic provided an answer to this by anointing philosophers king, or at least by making philosophers out of kings.  This tension between the ruler and the ruled continues to this day, as our American representative democracy can appear to have steered far from the ideal of representation based on principle.  Author Lane covers a total of eight concepts including democracy, justice, constitution, virtue, citizenship, cosmopolitanism, republic and sovereignty.  It's fascinating how the philosophical ground rules established more than 1800 years are still valid, as we deal with in our own presidential electoral process with issues like citizenship (immigration and so-called anchor babies); cosmopolitanism, with the shrinking of the world by communications and travel technology; sovereignty, with border control and submission to international bodies.  The ancient Greeks and Romans began this conversation and it is still going on.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RSY83IM9IIJ02/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0691166471#wasThisHelpful","RSY83IM9IIJ02","A3F0OFSE2M25U2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3F0OFSE2M25U2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Another terrific engagement by the co-authors of Freakonomics.  The book is a compilation of their most interesting blog posts.  I read these not only for the  entertainment value but also to remind myself of the economist's viewpoint on matters, which can often be enlightening (and a good corrective for what passes as reasoning in the media and elsewhere).  For example, Dubner and Levitt explain why high gas prices do not mean the end of civilization as we know, but instead will result in less use of gas and more use of gas substitutes, with prices and purchases correcting themselves over time.  Economics is about incentives, and a number of the posts focus on that, like incentives to decrease gun violence for example.  There are some very interesting posts that seem to have nothing to do with economics, like the one about names that match occupations for example, or the posts about the Pittsburgh Steelers, which were a bit annoying (yeah, Dubner, you love them but we don't care).  The other posts that also bothered me somewhat were the one's about gang members and the ""escort"".  i understand that the authors are trying to make economic points, but sometimes these posts can appear to glorify the underlying criminal activity and immorality.  Nevertheless, their books are a good way to exercise the economist's mindset and remind oneself how to apply it everyday situations.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1XWBZT608HVR7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062385321#wasThisHelpful","R1XWBZT608HVR7","A3F0OFSE2M25U2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3F0OFSE2M25U2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is one of the best philosophy books that I have read.  Although focusing on political philosophy, it covers the usual cast of characters of any introductory book on philosophy – Plato, Aristotle, Augustine, for example.  But, because of its focus on political philosophy, the book also covers others usually neglected from philosophy overviews – the ancient Greek playwrights, Luther and Burke.  Each chapter is lucidly written, covering the major ways in which the philosopher contributed to thinking about politics – Plato’s discussion of justice; Augustine’s views of two cities, the temporal and the eternal; Marx’s interpretation of history as the expression of class struggle.  The book also includes a chapter on scientists like bacon and Newton, and how their scientific discoveries impacted political viewpoints, leading primarily away from an authoritarian and communal viewpoint to a scientific viewpoint based on experiment and individual freedom.  A real treat was the chapter on Wollstonecraft, and her contribution to political philosophy.  Although I started out thinking that there would be a lot of dry material to plod through in a book like this, the co-authors proved that the material could be presented in a lively and engaging manner.

"This is one of my favorite books because it provides a very clear road map for effecting change. The brothers Heath break down successful change into three components: 1) Direct the Rider; 2) Motivate the Elephant; and 3) Shape the Path.  Directing the rider refers to using reason and facts to identify where others have succeeded (the so-called bright spots), give specific behaviors, for example.  Motivating the Elephant refers to pushing the emotional buttons to motivate your target.  They give a great example of a manager piling up the different kinds of gloves purchased by a company to make a point.  The book gave me a strong motivator to stop drinking whole milk when they said one glass of it is equal to six strips of bacon.  Shaping the Path mean working on the environment or setting things up in such a way that success is more likely.  One example is teaching people to have a bowl of soup when trying to lose weight as this makes someone feel full faster.  What I am really looking forward to is combining the Switch methodology with “nudging”, or using behavioral economics and psychological principles of influence to get things done.  I think there is also a tie-in to the idea of “simple rules”.  A book by that name describes how simple rules can effect powerful change and actions.  These three approached could make for significant impact in any environment.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R200NLWSPI4CY4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385528752#wasThisHelpful","R200NLWSPI4CY4","A3F0OFSE2M25U2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3F0OFSE2M25U2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Author Mudd makes a very convincing case for conducting analysis from “right-to-left”, or, in other words, not beginning with the data but beginning with the right questions and the decision needs of decision makers.  As an analyst for the CIA working on critical issues – post 9/11 terrorism, for one – he has a lot of credibility.  He uses his vast experience to create and explain his system, which he learned through a lot of trial and error.  The best take away from the book is the idea of thinking through clearly what the right questions are and what your bosses will need to make the best decisions.  Mudd emphasizes that the decision will not be up to you, but that you need to take into consideration the right variable for the decision maker.  He notes that to do so, you need to focus on the right variables, which he calls those which others would be agnostic about, meaning, given the same situation, almost every analyst would agree that those variables should be included.  One other major price of good advice is the idea that one should set benchmarks for one’s decision variable so that one can reassess whether the variables are still valid,  Too often analysts stick to the same variables and don’t jettison them or add other better ones.  The one criticism that I have of the book is that in some ways it is limited to the type of analysis done by CIA analysts, who may need to take into consideration motives and intentions, and differentiate between those and capabilities.  A current example would be the Iran nuclear deal:  what are the Iranians intentions vs. what are their capabilities?  Analyzing the former is rife with speculation and guess; analyzing the latter is more concrete as it relies more on facts.  I don’t think that most of us in either the business world or government need to include this component in our analyses.  In any case, the book does provide a valuable different way to perform analysis, one that takes the ultimate decision making goal into account, and build reality checks (and even humility) into the process.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3O4JLOAZJUVZA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0871407884#wasThisHelpful","R3O4JLOAZJUVZA","A3F0OFSE2M25U2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3F0OFSE2M25U2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book covers philosophy from a topical standpoint, addressing and exploring the usual suspects –knowledge, God, science and ethics.  The book is an introduction to philosophy but is written in a very dry and sometimes inaccessible manner.  To encourage philosophy newbies to imbibe further, books like this need more vivid and memorable examples; this one lacks them.  Also, although I understand that this is an introductory text, there are times when more can and should be said to enlighten and encourage the reader.  For example, the explanation of Hume’s view on induction stops at a point where it could leave the reader feeling inadequate to the task of understanding Hume’s thought. Thus, it may turn a budding philosopher away from the discipline.  Overall, the book does a good enough job, but there are other introductions to philosophy that make the subject matter more interesting and more accessible.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2IZO1YV5SL6KM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0064671240#wasThisHelpful","R2IZO1YV5SL6KM","A3F0OFSE2M25U2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3F0OFSE2M25U2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When I started reading this book I was a little frustrated because it seemed to focus on dramatic born-again type experiences as miracles.  For those of us who are Catholics, these types of experience are foreign.  Also, to me, focusing on this type of experience tends to downgrade the day-to-day grind and mundane nature of everyday struggles.  Sure, some of these conversions can be called miraculous, but let’s not forget that even in these cases there is a return to the everyday struggle of existence.  That aside, this book has an introductory chapter that makes a convincing case for life itself being a miracle, basically expressed in the question “What are the odds?” Specifically, Metaxas relates how physicists have calculated the probability of the universe existing as it does - it is exceedingly small. He describes how if even one factor, say the distance between the earth and the moon, were to change by the smallest amount, there would be no life on earth.  He also explains how scientists have determined that the nature of the universe was set in place within one millionth of a second after the big bang.  For all that to happen within such a tiny time frame seems to strongly suggest involvement of intelligence.  The remainder of the book is stories of miracles that Metaxas shares about friends and acquaintances, some of them more or less dramatic.  I am sorry to say that one of them includes a story that involves Benny Hinn, who to me is a spiritual charlatan.  The crux of the story seems real, but that Hinn is somehow involved leaves a bad taste.  Finally, Metaxas includes a heartwarming story involving Alice von Hildebrand, a renowned Catholic philosopher, and her late husband, Dietrich von Hildebrand.  I note that Hildebrand is Catholic because up until that point, the book had a slight anti-Catholic taint to it, what with all the focus on born again experience and an anti-Catholic quote from one Metaxas’ subjects.  At least in this case, redemption was achieved.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2NT753HKVCTZK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0525954422#wasThisHelpful","R2NT753HKVCTZK","A3F0OFSE2M25U2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3F0OFSE2M25U2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"What does someone need to do to become a philosopher?  Gary Cox explains that first and foremost, one has to have a skeptical mind and take nothing for granted.  He illustrates this point by detailing the various philosophers most famous for expressing this trait, Descartes in particular.  A philosopher needs to think for him or herself and not accept any received knowledge without sufficient scrutiny.  This attitude, by the way, serves well in many endeavors.  Cox covers broadly the main areas of philosophy – metaphysics, epistemology and ethics – and gives the reader a good sense of what the philosophical profession entails. One minor disappointment was Cox not mentioning that originally philosophy was a way of life; i.e. Stoics lived by stoic principles; Epicurians lived by Epicurian principles.  This book is geared more to philosophy as a career and even has some career advice.  Cox does note that anyone can be a philosopher by philosophizing, although I think the danger here is that, if applied too loosely, folks who do not apply real rigor to their thinking will consider themselves lofty philosophers.  Cox takes the classic question “If a tree falls in the forest and there is no there to hear it, does it make a sound”, and runs with it to cover a lot of philosophical ground that includes landscapes of epistemology.  This is an easy and fun read for someone who is interested in a quick glance at the philosophical endeavor.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2W07P5OQNW4VW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1472504941#wasThisHelpful","R2W07P5OQNW4VW","A3F0OFSE2M25U2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3F0OFSE2M25U2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"William Ury is the co-author of perhaps the most well-known book about negotiation, Getting to Yes, which he co-authored with the late Roger Fisher.  In this book, Ury shares his revelation that before you can successfully get to yes with others, you have to get to yes with yourself first. What he means by this is that we are often our own biggest obstacle to achieving negotiation success.  Why? Sometimes because we are not honest with ourselves with what we want, or we want the wrong things. For example, in a negotiation we may be seeking revenge or to not lose face, rather than looking for a win-win solution. We may want to achieve certain conditions, like freedom or recognition, but focus instead on the material expressions of this, like a severance payment or percentage of ownership.  Once we recognize what we really want, we then open ourselves to creative solutions. Ury gives great examples of these instances from the many negotiations where he was a participant or an advisor.Ury’s advice is packaged as a six step process: 1) put yourself in your shoes; 2) Develop your inner Best Alternative to a Negotiated Agreement; 3) Reframe your picture; 4) Stay in the zone; 5) Respect them even if; and, 6) Give and receive.  For each of these steps Ury provides a detailed explanation of what it means and vivid examples of where he has personally applied it or seen others apply it.  Number 2 for example is about willing to take ownership of your situation without blaming anyone, including yourself or others.  By doing so, you can focus on current reality and move toward solutions.What I did not know about Ury was how intimately involved he has been in major international crisis, like Hugo Chavez government and its negotiations with rebels.  Other negotiation books I have read are written by people who negotiate business deals, for example.  Ury’s negotiation experience is at an entirely different level.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RO5ACP1AZNU56/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062363387#wasThisHelpful","RO5ACP1AZNU56","A3F0OFSE2M25U2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3F0OFSE2M25U2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book provides a superb technique to identify and reduce stress.  The premise is that stress results not from events but how you react to those events.  This is not new wisdom as the ancient Stoics, and others, professed the same.  What is new here is the very detailed and specific technique that author Bernstein provides.  As someone who experienced traumatic events as a young person – the deaths of his father, step-sister and brother – he is speaking from sorrowful knowledge.Bernstein’s technique is a seven step process that begins with first acknowledging the counterfactual believe that is causing stress – e.g. he should not have been rude to me – and establishing why, seemingly paradoxically at first but ultimately correctly, the person “should have” been rude.  Bernstein explains why that is the case.  That something “should” have happened acknowledges that it did and allows you to move to action and resolution.  Bernstein shows how feelings and actions are tied to how we first react stressfully, and later, after we acknowledge reality, how we feel and react after the analysis using ActiveInsight (Bernstein’s brand name for his technique).Bernstein applies the technique to a range of areas, for purposes of illustration and to teach the technique.  The areas covered include death, anger, weight loss and success, to name a few.  The technique works.  I used it recently when stuck in traffic.  I explained to fellow passengers why there should be traffic – it’s the 4th of July weekend, etc., etc.The name of the book can be misleading and I can imagine people who live with stress thinking that it’s bunk.  Perhaps a retitling to the Myths of Stress may clarify.  I highly recommend this book for anyone who wants to reduce their stress levels around a number of issues.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ZRL03LTYGI8U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1439159459#wasThisHelpful","R2ZRL03LTYGI8U","A3F0OFSE2M25U2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3F0OFSE2M25U2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"David Graeber may be best known for coming up with the slogan, ""We are the 99 percent"". In this book he deals with the issue of rules and bureaucracy.  His these is that rules are not value neutral and objective, but rather are purposely promulgated to benefit the extraction of profit by the powers that be.  In the United States that would be the government and private financial institutions.  An example would be rules related to banking regulation which although ostensibly in place to ensure the proper functioning of the banking system, are in fact in place to ensure that financial institutions have legal backing for whatever their policies need. I think that Graeber is right to a point.  Given that we live in a complex society, there is no question that some sorts of rules are necessary to ensure at least efficiency, if not necessarily fairness.  As a personal example, take a popular local restaurant in my neighborhood.  The take-out area was chaotic and sometimes led to confrontations (this is the Bronx) as no one really knew who was next.  The simple implementation of a numbered ticket system, supported by the implicit rule of lower numbers go first when called out, ended all that.  This may seem a mundane and irrelevant example but it testifies to the fact that there is no getting around some rules.Graeber points out that one of the major forces available to the government is its power to use violence to ensure the following of rules.  And it is the threat of such violence, not the actual use, which carries the day.  I could not agree with him more.  The current area where this is played out today is in police-community relations and the use of force.  To my mind, police officers have a great power behind simply with the threat of the use of force.  This alone cuts resistance down significantly as most people in such a situation would not want to escalate because of the threat.  I also agree that there is overreach in this in many areas.  For example, why are security guards needed in public libraries?He includes an essay where he argues that those of us who grew up in the 60’s and early 70’s have a sense of disappointment at not seeing the technologies promised in sci-fi  movies – jetpacks, teleportation, hover boards, for example. He claims that this is a result of a conscious decision to place research resources into the military, medicine and communications.  I think this is a bit of a stretch.Books like this are always fruitful to read as they give us the chance to look at our environment and circumstances from a radically different perspective, hopefully for the better.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1PX6J72ZX9NEV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1612193749#wasThisHelpful","R1PX6J72ZX9NEV","A3F0OFSE2M25U2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3F0OFSE2M25U2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The author makes the argument that exercise is more than just a physical act but can also be a great mental act.  Young draws from the lives of various people, other philosophers and his own experience to make the case.  Exercise strengthens our character by forcing us to be disciplined and to sacrifice.  It helps one to rise above the daily grind and the difficulties of daily existence, to levels of reveries and, at times, even transcendence.  Exercise removes the Cartesian mind-body split and reunites the individual into a whole and unity.  Young does note that exercise can create bad mindsets, like those of bodybuilders who are narcissistic. He claims, however, that body sculpting can also be a legitimate pursuit of beauty and physical harmony, as supported by the ancient Greeks.  The book essentially elevates exercise above mere physical exertion or to a lofty pursuit of personal wholeness.  For couch potatoes inclined to a more intellectual side, this book may be a good motivator to start exercising.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1L4BTYGYVE5ZN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250059046#wasThisHelpful","R1L4BTYGYVE5ZN","A3F0OFSE2M25U2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3F0OFSE2M25U2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a great book that helps the reader figure out how and when to establish ""simple rules"" to help in decision making and taking action.  The co-authors describe the rule types, like boundary rules, for example, that tell you ahead of time what to include or exclude.  There are also timing rules, that tell when to stop or start something.  Simple rules tend to be more effective and efficient than complicated rules or logarithms. The authors provide as an example a Noble Prize winning economist who eschews his own complicated logarithim for personal investments and insteas uses a simple rule to invest.  Simple rules are effective because they remove the complexity of analysis and decision making, which can wear the mind out, and allow the individual to take decisive action because, to some extent, the decision has already been made.  An example of this is Michael Pollan's rule for eating: ""Eat food.  Not too much. Mostly plants.""  The authors also provide helpful guidance on how to create and refine simple rules.  My only criticism is that the authors mislabel instinctual animal behavior as simple rules.  They give examples of bees, birds and locusts for example, and how they achieve certain goals - locating a place for a beehive, flying in formation - and calls these behaviors rule following.  Creation of simple rules implies consciousness and rational choices, which are obviously not involved in these instances.  Perhaps there are not enough examples of simple rules created by humans to fill the pages of this book.  The other issue I had was a with the authors labeling creative people as eccentric when they used Tina Fey as an example.  Perhaps that was Fey's experience but that eccentricity and creativity go hand in hand is a myth that was laid to rest a long time go.  It's surprising to see this error stated as fact here.  They should have known better. Notwithstanding these issues, the book is a great guide for creating simple rules to help organizations and individuals achieve concrete goals.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3R19CIU1D603Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0544409906#wasThisHelpful","R3R19CIU1D603Q","A3F0OFSE2M25U2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3F0OFSE2M25U2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is one of the best philosophy overview books out there and I've read a good number of them.  The only qualification I would give is that the book is written for an intermediate level rather than an introductory one.  If you have read other introductory books, this one will take you to the next  level of understanding.  Shand has an uncanny ability to go over the same material in such a way that it presents itself differently but reinforces the particular thought of each philosopher.  As you are reading you get the feeling that the same point is being repeated, but it's okay because it's form a slightly different perspective that is providing more insight into what you just learned.  This approach has resulted in my finally getting a good grasp on Hume's view on induction as well as a better understanding of other philosopher's ideas, including Kant, Nietzsche and Heidegger, which is saying a lot.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1GG6LC6B9L00N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0773511393#wasThisHelpful","R1GG6LC6B9L00N","A3F0OFSE2M25U2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3F0OFSE2M25U2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

He puts together a menu of options that can help one achieve happiness, from Stoic teachings to Montaigne's philosophy.  Ultimately, happiness is something that one can achieve by taking responsibility for how one responds to events and by seeing life as something that inherently has ups and downs.  There is material here even from Schopenhauer whom one would think has nothing to say about happiness.  There is also some contemporary material about neuroscience, happiness set points and positive psychology.

"Father Morris provides the reader with a practical guide on how to use the serenity prayer.  The prayer is built on three things: acceptance, courage and wisdom.  The first is about letting go of things that cannot be changed - the past, other people, etc. The second is about having the courage to change the things you can.  The emphasis here is on action.  Finally, the wisdom to know the difference, as stated in the prayer.  Father Morris has chapters on how each of these components of the prayer can be applied and realized, and often gives personal examples,  The book is not tied solely to these three precepts, though, as Father Morris expands and extrapolates into other areas of Christian life and morals.  For example, he writes about mercy as an essential component of the Christian and writes about gratitude, living life one day at a time and trusting in God for ""our daily bread..  Sometimes when I read books like this I find myself drifting and inattentive, probably because I have heard the same messages so many times and in so many different ways that it does not come off as new or insightful.  Ironically, as I was having this thought while reading, I came upon a passage that said that God really cares about each of us.  At that moment i thought about how much I care about my own children and the message hit home in a profound away that I never experienced before, and I could really feel God's love for me.

"This book is a collection of Gary Becker's articles written for the magazine Business Weekly, many co-authored with his wife, a historian. Becker was a Nobel Prize winning economists who believed strongly in the power of free markets and rational choice.  I very much looked forward to reading his insights on how economics affects basic human choices, particularly since behavioral economics has attempted to bury the idea of homo economicus. There are a lot of good articles on how rational choice impacts social policy.  For example, there are good discussions on how special interests interfere with rational economic choices and how they can help to stifle economic growth.  There are also interesting articles on labor economics, international trade, welfare and crime.  Unfortunately, no effort was made to cull out article that were redundant, and there were a lot of those.  Also, none of the articles were dated, so there is not sense of exactly when an article was written and in what context.  The articles can therefor jump from one administration to another, and then back, causing some historical vertigo.  I was also surprised to find some naivete on Becker's part in his policy recommendations, such as how the implementation of school vouchers would work out.  A better book would have been one that first explained the economic principles involved and then followed with examples from the various articles, preferably in chronological order.  Nevertheless, the book is still a powerful advocate of free markets and rational choice, notwithstanding any valid correctives from the behavioral economists.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQVBC0SI3H2EI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0070067090#wasThisHelpful","RQVBC0SI3H2EI","A3F0OFSE2M25U2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3F0OFSE2M25U2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Adam Smith is best known as the intellectual father of capitalism and as the author of the Wealth of Nations.  Not too many people are aware of his broader philosophical side as reflected specifically in his book The Theory of Moral Sentiments.  Economist Russ Roberts writes about how he finally picked up the book and read carefully and how much it impacted his life.  He shares Smith's philosophical wisdom and insights with the reader and produces a guide to better living through better thinking and ethical behavior.  Roberts notes how Smith observed that the culture and its mores are established over time by social approval and disapproval.  As a result we want to be ""loved""; in Smith's terminology this means respected for our  character and noble actions, which make us ""lovely"".  The sum of all these good actions are what compose a good life.  And we do good and avoid bad not so much because we fear consequences, temporal or eternal, but because we feel that an impartial spectator is watching us, and so we take this spectator's  sentiments into account.  Roberts notes also that Smith was not materialistic.  Instead, he advocated becoming wise and virtuous to be happy and have a good life.  Material wealth is not intrinsically wrong, but it is not necessary for either wisdom or virtue.  The book is filled with these kinds of insights, as well as good examples as well and practical applications to live a better life.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3EJC1CKXIYT22/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1591846846#wasThisHelpful","R3EJC1CKXIYT22","A3F0OFSE2M25U2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3F0OFSE2M25U2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Author Lynch advocates the traits of scientific reasoning as those that should set the gold standard for public discourse in order to maintain a democratic society.

So he explains that there is another basis for accepting scientific reason and takes the reader step by step through his logic, Frankly, a lot of the reasoning was hard for me to understand, but what I get is that science's way of arriving at conclusions - intersubjective, adaptable, repeatable and transparent, is the best way to engage in public discourse and keep the engine of democracy moving.  This would be in stark contrast to the talking past each other, as well as the relativism that opposing sides ascribe to each others' views - whether they be reason or faith based.

"This book describes the various myths around creativity and how to counter them. Burkus give us 10 myths, for example the Eureka Myth where an idea appears to pop out of nowhere, as when Archimedes figured out in the tub how to solve the problem of determining whether the kings crown was made of pure gold or not.  (Personally, I often jump out of the tub naked on various occassions and run in the streets yelling ""Eureka"".  Fortunately there is always a clean towel waiting for me at the precinct.) The fact is that good ideas take time to develop; they percolate in the brain and take form over time. When the idea hits, it can feel as if it came out of nowhere.  There is also the Originality Myth, that ideas also come forth ex nihilo, unconnected to anything prior.  Again, this is a myth since most new ideas build on past ideas and are always a combination of two or more existing things.  The problem with these and other myths is that they can create excuses for not trying to come up with good ideas (hey, I'm just a regular schmo with no creativity genes (the Breed Myth) or can lead to counterproductive or ineffective practices (the Brainstorming Myth), in turn depriving the world of a better mouse trap (oops, that's another myth). (By the way, Nature invented the best mouse trap - it's called a Cat.)I did have some issues with some of his points:1) There is no gene for creativity to objectively identify who is creative.  However, Burkus points out that creative people have more white matter than grey matter in their brain.  Is this not then a way to objectively identify creative people (and does it matter)?2) He gives as an example of creativity the Netflix price and crowdsourcing idea to get an improved algorithm for making movie recommendations.  Two issues: a) Netflix ended up not using the algorithm, although they did learn from it; b) the algorithm would have led to non-creative outcomes for Netflix customers who would continue to view the same types of movies.3) As a public servant, I was completely unimpressed by his examples of private sector people working in the public sector to provide an outsider perspective.  The results of their efforts were insignificant and their roles seemed not much different from typical consultants.4) Burkus had an internal contradiction in his writing.  In an earlier chapters he criticizes the bifurcation of jobs into creative and non-creative work, essentially stating that the false dichotomy deprives organizations of the creativity found in all individuals.  Later on, when criticizing Taylorism's approach to incentives, he notes that ""creative work if different""; i,e. for white collar analytical jobs that are not defined by repetitive tasks, you can't apply the same kinds of incentives as you would to non-creative work.  So what happened to the prior alert against the false distinction between who is and is not creative?Despite these flaws, Burkus is largely on target with his identification of the myths and their antidotes.  Throughout, Burkus also presents good examples of both the myth and the right approach in practice.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R34WBKHW71KQ0K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1118611144#wasThisHelpful","R34WBKHW71KQ0K","A3F0OFSE2M25U2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3F0OFSE2M25U2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was unaware until reading this book that Rousseau and Hume had actually met.  Rousseau was on the run after publishing a work that derided miracles and Hume offered to give him refuge.  At first, the relationship was one of mutual admiration, but that deteriorated eventually mostly, as I percive it, due to Rousseau's sensitivity.  Today, Rousseau might be labeled as paranoid based on all the imaginary offenses that he thought were ocurring.  The story is told in a way that keeps the reader engaged.  The writing duo of Zaretsky and Scott are highly gifted; one wonders how they worked together to pull this off.  There are so many illustrious characters involved, beyond the two main protagonists - Boswell, Johnson, Erasmus Darwin, Robert Garrick, Voltaire, Diderot - it's a veritable who's who of Enlightenment personalities.  The reader gets a mini-course on Rousseau's and Hume's philosophies in the context of their relationship, their times and the conflagration between the two.  To be honest, at times it felt as if I was reading nothing more than gossip, a sort of highbrow version of the Housewives of New Jersey.

"As an overview of Kant's work I found this book to be quite challenging.  That is not necessarily a reflections of Guyer's skill at writing but more of the inherent difficulty of the subject matter.  As everyone knows, Kant's philosophy is hard to understand.  Guyer takes the reader through each of Kant's major works and goes into quite a lot of detailed explanations about what Kant meant, where he was inconsistent, and how his explanations were satisfactory or not.  There are other introductions that are far easier to grasp, but they only take the Kant neophyte as far as the wading pool; this one takes the reader into the deep end of the pool.  As such, the reading is challenging, and it is somewhat consoling to read phrases like ""what Kant meant"" because it reassures the reader that the difficulty lies in the material and no some shortcoming in the reader (have I mentioned enough times how difficult Kant is to understand?)  This book will require numerous dips before enough is sufficiently grasped; nevertheless there is quite a thrill when Guyer elucidates a Kantian point through example or clarification, although I am still struggling with fully understanding the connection between reason, freedom, free will, etc. My favorite quote, given the current interest in ""nudges"" and behavioral economics: Paternalism is ""the greatest despotism thinkable"".","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1C3RJWB84VHWU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0415283361#wasThisHelpful","R1C3RJWB84VHWU","A3F0OFSE2M25U2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3F0OFSE2M25U2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"What is law?  What makes law legitimate or something that should be obeyed?  Where do laws come from?  These are some of the questions that this short tome attempts to answer.  For the most part, author Wacks does a good job of making the material accessible, particularly in the early chapters on natural law, legal positivism and the thought of Ronald Dworkin.  However, as he gets into the later chapter, Wacks assumes too much knowledge and presents topics without sufficient explanation.  For example, some of the views on law involve economic or sociological concepts.  These are presented as if the reader already had basic knowledge of concepts and terms in these areas.  Those who do not will get lost, as I did on some occasions.  This may be the fault of the necessarily limited content in this series, but the author perhaps then should have only mentioned some of these areas rather than attempt to get into them briefly but at too high a level.

"This book is filled with terrific writing advice, not just for writing under pressure, but under any circumstances.  Kaye explains how writers in pressure circumstances end up with an unbalanced effort because they fail to plan both the amount of space to dedicate to each piece of writing as well as the amount of time.  As a result, someone may spend excessive time on the introduction and then find themselves with a conclusion that misses the mark.  Thinking ahead in this way gives the writer perspective on how much time and space to allocate.  One of my favorite bits of advice is Kaye's recommendation to spit out as many ""because"" ideas to bolster your point.  Doing so will give you enough material that you can then cull from, instead of being left with too little to say.  Also, he encourages the writer to give space to the other side of the issue, which helps both in crafting your own issue but also lets the reader know that your opinions are well considered.  One unique perspective that Kaye offers is the idea that the end of every writing effort should be an assessment of what was learned from the process so as to improve one's future efforts.  Kaye  also offers an insightful analysis of the writing that occurs in organizations, which tends to lean toward loyalty and not rocking the boat, thereby pushing creative and challenging thinking aside.  In this sense Kaye's book is also a call for honesty, integrity and even courage in the face of organizational expectations.  I wonder what he thinks about the stifling and falsely authoritative appearance created by the ubiquity of Power Point.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2VIM779YULNYF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0195066618#wasThisHelpful","R2VIM779YULNYF","A3F0OFSE2M25U2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3F0OFSE2M25U2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A collection of hysterical cartoons by the cartoonist who drew on of my all time favorites - ""How about never, is never good for you?"" Kaplan had me chuckling and bursting out loud in laughter, to the consternation of some of my fellow subway riders.

"This book teaches a method to analyze arguments so as to determine whether the arguments makes sense and their reasons lead to conclusions.  Fisher uses what I would call a layperson's approach.  That is, he does not use the methods of traditional logic, especially those of formal logic, but instead introduces what he calls the Assertibility Question;i.e. What argument or evidence would justify me in asserting the conclusion?  (What would I have to know or believe in accepting the conclusion?)  You get to this point after identifying the inference and reason indicators, figuring out how they relate to each other (are the reasons independent or dependent), are their preliminary conclusions which then becomes reasons for the final conclusion?  Through this effort, one should be able to arrive with some confidence at the assertibility of a claim.  The book is written for students, so for someone who is not assigned classwork going through some of the examples is tedious, particularly as Fisher first introduces the text being analyzed in full, then with notations, and sometimes excerpts again to review the analysis.  Part of the reason that Fisher does this is because he wants to motivate the reader to believe that he or she can get far in their analysis and not really on experts or on the need to be an expert in the subject matter itself.  This, I think, is a noble ambition.The book has a supplementary chapter on formal logic, which I skimmed, and a chapter containing readings for independent work.  Some of these are fascinating in and of themselves.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RBE3RA9YFOQX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0521654815#wasThisHelpful","RBE3RA9YFOQX","A3F0OFSE2M25U2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3F0OFSE2M25U2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have always felt that too much time is spent filling out project management spreadsheets at the cost of actually doing the work.  Doing so gives some people a sense of control, even thought that may not be the case.  A book like this is a breath of fresh air because it gets people to ficus on the essentials of project management (filling out spreadsheets is not one of them).  The one-pager is a genuine improvement as it contains all the information that a project manager needs to know, at an appropriate level, where a project is, what still needs to be done, and where a project may need help. I do feel, however, that the format could probably be improved by someone with a better eye for design, as at times, even this streamlined tool can contain too much information.  From my experience top management only needs to (and wants to) see the bare essentials.  I also agree with the authors that a tool like this also focuses meetings and helps to order priorities.  The book is probably about 50 or more pages longer than it needs to be.  There is a lot of filler, especially in the form of endorsements about the product, and some repetition as the authors explain the tool for so-called ""agile"" project management.  There are also a couple of instances where the explanations are not clear, as for example what the purpose is of ""blank squares"" in the OPPM. Nevertheless, the OPPM is a significant improvement over multiple page MS Project pages with numerous dependencies.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3OEEZYHPEAXAH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1118378377#wasThisHelpful","R3OEEZYHPEAXAH","A3F0OFSE2M25U2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3F0OFSE2M25U2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A fantastic study of all the issues and dilemmas that arose from Descartes' philosophy, particularly the notion that what we fundamentally know is that we think and therefore exist.  Chappell's work takes off from this launching point to explore questions like, if all we know is ourselves )the inescapable self), how can we know that others exits, why should we care about them (i.e. why should there be altruism), is there an objective morality that is possible?  Chappell covers these dilemmas with fair coverage of the major sides in each debate, giving full air time to sides with which he disagrees.  He uses analogies masterfully, helping the reader understand key concepts and nuances to arguments,  Chappell concludes the work with his conciliatory version of how the apparent contradictions in the dilemmas can be resolves.  His writing is also clear and often enough even humorous.  If you want to cover much of the ground that has been explored since Descartes' seminal works, this book takes you on a satisfying and enlightening journey.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1UKUWVXB1G1N2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=029784735X#wasThisHelpful","R1UKUWVXB1G1N2","A3F0OFSE2M25U2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3F0OFSE2M25U2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Overall this is a book worth reading for both the knowledge and the humor.  It was, however, at times rough going and I felt as if I was experiencing Jacob's challenge of reading through the encyclopedia but on an obviously much smaller scale.  I think it was just too much material, as there is chapter for each letter of the alphabet and, though there are enough fascinating bits of knowledge scattered throughout with the occasional laugh-out-loud Jacobian moments, they seemed for a long stretch to come too infrequently. The book soon became the one I read for a few minutes just before bed, or for a few minutes in the bathroom; in other words, it took a real long time to finish the book.  I managed to read the last 100 pages over a three-day weekend and I don't know if it was because the book got more interesting and funnier, or because I was basically stuck at home with nothing else to do (or maybe I kept going to bed and using the bathroom a lot).In any event, as I noted, there is a lot of fascinating information scattered throughout the book.  Stuck in my mind forever will be the fact that cilantro and coriander are the same thing (what about culantro?) and that Alaska is both the Western-most and Eastern-most state.  As happened to Jacobs, I will probably also forget most of the other information.  Jacobs is a humorist and he has plenty of very funny and laugh-out-loud funny comments and observations.  However, as I suggested above, during the first two-thirds of the book these seemed to come few and far between.  Also, he drops the f-bomb too often for my taste (and it is unnecessary).Here is my petty complaint about the book: as a backdrop to his effort to read the encyclopedia, Jacobs keeps us up-to-date on he and his wife's effort to have a baby.  Unfortunately, he kept using the phrase, ""We are trying to get pregnant.""  I have news for him: until he has an artificial womb inserted in him, and a willing accomplish to impregnate him, only his wife will succeed.  The other background story is his constant comparison to his father, an accomplished attorney who has written more than 20 law books and is a prankster.  This was okay although at times I was wondering if he could have spared us some of his public therapy sessions.  I forgive this because his father is a fellow graduate of Bronx Science.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3VJEW8PC6NMXC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0743250621#wasThisHelpful","R3VJEW8PC6NMXC","A3F0OFSE2M25U2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3F0OFSE2M25U2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Anyway, the grater is very lightweight, simple to use and easy to store.  Just put the cheese against the grating component, turn the handle and voila, nice, airy pieces of grated cheese.  The only downside is that the gadget is just a tad difficult to clean, as cheese remnants cling to the interior of the grater.

"As I read this book I had the persistent feeling that it could have been vastly improved if the author had taken his own advice.  Pinker has a chapter on the curse of knowledge and how not taking that into account results in inaccessible writing.  He then proceeds in succeeding chapters to use grammatical terms that I am sure many readers either don't know or have forgotten: the genitive, what is that?  These terms are scattered throughout and, ironically, slowed down my reading and my understanding.  I also had a hard time understanding his concept of a tree (versus the traditional sentence diagrams).  I understood it intuitively: writing has to hang together; the further words, phrases or thoughts that should be together are set apart, the more lack of understanding.  I get this conceptually but it is really hard to follow using the ""tree"" diagrams he provides. In a chapter that includes caution against the use of double negatives, Pinker's uses the phrase, ""making the negation unambiguous"".  How about ""making the negation clear""?  These criticisms are somewhat ironic since Pinker does the same to the work of other authors. (There is a hysterical account of grammar experts criticizing each other's texts on punctuation mistakes, each successive author capturing mistakes by the preceding author).Although I started with criticism, the book is actually good, motivating and helpful.  One piece of advice that I have already used to good effect, for example, is to put the old first and the new last.  I also understand better now how the passive voice can be helpful in certain circumstances. For those of us who want to improve our writing and ensure that our communications are effective, this book provides the necessary instruction.Here is something petty: of all the examples of text that Pinker could have provided from literature, he chose two examples from his wife's writing, not Hemingway or Sontag or Talese.  No, two examples were attributed to Rebecca Newberger Goldstein, philosopher/novelist and recipient of a McCarthur genius award.  I have read some of Goldstein's books and she is both a good philosopher and a good writer, but to select her writing and exclude so many from the pantheon of the immortals is pathetic.  Someone did not want to sleep on the couch.  One other thing:  Pinker uses his atheist (a/k/a humanist) buddy Richard Dawkins as another example of wonderful writing.  One humorous note: Dawkins endorses Pinker on the dust jacket.  Isn't there something unethical about that?","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2EBPE3NOP69OO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0670025852#wasThisHelpful","R2EBPE3NOP69OO","A3F0OFSE2M25U2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3F0OFSE2M25U2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Although this book offers provides a positive and even inspirational message about the benefits of continuous improvements, the techniques that it describes are just one of many possible approaches to continuous improvement.  One technique I was not familiar with is the ""six-legged spider"" chart, which is used for individuals to reflect on their performance, identify specific areas of improvement, identify problem areas, and identify new improvements and insights.  However, this specific tool is just one of many that could be used to this end.  The author also uses the traditional fish bone diagram to get staff to identify root causes.  The innovation here may be in requiring staff to then prioritize the areas of improvement focus.  Ahlstrom also provided a useful mnemonic to help use the fish bone.  One of the best parts of the book is the focus on cultural change, specifically the participation of staff at all levels to foster inclusion and ownership.  This is vital as improvement programs that are not authentically supported will be perceived as senior management manipulation.  In my opinion, establishing a change and innovation culture, where communication is open and staff can point out problems and offer improvement suggestions without fear of reprisal and with some confidence that recommendations will be seriously heard, is more important than the improvement process used.One of the things that was a bit confusing was that the writer of the foreword said that the book was written as a novel, but the text itself reads like actual events.  It leaves the reader wondering if what happened are actual events dramatized or if the events are completely fictional.In sum, this book provides one path of many that can be used to achieve continues improvement.  It's worth reading to identify which specific tools and approach might be best for your particular effort.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RT7S8J0SMXV12/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0071835237#wasThisHelpful","RT7S8J0SMXV12","A3F0OFSE2M25U2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3F0OFSE2M25U2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"One of the classic challenges that Catholics have is both understanding and appreciating the Mass.  For whatever reasons - poor catechesis, personal shortcomings, etc - too many Catholic do not understand and appreciate that the Mass is the sacramental recreation of Christ's sascrifice at Calvary; instead, many Catholics see the Mass as just another service or an obligation foisted on them by the Church.  What happens at Mass, as  Scott Hahn, has explained, happens eternally in heaven, as the Book of Revelation includes the Mass itself. At the Mass, bread and wine are consecrated to become the actual body and blood of Christ, in fulfillment of Christ's commandment to eat his body and drink his blood to have eternal life.  It's hard to understand, given what the Mass is, why so many Catholics complain that they ""do not get anyhting"" out of the Mass, or that it is boring.  How can being at the foot of the cross be boring?  How can receiving Our Savior in the form of bread and wine not give you all you can possibly get in this life?Father McGloin's book is an attempt to address the above malady in an informal and down-to-earth manner.  His audience is Catholics with these attitudes and misunderstandings.  He educates the reader by taking each segment of the Mass - the opening prayer, etc - and explaining its role in the Mass.  Father McGloin speaks to the common man with mundane examples and analogies to reach the reader.  There are no profound theological expositions, only streetwise remarks.  He alludes often to the typical distractions that Mass attendees face, such as thinking about the afternoon ballgame, judging the quality of the homily, rushing out of Mass, etc.  This is particularly important because it shows that Fr. McGloin knows what he is talking about.  For each of these maladies, Fr. McGloin provides both understanding of its occurrence and ways to counter them.  For any reader, it would be a comfort to know that it is not just you that suffers from these distractions and thoughts.  On one or two occasions, becuase Father is attempting to reach is audience where they are, he stoops a bit too low and gets too close to expressing his corrective examples in tones that can sound offensive.  Other than that, it would be helpful if the book were republished and marketed to today's Catholics, as the problems and misunderstandings described in the book continue to exist forty years after the publication of this book.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3KHE75QGN5VRP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0892430117#wasThisHelpful","R3KHE75QGN5VRP","A3F0OFSE2M25U2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3F0OFSE2M25U2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I do not understand why other reviewers are so positive about this book.  It is a collection of kumbaya-type essays about what a wonderful world this would be if only we could all be more creative.  There is constant reference to the imminent demise of existence, mostly driven by the abuse of the environment.  It's as if a bunch of hippies with PhD's got together and smoked one too many joints. Contributors include a former TV sitcom writer who believes that television watching can be a creative act and that tv episodes can be used effectively for psychotherapy (and dubs this teletherapy).  I have a nominee for the first client.  There is a lot of passing reference to everyday creativity, with the occasional praise of things like making recipes and arranging schedules, but nothing as to how this can practically come about.  There is a lot more substantive discussion about so-called eminent creativity or the geniuses in the field, but with a lot of very loose thinking about how this comes about.  The terms chaos theory and fractals are bandied about as if they obviously apply to the creative process. I was sad to see the renowned psychologist Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi attach his name to this ""publish-or-die"" endeavor, but he did warn the prospective reader quite diplomatically about the content.  To give you a sense of the type of writing that you can beat yourself with, the phrase ""ontogony recapitulates phylogeny"" is included.

"This book is written for young adults and covers ""contemporary"" philosophy from Bentham and Mill to Sartre and Camus.  The author begins with Bentham and explains how the industrial revolution began turning philosophical interests away from metaphysics and epistemology to more mundane concerns such as the happiness of individuals, which was the concern of the utilitarians' philosophical enterprise. After the utilitarians the author covers Kierkegaard and Nietzsche, specifically their intense focus on the individual; the Pragmatists James and Dewey, describing their similarities and differences; Process Philosophy, covering Bergson and Whitehead; Analytic Philosophy; Phenomenology (Husserl and Heidegger); and, finally Existentialism, including the thought of Sarte, de Beauvoir and Camus.  For each philosopher author Price provides a brief biographical sketch as well as some description of the contemporary culture or pressing social issues.  She does an excellent job of covering the main topics.  (This is not her fault, but I have yet to find a writer who can explain Heidegger.)  I am not so sure that the reading level is at times appropriate for the intended audience, perhaps only for more gifted high school upper classmen.

"This book, being a philosophical discourse on happiness, does not give a definitive answer as to what happiness is or how one can achieve.  Haybron covers the different approaches to identifying and measuring happiness, including well-being and life satisfaction.  These tools, however, are  limited, not only by the slippery subject of happiness but also by respondents' apparent tendency to rate their happiness level high whenever they are asked, as if providing a lower rating would be embarrassing or shaming.  Hayborn lists three major factors that he believes can construct a happy life: Endorsement (feeling happy and other ""classic"" emotions; Engagement (vitality and flow); and, Attunement (peace of mind, confidence, expansiveness).  For the most part, I think these categories work and Hayborn explores how they can be attained.  The one item that seems to have been covered ad nauseum is the effect of money on happiness - it is good up to a certain point ($70,000 in the US) and then goes flat.  The hedonic treadmill is also discussed, where individuals seem to return to a set point of happiness after a change in circumstances, new experiences or material possessions.  Meaning is also explored, and how while other things may appear counter to a happy outlook, a meaningful job, for example, could overall result in someone having a happy life (or having the subjective perspective that your job is meaningful).  The bottom line, I think, is that happiness is something that we experience in spurts and intermittently, simply because that's how life is, but we can always step back and see that, in the big picture, our lives are not all that bad or that they could be far worse or that there is something to be learned from tough times, and so we can rate our overall well being highly.  This book does a great job of covering all the different angles from which happiness can be studied in a short volume.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2730SLZY5KZ1Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0199590605#wasThisHelpful","R2730SLZY5KZ1Z","A3F0OFSE2M25U2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3F0OFSE2M25U2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a terrific achievement in making philosophy accessible to the layperson.  Adamson writes in plain language and takes the reader playfully throughout this first of many promised volumes.  He interjects humor occasionally to add to the pleasure of the ride.  Because, as promised, this is philosophy ""without the gaps"", Adamson covers philosophers and topics that would otherwise be passed over or discussed only superficially.  For example, Adamson includes discussions of Anaximander, Anaximenes and Parmenides when covering the pre-Socratics.  Each chapter gives enough information to get significantly familiar with the philosophers and their teachings without overwhelming the reader. Nuances and controversies are sometimes introduced but not expounded on because of the limitations of this kind of effort, but enough is provided to encourage further study.  The ""without the gaps"" approach is also reflected in Adamson's coverage of Plato.  Usually Plato in a philosophical overview is limited to some of his major thesis, like his theory of Forms and his theory of justice, with discussion of the Republic and the Symposium.  Here, Adamson instead provides one chapter for each of Plato's major works (two for the Republic ).  Again, Adamson does this in such a way as to not intimidate the reader, carefully connecting the works together where appropriate.  I cannot say enough about this book.  If Adamson can maintain the same quality and controlled depth throughout the rest of his anticipated series, he will have done a great service to the task of making philosophy accessible to the general public.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2OL4DTCRFK4X5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0199674531#wasThisHelpful","R2OL4DTCRFK4X5","A3F0OFSE2M25U2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3F0OFSE2M25U2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The point of this book is that we often don't solve problems because we approach them the wrong way.  We tend to get overwhelmed by them because we try to take them on head on, on their own terms.  This sounds somewhat vague.  Also, how to not take problems on their own term seems impractical.  Niven provides a few examples: When the mechanical shark that Steven Spielberg was using for the movie Jaws did not work properly, instead of spending time and money on fixing it, he mostly kept it out of the movie.  The physical absence but mental presence of the shark is what created the terror in Jaws and made it the greatest revenue maker.  The book concludes with an example of a train company in Japan that could not figure out how to solve a problem of water in a tunnel that they had to dig through a  mountain.  A person who was not an engineer tasted the water - it was great - and the train company created a successful bottled water subsidiary.  There are other examples like these, as well as advise on how to have the right mindset, that suggest the reader look at problems from a different angle.  One may be surprised at how solutions come, or in what other direction one is taken.One issues:  I think Niven takes too many liberties in re-interpreting one of the classic human behavior experiments, specifically the Milgram experiment where participants continued to give increasing levels of shock to another person.  Niven reinterprets this behavior as ""obedience to a problem"" instead of ""obedience to authority"".  He does not really support this; it just fits the theme of his book.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R29IKG4F4R6YBX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250042038#wasThisHelpful","R29IKG4F4R6YBX","A3F0OFSE2M25U2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3F0OFSE2M25U2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This book is a superb guide that teaches the reader how to prepare successful presentations.  Practicing what it preaches, Roam uses his steps throughout the book, showing the reader how to create presentations using the six ways that people visualize situations.  He convinces the reader that a story needs to be told and uses his PUMA, or Presentation's Underlying Message Architecture, approach to show how to tell one.  Roam is an advocate for using pictures instead of words, a case which he made strongly in one of his previous books, as this is how people think and remember most of the time.  To achieve this goal in a presentation he advocates showing - using pictures, graphics or drawings - and telling - speaking off the presentation slide.  i totally agree with him as i have difficulty following my own presentations when they abound in text.  He also repeats here the six ways of presenting information  -who/what, where, when, how much, how and why - and the visuals that correspond to each.

"An excellent and comprehensive survey of how happiness has been viewed throughout the history of Western civilization.  Beginning with the Greeks submission to fate at the hands of the Gods, where happiness was something that was not up to individuals, all the way up to the present day's obsession with achieving a guaranteed happiness, Darrin McMahon show the reader how perceptions of happiness have changed over time, usually as a response to historical, cultural or societal realities.  For example, the Stoic approach to happiness developed in response to the reality of a declining Roman empire where individuals were at the mercy of tyrants, natural disasters or invading forces.  During Christendom, people sought happiness in the after-life, as their daily routing could guarantee only the barest of subsistence living.  The Enlightenment changed the focus, as men of learning and science sought to wrest the fate of the common man from religious authority and place it back with the individual.  The industrial revolution, which opened the possibility of material luxury, also opened the door for seeking happiness in material accumulations and entertainment.

"Hegel is a tough read no matter who writes about him.  In this short work Raymond Plant attempts to capture the essence of Hegel's philosophy of religion.  He does a fairly good job in tying together the different strands to form a coherent picture of Hegel's thought, which is always a challenge.  What I got from the book is that Hegel is trying to somehow reunite man and the rest of the world, including God, so that man is not somehow alienated from them.  This will be accomplished when man achieves Absolute Knowledge, or the innate understanding of the inter-relatedness of all reality.  Hegel's philosophy is meant to transcend theology, at the same time elevating the latter to a universal level so that the particulars of religion are not restricted to a specific time or people.  In many respects, Hegel's thought on the matter is a re-interpretation or re-casting of the meaning of the Holy Trinity.  Again, a lot of what is included requires careful reading and will also require rereading to being to grasp Hegel's thinking.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R32GFID7KS36JA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0415923824#wasThisHelpful","R32GFID7KS36JA","A3F0OFSE2M25U2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3F0OFSE2M25U2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Bruce Nussbaum makes the case the creativity is the key skill that will drive economic growth.  The question is: how does creativity come about.  Nussbaum identified five factors that need to be present so that creativity can take place and innovation can occur: 1) knowledge mining - a depth of enough knowledge in a specific discipline or across discipline to have the raw materials to make new connections; 2) framing - the ability to see a position from different perspectives, rethink it and imagine new future scenarios; 3) playing - the act of arriving at solutions not through problem solving but through imagining, engaging in competition and playing around in an open manner with tactile things or concepts; 4) making - the physical act of taking an idea and turning it into reality; and 5) pivoting - the process of taking something from an initial idea to a creation that is purchased.  Nussbaum goes into detail on how each of these competencies is expressed, some with their own subcompetencies.  For example, he claims that pivoting includes charisma, which can be the passion expressed by the creator.For the most part, I found the book motivational and inspiring, as I found myself thinking of new ideas as I read, ways of implementing them, and jotting down the good number of resources provided by the author.  Oddly, I found some of his examples unconvincing although they did not necessarily take away from the main claim (Horatio Sanz as an example of creative success?  He was possibly the worst cast member of SNL ever.)  Like other books on creativity, this one also struggled with the core question of how exactly it's achieved.  From the vast reading that i have done on this subject, I am not sure that this one has found the magic formula. I still think the closest, most accurate attempt is Gary Klein's Seeing What Others Don't, which is more of a hindsight review that a how-to.The book also includes an incisive criticism of the financial economy that is driven by shareholder gains and short-term profits, and how this has hurt the masses to the benefit of the few,  This discussion is one of the clearest ones I have found on the source and consequences of this economic shell game.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2PO3A888ZSQDE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062088424#wasThisHelpful","R2PO3A888ZSQDE","A3F0OFSE2M25U2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3F0OFSE2M25U2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book claims to have finally definitively identified with DNA testing and other scientific techniques who Jack the Ripper was.  The author is Russell Edwards, a British entrepreneur who developed, like many others, a fascination with the case. The missing link which he uses to identify Jack the Ripper is a shawl that was allegedly recovered at the scene of Catherine Eddowes' murder.  Through an almost unbelievable number of coincidences and lucky turns of events, Edwards follows a winding trail that includes getting DNA from one of Eddowes' descendants; with the help of his scientist sidekick finding the Ripper's DNA on the shawl, and then matching the two up and - voila! - Jack the Ripper was Aaron Kosminski, one of the original suspects who ended up dying in an insane asylum.  The book covers the usual ground for this case: the crimes and their victims; the culture and history of the time; police procedures and such.  Edwards also discusses at some length some of the other plausible suspects and explains why each would be unlikely to be the actual candidate.The theory hangs on the accuracy and validity of the DNA testing, all of which seems tenuous given the age of the material involved.  As a non-scientist, I found the detailed explanations of the DNA evidence hard to follow but seemed to make sense at a high-level.  I leave that for scientific minds to sort out.  What to me seems to lack explanation is the meaning of the shawl.  Edwards makes the case that it did not belong to the victim but rather to the Ripper.  He supposedly was using the shawl, which included what was known as a ""Michaelmas"" pattern, to signal the dates of his murders, as they coincided with various dates for Michaelmas, the Christian feast in some Orthodox churches that honor St. Michael.  According to Edwards, the crimes occurred on these dates of observance.  This somewhat complex messaging system, however, does not mesh with the character decryption that was derived for Kosminski, who apparently was a schizophrenic who was becoming progressively more mentally ill.  It seems a stretch to think that someone losing their mental faculties could create a complex scenario using a shawl to send a cryptic message.  Perhaps that's why the story is not elaborated on further by Edwards.  In actuality, that tale does not matter so long as the DNA work is accurate and valid.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1YMTJ3O2BREK1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1493011901#wasThisHelpful","R1YMTJ3O2BREK1","A3F0OFSE2M25U2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3F0OFSE2M25U2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Hegel is one of the toughest philosophers to understand.  He wrapped difficult and innovative concepts in sometimes incomprehensible prose.  As a layperson, I feel good reading in this book that other philosophers found him obtuse.  In this shirt book, Peter Singer, more famous for his book on animal rights, captures the essence of Hegel's thought and packages it in a way that the lay reader can grasp.  He begins his coverage of Hegel's philosophy with Hegel's belief that ""the history of the world is the progress of the consciousness of freedom.'' Singer explains that for Hegel, freedom was not ""negative""; i.e. the ability to do whatever you wanted; rather true freedom was the individual's ability to act from reason uninfluenced by culture, habit or any other external forces.  Over time, history has been progressing toward this Hegelian ideal, with the mind coming to understand itself evermore as the creator of reality.  Singer also discusses how Hegel came to influence other major thinkers, including Feuerbach and Marx, the latter taking Hegel's concepts and constituting them to develop his philosophy of history that would germinate into his ideal of communism.  Singer also points out that Hegel's work was often in direct response to Kant's philosophy, particularly to the idea that there is an unknowable world, made so by the fact that the mind's instruments of knowledge cannot capture it.  For those readers interested in an introduction to Hegel that will not intimidate them, this is an excellent work.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R38L37FOVL9335/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=019280197X#wasThisHelpful","R38L37FOVL9335","A3F0OFSE2M25U2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3F0OFSE2M25U2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Goldstein is a philosopher and a novelist (and good at both).  In this work she combines both talents to give us a sense of how Plato would today deal with many of the philosophical issues he raised more than 2,000 years ago, in a weird way making himself a footnote to his own work, as supposedly all philosophy since him is.  Goldstein begins with Plato making a stop at Googleplex on a book tour.  He sits to chat with his handler and a Google nerd and they discuss philosophical topics like the difference between information and knowledge, the role of experts in determining what is good, and other similar topics.  This is a very clever and effective way to cover the topics that Plato discussed in his original works, mostly through the voice of Socrates.  That chapter is followed by one where Goldstein reverts to a more traditional format where she discusses Plato's views.  This format is actually a welcome respite from the fictional set ups because they can be a bit long and lead the reader to start thinking more about Goldstein's skills as a fiction writer rather than the topic at hand.  Plato is also placed at the 92nd Street Y (a very New York City-centric chapter),  at a call in talk show and at an MRI facility.  At the Y the topic is mostly child-rearing, at the call in show it's mostly influence and values, and at the MRI facility the mind-body problem.  Again, Goldstein uses her deft novelist skills and her profound philosophical knowledge to create a work that is entertaining, educational and provocative.  Even the footnotes, which are quite lengthy at times, are engaging.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1NBK1XKZ813VA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0307378195#wasThisHelpful","R1NBK1XKZ813VA","A3F0OFSE2M25U2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3F0OFSE2M25U2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The author makes a good case that having low confidence and low self-esteem is can actually be beneficial.  Why?  For two reasons: first, those whose confidence is higher than their competence are perceived negativeness by others.  Secondly, thinking that you are better than you actually are prevents you from making improvements.  Combined, these two effects of overconfidence are a recipe for failure.  In contrast, someone with low confidence will seek ways to improve their competence, thereby improving their competence and, as a by-product, also raising their confidence to match their competence.  The author shows how overconfidence can be a problem in business, personal relationships and health. He also very clearly exposes the lie that has been bandied about by the self-help industry that someone with confidence can accomplish whatever they want.  The opposite seems to be the case.For the most part, his claims and evidence are convincing.  I do have some problems, however, with pieces of the presentation.  First, the author suggests that reputation is a better gauge of where someone stands than character because character is internal and therefore subject to numerous self-biases and reputation is external and more validly objective.  This may be so; however, his recommendation to then be very conscious of what others think about you can be very unsettling to people who suffer from social anxiety.  if anything, they are working to decrease the amount of thought they give to what others think about them.  I get the authors point, but it seems to fly in the face of what other therapies, particularly cognitive behavioral therapy, recommend for people with social anxiety.  Also, in the social relations section, he actually encourages people to lie on their first date about their interests and accomplishment because the date will not remember the specifics but will instead remember broad generalities about the person and thereby leave with a better impression.  It seems to me to begin a relationship of any sort with deliberate lying is to start off on a very wrong foot.  My final rebuke is that it is sometimes hard to follow the train of thought because the author also encourages faking confidence in certain situations.  This advice seems inconsistent with the main claim that overconfidence is bad.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R34SNZVZPFKA8J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1594631263#wasThisHelpful","R34SNZVZPFKA8J","A3F0OFSE2M25U2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3F0OFSE2M25U2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a somewhat odd mini-introduction to Locke's epistemology.  About half the 58 page book are direct quotes from Locke's works and the other half commentary by the author.  One would have liked to see a better division that provided less of Locke and more of Ayers, as these introductory types of books are more valuable when the author provides more insight and direction into the philosopher's work and whets the reader's appetite by providing some key quotes.  Locke's material in this body of his work, as opposed to his work on political philosophy, is much more difficult, which is another reason why Ayers should have spent more time clarifying.  My concern is that a book like this might do more to turn off potential Locke readers than to excite them to read more of Locke.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3BMHIF3UQ6MMG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0415923832#wasThisHelpful","R3BMHIF3UQ6MMG","A3F0OFSE2M25U2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3F0OFSE2M25U2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This book covers all the different ways in which humans do things unwittingly, sometimes to their own detriment.  There are 17 chapters, each covering one of these ""maladies"".  For example, there is the ""post hoc"", or the fallacy that we attribute cause to something because it precedes something else.  At best, this is faulty reasoning; at worst, it is superstition, like wearing your old, dirty underwear at every final because after you wore it the first time you aced the test. (Personally, I wear old, dirty underwear just because I like it).  There is the No True Scotsman fallacy, where when someone from your group does something that puts your group in a bad light, unless you can somehow write them off as not really part of your group.  This happens a lot with Yankee fans who use the term ""True Yankee"".  In their world, A-Rod is not a ""True Yankee"" so therefore his arrogance and steroid use cannot be ascribed to Yankees (never mind the fact that he is under contract to them and wears their uniform).  One of the more interesting phenomenon that I read was the Backfire Effect, where trying to convince someone with facts and figures only makes them feel stronger about their original positions and does not change their mind.  You see this all the time on the internet when people debate over abortion, gay rights or who the best rock-and-rill drummer was (it was not Ringo Starr, by the way).  Each of these ways in which people either work against themselves or does so unknowingly is fascinating.  Being aware that these modes of thinking exist is the first step towards guarding against them or even reversing them.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RO0GJ3JDZS47F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1592408052#wasThisHelpful","RO0GJ3JDZS47F","A3F0OFSE2M25U2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3F0OFSE2M25U2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Matthew Stewart, philosopher turned management consultant and reverted back to philosopher, writes a convincing book that the core of America's founding fathers were not Christians but rather atheistic ""deists"".  Stewart traces Jefferson, Franklin and others' beliefs to Epicureanism which was revived by Lucretius and others, particularly Locke and Spinoza.  The core belief of deists centers around what Stewart calls the ""guiding principle"" of philosophy, or that every phenomenon requires an explanation and that nothing is based on faith.  For deists God is Nature, or how nature expresses itself in experience, particularly through each living thing's efforts to survive and grow.  The goal of each individual is to achieve understanding via reason.  Deist piety thus is centered on an appreciation of these relationships and interactions between reason, nature and man - together they are held in high esteem and give the (false) impression that deists have the same piety as devout Christians.Stewart covers a lot of ground, including how the deist outlook sought not just liberty from political tyranny but also from what they  perceived to be mental tyranny at the hands of existing churches.  It was their belief that man was better off without religion and instead replacing that with an improvement of the understanding, which would ultimately show that a deist mindset would result in moral living.  Stewart offers numerous quotes from the founding fathers that clearly show that they were not Christian believers but were rightly considered heretics by their contemporaries.  In Stewart's account, men like Ethan Allen and Thomas Young jump to the fore, as they were key in pushing the deist agenda.  Stewart also traces the history of the movement from Epicurus to the present day, ending with secular humanism and covering a lot of ground discussing Locke and Spinoza.My criticism of Stewart is that he is clearly on the side of the founding deists and on the side of today's secularists.  What at first read like sarcasm to emphasize the revolutionary deists point of view is actually Stewart's own voice.  He seems to hold religion and believers in as much disdain as did the deists.  That's ok if the point the book were to express his opinion, but the book is sold as a philosophical history of specific founding father's views, not as Matthew Stewart's beliefs.  Perhaps he wants to replace Christopher Hitchens as the fourth horseman of the atheist apocalypse.  Besides, I do not agree with his thesis that secularism is best.  There is no easy answer. History has shown that humanity is capable of horrendous atrocities under theocracies and under atheistic governments.  To suggest that the latter is benevolent is a case of rank ignorance.What the book definitely accomplishes is that it pulls the rug out from under the feet of current Christians who claim that the founding fathers were devout believers.  The fact is that some were and some were not.  However, they did work together to achieve what, until now, has been the most successful form of government.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2VWDTRL3EFD1E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0393064549#wasThisHelpful","R2VWDTRL3EFD1E","A3F0OFSE2M25U2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3F0OFSE2M25U2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book aims to introduce the reader to some of the basic questions of philosophy: how do we know what we know?  what makes something right or wrong? is there life after death?  why do the Mets suck? (The last one is not actually covered, but as a Mets fan I think it should be).  Thomas Nagle engages the reader by asking some of the sub-questions around these fundamental questions: why should someone care if something they do is wrong if they can get away with it?  If there is life after death, what is it like?  how are causes involved in free will?  Why does every superstar free agent the Mets signs end up stinking?  (Again, that last one was not actually covered but should have been).  Although Nagel says he leaves the questions open and does not provide final answers, on some questions he lets us know very clearly what his positions are: he does not believe in an after life, for example.  Nevertheless, his questioning, prodding and provoking approach achieves its goal: it stimulates the reader to consider the questions in more depth and possibly to reassess his or her view (without ever once naming a specific philosopher).

"This book is a great resource filled with powerful yet easy to apply and inexpensive techniques.  The authorial trio collaborated on another popular book.  One of the authors is Robert Cialdini, the writer of Influence, the seminal work in this field.  There are over 50 short chapters, each explaining an inexpensive but powerful influence technique.  The authors open each chapter with a question or scenario, and then explain how a particular technique can be used to great leverage.  For example,  although it common wisdom to not be the first to make an offer during a negotiation, the authors demonstrate that doing so puts you at an advantage because you create an anchor from which the other party must begin.  You can set this anchor to your advantage.  Another technique is having patients write down their next appointment time themselves; this dramatically drops the no-show rate.For each technique, the authors describe the experiments behind it.  This is actually the one area where I am a bit skeptical, as it appears that a good number of the techniques are based on one or a few studies, with the usual participants being college students subject to the possible WEIRD (Western Educated Industrial Rich Democratic) bias.  However, a good number of the techniques are also based on well-established cognitive science.This is a great book for anyone who wants to get an ethical advantage without a heavy investment.  I wish there were a way to capture all these techniques in some sort of sheet cheat (or app), where you could select your situation (negotiation, sales, etc) and then pick from a menu of techniques.  I know that I will probably forget most of them to my own detriment.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3E6O9YI9LG5FG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1455584258#wasThisHelpful","R3E6O9YI9LG5FG","A3F0OFSE2M25U2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3F0OFSE2M25U2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Roger Scruton is slowly but surely becoming one of my favorite ""popularizers"" of philosophy.  His writing is clear even for the most difficult of topics.  At the same time, he does not talk down to the lay reader; if anything, he elevates the lay reader by inviting him up to the loftier levels of philosophical thinking through his engaging and accessible prose.  In this book, Scruton's aim was to act as a guide to the reader in how to approach philosophical questions by treading on the usual ground covered by introductions to philosophy - God, knowledge, science, morals, etc.  Scruton's goal, however, as not to spoon feed the reader the usual list of beliefs, arguments and counterarguments for each issue, but to prod the reader along by asking more questions than giving answers.  For the most part, I think Scruton is true to this goal.  On occasion he does take strong positions one way or the other, rather than leaving it up to the reader to come to their own conclusions.  This he clearly does in his discussion of sex, where he stands firmly on the side of traditional sexual morality.  Overall, though, he sticks to his plan and allows the reader, through the raising of well known arguments and counterarguments, to chew on the ideas and digest them with the notion of the reader arriving at his or her own conclusions.  I was particularly touched by Scruton's explanation of why we need God and why reduction of man to mere biology emasculates humanity from itself.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R6CJR7CEBMAZ1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0826494455#wasThisHelpful","R6CJR7CEBMAZ1","A3F0OFSE2M25U2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3F0OFSE2M25U2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"An excellent study and presentation by an eminent Stoic scholar.  Professor Sandbach, who passed away in 1991, provides a clear and accessible study of Stoic philosophy.  He covers the cultural milieu as well as specific Stoic teaching on ethics, logic and cosmology.  One has to be amazed at how much Sandbach knew about the Stoics, as with each topic and Stoic he covers, he includes criticisms of other Stoics, inconsistencies within the specific Stoic's teachings as well as multiple interpretations of the Stoic's perspective.  The impression given is that early Stoicism was in no way monolithic and went through its own growing pains as it addressed and responded to both specific day-to-day requirements of a lived philosophy and longer term metaphysical issues.  Sandbach includes the usual Stoic cast - Zeno, Chrysippus, Epictetus and Marcus Aurelius - but also goes beyond and introduces the reader to lesser known Stoic lights, like Posidonius and Hierocles.  Sandbach is not in agreement with some Stoic philosophy and makes sure to let the reader know when that is the case.

"This book makes the case that happiness is something you can achieve by becoming more conscious of what actually contributes to it and how.  Specifically, Dolan says that day-to-day happiness is composed of pleasure and purpose - you don't want to just feel good, you also want to feel that you are doing good.  With this mindset, you can tolerate short term burdens if you know that they are being suffered for a purpose.  At the same time, pleasure must be included in the equation as it is necessary to feel happy.  Dolan covers many of the ways that we obstruct our own happiness, usually unintentionally, because we are not aware of how our mind works.  For example, we think we are going to be happy from getting things but that usually wears off quickly; at the same time, we do not give enough credit to the happiness of experiences, so we don't value them as much.  So, we focus on accumulation rather than participation, to our own detriment.  This and other examples are gathered from the burgeoning field of neuro- and behavioral economics (Daniel Kahnenam is Dolan's friend and mentor).  Dolan proposes a three point plan - Decide, Design and Do, for each area where you feel you can achieve more happiness.  For example  if you want to improve your health, you can ""Decide"" to go the gym; ""Design"" by committing to do so with a gym buddy; and ""Do"" by actually going to the gym.  The Design part is the one that I was most looking forward to.  However, I actually found the few recommendations here somewhat weak and mundane.  Also, the recommendations and exactly how to implement them either do not jump out at you or are somewhat unrealistic.  For example, who you hang out with has a great deal to do with your own attitude and happiness.  However, most of those we ""hang out: with tends to be determine by our family members, our work colleagues and the neighborhoods we live in.  There is limited room to design who you hang out with by selecting the individuals who make up these groups.  I think a companion dose of Stoic practices would go well with those prescribed by Dolan.  Though you can plan and design your happiness, life is right now rearing back its arm to throw you a curve ball.  Better to also be prepared for that than to hope that life will only throw you a meatball, 65 mile per hour fastballs.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R15G84ZFYMC9Z2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=159463243X#wasThisHelpful","R15G84ZFYMC9Z2","A3F0OFSE2M25U2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3F0OFSE2M25U2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I often enjoy reading books about books because the authors will share experiences and put into words things that I feel but can't express. This is for the most part the case with this book.  However, the author took a chance by commenting on books that she selected somewhat at random from a shelf at the New York Society Library (which, by the way, is the best takeaway for me from this book, since I live in New York and was unaware of this amazing resource).  Because of that, the quality of books she read and reviewed varied greatly.  However, there were some good finds, like A Hero of Our Time by MIkhail Lermontov and books by Rhoda Lerman.  it's always refreshing and humbling to read books about books by authors, Rose having written a number of books herself.  Inevitably these types of books are very personal and subjective experiences, and one sometimes identifies with the perspective shared and sometimes one is jolted by it, but that is to be expected.  For example, one of the books she read was The Phantom of the Opera by Gaston Leroux.  This is the book on which the Broadway musical is based.  I and others have found ""Phantom"" (and I hate the single name reference) not that big a deal: it has high moments and quite a few stretches of absolute boredom.  You can go to any production and find a few people asleep.  I am now more interested in reading the book or watching the silent movie with Lon Chaney.  I agree with her characterization of detective novels.  They are mostly entertainment and not literature, although they can, depending on the author's focus, be educational as well.  I found her complaints about the way women writers are treated both valid but somewhat overdone.  Can some of them really complain that they are treated as Chick Lit if their subway ads sell them as the author of summer reading?  I am sure the author's arm wasn't twisted.  Some of the books listed I may pursue on my own, like Gil Blas, for example.  What I will definitely do is take a trip to the New York Society Library.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R39235QNSMBQJE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0374261202#wasThisHelpful","R39235QNSMBQJE","A3F0OFSE2M25U2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3F0OFSE2M25U2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is USA made, with cane sugar and brown rice syrup.  Just got mine in and tried it.  Taste is excellent, but sadly it goes away within a couple minutes and that's not really surprising when you're talking about real sugar gum so, it's disappointing but, to be expected.  I've been chewing Spry for years and bottom line, it's much better (and no i don't work for Spry, lol).  The actual gum base for Spry is a more natural/typical gum whereas the Tree Hugger is fine, but a bit softer/stickier.  And the taste and sweetness (mostly taste) in spry lasts a lot longer.  Admittedly, that's when comparing the Spry peppermint to Tree Huggers flavors and a mint is always going to maintain it's taste longer than a bubble gum, fruit gum, etc.  I think the Tree Huggers is probably better for kids but, they will go through a lot of it so be prepared to see your kids blasting through 30 balls a day!","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1T2P84MWK0OIZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BI77UM0#wasThisHelpful","R1T2P84MWK0OIZ","AP5LXBV3T0JR7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AP5LXBV3T0JR7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Our office cat is currently being rushed to an animal ER because, despite my clear and urgent warnings against, my brother put some poison behind his desk, and the office cat crawled in there somehow and got to it and lapped it up, luckily i caught her doing it and, like i said, she's enroute to the ER.

"I replaced lenses for SpyOptic, Logan, K61, and my frames say ""Made in Italy"" though i noticed that the ones on line are made in China.  I only bought these glasses 6 months ago, tops so anyway, whatever.  My glasses cost $100, and i don't recall if they are polarized or not.  The China ones with non-polarized lenses are $41 on Amazon.These replacement lenses, which cost about $40, are extremely thin and also are darker than the lenses that came with my Logans.  I cannot possibly imagine that they have the same impact resistance as the lenses they replace, which are almost twice as thick.  Part of the problem is that the sockets on the frame were designed for that fatter lens, so these new, ultra thing lenses ""rattle"" around inside the socket.  Not while they are on your head, thank goodness, but while you take them on and off, they kinda rattle.Bottom line, the only reason i got these was because they say/claim they are polarized (which i will be able to find out more on when i take a boat trip next week but until then, i have no real way of knowing).  If you don't need polarized lenses for skiing or water sports, then you're obviously much better off just buying a new pair of glasses for $41.  I almost did, but, the polarized part was important for me but if you're not using these for water/snow sports then it really shouldn't be an issue and non polarized should be fine for you.If these lenses were $19, i would have given it 4 stars.  Maybe I am out of line for saying so, since i don't ""truly"" know what it costs to produce a plastic, polarized lens, but $40 seems like a hell of a lot of $.  maybe i am wrong.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R244054V0F9MFF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N5AE85A#wasThisHelpful","R244054V0F9MFF","AP5LXBV3T0JR7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AP5LXBV3T0JR7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

These are not polarized for ""reflected"" light, which is no biggie if you're not skiing or on the water, and i use them for driving.  The lenses are very good, no distortion.

"I always start any sci-fi review by saying, i read a lot of sci-fi (30 sci-fi books a year maybe) and I am probably ""picky.""  I think most of it (90%) is trash or, at best, suitable for young readers who would otherwise read comic books.  Now that we've got that out of the way, I loved this book and am so happy to have found Alan Black. The book is clever, at times laugh out loud funny (really, and i can't remember the last book that made me laugh out loud and this book did, 4 times). It's believable, the science is fine - no glaring ""how in the hell did that happen"" moments apart from one (later) and he seems to have a good understanding of how the military works which always makes me enjoy such books better. Few writers can capture the tiny, subtle details of military life, AND put it into prose, unless they've been there as Alan no doubt has. I usually give a list of sci fi writers i like, but I don't think i could compare this book to anything else i've read.  Alan claims he hates editing (boy, i understand, i do) but the editing in this book is pretty good - i don't recall getting yanked out of the story over and over from annoying mistakes.The only negative is that toward the end, i think the book got away from Alan a little bit and it is hard to pinpoint what it is exactly, but it seemed like maybe he rushed it a little(?)  And, in the middle of this he made one big mistake:  in the middle of space, 24 people jumped into fiberglass gliders, blew themselves out airlocks (and I never could figure why exactly that aspect was necessary) with no more guidance than being shot out the door, they glided over to, and somehow landed on another space craft.  In space.  Erm, that's improbable, i'd argue - not even possible.  He noted that the ""wings"" of the gliders were deployed, and then retracted just prior to landing.  Alan, you were in the Air Force sir, and certainly you know there is no atmosphere in space so a) why would they deploy any wings at all, and b) how in the world could they get a perfect vector/velocity to land from one (moving) space craft to another (not moving) without thrust or atmosphere?  Even with thrusters, on such a simple tube shaped craft it would take a computer or the best space pilots in all of history and certainly more than the distance you allowed between the two aircraft to perform the maneuver (100s of meters, not 1000s).  Anyway, I am not saying this to complain about you Alan, i LOVED the book and one error such as this does not make a bad book!  And, better it happened at the end, than at the beginning, i say, and the book is still overall truly fantastic, clever, funny writing (your characters are great).  If you can simply discard that one operation as an error (and, there were many plausible ways the maneuver could have happened, so it doesn't wreck the story), you will like this book from cover to cover.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2886J660DI9A6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TOMJTAM#wasThisHelpful","R2886J660DI9A6","AP5LXBV3T0JR7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AP5LXBV3T0JR7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"what a shame, I was really looking forward to this book series but I probably should have read some of the negative reviews first because they are spot on. I read a couple hundred pages and pretty well got the gist of it. I started noticing that the writing was plane and simple, somewhat childlike and at first it didn't bother me I thought maybe it's just me, but the writing style didn't change and as the various different scenarios involving engineering, science, or technology started to play out I started realizing that they really had no idea how any of this was happening, so much so that I don't think they even realize that most of the things they were describing as really taking place were physically impossible. I'll just use one example, in the asteroid they construct a 25 by 60 foot tunnel one mile long and build a thousand two bedroom apartments complete with small kitchens and bathrooms in it in a matter of a few months. I'm a contractor and I don't care if it's 2015 for 2515 you don't just build a one mile tunnel through rock and drop a thousand apartments in a few months, it's impossible.and that's just one of countless examples.

"I'm not sure that's scifi is this authors strong suit. If you're a science fiction geek like me and very much enjoy the science and details thereof I don't think you'll like this book. There are some in consistency is and scientific aspects what are inaccurate. For example during a ground assault laser beams for being fired by the alien enemy which blast apart rocks but lasers don't do that. Lasers don't impart force, all they really do is heat up the object and any high school science class knows this and this datum extends up to and including weapons-grade lasers it doesn't really matter how powerful they are the objective is still the same it would just burn a hole through the rock not splatter it all over the place and this is just an example I'm not going to sit here and pick apart the entire book but you get the idea and for me these kinds of things are critical to the story and whether or not I will be sort of interested or extremely interested. it wouldn't be so bad if this were the only negative, but also felt that the author did not have a sense of how the truly powerful, or military leaders would really act with him the various scenarios laid out in this book. I did not find her characterizations very realistic, they were not clever, and I just could not find myself buying into it.

It isn't that the author is a bad writer, I didn't get that, but the characters or ripped out of a Michael Bay film with very little originality.

"So the 1 star is because this was the wrong seal.  (not really my fault, read on).

My advice to you is, somewhere on your toilet (depending upon model, location will vary LOL) you will find a model #.  YOU NEED that model # and you need to know if it's got an overflow or not.  What the hell that is, is anyone's guess and i think most of you who got the right seal (which is most of you) are probably luckier than you think (or geniuses maybe, who knows).

"I installed in a 2004 X-type Jag and it went really easily.  I will make an installtion note:  I have a ""hub"" of 12v ""cigar type"" outlets on the driver side, down by my right leg on the floor, because i run so many darn different things.  Running the provided power cord (yes they do give you a cigar type for cars with 8 ft cord) up over the driver visor, down the molding, and then under my driver carpet thing, it only just made it to my hub, so, the cord length is about perfect and it only took my 5 minutes and you can't see the cord anywhere when you just push it up behind your trim (I used a plastic pen as a  pusher, worked great).There was no data chip included which almost certainly is not the seller's fault (Speedy Mobile) but  they promptly responded to my comment, and refunded me $7 for the missing chip which was extremely nice.

"I was pretty surprised at the design quality for what it cost.  You really do expect junk at this price point but apparently not so here.  This is a very small stun gun (in my view, the absolute perfect size, particularly for a woman with smaller hands who wants to carry a purse).  It easily fits in almost anyone's pocket.  It can be concealed in your hand, even if your hands are small.I like that the light is VERY bright, it's not a ""toss in"", token light that will barely light the path in front of you, it's blinding (I know, i stupidly shined it in my eyes and was seeing spots for a few minutes).  I don't know the lumens, but it's got to be around 40.The best thing about this is the brilliant way it charges.  It has it's own built in prongs.  You just slide em out, and plug the whole thing into an outlet (an American 110v standard outlet only i guess - don't know if they make euro models).  Nothing to lose, no cord, no hassles.  I've had a couple stun guns, this is the smartest, best design i've ever seen.Operation is idiotically simple (so, keep it away from Damien your recalcitrant 13 yr old).I haven't tazed myself with it yet, but when i do i will let you all know how it goes after i wake up.You should probably replace these every 3 years tops.

The frame is exactly 5 inches wide at rest, but stretches out (the frame is ""sprung"", surprisingly) to 9.5 inches to accommodate even the largest brains though i expect for really large heads, these would be a little uncomfortable.I would think these would look acceptable on almost any face.  A couple of people tried these on in my office and they seemed to look fine on almost anyone.  I have a roundish face which i think is the hardest sort of face to accommodate, style wise.  Everything seems to look like crap on my face, even my face itself sometimes whereas skinny people could paste broken glass to theirs and somehow, pull it off.  damn you skinny people, damn you....I will say, they have real temerity to label the side of the frame ""Hand polished frame"" when you can see the defects with the naked eye (up close).

"G-E-T  T-H-I-S  O-N-E. omg get it!!!If you're not sure about multitools, maybe you're buying this as a gift for your husband or whatever, read on so i can make your choice easy for you - get THIS one.In terms of size it's perfect, not too big, not too small, fits any hand with perfection.This is almost exactly the same thing as the super expensive Charge TTi, which is twice the cost, made of titanium, but somehow they weight almost exactly the same so why get the Charge?  Sure, the Charge TTI blade is made from S30v stainless - a slightly better steel at holding an edge but it's hardly worth double the price and was really made for uber picky knife snobs. There are a couple minor differences which i do not care about (the Charge TTi has a gut hook on the blade which very few people are really going to use (even if they were in fact faced with gutting an animal) and i prefer not to have the blade end wakened with a gut hook i will never use.The standard WAVE sheath is awesome and i do recommend the little extra bit set (u get two little plastic wafers filled with bits) you can buy (15 bucks i think) and those little plastic wafers of bits easily fit inside the nylon sheath that comes with the Wave in fact, they made a little pocket for them (no one seems to mention that pocket for some reason).  The sheath is designed to work with either a simple belt, or for military MOLLE attachment.  Totally awesome that they made it that way because i do intend to MOLLE strap it to my armor plate carrier for deployment as a primary go-to force-multiplier kick-ass everything tool - YES!  omg i am way to excited about this thing.I think the single aspect i like most is that the major tools (blades, file and saw) deploy from the o-u-t-s-i-d-e.  This is not something a casual observer might notice but if you go to Leatherman's website, you can see how all the tools unfold, or, display, and the WAVE, as with a few others, have the 4 major tools deploy on the outside.  So for example, if you need to deploy the blade, you don't have to crack the tool in half, you simply slide your thumb to the thumbhole and flick the blade out and it 100% locks into place like a real knife that won't fold back and cut your damn fingers off.  you could even use it as a legitimate weapon (against an angry bear obviously). anyways, a-w-e-s-o-m-e.  That really makes it for me.  The ease of use compared to say, my old leatherman which i've had around 20 years is night and day.I got black because i just prefer it so whether you get black or shiny stainless is up to you.  if it could be for military use, get black otherwise it hardly matters and they are both equally corrosion resistant. Just note that the black stuff ""cures"" with handling, in other words, i guess the oils in your skin are what sets this carbon powder stuff into the steel, so, you might get black hands and fingers for a bit.  I didn't care for it, so i wiped most of mine off (and mine is still a really nice, soft black, love it).  It's still stainless steel under there so the black is technically just for show.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RUIP0ZIJQ4ACT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0009JS2ZW#wasThisHelpful","RUIP0ZIJQ4ACT","AP5LXBV3T0JR7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AP5LXBV3T0JR7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The width of the center ""tube"" is 3/8, i put my micrometer on it.When the two sides are screwed together all the way they are 1/4 inch apart, meaning, that the MINIMUM amount of material you can use is 1/4 inch (slightly larger really).  So if what you're trying to put together is less than 1/4 inch, this won't work without washer or something to make up the distance.These are often used to bind two pieces of kydex plastic together and another reviewer commented that it won't snugly put together two sheets of 0.80"" kydex and that is true.  you can make up the difference with two small washers though.

"UPDATE #3: I noticed another reviewed said his pan does not say Joycook on the handle and it's not doing well. Mine also does not say Joycook but i havn't had any issues with the pan surface. I will say that within months, it started to knick around the rim and this is because the stainless rimmed lid would knick it, but this did not, has not, translated down to the pan surface so it's not an issue for cooking. It did bother me, but again, the knicks and stuff didn't cause any sort of progressive failure.UPDATE #2: So after 4 years or so, still works. Not as good as it used to but still not bad at all. I must stress that for these to work right, you cannot use anything metal on them or ""scrub"" them with greenies. NO NO NO NO NO ! only use a plastic brush. only use plastic or wood utensils. My pan only has one mark where my wife knicked it with a fork. When i originally bought my pan it was $85 and now i see they are $45 which is a great deal.UPDATE #1: Good pan so far, have owned now for just over a year and I cook a lot, i use several times per week. Has not lost any of it's no stick powers yet.ORIGINAL REVIEW:Bought because it doesn't release harmful chemicals. It's certainly non stick, I rarely have to brush it clean, just shoot water on it, clean.If you don't scrub them with greenies (which is tantamount to 120 grit sandpaper, my paint and body guy uses greenies to prep car bodies) these kinds of pans will stay non stick a lot longer. When you clean them, ONLY use a plastic brush (if u need to use anything at all). DONT use the scrubbie. Don't wipe it with paper towels either (they will micro scratch pans, oh yes they will) unless u do it gently.NOW WHAT I LIKE MOST ABOUT THIS PRODUCT IS THAT IT DOES NOT LIE ABOUT WHERE IT IS MADE. There is a certain other pan that says it is ""From Germany"" and it's not, it's Chinese (I finally found a review that says it it is actually made in China, the coating if from Germany - what they hey???) and I simply cannot stand products that lie.This pan is made in Korea and I've actually had pretty good success with Korean products, they seem to be well made, not just this pan.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 3, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Z5ZNVF6THQ2P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0049KFR5A#wasThisHelpful","R1Z5ZNVF6THQ2P","AP5LXBV3T0JR7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AP5LXBV3T0JR7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Like everyone else: hard water, can't do soft water for myriad reasons. Tired of crusty white stuff on everything (imagine wine glasses that are a particular shade of white - and that feel like they are covered in a very fine sand paper).  We just moved here recently, and well, who knew water could be like this!  I am sure you do if you're reading this but it's all new to me.So I researched, like you, and among the ""electronic Water Zapper"" dealies, this was the best+cheapest, apparently.  It seemed to do the same thing as the Eddy, but for quite a bit less.  Now this only has a 90 day warranty, the Eddy comes with a 1 year, but then the Eddy charges you a $40 restock fee.So, i ordered this (well actually, my wife put a proverbial gun to my head, and then i ordered it).  It arrived, literally, the next day (wow).  So i wasted no time, and, within 15 minutes had it installed.  Super easy.The very next day we're noticing a big difference.  The glasses are clear, skin feels slippery and my wife claims that she can finally wash her hair.  The water tastes better - I used to get a kind of chalky film on my mouth, teeth, etc.  Now it just tastes like, water.  In one day!  I had expected to wait a few days or even a few weeks for any sort of noticeable improvement.I will say that i didn't research my water to see what sort of hard water we have, or what our water composition is.  Obviously, i fell into the category where this really works well (if you have high iron, for example, you're kinda screwed since it upsets the process).What else can i say, so far (3 whole days) and we love it!NOTE: In the instructions, it says quite clearly: Do not install this BEFORE any ground-wire that may be attached to your piping (I see most plumbing ground wires outside, which would almost automatically put the ground before the unit if you install the unit inside, of course).  For those of who are not aware of it, most metal plumbing should have a ground wire somewhere on it, that grounds it to the uh, ground (so if you're house gets struck by lightning, and you happen to be in your bathtub...u get idea).  So, it just so happens, that where my water enters the house (which is where i needed to put my little CLearWave unit), just inside my garage door, is well ""behind the ground"" wire, which is across the garage, and next to the water heater.  So i thought i would just move the wire, but - the wire disappears into the wall.  Crap.  So I went onto ClearWave's website, sent their sales staff an email (the only option), which they relayed to techsupport, and they answered me the next day saying: ""don't sweat it, your ground is 20 feet away, that won't interfere, you're good to go.""  Nice!  So anyways, I don't remember exactly what he said but i got the impression that so long as it's at least several feet away (6-7 ?), you're ok.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2X3O2IU7Y5M0R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00795B9IQ#wasThisHelpful","R2X3O2IU7Y5M0R","AP5LXBV3T0JR7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AP5LXBV3T0JR7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It's a very nice press that comes with the extra of a base that is on wheels so it moves around.  you can take it off that if you want but i think that's helpful for some people working with large items like tarps, where you want to move the press, not the object.Just beware it doesn't come with the dies.  They say it doesn't in the description but i missed that and stupidly ordered it but the people at Crosslinks were really helpful and got me a set of dies at a discount which in total, equaled about the cost of other presses that come with die sets so it's still a good deal.I would recommend that they pack it with some extra packing.  Mine was only packed with a small piece of bubble wrap on top, and the press had worked holes in the box and was ""fixing"" to make a getaway!  Also, the handle rubbed and marred the finish on the base because it was not properly wrapped up.  I could care less about the marring, it will not alter the performance and it's minor but some people are pickier than i.  Personally, i'd just wrap it all up in a bunch of newspaper.

"I purchased mine as a ""refurbished"" unit from a company called Data Sales Co, through Amazon of course.  The computer is, unbelievable.  I swear this thing is new.  I have gone through the whole thing, inside and out, not a nick or scratch or even spec of dust.  It sincerely does not like it's ever been used.  They sent it promptly, it was very, very well packaged with a foam pad that surrounded it and was made for it.  It came with a W7 disc though it was pre-loaded.  Just bear in mind because this is a refurb, the refurb Co loads their license copy of W7 in it (they are a distributor) so you don't enter the product key on the case, you enter the product key they give you.  It works fine, it's totally legit.  Havn't spent ton of time with it but it seems fast, it's quiet, and the Dell Optiplex line (i ahve several) is a tank.  These are built much, much better than your average computer, many of which have the appearance of being ""tossed together"" - this whole thing looks very purpose built.  I bout the SFF (small Form Factor) so the case is pretty small and, regrettably, i don't think i can stuff naother HD in it which kinda sucks since the one it came with is only 250 GB but it's not a huge problem for me and anyone can buy an external HD and use that.  It does only come with 4GB or RAM but this is easily upgrades for around $75.

I read 100+ sci-fi books a year, so you can imagine, like some of you no doubt do, i don't always put the research into it i want to.  I just want to read man.  I stupidly went with the fact that this book is 4.5 stars with at the time, 358 reviews which is a lot.  Usually, that's enough, right?  Not this time.  Look, it's not ""bad"" but I agree with the other reviewer, people are losing their objectivity here.  The problem is, if you read the sample, it's pretty good.  It is, at least, exciting.  Once you buy the book and the first ""scene"" is over, it is frankly, boring.  Clumsy, not-at-all-clever, clunky scene writing that is sort of connect the dots simple.  Seriously, there were chapters upon chapters of backroom Navy board meeting and strategy planning that, in the hands of a skilled writer may have been passingly of interest but it was so boring, i fell asleep reading it two nights in a row and on night 3, finally got so frustrated, i sit here now, writing this review to spare the rest of you.

"this book needs a MASSIVE TRIGGER WARNING. The male is abusive (he rapes her for crying out loud), he's constantly having dangerous flashbacks where he talks about the abuse he had as a child, he repeatedly hurts her and then asks for forgiveness. As a marital abuse survivor this book was horrible to read. I expected a love story not a horror story. It was nothing but abuse and stockholm syndrome. I kept reading hoping the guy would ""see the light"" but he was abusive to the end. I don't know the author but this book frankly is disgusting. Scene after scene of abuse, both of the wife and the reliving of his childhood abuse. If I wanted to read a book about child abuse I'd have picked up Lolita instead, at least that was better written. The male lead is an idiot on top of it (your pregnant wife is upstairs and she's not going to hear you f!$@ing a hooker downstairs? Come on!!!) The woman is constantly thin, losing weight, unable to sleep and it's blamed on pregnancy not abuse. Seriously if you went to an Obgyn and you had bruising they would still likely comment on it or ask if you needed help, no doctor is going to ignore a pregnant woman with such obvious signs of physical abuse.The writing itself was dull, the author has moments of passion (ironically abusive scenes) and the rest of the book is jumbled and dull. It jumps around a lot both in perspective, time and what's going on. One minute he's happy the next he's a sociopath. One minute she's a sane human the next she's a needy abuse victim who had a rough life. There's no cohesion with the characters and the plot drags on with abuse after abuse after abuse. If I hadn't lived through an abuse situation I'd wonder how any woman would continue to stay through his behavior. The thing that cinches it being a terrible book is that even though she's being abused not once does she justify his actions, in fact the woman is constantly saying how his behavior is not ok (if you're not ok with it why do you freaking end up staying with him?????)I don't know what to make of this book, the writing is sub par, the plot had potential UNTIL the abuse rolled in. This isn't 50 shades ""non consent"" junk, it's abuse - he rapes her and leaves bruises on her and then cries about it the next day and says sorry citing his childhood. Not buying it and I certainly wouldn't recommend it for anyone with trigger issues.","2.0 out of 5 stars","September 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R188OLTM265CO6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004G8R262#wasThisHelpful","R188OLTM265CO6","A3NWTXTR2IYHGH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3NWTXTR2IYHGH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is one of my favorite new series out. I LOVE Mass' writing anyway but this is great. It's a little tentative, but that can be the same with any new book. Not a lot given away at first which I think could be frustrating for some as you're not sure of the plot. I'm 50/50 on the family characters - they seem to develop one way and then switch up so they're rather ambiguous, hopefully that will be better in future. I liked the style of the book though, mixing traditional faerytale and folklore in with the world. I'm sketchy on her name, I'm hoping that Fayre turns out to be for a good reason because it's too damn obvious. Also I'm still in the dark about why ""roses and thorns"", maybe I missed the line that explained that because since there's more than one court involved I don't feel it applies as a whole.However, despite the shortcomings it's very easy to fall in love with the characters, and it definitely leaves you wanting more.

The only thing I disliked was the fact that there were glaring historical inaccuracies for the period (seriously old people talking about their sex life at the dinner table to strangers in the middle ages?????). I understand it's a fictional kingdom loosely based on Europe at the time but it just annoyed me. Ciara is a little bit too modern for a time that spawned damsels. I did like the innovative ways the author made them get out of their scrapes (sledding on a shield?!) and their ending up together didn't seem too cheesy in the end.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RFAMKA1TSPCVJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0065QWGXW#wasThisHelpful","RFAMKA1TSPCVJ","A3NWTXTR2IYHGH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3NWTXTR2IYHGH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm the midget of the family, even my grandmother is taller than me and I always thought it was genetic. I never knew how to get taller as an adult was all in your posture and stretching your body out. I don't know about a whole 4 inches but my posture has improved from the stretches alone which has certainly added a cm or two just from that (and it's only been a couple of days!). I'm pleased so far as I feel more flexible and my back feels noticeably more comfortable with just a few days of following the stretching. I have back issues and they aren't particularly difficult so I think this book would work for anyone who has reasonable flexibility, the stretches aren't that complicated but I think if you're an advanced yoga practitioner this might be a waste of time. I knew yoga stretching could help children grow but I didn't honestly believe that it would make a difference as an adult. I'm definitely going to continue with the routines and see whether or not there is any more improvement.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQ3T95JAXVJCX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1500728810#wasThisHelpful","RQ3T95JAXVJCX","A3NWTXTR2IYHGH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3NWTXTR2IYHGH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

They are comfortable and fit well, I've honestly forgotten that I was wearing them most of the time. They do get a little dirty though so I've been cleaning mine with alcohol to keep it looking nice. The material is solid and seems to be well made - no sharp edges and a uniform shape. I liked that these were a set of two so if one breaks I can use the other, or if I simply want to match in flip flops I can wear both and it doesn't stand out so much.

I found this book really interesting and informative and the recipes seem fairly simple. I'm not much of a cook so I was specifically looking for recipes that didn't take long, tried one for dinner last night (took me more than 30 but like I said I'm not much of a cook) - the veggie pancakes were really good. I'm really pleased that there are a lot of vegetarian recipes included too so I'll be trying some more for sure. I liked how there was also a little introduction and information on the different blood types so it wasn't just recipes with no explanation.Eating for your Blood type seems like a well written book (didn't see any errors) and the recipes were complete (no time or ingredients missing). I'll be trying more from this in future- probably going to give the smoothies a go for breakfast this week.

In fact the third book seemed like the author didn't want to write it either the way it just suddenly cuts off and ENDS. No wind down, just end of the chapter, epilogue.

The balls are easy to spot even in the sand and grass so they've worked out well in both locations. They're a good weight, not too light and cheaply made like some but still easy enough for the kids to pick up - they're certainly worth the extra money in quality. I'm thinking about buying a second set just to have a spare or perhaps so we can play more than once game at a time as this one gets a lot of use in our family. I'm really pleased with this set so far it's been a pleasure to play with and not worry that the balls will chip or break or that one will get lost.

I think there is some great information in here and it's well laid out, I feel that as a beginner shorter books work best and this was quite succinct. I know zip about Linux but had a few questions relating to other codes and comparison and this book helped answer them, though my knowledge is limited so I think this book would be better for those with a bit more background in OS rather than web programming.

I thought the language was easy to follow even to someone like me who is just starting to program and the book is well set out with the included examples so it doesn't get confusing. I liked the examples used because they weren't just a copy and paste but included explanation and thought the fact that the author really starts you from scratch with downloading was very helpful. I think there are good tools and advice for anyone wanting to start working in python. It's a fairly short book so I just went and read it again after learning new things in class and found that even after I've gotten a little more comfortable I'm still able to spot things in the code that I hadn't quite understood before. I think the author did a really good job with this and more beginner python programmers should check it out.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3DI949ZZCWQ5Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N4IQRD4#wasThisHelpful","R3DI949ZZCWQ5Q","A3NWTXTR2IYHGH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3NWTXTR2IYHGH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've always been heavy and recently made a commitment to losing weight. I chose this supplementbecause Schwartz products are made in the US and also being manufactured in a FDA regulated labmade me feel safe about its content. I also purchased another product (Phytceramides) from thiscompany and received the product at a discount which was awesome. I thought the capsules weren'ttoo difficult to swallow, I didn't have to break them up to take them and they're not rough edged likesome. The bottle is pretty good value for money since you get quite a lot of pills in there – taking twoa day has been really easy to remember. I've noticed that while taking pure caralluma fimbriata Ihaven't been grazing as much so it has markedly decreased my appetite. That has really helped me tocontrol calories without feeling like I'm hungry all the time. I've lost a little over 3lb in the first weekwhich is more than 1% of my body weight so I'm very excited to see if that rate continues with this.I've tried Garcinia Cambodia and a few others in the past that haven't been quite as effective, andespecially not so fast. I would absolutely recommend this product based on my results so far.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2LW4HIL9RRWH3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00S1TICIE#wasThisHelpful","R2LW4HIL9RRWH3","A3NWTXTR2IYHGH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3NWTXTR2IYHGH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This year I hit 30 and I detected a marked difference in my skin, especially the fine lines appearing on my forehead. I just started taking these capsules and my skin looks noticeably fresher. I chose Schwartz over other brands because they're vegetarian which is important to me, and because I got it at a discount - an unexpected bonus. I have always known about antioxidants being important to skin care so I thought these supplements would be a good choice since Phytoceramides 350mg are just concentrated antioxidants. I thought they were easy to take, especially since it's only one a day and there was no aftertaste at all. My skin feels more supple and looks brighter, I've also noticed that I don't need to use as much moisturizer anymore or as much concealer on darker areas. I'm very pleased with my results so far and will continue to use this to fight any new wrinkles.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R19KCX2A7W7LQS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SXWRNB6#wasThisHelpful","R19KCX2A7W7LQS","A3NWTXTR2IYHGH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3NWTXTR2IYHGH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought this book to better understand my other half and found it quite insightful. He's an ISFJ whereas I am an INFP ""diplomat"". This book has really helped me better understand him - he's so analytic where as I'm more of a feeler. I thought the book was well written and easy to read, the introduction was particularly good if you haven't read a lot about personality types. I felt that the book went into more detail than expected and learnt a lot of information such as some good suggestions about what I was doing a wrong to make Mike happy. There's a lot of really good information here and the book gave me more information than I really needed which was great and the author included some interesting personal views as well.

"I was pleasantly surprised by this book. A lot of non fiction that I find here tends to be painful to read - this book was well written and though some of the words were hard to pronounce/understand I felt that the author went above and beyond for the information included. The book was well laid out with clear chapters though it did seem there was a little repetition in some areas - poses for example. I liked that the author went into detail about how to perform the poses, though it would have been nice to have pictures to go with the information. I also thought it was pretty impressive for a beginner book to go into diet and chakras since I never ever knew the subjects were related until this. I think it could have been improved potentially by adding a meal plan but it already went over my expectation so it isn't a huge loss. This book is so much more than a crash course - it gives you everything including suggestions for what to wear for different types of yoga.  I'm really impressed by this book and it's definitely worth the price and I would recommend it for anyone looking into yoga.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R28FASXADHUULT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UK95TS4#wasThisHelpful","R28FASXADHUULT","A3NWTXTR2IYHGH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3NWTXTR2IYHGH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was a little concerned being that I have sensitive skin and others had a reaction but after doing a test patch I tried this on a really nasty zit and some unbroken skin. The zit was definitely down the next morning a little bit but still red. The mixing instructions were easy to follow but it is supposed to sit 20minutes and I didn't leave it that long so that could be why the effect wasn't so pronounced. The mud felt luxurious and very thick after I mixed it. On the unbroken skin my skin was quiet soft afterwards, no redness or irritation. It actually felt like a really good face mask when it was on - a little drying but washed off easily. My skin seemed a little less greasy for the couple of days afterwards.The package is huge - it's going to take me forever to finish this so it was really good value, especially since I got it on a promotion. I haven't tried it on my hair yet as a mask but I will soon. I think perhaps if I have the time to mix it and let it sit longer it might give better healing results.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R31SGH5CLG1PUM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QJDXBSU#wasThisHelpful","R31SGH5CLG1PUM","A3NWTXTR2IYHGH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3NWTXTR2IYHGH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"A few years ago I took my Realtor license and never did anything with it, now we're looking to sell our house and I think the insider knowledge I already have has been invaluable but it's out of date. That's why I bought this book since I know nothing about real estate online.This isn't a how to but it's excellent for adding to the knowledge you already have. I wouldn't recommend this book if you don't know anything about real estate already since there's plenty of work terms in here you might not be familiar with but it's got a lot of useful information even for its small size. This is good if you're thinking of doing a FSBO even if you won't be able to access all the services it mentions or if you are using a broker at least you will know what they are talking about when listing.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RM8PDXRS8IGQ4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EF5DTH2#wasThisHelpful","RM8PDXRS8IGQ4","A3NWTXTR2IYHGH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3NWTXTR2IYHGH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I actually look out every time that one comes out because it helps change things up. Of course the kids play everything so they win but it's really good for being able to boost their confidence in that they know all the answers.

"So I've always been a big fan of if it looks good enough then I'll buy it anyway. I admit it, I buy fakes, but this book is great because it points out things that are really obvious on them so I know what to look for in future when shopping. There are some things in here I already knew but there's also plenty of things I never would have noticed. I thought the book was short but got plenty of points packed in especially if you like to shop online. I wish it did extend to other brands a bit more as it does focus a lot on LV products. Maybe the author should do a series for different brands?  This was an easy and quick book to read and was perfectly laid out though there were a few points that were simple common sense. I'm going to be getting rid of a few bags after reading this because now I can see how obvious they are and using the information to shop for new ones.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R7HIR550OWX9D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EESP60S#wasThisHelpful","R7HIR550OWX9D","A3NWTXTR2IYHGH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3NWTXTR2IYHGH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Ok so the cover might be a little unrealistic but I'm certainly seeing a bit of results so far from the exercises. I suffer from classic white girl @$s and my boyfriend constantly picks on me for it. As someone mentioned there aren't pictures but it takes a whole few minutes to google anything you don't understand and a video will pop right up. I think the explanations were pretty good overall and I've been trying out the exercises. I have seen a bit more firmness, and my butt certainly aches like I've been working out! I haven't had this long so I think realistically I've seen results being that it hasn't been but a couple of weeks. I like how the exercises suggested don't have to all be done together - if you've got a couple of minutes you can do one at work, or in the morning before you get in the shower etc and get the whole program done through the day without having to add an extra time to work out your butt.

"I just started programming, it's quite difficult but this book has really helped me so far. I've not encountered R before so this is rather new. I don't think I'm comfortable with it yet but I've only just started and this book has given me great understanding about what R is and how I can use it. I think I have the basics down after the first read. I like the way the author has presented the material and they have made it easy to follow and understand even if you aren't familiar with programming. It seems really similar to VB how the author has presented R (maybe how much I've gotten comfortable with so far of basic programming) but this is ideal for anyone looking to expand their programming languages.

"Very cool light strip!There is plenty of lead on this, which allows me to plug this above our kitchen cabinets and power it with a hidden outlet. Yes, its expensive. No, they are never long enough, but I will not judge the product on this alone.Why not 5 stars? I am not too impressed with the non-defused RGB LEDs. Seeing the color separation reflecting off things drives me nuts and cheapens the ambiance.Overall, I am a big fan of Hue and we have it supplement our lighting in every room. The lights are programmed to ""follow the sun"", with a simulated whole house sunrise in the morning, daylight color temps during the day, a simulated sunset, and eventually night time ambiance. It really helps waking up in the morning and being in tune with the time of day.

"I almost did not buy this microscope because of the lower resolution camera. But at the price point, it was a great buy, so I went ahead and purchased it.To my surprise, the camera is actually very good quality, even if its only 640x480.The camera shows up as a webcam, so you can plug it into just about any computer. On Mac OSX, I was able to use it in Photobooth (great for video and pictures) as well as FaceTime. My daughter was able to make a FaceTime call showing video from the microscope, which was very impressive.The optics and construction are high quality. I think a lot of users looking for an inexpensive but not cheap feeling microscope will be happy with this.While it has a lot of features, the manual is absolutely useless. It does not tell you how any part of the microscope works. For example, turning to maximum magnification rendered the image so dark, I could not see it. It took me 20 minutes to realize an unlabeled dial on the microscope controlled the light intensity. After that, I could see fine. There is also an iris selection labeled 1-9 (no idea what this does), and a focus knob which is obvious. There is no fine focus, so you will have to be very careful when focusing at high magnifications. It is not impossible though.Some cons of this microscope: easy to hit the max magnification lens on the slide if you are focused in past a certain point, easy to hit the lens on the slide if you are past the focus point, and strange camera flicker under certain lighting conditions (it can be mitigated by changing the light intensity slightly). I do not regret this purchase.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R19K175X25K6MS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007O1I7IU#wasThisHelpful","R19K175X25K6MS","A2SX8FFFC56KDH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2SX8FFFC56KDH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Purchasing a hard tub is an incredible commitment in time, chemistry, and maintenance (never mind the thousands of dollars to purchase and install). After seeing this Coleman steeply discounted on Black Friday at another retailer, I decided to give this inflatable a try.The Coleman is a branded variant of the Lay-Z Spa, and other than color, it appears to be identical to the other Lay-Z Spa sold. However, it appears that it holds about 50 gallons more water. It plugs into 120V, which makes it extremely easy to plug and play. Just be careful what else you have on the circuit with this tub, as it *will* consume an entire 15A circuit when you take in account safety margins. I have a Kill-a-Watt connected in series so I can monitor its power consumption (more later).The little green ovalish box is the brains of the operation. It contains the heater, a blower (which doubles as both inflator and bubble maker), and a membrane control panel. I have found it difficult to read during the day. The dark LED segments show bright white while the red is dimly lit.Setup:The instructions are not the best. Warnings are randomly scattered all over the place, making it difficult to read. While physically using the inflator works great, the pressure gauge is not even to the right scale needed to properly measure the correct pressure required. The first marking on the gauge is 2 psi and there is no 1 psi marking! Expect it to move a couple of millimeters and not point anything in particular when you reach 1.2 psi. The main air chamber has a very nice locking connector with a high quality one way air valve, so it is not like blowing up a pool inflatable. The sides are very firm once inflation is complete.*Pro Tip* While inflating, its very likely the keypad will auto lock before you are done. Make sure you unlock it again ahead of time, otherwise you'll spend a minute trying to figure out why the heck it won't turn off and overinflate your pool!There is a ground pad that looks like thick bubble wrap. There is still bits of snow on the ground, and it felt warm sitting on top of it. Although the instructions mentioned nothing of this pad, I faced the flat side down and put the pool on top of it. Do this before you put in the water!The hoses connect up nicely and it took me a couple of minutes to finish the connection. Expect it to take an hour or two to fill up the tub with your hose. I'd imagine, the warmer the water, the better. I couldn't find my sink adapter, so I just used whatever bitter cold water came out of the garden hose though.Operation:People complain about how slow 120V systems are to heat up. This is because you are physically restricted by the number of watts you can pull through a typical house plug. The tub has a two stage heater and can pull between 700 and 1200 watts.  It apparently decides to use full wattage if the water is cold enough. It will switch to 2 elements after about a minute from my observation. When heating, it also runs the pump. This means only 1-2F degrees an hour of warming per hour. While they made a good effort to insulate the tub, it still is an inflatable.The bubbles are surprisingly large for just blowing air into a holed ring in the bottom. It looks just like a typical hard tub. Just remember: the amount of power required to create the bubbles takes away from the power needed for full heating capability. My tub is not at temperature yet (57F), but as it stands now, it turns off all heating in order to make bubbles.Sound:The heater + pump does not make much sound. Its a quiet hum, around 50 dB (or what is called a ""quiet street"" sound level or maybe a refrigerator hum). Obviously bubbles make a lot more noise, and there is a slight vacuum cleaner sound. But I would imagine a lot of other hot tubs have similar noise levels.Chemicals:You need proper chemicals in your spa. Not putting any in because its ""just you"" or randomly throwing in a tablet into the floater are not good ideas. You can get sick or chemically burned. The manual is completely useless and tells you to ""go to a spa store"" to learn about some ""chemicals"". Thanks guys. Just what I need is another salesmen who will try to sell me a hard tub. Searching on the internet is not much help either, as it is full of snake oil additives, unsound science on forums, etc.Make sure you buy a pack of test strips, as blindly adding chemicals can be very dangerous. You will want to know pH, chlorine/bromine level, and alkalinity.For the type of chemicals, there are two routes to go: Bromine or Chlorine.Bromine is a little bit more work but has some purported benefits. It has less odor, can be restored using a shock, etc. People in our hot tub notice little to no odor.Read the directions, but typically one will add Sodium Bromide (granules) to bring the Bromine levels up to an initial value. After that, you will likely use a Bromine tablet in the floater (1""). You will have to apply a ""shock"" to convert all that Bromine into free Bromine if your granules do not also include a shock.Pick up some pH Up and pH Down. Its cheap. When I initially filled it, my water was around 6.8 (too low). My Alkalinity is slightly low as well, and usually pH Up will boost this incidentally. Your water will be different.You can use the bubbles to mix chemicals as needed.Energy consumption (from Kill-A-Watt):Standby: 5-8 Watts (electronics only)Pump: 27 WattsBubbles: 650 WattsHeater: ~700 Watts with one element, ~1200 Watts both elements (automatic)Bubbles + Heater: Doesn't appear possible** Update - 1 week of usage **In the Seattle winter with 40F days, this hot tub typically takes around 24-30 hours to reach temperature from cold hose water. It burns around 40kWh of electricity to heat this water up, so the initial startup costs can be costly. (40 * $0.10 = $4.00). I also noticed that it takes a lot of energy to maintain 104F (it runs 100% of the time), and you might be looking at $90 in electricity over the month! This is likely an insulation issue.* however * I have discovered that simply lowering the temperature a couple degrees when you are not using it makes a huge difference. Backing off the temperature, to say, 100F, practically quartered the power consumption. I should have some better numbers later, but this is the way to go. It only takes about an hour to go from 100F to 104F in the worst case, so not much is lost.We have used it quite a few times over the week, and it was very enjoyable. The tub is soft and comfortable, much more than a fiberglass or tile tub. I actually prefer it. The surround is still very firm and has not lost inflation.** Update - 6 months later **The inflatable vessel has developed some problems (leaks) and I have now engaged the warranty process. I am waiting for my RMA to be approved. I could not tell you if this is normal for this hot tub or not. I got my first leak on one of the seams. It was a small hole and I easily patched it. But then another developed...then another...in each case I noticed the internal ribbing completely failed. Eventually, a large section failed and it was hard to keep up with batching all of these holes as the hot tub slowly tore itself apart. These holes developed while nobody was using the hot tub. I will keep this updated with the progress on this. If the customer support is sufficient, I am not going to dock any stars on this review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 3, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RP1F43TGTN5BE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NB3P98G#wasThisHelpful","RP1F43TGTN5BE","A2SX8FFFC56KDH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2SX8FFFC56KDH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This adapter adapts my Nikkor lenses to use on my Fuji body (X-T1).It works perfectly, and looks really nice as well.

And as i've had some that were too loose, it doesnt bother me.The aperture ring has 6-7 clicks, so its better than the Fotiodix version i have with only 3-4.Not much more to say, but that it works well and allows me to use all of my Nikon lenses on a Fuji body.Of course, this is all manual control, no Autofocus or Autoexposure control--just a metal tube that allows you to mount Nikon lenses.At this price, its a great deal, and works wonderfully.

"So far, my favorite card reader.I've been shooting professionally for 25 years, and using card readers since the Nikon D1. Compact Flash cards and readers are becoming scarce, as SD is now more the norm. But pro bodies still have CF cards, including my D4.As my old one was only USB 2, i figured it was time for an upgrade. Tried another USB 3 card reader, and it failed after 2 months (pin bent in the CF card slot), so went in search again.There are varied reviews on this Lexar reader, but upon closer inspection, it seems there are at least 3 models of this reader (that all look the same externally). The one i got is model # LRW400CRBNA, with a 2015 date on the box. This 400 series i think is the latest at the time i am writing this.It is indeed USB 3, with a usb3 cord as well, that inputs into the back of the device. I like that it has an interchangable cord, and comes with one.I can swap other devices using the same cord--such as my Pioneer external BR burner, another great product:http://www.amazon.com/Portable-External-CyberLink-Software-BDR-XD05/dp/B00HSHLZJ8/ref=sr_1_8?ie=UTF8&qid=1434128497&sr=8-8&keywords=pioneer+bluray+writerIt has a great form factor, as the shell can enclose and protect itself. It stays open very well in use. When closed, the buttons on the side pop open the clamshell--this is very sensitive, almost like a mousetrap, and snaps open! Not a big deal, but kind of surprised me how sensitive it was.It can download TWO CARDS at ONCE--my main reason for purchase. So you can put a CF card and SD card and upload them both simultaneously. It is much easier to put in the CF card first, as it is on the bottom.It is VERY FAST at READING both cards. This of course, is dependent on your computer, usb ports, etc. But its the fastest reader i have ever used (other than other formats, such as the Sony XQD).It has a nice padded rubber bottom that grips relatively well and stays in place. Seems trivial, but its nice.As it only has 2 cards formats, it doesnt use a gazillion drive letters on your computer like some of those readers with 10 or more formats. If you only need SD and/or CF, this is the reader for you. I dont have or care for any of those other weird formats. Of course, you can just use a SD card adapter if you need to put in a MicroSD card.The device was recognized immediately on my two computers, with no need to download drivers or install software. WHEW, what a relief--No crappy proprietary software to put on my machines.It just works well. Reads cards from every camera ive put in it so far (Nikon D4, D7000, D300s, Fuji XT1, etc) with no glitches.Couldnt be happier to have something work well, with NO HASSLES.I will update if i ever have a problem, or if the product fails.

"As an early adopter of the Piston 2, I was pleasantly surprised by the sound quality and features of the Piston 2, but there were a few things I would have changed: the bass was a bit too bloated, the treble a bit too harsh, and the midrange quite lacking. But I still liked the sound overall, despite the heavy V-shaped signature, because the price was phenomenal for the quality and features, and they were/are still better than many earbuds in the price range.Basically, I find the Piston 3 to be better in almost every way:The BASS is certainly still very strong, in fact I find it to be more impactful in the lower register with a tighter, faster attack. It loses some of the mid-bass hump of the 2’s, albeit a bit less warm as well, but more natural. It still kicks with authority, but is very well-controlled and never boomy, bloaty and muddy.The MIDRANGE is so very much more present that at first it was a bit of a shock. As most of my IEMs have too low of a MR, my EQ settings were pumped up to compensate, so I needed to flatten them out some. With the P3, the MR is very detailed, accurate, and present. Vocals are a pleasure, with articulation that is just amazing in this price range. I find myself hearing things I did not hear with lesser IEMs. They can be very revealing and true to the source though, and with some recordings can be a bit glaring, but I believe fairly neutral.The TREBLE is airy, detailed, and articulate, and never harsh or tinny. I found the Piston 2 to be a bit too sizzly, with a more artificial air. I love strong detailed treble, and it is ever-present in the P3, but with a bit of a roll-off to be non-fatiguing as well. With the treble and MR, the level of articulation and detail is simply amazing. This is even in comparison to much higher-priced IEMs, including my custom-molded UE Triple-Fi 10s. Because of this enhanced detail, bad recordings or poor-quality MP3 and the like are much more of notice, and I hear a bit more sibilance than in other earphones, but it is never out of place. I think the phones are just so much more resolving than anything else in this price range, and you will notice lisps in vocals, poor recordings or mastering, and poor compression in low-res files.The SOUNDSTAGE is amazing for an IEM, one of the best I have heard. There is a very WIDE airy stage, much more like open-air headphones vs. closed. Depth is good, but not nearly as strong as width. I find myself rolling my eyes back and forth, hearing the wideness of the staging and mixing. Because I believe the outside housing to have some sort of porting, sound leakage (outward) is maybe a bit more pronounced, but probably the very reason the soundstage sounds as it does. It shouldn’t be that noticeable to anyone else but in a very quiet environment, or if you are listening to music too loudly. ISOLATION is pretty good, with most outside sounds diminished and muffled. Not as strongly as some deeper-inserted IEMs, but still good.SENSITIVITY is high, so the Pistons are also great for portability--I find a separate headphone amp unnecessary, with plenty of volume straight out of my smartphone (Note 3, using PowerAMP as my music player—with custom EQ settings).While the Piston3 is much more articulate, with a flatter frequency response and less overall warmth, vocals are silky smooth and inviting, the overall sound signature more clinical and ACCURATE, while still retaining a FUN, involving musicality.FIT and COMFORT to my ear is much better than the Piston 2 also. The nozzle is smaller, the outer shell still fits in your pinna and stays in place better. The finish looks very nice, and subtly understated. I was not fond of the shiny gold personally though. Gone is the sharp edge of the metal shell, as the Piston 3 is mostly plastic, but still looks very attractive and just feels more comfortable and smooth in the ear. Of course, fit is very arbitrary, so your mileage may vary. I am using the medium rubber buds that came on the earphones. Tried the others, but the medium was the best fit for me.The braided cloth-like CABLE is the same on the Piston 3, but the top part, above the convergent cord, is of a rubber texture. I think I would prefer the cloth cord the whole length, as the rubber seems more prone to tangling, and more microphonic.The controls are now on the right side of the top cord, which makes it easy to tell the Left/Right configuration, puts the microphone closer to your mouth, and is fairly easy to reach. But I would still rather the mic be in that position and have the controls separate, lower on the cord, as I find it easier to see and manipulate (the current V-Moda headphone cable is perfect in that regard). The controls work very well, just as they do on the P2, with solid clicks for Play/Pause, double-click for track advance (common Android use). The top/bottom buttons control Up/Down Volume. The controls work better than any IEM I’ve had, which is one of the main reasons I loved the Piston 2.

"As an early adopter of the Piston 2, I was pleasantly surprised by the sound quality and features of the Piston 2, but there were a few things I would have changed: the bass was a bit too bloated, the treble a bit too harsh, and the midrange quite lacking. But I still liked the sound overall, despite the heavy V-shaped signature, because the price was phenomenal for the quality and features, and they were/are still better than many earbuds in the price range.Basically, I find the Piston 3 to be better in almost every way:The BASS is certainly still very strong, in fact I find it to be more impactful in the lower register with a tighter, faster attack.

I am utterly astounded, and found myself just wanting to listen to music even more after my initial “critique.” And that’s what my main impression is: I just ENJOY listening to the Piston 3, and feel that I got way more for the money I spent than maybe I even should have!!COMPARISONS BETWEEN original Piston 3 and this YOUTH EDITION:Soundwise, at first i thought the YE to be a bit more bloated in bass, with less definition. But that was straight out of the box, and as my orginal P3 has many more hours of listening on it, i do not want to make a complete statement, and think that with more burn-in the sound should be the same.I have no definitive knowledge of the drivers between the two models, but have read that they share the same driver, and from the sound signature, i believe this is true.The plastic housing of the two models is the same form factor, but the YE removes the metal accent pieces along the outside and along the bridge of the cable attachment. The back of the housing on the YE (the part you see, not in your ear) is a bit smaller and tapered vs the P3. It uses a plastic or rubbery FLAT RIBBON type cord, the entire length of the cable. The control buttons are in the same position, down about 6 inches on the right earpiece. The control piece (which also houses the microphone on both versions) is made entirely of plastic on the YE, is flatter like the cable, and the 3 buttons are larger rectangle boxes that are more separated than the very thin long buttons on the original P3. Actually, i like this control better, as the buttons are a bit easier to feel and distinguish apart. I'd prefer that there was maybe a difference in the middle button (larger or raised above the other two, or indented). And i'd prefer that the mic and control were separated, with the mic in this placement and the control further down the cord in the center, where it could be more easily seen and used.Both cords are almost the same length, with the YE being just a bit shorter (less than an inch). Both seem sturdy enough, and both are straight plugs--i'd prefer a low-profile right-angle plug, but the straight version may be more universal.The ribbon cable on the YE is harder to roll up, takes up more space (if you try to put it in a small case) and unravels. It also seems to hold its packaged form, and doesnt straighten out well. It may be more microphonic as well. I prefer the cloth-like cable on the bottom part of the P3 and the Piston vs.2. I wish it was the entire length of the vs.3 in fact, without the rubber part attached to the earbuds. The cloth fiber cable is way more supple, stays in a straight line when unfolded, and folds very easily and tightly for storage. Its just a much better cable.The YE also deletes the gold-plating on the 4-pin standard 3.5mm plug, and the metal housing of the plug. Basically, the flat rubber cord runs the entire length from plug to earbuds, with no metal parts.As such, the YE seems lighter and gives the impression of a cheaper build, but i am not saying it is of lesser quality or construction.In summary, i like the control buttons better on the YE, the cable better on the original P3 (or P2). The sound on both the P3 and P3 YE is just phenomenal. I believe it to be the best SQ at the moment in a budget earphone.So the YE, at $10 or so, is an even better value than the P3, but i prefer the original P3 overall, and both are an incredible value for such a high quality sound signature!***I have posted a photo showing both the Xiaomi Piston 3 and this Piston 3 Youth Edition, side by side. Notice that the YE has the rubber flat ribbon cable throughout. ***","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RC9CNSALP62Y6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00X13KX50#wasThisHelpful","RC9CNSALP62Y6","A2RGWCT6K2C3EZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RGWCT6K2C3EZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"They are not horrible earbuds. But they are certainly not the greatest either--something that (at the time i am writing this) over 90% of the reviewers would have you believe. If you read their reviews, they were all sent this product for free. This is a trend on Amazon i am finding disheartening. I bought this item based on the absolutely glowing reviews, as many others do, and i think these reviewers are NOT being as honest as someone who PAID for an item.I dont like to pin myself as an audiophile, but i have some knowledge of the quality of audio. I have training as a recording engineer. I build my own hi-fi speakers/monitors from scratch including the crossover networks. I've bought and listened to many headphones and IEMs. I record/mix/edit A/V content for production.This set has a lot going for it. They look good (although the gold is too showy for my personal taste). The cord is one of the best i've used--it doesnt tangle, has a great right-angle plug which i love. It also isn't very microphonic, something that even high-prices IEMs could learn from. The one-button control works well to play/pause/skip tracks. It does NOT have a volume control, which some reviewers (in their haste to write their review for a free product) state that it does.Soundwise, it isn't that bad either--for the price. It does represent a wide frequency range, but it is VERY BLOATED in the mid-bass region. If you deem yourself a ""basshead"" maybe you will like it. The bass is bloomy, with slow attack, pumped up in the 100hz range without a tight controlled lower bass. The mids are more recessed, but listenable--but not resolving, with a somehow artificial sound. Highs are rolled off, which is non-fatiguing but also not airy and lending to articulation.For my ears in particular (this of course will vary with ANY in ear monitor-style of earphones) they are very uncomfortable, and hurt my ears within minutes of use. The nozzle does not go far enough in my ears before the large-diameter of the bud hits my pinna. The sharp metal edges of the buds dont help any.As stated, i have heard much worse earbuds, and for the price the quality of the product is good. They are very well made and seem like they would hold up to use, the features are good and the sound is good for the price range.

"This tiny little RC boat is actually much better than i even anticipated!It uses a small rectangular brushed motor, has 2.4ghz radio system, and a true micro servo (with regular hobby grade connector plug) for the rudder. The tiny ESC board also houses the receiver, and a tiny wire goes into the antenna on the back of the boat.Running, it is perfectly fine as is. I had no loss of control or communication from the TX. It turns sharply and has an adequate speed.It is also completely water-tight. Not a single drop of water got into my boat. It uses a great hatch that locks in place in the front with a pin, and a simple turn of the lever on the back locks it down tightly. No tape is needed, and it is simple and effective. This is in my opinion how all RC boat hatches should work. The tiny hole where the front pin locks in is even enclosed so there is no chance of a leak there.Of course, i had planned to modify mine from purchase, so i have upgraded mine to a very small brushless motor, ESC, and a Spektrum RX, running with my DX8 TX. I have built a custom cooling coil/jacket for the motor. The simple bar across the stock motor worked, but did not provide very adequate cooling. The motor was extremely hot after one run, not even fully discharging the included lipo pack.I am now using a 2s 500mAh pack for even longer runs, with a cooler motor.The self-righting feature does work. The boat will turn itself over if it flips. If you modify yours as i have to need to make sure the CG is correct and one side had more weight for proper self-righting. I could not get my boat to flip with the stock setup though. :)For this price, this is an excellent tiny RC boat, with great features, and EVERYTHING is included. Even the LIPO battery pack and a USB charger, and everything worked great on the one i received. Thinking of getting another one, just for the kick of being able to modify it again.I do wish that you could pick the color that you want though. I got the yellow one, which looks fine. I have added some stripes and other paint trims to mine.FUN BOAT, that is TRULY A MICRO SIZE!!","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2OBV6HNK5BKD0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PXLG7Z8#wasThisHelpful","R2OBV6HNK5BKD0","A2RGWCT6K2C3EZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RGWCT6K2C3EZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"You can find much better, for a cheaper price even.Unfortunately, i sized, cut, and mounted my strip to a multi-rotor before testing. If you do buy this product, i'd suggest you test it first, so you can send it back!There are horrendous soldering joints, burnt traces, etc.that should be an indicator of its mediocrity.Once powered, 5 of the LEDs were not working. The mounting adhesion is not good either and the strip will come loose easily. Which, for my case, is good--since i will need to replace it with something much better. Also, the strip seems to need much more power than other similar strips to output a decent light. Not sure what resistors they are using, but the light is dim and uneven. This is tested with both 2S and 3S LIPO packs. Even with a fully-charged 3s pack (confirmed on my voltmeter to be putting out 11.52 volts) the light is dim and uneven across the strip.Seriously, this is a junk LED strip for a rather high price--for the amount of surface-mounted LEDs on the strip (even if ALL of them actually worked)!","1.0 out of 5 stars","April 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1C5VHOU78L92I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BS478WA#wasThisHelpful","R1C5VHOU78L92I","A2RGWCT6K2C3EZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RGWCT6K2C3EZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Having loved the original Nano Qx,  I certainly wanted this one.  I had actually installed my own tiny smd LEDs in my old nano,  which helps so much in quads for orientation, not just looks.  It's great that these are installed,  and look great and are easy to see,  even outside for much of the time!  However,  there are several reports surfacing that the LEDs are going out.  Mine are still fine,  but I fear this could be a flaw in the design as the entire PCB board is essentially the frame. Any crack in this frame could render a broken trace making things problematic.  Maybe others are just having very hard crashes,  which  I'd just advise to avoid.  ;)Also,  I had some issues programming mine,  and the documentation was not in the manual,  but once sorted out (using DX8), it flies very well.Compared to the original nano,  which I still love,  it is also very stable but I think needs more room to stretch it's legs,  so I am still happier flying the original nano in smaller spaces/indoors.  This one though I think flies better outdoors,  and as it's heavier,  can withstand some wind much better! It can zoom along well.The 3 flight modes work well,  and I love how the model can be flown inverted with no change in controls in the first 2 modes.  Flips are easy and controlled (half flip or full 180 depending on mode), or all-out full control for the 3d pros and heli masters.It's a great flying quad and a good addition to the nano line.  I love that you can generally keep flying if you turn the quad upside down in a crash, and not have to retrieve it!  But, this doesn't work so well in grass however.I love the inverted look,  the white-red colors along with the LEDs make it easy to track. Wouldn't mind another choice for a canopy.Great,  stable mini quad that works great with your own transmitter (bnf version means no radio is included).  Like the USB charger as well,  and it charges up fairly fast,  but I'd still recommend at least a few more batteries.  I'm getting 5-6 minutes of flight time with my stock battery,  with a mix of fast and slow flying,  with full out 3d, Flips,  and heart throttle I'd expect 4-5.It's a fun ride,  and a great step up from original! We'll just have to wait and see on the longevity of the new brushed motors and possible led problems.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQW4JV392RP0H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00T3JLI3C#wasThisHelpful","RQW4JV392RP0H","A2RGWCT6K2C3EZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RGWCT6K2C3EZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Good stuff.I have used this wire for adding LED lighting to RC micro quads and planes using tiny surface-mount LEDs.Its a good quality wire that is light yet strong with good conductivity.It has an outer film that covers the wire that needs to be melted off with your soldering iron before you can get the solder to melt and make connection.

"My wife and I have been getting Carefresh Complete for our pet bunny for several years. Within the last year, they have changed the formula, apparently. Now, it contains tiny particles of hay, which are in reality MOSTLY DUST PARTICLES of shredded hay. You can literally see a cloud of dust coming out of the bag when you open it or attempt to pour the contents into a container or your pet's food dish. When this first happened, our bunny hungrily tried to eat his food but became choked on the dust and started coughing and sneezing. I also am affected by the dust. My nose is running as i write this review, after spending about 30 minutes SIFTING the food so that most of the dust particles are taken out.I might add at this point that the product for more than 5 years has not contained this tiny shredded dust particles, and that this in not a one-time thing. The last 5 bags that we have purchased have been consistently bad.After the second bag, I attempted to contact CareFresh customer service. I did not receive ANY response whatsoever. Again, after the fourth bag purchased, I contacted them twice. Through their customer email as well as their online customer response box. To this day, I have not heard a single response from CareFresh.I'd like to add that I have been a responsible pet rabbit owner for many years. I have tried many brands. I would certainly recommend the Oxbow foods, but our Muffin is very picky and really liked the Carefresh after we started using it. For the most part, the food it contains is as it was before, the pellets seem green and fresh, with some bits of treat but not the harmful junk that is in some rabbit foods.We also feed our rabbit fresh quality Timothy Hay, and give him a fresh handful daily. I do not want tiny pieces of shredded hay and mostly DUST particles in his food however. I am attaching a photo of my most recent ""sifting"" process, as I want to stress that the dust is not the normal packaging, breakage of pellets in transit, etc. This is HUGE amount of DUST that is a large portion of the entire bag of food!Not only is this completely ridiculous as the cost of on bag is generally between $11-15, it is HARMFUL to your pet's health.As I can also attest, Carefresh CARES NOTHING for its customers, as they do not even respond to inquiries.This rabbit food is not fresh, and and there is no care taken for the health of your pet, nor is there any concern for you, the customer.This company should change its name.","1.0 out of 5 stars","February 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R6M6X2P8EX1S0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007CREL5O#wasThisHelpful","R6M6X2P8EX1S0","A2RGWCT6K2C3EZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RGWCT6K2C3EZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As a RC'r for decades,  I've seen a lot of evolution in model aircraft.  This Nano QX is one of my favorites. It's tiny,  so it's very portable.  It can fly indoors  in small spaces,  and quite well outdoors as well.  Of course,  wind can be an issue with any very small and light aircraft,  but the nano does quite well in light wind and can really zoom along with room to stretch it's legs.  It also has good behavior going either slow or fast.  It's the most stable quad I own.  It uses the standard 1 cell micro battery that is cheap and easy to charge.  You can and should have plenty of spares.  ;)It looks really nice too I think,  love the low profile,  canopy,  and colors.  Wish they would offer more choices.  I also wish it had LED lights,  which would help for orientation,  as the quad gets very small,  especially flying outdoors. I've put some in myself, and it helps.It is also reasonably priced I think,  IF you are already a Spectrum radio (TX) owner.  It bound perfectly to my DX8 and has never had a glitch.The quad is so light,  and with the protector guards on the blade ends,  I've never once broken a prop,  knocked one off.  The flexible plastic body is so strong it can take a beating and never breaks.  The canopy however can crack but it's easily replaceable, and besides it comes with two (one green,  one yellow) and with matching pairs of extra props.It truly is a great flying micro quad that's durable and fun to fly!","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R11Q2S2BA9K7WL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CYHZTDK#wasThisHelpful","R11Q2S2BA9K7WL","A2RGWCT6K2C3EZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RGWCT6K2C3EZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As an early adopter of the M-80, then the M-100, i honestly didn't think i would ever need another model, but now the XS is my most-used headphone. Here is why:I won't go into great explanations of the sound of the XS, as others have already covered that extensively, but i will make comparisons to the other two models, which I have also written reviews on, and am quite familiar with the sound signature of both.Perfectly Portable.The XS is indeed Extra Small. It utilizes the ingenious click-fold feature which the M-100 debuted, but as the XS is a much smaller on-ear (supra-aural) versus over-ear (circumaural) headphone, it is quite a bit smaller. I know of no other hp that can fold this small and compact. The case, which is another clone of the M-100 exoskeleton case, holds the folded XS well, protects it, and packs in a very small space. These are cans you can truly take with you everywhere.(Perfect) Xceptional Sound.Sure, that's highly debatable. And relative to your experience, and types of music you enjoy. But to my ears the balance of sound in the XS is certainly one of the best-sounding small headphones I have ever heard. When I first wrote a review of the M-80, some did not agree with me but i thought the sound was not as flat as others suggested, even though i liked the M-80 overall. I complained of a too-forward midrange. First of all, i love MR, but it felt slightly artificial to me, with a spike in the range between 1500-3000hz. In some recordings it sounded very good, in others it could be a bit harsh or grating in the higher-mid register. The treble, though very non-fatiguing, lacked sparkle and seemed a bit dull to me. The bass to me was good. My review of the M-100 was much better, although i thought the bass was much over-emphasized as a whole. As i stated, with EQ it can be toned down to sound very good. The bass in the M-100 is still very much more present and impactful in comparison to the xs, but it is not as balanced. (If you're a bass-head, you'd be happiest with the M-100).The bass in the XS is fast, deep, and of a better balance with MR and treble frequencies. It is never bloating, muddy, or slow and thumpy. I think it is better than the M-80 too (deeper with slightly more impact and less decay). The MR is clean, slightly warm, and has no harshness in the upper mids. Vocals are upfront, but not overly pronounced, with very good resolution and intelligibility.Treble is extended with good air and sparkle, without any harshness or sibilance. It helps the clean midrange to further the overall resolution of the recording. While not the absolute most resolving of headphones i have, the XS just has a very good BALANCE of sound that is very good for casual and fun music enjoyment, without being too fatiguing or critical as well. As such, even lower resolution recordings (MP3's on portable devices) sound resolving and listenable. This is what makes the XS so desirable in my opinion...they are tuned for portable use in particular. They are also, like the M-80 and even the larger M-100, sensitive enough to play very well without an amp. I have had great success with the PowerAmp app on my smartphones (currently the Note3, which has a Yamaha op-amp), which allows for great EQing and plenty of pre-amping sound. I have custom EQ settings for each of my headphones and IEMs. I no longer carry around a seperate headphone amp for portable use as I did before to get good enjoyable sound on the go.Better Fit.I complained of the fit on the M-80. As i stated in my review of the M-80, i feel that on-ear headphones are more related to IEMs than full-sized over-ear cans, in that fit is more critical and more highly specific to each person. The XS is much better, at least to me. The elongated band truly fits around the shape of the head more snugly, and closer. There is no longer a huge halo above your head with gaps between your ears. And as the band contacts more area of your head, the weight is distributed more evenly, making the phones feel much lighter and more comfortable. I did still need to slightly bend my band to get a perfect fit.  The strong metal band is still conformable for personal fit--Please search online for the proper way to bend your headband for your perfect fit if you are unaware of this intended feature.Same great Build and features.The XS continues the excellent build quality of all V-Moda headphones. They are impeccably well made, surely among the best. You feel assured they could literally last your lifetime, and V-Moda gives you the warranty to secure that. The M-100 model set the bar for the evolution of features in the line: the foldable hinges, the dual inputs, the separated mic and button placement on the great cord. The XS is  basically a baby brother of the great M-100 in almost all regards. So which is better? I love them both, but the newest model, the XS, is clearly an exceptional PORTABLE headphone: extra small and compact, with great balanced sound, that goes with me everywhere.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R36VM5GNJ4XL4O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GO4GMAI#wasThisHelpful","R36VM5GNJ4XL4O","A2RGWCT6K2C3EZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RGWCT6K2C3EZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I didn't really need this flash. I have 5 SB-800's, a SB-910, and SB-700, in addition to many manual flashes (Vivitar 285 to Yongnuo YN-560 iii).Why did I want it?1) It's tiny and very portable, and has features my very (expensive) high-end flashes have.You really need to see comparison photos to see just how much smaller this flash is from a regular one, so I have posted several photos with this review, in addition to some hopefully helpful shots using the flash.I can easily tuck this flash into a side pocket in my camera bag (Domke's or Lowepro Pro Messenger 160), or put it into a small fanny pack when shooting very light. Before I may have foregone even taking a flash, just in case.Its so small, I'd rather have 2-3 of these instead of my Nikons. I could carry a couple of these in half the space of the larger units. As most of my flash is done off-camera, I generally use the Nikon CLS system or with radio slaves for wireless operation, and I generally shoot with multiple flashes. It would be nice to carry several of these smaller units with half the weight and space in a smaller bag.2) It uses Manual dials for controls, something I still love on my old Vivitar 285's. The dials are highly intuitive, and user-friendly. I still haven't even glanced at the manual for this flash.One push of the power button starts up the flash. The same one-push shuts it off--you do not hold the button to shut down--that is used to control the manual zoom functions.Two click-stop dials control all the other functions. The smaller dial to the left is the main function dial, with selections for Video (a dual LED light on the front comes on), Sf, Sd (slave funtions), M (full manual exposure), A, TTL, and then three positions for the Nikon CLS system (to select either channel A, B, or C).The larger dial to the right serves three funtions. Firstly, when in TTL mode, you can use flash exposure compensation, with clicks in half-stops from -2 to +2 stops. When in the TTL mode, a LED light to the right of the dial confirms you are using the dial for exposure compensation. Secondly, when in M mode, an LED to the left of the dial is lit, showing you that the manual settings are in play. You can set the flash power in clicks from 1/1 to 1/256 power. I like that a lot, as I use manual flash still quite regularly, even with a dedicated TTL flash. Going into menus and pushing a button while rotating dials and such is a pain, and then going back to the basic TTL is another pain. This system could not be easier and more liberating to use.The flash shoe is metal, and uses the pin lock system, which clicks and locks when mounted, a push-button disengages the pin to release the flash. It seems to work perfectly and is very stable on the hotshoe of every camera I've tried so far.Even as tiny as the flash is, it still uses the standard 4AA batteries. There is not much space left for the electronics, I'd think. The door is hinged and has a metal mechanism. It seems too easy to open when picking up or playing with the unit, however it stays shut more tightly when batteries are installed.The flash head can be swiveled 180 degrees in both directions, it can be tilted the full 90 degrees in 4 click-positions in between. It has an outer sliding door that pushes up to reveal a bounce card. The little door has tiny magnets that hold the door in either the closed or open position. When open, you see a color graph for the manual zoom functions: Green for Auto, blue for 24mm, magenta for 50mm, cyan for 80mm, and orange for 105mm. As stated earlier, holding down the power button enables the manual zoom function, one long push for each manual mode. The main power LED changes color which corresponds to the zoom function.There is also a wide-angle diffuser that pulls out from the bottom and folds onto the flash head. It seems to work well mechanically and to provide the widest coverage for wide-angle lenses. A plastic diffuser (Stofen-style) mounts to the head for further soft-bounce use. It works fine, and clicks in place if you put in on the right way.There is no LCD screen with readouts, and I don't miss them. It could possibly be useful in low light, but you can see the settings in your camera viewfinder for the most part.A red LED on the front center, under the nameplate, blinks when in wireless modes. A light sensor is located here as well, which seems to work well. I prefer it be in the center, as many of my Nikon units it is on the side and gets covered up if holding the flash, or just seems to be on the wrong side when off-camera and positioned for the main flash or TX to reach it. The system seems to work every bit as good as my Nikons for off-camera CLS use. I often use the Nikon SU-800 transmitter in this case, and this Nissin works with either another Nikon flash as Commander, or the SU-800.I REALLY WISH THIS FLASH COULD WORK AS THE COMMANDER, but it does NOT.In video mode, the dual LEDs put out a fair amount of light, which is then controlled by the power/compensaton dial from low to full power output. The light seems clean and balanced in the image. No funky blue color shift, its color-balanced well, so I may use this function more than I had even planned--for a little on-camera fill for video or even stills. Its useful for aiding in focusing and seeing the subject in very dim lighting as well.  The LED turns blue to the right when in this video mode. In every other function the dial LEDs are lit in white.Another great feature that I wanted this flash for: true high-speed sync (called HSS in the Nikon system). I have tested exposures shot in broad daylight with a little bit of flash-fill, shot at 1/2000 sec., with great results. Enabling higher shutter speeds to use lenses with wider apertures in bright light is very useful for me.  For a few of the test pictures I have uploaded, these images were made with a Nikon D300s (my D4 works well too) whose top sync speed of 1/250 is expanded in HSS mode. Images were shot with a Tamron 60mm f/2 MACRO lens at very close distances to subject, at f/2.8 at 1/2000 shutter, balancing daylight well and also providing great exposure even at such a close subject range. I am impressed!! Also, there is no buttons or mode to fool with to enable the HSS, it just works when it needs to (provided your camera body is capable and set right). The high speed sync works up to 1/8000 sec! (if your camera supports such use).Additionally, bright or spotty overexposed images have not been found so far using TTL. The flash seems  to balance very well in autoexposure. I'd say every bit as good as my SB-910, if not BETTER.Of course, such a small flash does not put out as much power nor recycle quite as fast. I can live with that in such a tiny portable flash. It works great for fill flash when you know how to balance for ambient light anyway.A few niggles I might mention:when using rechargeable AA's, the two slots close to the back of the flash are tighter, making those two batteries harder to remove. This is not the case with regular alkalines or lithium AA's, only with the slightly fatter rechargeables (I have multiple eneloop and eneloop XX versions). I can easily remove them with a slight tap on the other side of the flash however.I really wish the flash head when tilted was flush with the rest of the flash (like almost all regular flashes are). I guess this is part of the design to keep it so small, but it would be even nicer and more compact to store if the head and body were flush. I  much prefer to store the flash in my camera bag in the tilted position. That said, the design is just the opposite: the storage pouch has the flash head tilted down, and the diffuser is stored under the flash in a cube-shaped pouch. As small as it is, its more like using the space of a small prime in your bag.The bigger compensation dial, although having nice clicks, is a bit too loose for my comfort, making me worry that the dial could be unintentionally moved too easily in use or in storage.I actually like that there is no unlock button to tilt the head or swivel it. Its just another pain to deal with onmy Nikons, as long as the design is good and the indentations provide enough force to hold position well, which they do.ADDITONAL info for users that may use this flash in a manual setting on different camera brands:As I also shoot with the Fujifilm X system (X-T1), I had thought about getting this flash for the Fuji system (which the dedicated version is now available for). I decided to go ahead and get the Nikon version, as I use Nikons for my day-job. The added benefit of the wireless TTL system with the Nikon CLS is very useful to me, that function would not be available (at this time) for the Fuji system. I can happily report (as I had hoped) that the flash functions beautifully on the Fuji X-T1 in manual mode. It fires perfectly, and using the manual dial is very easy to set the right exposure quickly. I can also carry it with a couple of radio slaves for a very small flash system for the X-system. To those wanting this flash for the smaller mirrorless cameras, I can say it would be a great match as well. I cant comment in terms of function for other brands, but it does work well in manual mode for the Fuji X-T1, and the size looks absolutely perfect for this camera. The manual dials of the flash work in concert with such a camera as well.This Nissin i-40 flash is designed in Japan, and manufactured in China. It seems solid despite its tiny size. I would be worried if it was dropped onto a hard surface, but durability is in question with any product. I will report any faults or problems I have with the unit as I use it more.If this flash had the added benefit of a built-in radio RX it would be perfect! I can see a  similarly sized and featuredYongnuo (with built-in radio) to be highly desirable!  ;)","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJY65B16PN3OO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KCWR5OU#wasThisHelpful","RJY65B16PN3OO","A2RGWCT6K2C3EZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RGWCT6K2C3EZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Works simply with a low price.  Have 4 YN560 III flashes,  this controls them wirelessly with the added benefit of full control of power levels on each flash.  Sure,  it's all manual flash (no TTL),  but it's consistent and rock-solid with no missed syncs or miss-fires or variances in output. Once you dial it in,  your set and you can think about getting the shot.  No line of sight worries either (as infrared or slave),  great radio range.  Uses 2 AA batteries,  so you only have to carry extras of  one type. And no extra modules to attach to my flashes and carry separately and keep batteries for those as well!The best part is you can stay behind the camera and never run back and forth to each individual flash to change each settings/power levels. .. fully adjustable from 1/1 to 1/256.You can hold down the left side  Group button to get the additional 3 groups (which then shows groups DEF--6 total groups of flashes to control),  the buttons are fairly easy to use and intuitive as they line up the functions under the LCD screen.A great yet inexpensive system!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3Z4C11MND8G2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MUNRSVO#wasThisHelpful","R3Z4C11MND8G2","A2RGWCT6K2C3EZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RGWCT6K2C3EZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Seem to be about the best 1-cell micro batteries I have found thus far.  The 45c amp draw really seems to help with higher drain RC vehicles.  Using them in several micro planes,  helis,  and quads,  as well as a few custom-made aircraft.

"I have DOZENS of camera bags and wanted a great sling. I really wanted to like it, but i had to send it back.Love the color (got the slate blue) and look of it, the size is nearly perfect and it does hold gear well without being overly bulky (all great features).You of course need to decide what is most important, as your whole trunk of gear will not fit inside it.A DSLR without a grip will fit easily, even with a moderate lens attached (say Nikon D7100 and kit zoom). You can also fit a couple of other moderate lenses, say a couple of good primes such as a 85mm f/1.4.It would fit my Fuji XT1 even with the attached grip. A pro body such as a D4 is very hard to fit inside.Its also extremely well made, as all ThinkTank products i've owned, and is fairly light too.It will also hold a small tablet in its own pocket, with padded protection. A very nice feature.WHY i sent it back: The sling is designed to go over your RIGHT shoulder only. After 25 years of carrying a camera bag on my left shoulder, i just can't get used to carrying a bag on my right, unfortunately. Sure, this is a personal thing--but i thought it might be useful for some to understand.

"For the price, you cant beat it!It looks pretty good (a little bit like my Springfield XD9 subcompact), has decent power, and very good accuracy. Sights are quite good, better than some of the pricier guns, although they are non-adjustable. The CO2 powerlets are easy to put in (and the turnscrew is somewhat hidden so it doesn't give off that its a CO2 BB gun) as is the BB clip. The clip works very well and is made of a heavy solid metal. The gun is mostly plastic and light, but feels OK.The main thing i do not like is the trigger. It has a very long pull and needs a  lot of weight making it somewhat hard to pull. This mostly translates to bad target acquisition, as the long, hard trigger gives you time and pull to get you off-target.Otherwise, for $20 it is a great little plinker though.I'd recommend a bottle of Pellgun oil to lubricate your CO2 cartridge and keep the seal working well.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2T17S6LL6C93S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AE00E5W#wasThisHelpful","R2T17S6LL6C93S","A2RGWCT6K2C3EZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RGWCT6K2C3EZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"To be honest I was not planning to get this lens. But I did need a good all-in-one zoom for my X-T1 as the only lens I have (had) so far is the 56mm f/1.2 (an amazing gem of glass).  Had hoped to get the 16-55mm f/2.8 by the summer/fall of 2014, but when the Fuji roadmap recently changed, and with some more specs announced and sample photos released on this 18-135mm, I decided to give this one a chance as my “light travel” lens.The FOCAL RANGE is quite broad, and certainly useful.  Sure, it could be wider and longer, but it’s still a decent wide-angle (27mm) and a decent telephoto (206mm). I’d personally prefer more degrees at the wide end at the expense of the long though (as the 16-55 will be). A 16-120mm (24-180) with at least a constant f/4 would be more in line with my wishes.Yeah, it is kinda SLOW. And I am known for using and loving fast primes (25 years as a photojournalist), so when I first saw the specs on this, I was not even interested. As I shoot a D4 on my day-job, my X-T1 is more of my personal (fun/art) camera. But it is highly capable for pro work, and for some things, I’d prefer it.The useful max f/stops break down like this (or there-abouts) :18mm 3.520mm 3.623mm 4.028mm 4.235mm 4.355mm 5.070mm 5.385mm 5.3100mm 5.6135mm 5.6What the lens lacks in aperture speed, the vibration reduction system (OIS) makes up for. And the OIS in this lens is really amazing, I really think the most useful I have used. Better than my Nikkor 70-200 f/2.8.For most of my pro work, VR or OIS is honestly not very useful to me. I’m more worried about subject movement vs. my hand-holding ability, which is why I prefer (need) very fast glass. I regularly handhold a 300mm 2.8 and have never used a 70-200 2.8 with a monopod—I just use a higher ISO and shoot wide open. But the ability of this lens to keep an image tack sharp at 4-5 stops slower than normal is amazing. And the system is quiet, unobtrusive, and doesn’t shake around. It is very useful on a compact all-in-one lens such as this, which would (in my use) be more for scenics, still life, nature, portrait snapshots---Travel, vacation. I don’t love variable-aperture lenses for my pro work either, but as a travel zoom, its fine. This lens is also highly useful for basic video work (home movies) with the broad focal range and very effective vibration reduction.The SHARPNESS is actually quite good for this 7.5X focal range. Bit soft in corners wide-open, especially at 18mm (I’d almost wish it was less sharp in corners at the long end vs the wide end) but it is still very useful. In fact, it seems resolving enough at EVERY focal length, which is really pretty impressive. Don’t expect it to match your primes, but I haven’t met any lens that does. There are just too many variables to engineer into making this broad a focal range perfect. I’d certainly say it’s the sharpest all-in-one lens I’ve had though. The multiple ED/Aspherical elements probably help out there.CONTRAST is very good all the way through, which adds to the impression of sharpness. Flare seems well controlled and Starbursts look decent too.Can a slow lens like this even have BOKEH?  Well, that is probably what is impressing me most with this lens. WIth careful study of background/highlights, it CAN!It’s fairly smooth and creamy for the slow aperture openings it has. Guess the aperture openings stay fairly circular throughout the range and help with OOF highlights for a fairly decent bokeh for a slow lens.The minimum focus distance (MFD) is another highlight for me. It makes this lens way more useful as an all-in-one when you are able to get in close on a flower and just about fill the frame. No, its certainly not a 1:1 macro, but its more useful than most primes with generally more-limited MFD. In real-world shooting it seems to be around 10” in front of front element (filter to subject). This 10 inches or so is comparable across the focal range as well, so you can shoot around the same distances from wide angle (27mm) to telephoto (206mm). This is very useful and the close-focusing is helpful for bokeh in macro-ish shots.One of the major selling points is the WATER RESISTANCE, and that was certainly of interest to me. It’s nice to not have to worry about ruining your lens/camera when you get caught in a shower or want to take a hike and still get nice nature shots in any condition (which is sometimes more productive in cloudy light in drizzle).Well, if you are looking for an exact test on the effectiveness of the water-resistance, I am not gonna be the guinea pig just for tests-sake!! Winking smileAs I use the lens more, I will try to add some more observations though. I think the dust-resistance is nearly as important, although not nearly as touted about. Keeping dust particles from blowing around and through the back of the lens onto the fine sensor is very beneficial.But being able to use a one-lens system and not HAVE to change lenses in the field is very important for the effectiveness of the weather-resistance features.I can certainly see this lens as being great for shooting fall scenics and waterfalls in particular (as you generally want a slow shutter and don’t need a fast lens)—the range will be great.It is fairly LIGHT in weight too, making it even better for travel. Although light, the BUILD QUALITY still seems high. The ZOOM ring is very smooth mechanically, and it does not creep around either. I’d prefer a zoom that was totally internal, but probably hard to do with this wide a focal range. My copy seems to be a little tight at just the last few millimeters of zoom, say 128-135mm—but that may loosen with use.The included hood somehow seems a just bit small for the lens girth to me, and the plastic is slightly a lighter shade (grey vs deeper black of lens) which appears a bit mis-matched to me, but not a big deal. Unfortunately, the hood does not have a great “click” stop once in place either, making it a bit loose and prone to falling off.The AUTOFOCUS is internal, so you can easily use SFX filters (esp. polarizers) easily. The AF system is FAST and hits the mark well!  I’d say its better than my 56mm honestly, with less hunting. It is also extremely QUIET and SMOOTH. Very pleased with the focus.In conclusion, This is a very USEFUL lens, even though it is slow. If it were faster with an even broader focal range, it would also be very heavy, very large, with a huge front element (that needed 77mm or larger filters). As such, it suits the small mirrorless bodies (such as the X-T1) perfectly as a take-anywhere but highly-capable camera system.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ATS5R2DA10L6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KZHOYSW#wasThisHelpful","R1ATS5R2DA10L6","A2RGWCT6K2C3EZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RGWCT6K2C3EZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a great flying heli for the money! I've had about 10 rc helicopters, from the cheapest Blade to 6 channel fixed pitch large rotors. I'm not an expert 3D flyer and have not spent the kind of money for the very large expensive machines to tear up yet. ;)But this is a great-looking helicopter that flies quite well for its very cheap price. Its very stable, will hover without drifting much and was trimmed about perfectly out of the box. It has a button on the transmitter that allows it to fly a bit faster. The included battery seems to give a good 7-10 minutes of flight time and the charger works well enough too. The transmitter radio actually looks decent enough for a toy (wouldn't mind if this was Spektrum-compatible and I could use my DX-8 though!)One cool thing about it is that although it is only 3.5 channels (whatever that means) is that you can ADD the true 4th channel with the addition of one servo, which is actually quite cheap to do, and the board RX already has a position for it, and uses the standard hobby-grade JR connectors too. And the TX is capable of giving input to the 4 channels as well.Of all my helis, i have never ONCE crashed this one. I do have quite a few years of stick-time, but this is a very stable flyer. It could use a good bit more power of course, but for a little fun in your yard, its a winner. As i havent yet crashed it, i cant comment on the reliability or crash-proofness, but it SEEMS VERY STURDY. The frame is quite strong and the blades seem very bendable and able to handle a few strikes. It even comes with extra blades if you need them.I love that it has an ON/OFF switch on the frame, so you can leave the battery plugged in and wires tucked out of the way before you turn it on.

"Nice cheap alternative for the Nikon diffuser. I had temporarily lost my diffuser from my SB-910 and so started the search for a cheap alternative.Actually, i like this one better than the OEM one! Although the Nikon one clicks into the tabs to ""lock"" it in place, is seems unwieldy and frankly doesn't fit well. Mine was always falling off at the worst times. This one just fits the top of the flash snugly and slips on/off, no trying to get the right side and line it up and get it to fit right.The Nikon one does have ""features"" that you might not be aware of. It has specific places that indent into contact buttons on the flash, to automatically tell if the color correction covers (gels) are in place. I actually hated that because i couldnt just use them to warm or alter the light, as the camera changes or white balance to ""balance"" the gels for the situation. Well, it never seems to work the way i want it to, and i would rather just do it manually and effectively without having the camera think its right.Anyway, this is a lot cheaper than the Nikon version, works just as well, and is easier to use.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1AFMZMPFM6SWJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BY3LQ8M#wasThisHelpful","R1AFMZMPFM6SWJ","A2RGWCT6K2C3EZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RGWCT6K2C3EZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a very nice little light. The Dimmable and Bi-color features were selling points for me. The accessories are a plus. You get TWO rechargeable Sony lithium batteries AND a charger which can charge both, but the light only runs off of one battery at a time. So you can also switch them out without the light even stopping, or have both attached and auto switch from one to the other. Unfortunately there is no dual-battery meter so you dont know which battery the light is running on, or the metering for each seperate battery.The case is a nice plus too, its small and holds the light and accessories well. The barndoors are made of a heavy metal and seem a little junky and very heavy for the rest of the kit. In this case, I would have rather had them just be plastic to match the light. They or the bag also stink. I've actually removed mine from the bag, and found that my Lumiquest LTP softbox fits perfectly in the lid cover (where the barndoor was). I have velcro and can use this softbox on the LED light as well as my flashes.The warming/cooling color feature is very nice, and you can dial it in to just about what you want. I usually dont want it completely warm, but around the middle, which adds a little warmth for skin tones without looking too yellow and fake. Have also noticed that the middle point of the color pot is also is the brightest output, as both sets of LEDs (white and yellow) are working to full capacity.It has reasonable output and light throw for most indoor shooting, but don't expect to overpower the sun outdoors. With subdued sun/shade you can use it for a bit of fill however.Overall, a very nice LED kit at a reasonable price. Great for fast shoots and nicely compact. Have used it for shooting small closeup stills, food, and one-person head and three-quarter portraits very successfully.Have not used it for continuous (VIDEO) light as of yet, but will update my review if needed (if there are flicker problems, etc. that i might notice for video use).Hope that helps!","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R38FT2K4TX905X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FL7LLZA#wasThisHelpful","R38FT2K4TX905X","A2RGWCT6K2C3EZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RGWCT6K2C3EZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This lens adapter enables the use of NIKON (Nikkor) lenses on the FUJIFILM X-mount series of compact cameras. It works perfectly on my Fuji X-T1.The metal tube seems very solid and machined well. The mount lines up and slides smoothly onto the Fuji body with a reassuring click. Lenses mount as they would on the Nikon body on the receiving end, also very smoothly with no play. There is absolutely no movement or sense of mis-alignment on the copy I have.Focus using the Nikkors seems spot-on across the plane. It does of course extend the lens even farther from the camera and makes most of my Nikkors look ridiculously long and huge on the small Fuji body...but it works, and well. Not sure why the little ring is such a bright blue, its a bit distracting and showy, but OK.Of course, you have to FOCUS MANUALLY, there is no electronic contact with the third-party lenses to the Fuji camera. For newer Nikon lenses (G-type and above) you can set the aperture using the blue ring on the adapter. At far left is wide-open, at far-right is fully stopped-down. Don't know why there are only FOUR CLICKS between wideopen and stopped down fully. You can however move the ring slightly and get in-between these indented stops, but its a bit of a pain, and you don't know what f/stop its on at all. I've noticed the Canon version of this adapter appears to have several more ""stops"" on this ring--not sure why the Nikon version has so few.You can use your camera in Aperture-Priority mode and let the camera do some of the AE work if you want. Also, you can use older Nikon lenses as well (ones with aperture rings on the lens). I then put the adapter's ring on max (stopped-down) and use the lens' aperture ring to change apertures--works fine, and you then have all the clicks available on the lens. With G-lenses you just have to guess where you have the aperture. I generally just shoot wide open, or stop it down just a tad.I'm pretty happy for the price though. It works, its sharp, and I can use every Nikon glass I own (from 8mm fisheye to 300 f/2.8) on my Fuji body, if I so desire. So far I am happy using a few primes in particular such as my Tamron 90mm Macro, a 50 and 85 f/1.4, Tokina 10-17mm, etc. I'd suggest holding any heavy lens by the lens, and not put too much weight on your Fuji body mount!","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2V8DLPQEJHJ8H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00D9BL07E#wasThisHelpful","R2V8DLPQEJHJ8H","A2RGWCT6K2C3EZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RGWCT6K2C3EZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The announcement of the FUJINON 56mm f/1.2 really strengthened my desire for the X-T1 camera (and to step out from my DSLRs to a compact system), so I preordered the body, the vertical grip, and this lens--my first and so far only Fuji glass for the x-series Fuji compact camera system.I shoot a lot of PORTRAITURE. Headshots, environmentals, bridals, fashion, journalism. The 85-90mm focal length is one of my favorites. Tight if you move in close, yet loose enough to get just enough background and sense of place when you back up some. And the size of the glass is not too big or heavy for easy carry and quick use. I also like a small prime as it forces you to move around and find the best angles (rather than zoom in and out)—I find that I generally shoot better when using primes because I work harder for the better composition.This lens has extraordinary BUILD QUALITY, just leaps above the plasticky (yet pricey) offerings of other major brands. I'm not knocking the quality of the glass of competitors, but the general sense of build and aesthetics doesn't usually come close to this. The Fuji just feels like it was built in another time period, when mechanical engineering and quality components was important.The MANUAL FOCUS RING is honestly one of the best i have ever felt. Damped with just the right amount of resistance with silky smooth turning...and a good amount of range for intricate focus feel. You almost wonder if its at the expense of a faster AF though. The autofocus does work well, it is smooth and generally locks on target quickly and accurately. It does have a bit of noise however, more than i would like, especially for video use, but the MF is so nice that it would be more useful in focus pulling for video anyway.The glass is SHARP as a tack, detailed, highly-resolving--even on the razor-thin edge of wide-open. Like all lenses it's even sharper stopped down a bit, especially to the corners, but the crispness is there, even across the entire focus plane at f/ 1.2.The BOKEH is sublime, dreamy, creamy, soft and snugly for the backgrounds.  I'm a bokeh hunter. I look at my backgrounds as much as my subject. I create lighting effects just for bokeh. So i had to have this lens, and it does not disappoint.COLOR and CONTRAST are excellent, and DISTORTION is very well controlled. My only wish would be the MFD be a bit closer (it’s 70cm = 27.5” or 2.3 feet), but its not a macro lens and as such the ratio is only 0.09x (a bit less even than the 35mm f/1.4). Just think it could be a little more useful overall if it could focus just a bit tighter to fill the frame with the smaller objects (such as hands/rings portrait for wedding).It is SOLID, mostly metal, with a superb FEEL in the hand, and in use on the camera it balances very well with the X-T1/vertical grip combo. Might be a bit bulky and heavy matched to the smaller bodies though. The filter thread is 62mm, and it comes with a plastic hood. The included hood seems quite long and large for the lens, and although i am sure it will do its intended job, I've adapted a step-up ring with a quality UV filter and a much shorter metal hood to mine (62-67mm) just because i want the lens to stay on my camera and fit in a bag easily with no cumbersome hoods, caps, etc. in the way of quick shooting. The larger plastic hood would probably be more effective for flare (I just use my hand when I need to) and possibly for protection in case of drops. The front element/filter does not turn, which is useful for polarizers and other sFX filters. The focusing mechanics are completely internal which keeps the lens at a consistent length.The f/stops (on the lens) have softly-indented mechanical clicks--23 clicks between f/1.2 and f/16--with the ""A"" click setting to the far left. I love using a lens-equipped aperture ring, as I did in film days. Makes a quick transition between apertures easy and more intuitive while using your left hand and being able to keep your right finger on the shutter release.I absolutely love very FAST PRIME lenses. I shoot in all types of environments, and lighting is not always so good-- a fast lens can be very useful for low light and to separate the subject from the background well. I also frequently use a short telephoto range for action/sports such as basketball. A poorly lit gym can make things hard, but a very speedy lens can help you to get the needed shutter speeds to stop fast motion (without having to use ultra-high ISOs). This lens will be useful for many subjects, and is actually worth the high cost for a lens with a maximum f-stop of 1.2. Of course it is not the same as having a full-frame sensor with a comparable full frame glass, but you certainly have the useful light-gathering ability of the fast f-stop regardless of DOF comparisons.There is really not much to fault with this lens. It's a beauty, and it creates beautiful images. It makes it easy to work with and inspires my fingers to want to caress it into compositions. It is a glass jewel that works perfectly with the the X-T1 camera (and I am sure with all x-series Fuji’s), a marriage made in FujiFilm-land.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2Q0IGAPK3NMQN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HK8Z9AG#wasThisHelpful","R2Q0IGAPK3NMQN","A2RGWCT6K2C3EZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RGWCT6K2C3EZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"For me personally, vertical grips are almost a necessity. I just cannot maneuver cameras as well without a bottom grip, and I shoot nearly a 50-50 split of horizontal and vertical shots--sometimes even more vertical depending on the subject of course (portraits, bridals, basketball). I pre-ordered the battery grip at the same time as the body, because I knew I would just have to have it to work well for me ergonomically.It isn't cheap. I mean that both ways: The price is kinda high for what it is, we all know that. Camera companies probably make more money on accessories than the actual bodies anyway. Lenses, grips, batteries. But it isn't cheaply-made either. It seems solid. The fit is just perfect on my X-T1. You need to take off a plastic cover over the contacts on grip(20!)and the rubber gasket over the contacts on the body and put the rubber cover into a recessed hole in the grip, align two strong pins on the edge of the grip that go into the body's bottom plate, then screw it down onto the camera. Easy enough.There is a leathery-covering over the top plate of the grip. It something I haven't seen much of on other grips, but it looks nice for the 10 seconds you see it before attaching to your camera. And I do believe it may be functional. The very assuring way the grip aligns with the body as the grip is mounted is nice. There are NO squeaks once the two parts are perfectly joined. The grip does not ever feel loose or move around any. It's just the way it should be.It does LOOK a bit big for what it is--which makes the camera look even more like a DSLR. That could be good or bad, certainly makes it taller, but its pretty slim (the cameras girth in general is much less than a DSLR). I wonder if there is extra space inside there, if there was some way they might have been able to fit TWO batteries in the grip (would probably be nice for extended shooting) but I don't think it would work. The battery kinda slides into the grip at an angle strangely, but its of no concern at all, just different.You keep one battery in the camera body. I chose to keep the battery I got with the camera inside the body, making sure it was fully charged first. With all my grip-enabled cameras, I try to just use the body battery as necessity, not for general shooting--'cause its a bit of a pain to unscrew and dismount the grip to change out the battery in the camera. But it is easy to change the battery in the grip. There is a little slide release that opens the door on the left side (from shooter's position) of the grip/camera. You have to slide it BACK into position, there is no spring-loading--just like the battery cover on the camera. There is a spring-loaded clip inside, that holds battery in position, also just like the camera.The controls work well. They basically duplicate what is on the camera. From top (vertically-arranged on the left) Focus Assist (abbreviated ""F.A.""), AE-L, and AF-L. Above and to the right is the selector wheel. All the buttons and the wheel look and feel exactly as the ones on the body. The SHUTTER  RELEASE is also very similar. Same size and pressure-release sensitivity. There is a lock ring around the shutter button that mimics the ON-OFF switch on the camera. It of course just locks the release, does not power the camera on/off. The shutter seems almost the same trigger-feel as the body shutter release--maybe just a tad bit harder or longer (I may be imagining it)--it's so close you will not worry about it. And maybe I just need to shoot with it more and loosen it up a bit.The grip on the camera FITS my hand very nicely. It feels solid, makes holding the camera in either position (H or V) more comfortable and grip-able (yea, that's what its for, huh?)I think your hand rests even less on the selector dials on the camera with the grip attached (the D-pad that is too recessed making it hard to maneuver--hmm, maybe they shoulda just designed a built-in vertical grip that was slightly smaller and then made the D-pad on the camera work better!).That's about it really. I'm sure if you are reading this you already figured most of this out, but I hope it was helpful anyway.I have already shot some product shots that I will attach here with the review or on the X-T1 body review. Maybe they will be helpful for SIZE COMPARISON, as many might like to see how the camera compares to a few others in terms of size.Thanks for reading ;)","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQ07APPDM2P99/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00I44EUBO#wasThisHelpful","RQ07APPDM2P99","A2RGWCT6K2C3EZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RGWCT6K2C3EZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In many ways I feel the FujiFilm X-T1 is a groundbreaking camera, though it is my first step into the ""Compact System Camera"" genre.I've shot with many film and digital cameras, professionally, for around 25 years. I currently shoot my day-job (working photojournalist) with a Nikon D4. After shooting film for many years and hand-processing it on a daily basis, I welcomed digital ;). In 2000, I was chosen by my company (a NYT-owned newspaper) to fly to another state and meet with a Nikon rep to learn how to use the new D1 that was about to come upon the scene. I've shot with many Nikon bodies since the D1 and own too much glass and flash equipment to even dream about switching to another system at the moment. I kind of laughed at the 4/3 systems when I heard about them, thinking them backwards-thinking when bigger sensors were becoming more mainstream, and getting cheaper and better. Then I saw and felt smitten by a Fuji X10, and a friend adopted an Olympus in favor of his pro Canon gear. I had such a huge system of camera equipment it was daunting, but I could use a new point/shoot, right? I love to hike and shoot nature, but wanted something small and light, but still capable. The X10 met my needs, and still does.Fuji seems to get what I like in a camera: not only the look but the ergonomics, features, the blending of old-style with the latest cutting-edge technology. Real buttons and dials that are tactile--you feel connected to the machine in your hand, letting it help you create your vision. No vast menus that become a plethora of a corn maze you cant find your way out of.Let me get one thing straight--I am not a ""fanboy"" of any system or brand. I began my photo career shooting with Minolta. I owned (3) Maxxum 9000 bodies (the first Pro AF body made) and shot daily news with them for nearly 10 years. Simultaneously, I used Nikon F3's and FM2's, switching between both systems for years (owned Maxxum 9xi and Nikon F5 before digital took over) But I've shot mostly with Nikon for the last 15 years, even while close friends and colleagues switched from Nikon to Canon in the 90's when their AF systems began whipping Nikon. Minolta never had as big a ""pro"" market as Nikon or Canon, but they were innovators. First mass-produced AF camera, first multi-segment metering system, wireless TTL flash. I believe the Minolta R&D team still lives on in Sony, who is also doing innovative things as well...I've had to keep up with technology. I've had to switch from shooting only stills to video clips and editing/posting multimedia, web-based reportage. Modern DSLRs shoot quality video, but the bodies were not ever initially designed to shoot video technically, or ergonomically. I could never stand looking at the LCD to shoot, so I bought the first Hoodman loupe and made my own straps from hair bands to hold it onto my camera. Worked, but still a pain. No mic input, so you had to have audio recorders and mics seperately. Most people, probably those reading this, simply hate video and would wish it was not even a feature built into this camera. But the X-T1 does a few things I like in that regards. The video feature is for the most part hidden, the dedicated button on the top-plate is perfect. You simply shoot a video clip when you want to without having to put the camera into video mode (and then forget that you left it there when the moment happens for a great still picture). You press the dedicated button again to stop shooting video. It does have a microphone input, which is very important for video. I wish it was the standard 3.5mm jack, but my adapter works fine. It has on-screen audio metering and some limited manual audio control, but no headphone jack for monitoring. The video output is perfectly fine for home movies and web-based news clips.The camera IS COMPACT, more so than I had imagined. Certainly compared to the beast of a D4. My hands are not small, but my rather long and slender fingers can manipulate the controls just fine. The back menu buttons are very recessed and are hard to find by touch. But they would probably be in the way if they were bigger on this limited-real-estate body.To me, the camera just feels about perfect. That's something hard to really quantify and very personal so that's all I will say--as it may differ greatly for you. It fits well in a small canvas bag with just a couple of lenses (my goal) and should work well for travel and even pro shooting without the kitchen sink. I plan to get the upcoming 16-55mm f/2.8, and along with the 56mm f/1.2, shoot about 90% of what I need with two XF lenses.I have this lens adapter (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00D9BL07E/ref=oh_details_o04_s00_i00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) which is doing OK converting my many Nikkors to Fuji X for the time being. It seems solid enough, smooth mounting on both the Fuji body and the Nikon lenses. The aperture ring turns 4 indented clicks (from wide-open to fully stopped-down) but you can manipulate the ring between clicks for more precise settings, yet you can't really tell what f/stop you are at (and reads as f/""O"" in the X-T1 display). I will say that the adapter makes even a 50mm a good inch-and-a-half longer on the camera, and makes larger Nikon lenses look ridiculously huge/long on the tiny X-T1 body.The 8-frame-per-second drive is plenty fast enough for about anything. That said, I didn't get into the Fuji system for speed. I wanted a compact system that does make me THINK again about composure and the joy of shooting manually and with thought. Too many people ""video"" with stills. Sure, I do the same sometimes with breaking spot news and sports (spurting away at 10 fps is sometimes useful), but I want this system for a different intent. Having a degree in art, I came into photography/journalism from a different angle, and I think the Fuji system gets me back there. Manual controls do in some cases hinder speed, but they make you think deliberately as well. I've always thought that mechanical apertures on lenses were much faster and easier to use however--You can flip from wide-open to stopped-down in a fraction of a second--while using your left hand--and keeping your right index finger ON the shutter.The X-T1 starts up fast and is ready to shoot immediately. Upon shut-down with the On/Off switch, a very momentary ""Sensor Cleaning"" is displayed on the LCD screen.The two big main dials (ISO and shutter speed) on the faceplate have a the lock button in the center of the dial which requires pushing in to turn. The ISO dial requires you to push in the lock button at every setting; the shutter dial only locks when in the ""A"" position--the settings can be turned freely outside of the A position.The function dials below these two bigger dials control Drive modes (on the left under ISO) and Metering modes (under the Shutter dial)--these lower dials can be switched without pushing in the Lock button. The Exposure-Compensation dial (on the far right) is also very large, but it thankfully does not lock but is well-damped and not easy to accidently turn.There is no Mode dial. You simply put both the ISO and Shutter dials on ""A' for automatic or turn them to what you want for manual. Its actually better, and less fiddling than you can imagine (particularly if you have experience shooting with a manual camera from the past film SLRs, or if you want to learn how to use a camera with a retro-manual feel).The sweep-panorama (with auto-stitching) seems to work quite well (as it does on older Fujis), I use this feature quite a bit on the X10.The multiple-exposure mode is a new design, and is quite amazing. I did infrequently use multiple exposure on my Nikons, but it required going into menus and fiddling with settings for each frame. The X-T1 will stay in the mode when the switch is set to it, but what is amazing is that it will SHOW you the two frames simultaneously in the VF--the first shot and the ""Live"" second frame--ingenious! So you can see the (faded) first frame while composing the second frame over top of it--quite useful for in-camera double-exposing.As I sadly have NO Fuji XF lenses at the moment (56 is pre-ordered) I cannot evaluate AF speed/accuracy, nor the quality of the Fujinon optics in this review. I have no reason to think they are nothing but spectacular, and would be a primary reason for owning a Fuji XF system in the first place. I did not want to spend money on the included kit lens as I plan to get the upgraded pro zoom lens and only the primes I want for my growing compact kit.I can say that the Nikon mount lenses I have tried (with adapter) so far work quite well (in aperture-priority A mode) and with MF. The focus-peaking modes and split-screen focusing features work great for manual focusing on the X-T1, making it a truly useful body even for those who want to use other-brand lenses on the great Fuji sensor.Frankly, the EVF is probably the major reason I wanted the X-T1.  It is large and bright, and reasonably fast, as has been described. I would not say it is BETTER than an OVF, but it adds to functions that are simply not possible with an OVF: such as being able to see thru the viewfinder to shoot video, watching changes to exposure/color balance, etc. as you shoot. And even though there is noticeable GAIN NOISE when shooting in very low light, you can actually see better through the EVF than with your naked eye! Not to mention, less mechanical problems with mirror alignment, much less (sound) noise with mirror slap, easier to clean sensor.  You can also preview your shot images in the EVF without taking your eye away from the camera--something that works well for someone (as myself) who sometimes needs reading glasses to see the LCD and you can see it well in bright outdoor sun.  I really think EVF is the future, whether Nikon or Canon decide to get on board or not. The EVF on this camera could be a game-changer and will only get better.There is a Silent mode that cuts off any beeps and turns off flash. As the XT-1 uses a focal plane shutter, the shutter does still make a sound in Silent Mode, but is fairly quiet and has a nice muted mechanical sound. Its still MUCH QUIETER than my Nikons, especially a pro D4 even in Quiet Mode. It would be nice to have a completely silent shutter (as other Fuji models) but I can live with it.The APS-C-sized sensor used in the X-T1 is FujiFilm's own (Trans-X) sensor, and it works quite well. The resolution is very good out of camera and with JPEGs even. It has good depth, color balance and saturation. I do think it can look more FILM-LIKE than other manufacturers' sensors, which I am sure Fuji has labored much at. The Film-Simulation modes work well too. I can't say they look exactly like their film-counterparts (and I've shot plenty of Fuji film, having finally thrown out 100' bulk-rolls of Fujichrome 50 from my refrigerator), but the effect is nice and the feature of having film-simulation in-camera is something missing from digital cameras for many years.  B/W modes (with included filters for effect) work quite well. Many old-schooler's such as myself can remember shooting BW film and how dramatic a red filter can help darken a sky--it works about as well here, digitally. BW pops and also had good tonal gradation. It's a joy to actually use it in-camera. With almost all other digital bodies, I would just convert color to BW in Photoshop. But the Fuji system makes you want to decide how you want it to look while you are shooting, something that makes the creative process somehow more fun as it is retro. (I do find it interesting that Fuji has adopted the FILM to its branding/logo for its digital cameras, as they were mainly branded just FUJI in the days that I shot their great film ;).The battery seems to last OK for what all the camera does. It could last longer, but it would make the camera bigger, and extra batteries for the Fuji X-series are cheap and pocketable. This extra set with a charger works great and is very affordable (the included charger works as well as the Fuji one and is more compact and includes a car cord) http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0084G3FKE/ref=oh_details_o05_s01_i00?ie=UTF8&psc=1The X-T1 body is solidly built while very compact and not too heavy either. I like that it is weatherized, as I shoot in almost any condition (another reason I am waiting for the 16-55 lens). I have the grip pre-ordered and hope to receive it soon, will add comments here....http://www.amazon.com/Fujifilm-Vertical-Battery-Grip-X-T1/product-reviews/B00I44EUBO/ref=dp_top_cm_cr_acr_txt?showViewpoints=1The X-T1, while retro-looking, includes many built-in technological advances, such as the EVF...and built-in WI-FI. At the press of a single button, you can open the wi-fi and transmit photos to a smartphone or tablet, or shoot and auto-upload to a desktop (all with no added wires and additional cost parts). The FujiFilm ""CAMERA REMOTE"" APP is free. And it works amazingly well! I had no problems setting up my smartphone (android) to work with the camera, adjust settings, and shoot photos remotely from the smartphone or a tablet (Note 10.1). Previewing photos and uploading (named ""Importing"" on the app) shots from the camera to phone/tablet was also a breeze. It just works, flawlessly. You can even use touch-focus on the screen of your phone and manipulate about every manual function available on the camera.Will I completely convert to a compact camera? Probably not. I have too much invested in the Nikon DSLR system, which still works well for its intended use, particularly fast-moving action, sports, etc. The one downfall at the moment for Fuji is the flash system. I do plan to test using radio slaves on the X-T1 with strobes and studio lighting in the future, but I do not foresee having TTL flash be anywhere near the advanced state of Nikon CLS at the moment. I certainly wish the X-sync was much higher than 1/180 as well.As I use the camera more, and acquire the upcoming Fujinon XF lenses,  I will add any observations/evaluations to my review....FUJIFILM has done a great job designing and engineering this little gem of a camera. It's just a joy to use, and its full of features that are cutting-edge AND the perfect mix of retro-art-camera...in a compact size with a great clean sensor that records nice, detailed images!***ADD 3-7-2014***Some new observations:For those like me that are using non-dedicated glass with a lens adapter, i've discovered a few quirks i'd like to share. Although the Nikkors i've used with my adapter (above) work quite well in many situations, some of the strengths of the great EVF are also a weakness in this regard! Since you have to manually stop-down the lens to get the DOF/exposure you need, you also cant SEE through the EVF in some situations. For example, i was hoping to shoot a few studio shots with the X-T1 and my Nikon 85/70-200mm--even at LOW ISO (100) i could not shoot at lower than f/11 with the Elinchroms (500-2000 Watt/s heads)so having to stop-down the lens made the EVF so dim that i could not even see to focus (manually). This makes the camera less-useful in this regard. Of course, you could open lens, pre-focus, stop down and shoot, but not very practical...this is of course not Fuji's fault, as its a third-party use. (I really am looking forward to getting a XF lens--hope that 56 isn't too long in coming!)Also regarding flash/x-sync: the stated 1/180 sync is certainly the TOP USABLE SYNC SPEED from my tests thus far. I was able to get 1/250 with no shutter blackout many times using a hot-shoe attached (SB) flash in manual settings, but not in any wireless function. I'd hoped it would be possible to get up to 250th in manual flash scenerios, but certainly not with the (1st gen)PWs and other radio slaves i've tested so far (this is to be expected as the RF will slow down the transmission though).This is certainly a bit of a let-down for me personally, as i would love to be able to shoot flash outdoors and still use wide apertures. And the combination of ISO 100 (really 200) and a slow 1/180 sync is just not that useful. It would be nice to have a body with a much more substantial range of lower ISO--if there was a way to keep the decent high ISO as well ;) Haven't shot Kodachrome25 or Fujichrome50 is quite a few years now, but an ISO of 25 could be useful for some instances, or a built-in ND filter, OR find a way to get that x-sync MUCH faster!***ADD 3-10-2014***I've received my Vertical Grip for the X-T1 and have reviewed it here:http://www.amazon.com/Fujifilm-Vertical-Battery-Grip-X-T1/product-reviews/B00I44EUBO/ref=dp_top_cm_cr_acr_txt?showViewpoints=1Like the camera even more with the attached grip--more comfortable to hold, much easier to shoot in vertical orientation. Does make it taller but its still smaller and thinner than a DSLR with grip. Looks even more like an SLR of course, but it looks very nice and the fit and finish is very good, perfectly complements the camera.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 3, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R12CTEXCU7C8RL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HYAL88W#wasThisHelpful","R12CTEXCU7C8RL","A2RGWCT6K2C3EZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RGWCT6K2C3EZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I had been searching for a product just like this: a beautiful glass that would not perspire on your hands and furniture, help keep your cold drinks cold and hot drinks hot. It does just that, and is visually attractive as well. The curve in the surface creates a nice grip for your hand. The glasses are very nice looking and actually work quite well for insulation, keeping condensation off your tabletops.BUT...both of ours are broken in less than a year.The first one cracked AS it was being washed, carefully BY HAND in a dish-pan with warm water. It literally cracked with no pressure or contact with another dish, in my hands as I was washing it. We threw it out.The other one fell off a table onto our floor (about two feet onto vinyl linoleum). As an accident, I cannot fault it for breaking, but I do fault it for literally SHATTERING into dozens and dozens of pieces. My wife and I spent quite a long time picking up many tiny fragments of glass. We then vacuumed very thoroughly. We used high-intensity flashlights to look for pieces and then picked up more. The next day will still found even more tiny shattered slices and splinters of glass.That is the reason I am giving this product one star (even though it does function well and looks nice): the company clearly CLAIMS that the glass used is very tough. You have probably already read the product descriptions:""Heat and shatter resistant borosilicate glasses"" , ""Stronger and more durable than common glass"", ""Completely dishwasher, microwave and freezer safe"", ""Made of durable, heat resistant, mouth-blown borosilicate glass of the finest quality"", ""handmade glasses designed for lifetime use.""Upon one cracking in my hand and the other shattering upon impact, I can without question tell you that the material used in the glasses I received is the most DELICATE and THIN glass that I have ever seen. I am also posting photographs in the product page of the shattered glass as well as a side-view of the thin-ness of a piece of the glass (piece held in my fingers shot with a macro lens). Please do have a look before you judge my review.Also, just of a note: I have seen claims made that Ozeri is a small American company. The box the glasses are packaged in clearly states the product is ""made in China.""I loved these glasses until they both broke, bragged about them to my wife and others. But, they are clearly not very durable. And for the price and the short life-span are very expensive (they cost $10 a piece). I had actually planned on giving them five stars and saying how wonderful they work and how beautiful they are. I wish I could find something similar to replace them, but I cannot. However, I will not buy another set as I would never be able to trust them. I am planning on contacting the company to see how they will honor the warranty (stated one year), and will report my situation later in this review.I hope my experience has been of some help, I am truly saddened that I am writing a bad review for this otherwise great product.***UPDATE  3/3/2014***After contacting Ozeri, they replied to my email within hours. They were friendly and helpful, and after getting my purchase info, sent out replacement glasses to me at no charge. The new set arrived in perfect condition. I must say that i am still very wary of the durability factor of the glass, but they are beautiful and functional glasses, and the customer service from Ozeri is very comforting. I have updated my rating from 1 to 3 stars because of that.","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2A6U6MORM7JNZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005TA1IUW#wasThisHelpful","R2A6U6MORM7JNZ","A2RGWCT6K2C3EZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RGWCT6K2C3EZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This stuff isn't even as good as the regular Elmer's School glue or generic glue you can get in the box stores for very cheap! And this stuff is very expensive for the ounces you are paying for!As a modeler, I am always looking for glues! You really need to find a glue for a particular purpose! Most glues don't work well on all surfaces or types of materials!As I build RC airplanes made of foam, I wanted something that would be safe--some glues can literally eat or melt foam in a heartbeat, particularly the regular CA (super glue)! Some glues turn different colors or don't blend well with what you are using them for!This glue gets a few things right--the color goes on kind of yellowish but dries pretty clear! But takes way too long to dry, and there is basically no tack to hold things together while drying! And then...well, after it cures, it doesn't hold anything together worth a crap!It can then peel off like the skim on milk! Hmmm. Just wasted an hour, or three! Now I have to re-do the whole thing with another glue that will actually hold! I guess if you want a really-low tack, easily-removable glue this might just work for you!After trying the stuff on a few different things with similarly poor success, I stuck the tube in my hardware drawer! A month later, I picked it up, wondering if I should just throw it out or if I could find something to try it out on again later...I noticed the label was peeling up on the sides! So, as I am a curious person, I pried it up even more! Guess what? under the blue label is a yellow tube that says ""Kids Choice Glue!"" (!) Hmmm, again.Maybe 'Kids Choice' is good for IT'S intended purpose--being non-toxic for children who like to eat it?--but it ain't MY choice for HOLDING FOAM together! (Really, I don't think a kid would choose it for anything either).Hmmm...I wonder if they used their own glue to hold this label on? It actually holds better than this stuff does!Hold the Foam (!)....NOT!!!!!!","1.0 out of 5 stars","August 10, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2YF2CQ2ND6ZD6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000YQDXJ0#wasThisHelpful","R2YF2CQ2ND6ZD6","A2RGWCT6K2C3EZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RGWCT6K2C3EZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Having used the Tamron SP 70-200mm Di VC USD lens for a week, here are my observations so far:The lens is tack SHARP, seems crisper than my Nikon 70-200mm (VR1), even wide open at f/2.8. Good definition on the focus plane areas, corners seem sharp enough to me in use with minimal vignetting.The APERTURE rating seems accurate, in fact maybe slightly more so than the Nikkor. Available light is made to good use and the lens seems to be getting a true transmission of light at the f/2.8 rating in comparison to other lenses and manual off-camera metering.COLORs are nicely rendered with a slight warm cast, a look that I am familiar with owning other Tamron glass.CONTRAST seems good, flare seems well controlled  using supplied hood.BOKEH is probably the best I have seen in this focal range (70-200mm zoom lens with multiple elements), much better than the VR1. There is a very pleasant creaminess to the background that is just not there with my old VR1. This is one of the primary reasons I like Tamron glass. I am sure the 9-blade circular aperture may be a part of this, but I think there are other elements that make the rendering so pleasant, although hard to quantify or explain. It is just a beautiful look with such a smoothness.CONSTRUCTION seems very adequate; the lens seems well-built and is substantial in the hand. As a pro photojournalist for 20+ years, I am very used to handling heavier lenses. Most of the lenses I use on a daily basis are fast and heavy (f/2.8's or faster). I regularly handhold a 300mm f/2.8, but for someone not used to handling heavier glass, this lens may seem a bit heavy, especially to carry around. The included tripod mount can be taken off, which is quite beefy (well-made) but adds to the overall weight of the lens a bit. I have taken mine off entirely, as i rarely use a monopod or tripod for this size lens. It also adds to the girth of the lens, as I would rather have it as small and sleek as possible to fit in my bag.The overall length of the lens is shorter than other lenses in this range, making it fit into a bag much easier. I like that a lot.I do think the BALANCE is not quite the best, seems a bit front-heavy to me. This is exasperated by the reverse of the focus/zoom rings. Probably the one thing about the lens I am not particularly fond of. Perhaps it is just a matter of getting used to it, but from my initial use I do not like the layout at all. I find the zoom ring hard to reach and maneuver easily and quickly. Something I need to do a lot of. The manual focus ring seems to fall within easier grasp and is easy to use with a slightly damped turning force. But it seems out of place and also easy to accidently turn.The AUTO-FOCUS is of the latest hyper-sonic motor variety, something new to Tamron and long overdue. It seems to work quite well in fact. It is very QUIET with smooth liquid turning that locks onto target most of the time with accuracy. Not always, but neither does my Nikon. I would say that the VR1 is very comparable. No better or worse from my use so far. I cannot compare the VR2 as I do not own it.I purchased this lens as it is nearly $1000 cheaper than the Nikon VR2, and as I have had several problems with my VR1, I frankly do not feel a second-party lens is necessarily subpar. In fact, I've had better customer service from other brands of late (even as a pro with NPS membership).The VIBRATION-compensation (Tamron calls theirs VC rather than VR) is I believe the best I have used in any lens ever. That's a strong statement, but I believe it works as stated. And it is the most unobtrusive system I have used by far. Almost inaudible in use (does not click, buzz or make loud noises while it is working). Also, the image does not move around in the viewfinder as other VR systems. As a photojournalist, I have not been a huge fan of VR as most of my glass is very fast to begin with, and nearly all of the time I am more concerned with subject movement vs. my own ability to handhold the camera, even at longer shutter speeds. But this system works quite well for the times when I use it. Even though I generally leave it off, the system works so well that it is hard to tell it is even on.I cannot compare this newer version to the older Tamron 70-200mm as I have not used it. I do wish that the MFD (minimum focus distance) was shorter and the magnification ratio higher however. But this lens is very comparable in that regard to the best, or highest cost name-brand versions available. As someone who owned the original Tamron 70-210mm f/2.8, I can say that this latest version is I believe the brand's best yet. Yes, I did say 70-210mm, the very old screw-drive AF lens that Tamron produced when Canon and Nikon were still touting the 80-200mm pro lenses. An extra 10mm on either end before the standard became 70-200mm. I can say that my over-15 year old 70-210 is STILL working too, still sharp, built like a tank. Of course, the AF is slow and always has been, especially by today's standards, but the lens was obviously well made.I cannot evaluate the moisture and dust-resistance claimed for this lens as yet. It does have a rubber sleeve at the mount which would help to keep rain from the mount area I guess, but I would be more concerned about the zoom/focus rings or any other area that might allow moisture in. As someone who generally has to shoot in any condition or weather, I will probably have to find out, unfortunately.So far, I am EXTREMELY happy with the quality and sharpness of the images made with this lens. In use, the AF works well, the VC works very well. Wish they had just kept the focus/zoom rings in the traditional placement.If there are any questions, I'd be happy to try to answer them. And I'll add to my review if conditions change for the good or bad. ;)Thanks for reading, hope I have been of some help.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 9, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1LEA2IGHAI69L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00A34GP52#wasThisHelpful","R1LEA2IGHAI69L","A2RGWCT6K2C3EZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RGWCT6K2C3EZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Ive been building and running rc boats for years. This little one finally has some of the features that have been lacking in too many models, in particular the sealable lock-down hatch and the self-righting feature. Having to tape down a hatch is just a pain. Yes, it works, but i just dont relish doing it every time i get a chance to run a boat or two. This hatch system works great, so easy to just fit the front part into a recessed lip, drop it in place and turn the lock into place. And the best part, despite my reservations and worry, upon my first run, i pulled the boat out of the water and not a single drop of water inside the hull, not ONE!!If you have run fast rc boats, you know sometimes they flip. I have around 20 boats, from small to larger V-hulls, catamarans, and hydroplanes. Ive built many from kits and reengineered ""toy"" boats into fast model-grade boats. Anytime you push the hull to the limit with fast brushless motors, they can easily flip, and it generally ruins your day at the lake. Usually i bring several models, including a custom jetboat, just for a rescue boat in case it happens. Ive even had to get a friend to use his kayak for rescue.The self righting feature in this boat works, and well. I have a few boats that claim they will right themselves, and sometimes they do, but not always. I have other high end hulls that use a water chamber in the hull to self right when they turn over. They work, but you also need to keep them going in the water to keep the chamber clear.This boat seems to use the balance of the battery on one side along with the torque of the outrunner motor to actually FLIP the boat rightside up when overturned. Simple, but effective and reliable.This boat is well engineered, it includes decent running hardware including a metal rudder, trim tabs, and turn fins, the latter two adjustable to trim the boat for your conditions (choppy water, boat cg).The plastic hull seems very solid, no hull warping under stress. Ive had higher end fiberglass hulls, but the plastic seems high quality and nicely molded with clean lines. The paint job is well done. I do wish there were more options with designs and colors though. Upon first looking at this boat online, i had expected to repaint it myself, but it actually looks better in person i think! Its also easy to see in the water.This boat is a perfect compact model for small areas, and is very portable for trips or vacation. I have an aluminum case that will hold it perfectly, alomg with my TX and charger, batteries, etc.This kit may truly be one of the best RTR kits available ever. A good lipo battery (i like the Venom interchangeble plug system included too) and a 2 or 3 cell lipo charger that works with just the balance port. Its compact and easy to use, but is slow to charge. Ive got pro chargers that will work better, but the included charger is still a good addition. I especially like that i can use it for trips and leave my others plugged up at home.The 2.4ghz system works fine, certainly an upgrade from any cheap AM or FM toy system. However, i really wish Atomik could offer the kit in a BNF type alternative for a bit cheaper price too. Ive taken out the Rx and replaced mine with a Spektrum receiver so i can use my DX8. I do think the included transmitter looks and feels a bit cheap, but it works fine if you want to keep the system stock.The boat is very fast for its size, turns sharply and well in both directions. Is not easy to turn over if you are experienced running fast boats and know how to throttle down into the turn, etc. It does seem to take a little while to get on plane and likes to run at a fast enough speed to stay on plane too, doesnt run well at too low a speed. But its a fun and fast little boat, it stays dry inside, and seems easy to maintain (remember you do need to lubricate the drive shaft betwwen a few runs).I was perplexed that they chose to use a plastic molded in water pickup in the bottom of the hull rather than built into the alum. rudder, but it works well enough. Ive also never seen an outrunner brushless motor in boats, and believe the inrunners with full jacket water cooling are more effective for cooling-- this motor does run quite HOT, even after one average run. Worries me that the motor really is not being cooled effectively with the mounting cooling, but time will tell. Im sure the outrunner has something to do with helping the boat self right, so maybe its a trade off.Overall, i really love this little boat. Its a great running boat with features that should be popular -- i would love to see the same system work in something like a small hydroplane too  ;)Good job Venom/Atomik, i will look forward to more offerings from you.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 8, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1JZAKMY3LWCCU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CQKN11W#wasThisHelpful","R1JZAKMY3LWCCU","A2RGWCT6K2C3EZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RGWCT6K2C3EZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It has the features I had been searching for. A completely wireless solution (RF controlled), the receiver unit can be plugged into AC and not use battery. The motion sensor works well and is seems sensitive enough, it has an alert and alarm modesBUT...The ""alert"" feature is my primary use, to be able to know if someone (such as the mailman) comes near the door when I am AT home. Instead of a nice chime (ding-dong), this unit beeps, loudly, 11 times in a row. You cant change the amount of the annoying beeps or the tone or volume of them for a more pleasant sound. And yes, Skylink, I know I can press the ""mute"" button, IF I am perched  beside the device with my finger at the ready and want to waste my time doing that every single time it gets tripped. Nor does my wife want to hear 22 loud beeps every time I go to the garage and back.So for me this is not much better than a piercing alarm for an intruder, and I already have an alarm system.I had a device similar years ago that had a very nice sounding alert tone that only beeped twice. That was perfect. Too bad after 10 years or so, it is now broken and I cant find something similar. (if anyone has a suggestion I would like to know).This works if all you want is a cheap alarm system, but it's a loud annoying mess if you just want the alert feature. And for that, it's way overpriced as well.","2.0 out of 5 stars","May 20, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R32M5E55XWCJ9E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003CWK4JK#wasThisHelpful","R32M5E55XWCJ9E","A2RGWCT6K2C3EZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RGWCT6K2C3EZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Have several reflectors, but thought i would try a smaller more manageble one for holding myself. This one works pretty well. Small enough to collapse and put in a small backpack, the white and gold surfaces work quite well for me, silver seems a bit too hot for portraits, depending on your sunlight of course. I had thought the gold might be a little too yellow/warm, but it looks nice on even fair skin tones. Has a nice coverage and falloff for head and shoulders area portraits, but i have larger ones for full-length/fashion work. The larger ones generally require assistants however.

Works great, you can bend it just the way you need it for each shot, make the snoot very small and pinpoint or larger for hair/rimlighting for portraits. Doesnt take up hardly any room in a lighting kit bag or camera bag. I just keep a few pieces for a couple of strobes, if you are careful you can bend the foil several times without breaking, then just flatten for storage in your bag.

"Gives a pretty good soft light for a portable flash. I've used almost every LumiQuest product available for portable flashes, for decades now. As a photojournalist, i need to be able to modify my light as quickly as possible. The Lumiquest products work pretty well for decent, softer light on the fly. This one is the largest and will only fit in a larger bag, particularly a laptop sized bag. It works well as the bigger the softbox the softer the light, obviously. But I also still like the Softbox 3 version as it will fit in a smaller bag such as a Domke and is easier to handle (less unweildy for hand-held off-camera use) but still good light for about half the size of this model.

"I have charged and conditioned battery as directed, but for me this hand-vac is very dissapointing. Not nearly the suction power i had expected from the other reviews and product description. Nozzle needs to be placed directly on item to suck it up, then it doesnt always stay and falls back out. Maybe i got a lemon, but it will not even vacuum items much smaller and lighter than things pictured in descriptions, such as dog food kibbles! ;)***UPDATE 5-2-13***After a few complete discharges/recharges the suction power is MUCH better!, even nearly doubled i would surmise from my initial review...so i am ammending to 4 stars. It works quite well now for quick pickups of small-item spills and dirt. I am still not particulary happy with the battery system though. As it states it is 15.6volts, you can deduce that it uses an older battery chemistry (NiMH) with 1.2v per cell, meaning 13 cells, rather than a newer chemistry lithium (polymer or ion with 3.7v per cell) without battery memory problems, loss of power, battery life, etc. Still, it works much better now with suction power and its fairly compact and easy to use. It is a little bit of trouble cleaning out the dirt bucket and filter, which then gets dust everywhere.And...this thing is LOUD when its running, so loud you dont want to use it very long.But its working much better--just keep in mind the battery needs to be cycled several times (completely discharged/charged) to get full power results.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 22, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3GGBXKLGNW75D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004412GTO#wasThisHelpful","R3GGBXKLGNW75D","A2RGWCT6K2C3EZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RGWCT6K2C3EZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Have one on most of my glass, including Nikkor 24-70mm and 70-200mm.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 22, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3N6FB4L9VV4VS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002L60TTI#wasThisHelpful","R3N6FB4L9VV4VS","A2RGWCT6K2C3EZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RGWCT6K2C3EZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is one of my favorite early albums from EBTG, in fact one of my favorite of Tracy and Ben's work. Stand-out tracks for me are I Always Was Your Girl, Oxford Street, The Night I Heard Caruso Sing, Shadow on a Harvest Moon, and Apron Strings, but there really isn't a bad track to be found. ;)Nice packaging and 18 extra tracks (B-sides and home demos) on DiscTwo.

"It is a very unique bracelet for photographers or shutterbugs. Seems to be made well enough and looks good, is the perfect diameter for my hands and arm, but i am on the thinner side.

"This flash cord does seem to work properly if using flash connected to terminated hotshoe, in TTL mode. Have tested with SB700, 800, 910 speedlights on Nikon D300s, D7000, D4 bodies. The shoe on top of the camera-connection end however does NOT pass-through TTL at all, will disable flashes if two flashes are connected to both shoes and used in TTL modes. Will not work with SU-800 commander attached either. It does however allow MANUAL, non-TTL connection on the pass-through top connector for units such as PocketWizard or other manual-only radio slaves, which at least is useful for me and will be my primary use. I do believe the product info is misleading and should state exactly what it can and cannot do. The cord and hot-shoe mounts seem sturdy enough, although the cord so far is quite stiff and unweildy to hold a flash in one hand for off-camera use, and seems as though it would be more useful with a few more inches of length; hopefully the coils in the cord will loosen up some and be more workable with time and continued use.","3.0 out of 5 stars","February 22, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/REZ4J3YGXA9L4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006NY99GS#wasThisHelpful","REZ4J3YGXA9L4","A2RGWCT6K2C3EZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RGWCT6K2C3EZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"First of all, when i first ordered this product there was only one review, which i now absolutely believe to be a bogus reviewer.There was no photograph or product description showing the cheesy printed ""Oontz"" label on top of it, which would have put me off to begin with.I went ahead and ordered it, from Cambridge. It was not available directly from Amazon when i purchased it.When i received it, it paired fast and well with my smartphone, but i immediately noticed a mediocre sound quality and volume, and was unimpressed. A day or two later i decided i would give it another listen. Same bad sound, no fullness, quality bass or treble. I packed everything back up in the box intending to send it back, contacted Cambridge who replied only giving me a phone number i would have to call for help. I forgot about it for awhile because of the hassle of having to call a customer service dept. About a month later, i pulled it out again, thinking i'd just keep it. It wouldnt even turn on. Figuring the battery charge had just gone down, i plugged it in for a recharge. Nothing. Light would come on, but no sound, no BT connection, nothing. I called the customer service number and explained my situation. They said i couldnt get my money back or return it, only have to send it in for repair. Told me they would send out RMA. Still waiting, weeks later.Lesson for me: will never buy another product from this company. If you must purchase this mediocre product, do so from Amazon where you can return it when it breaks.","1.0 out of 5 stars","January 25, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3100DKHG9A0TK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008JGR44W#wasThisHelpful","R3100DKHG9A0TK","A2RGWCT6K2C3EZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RGWCT6K2C3EZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"12-12-12. They finally land, at my doorstep. After months and months of waiting for this promised aural nirvana, the journey is over...or finally beginning.Opening the carton, pulling un-ceremonial old utility scissors from a drawer, i finally cut the ribbon on the slick box. I survey the box, the niceties of the accessories, the pretty cables. Yep, they look so beautiful, just like the pictures i'd seen long ago fore-told. ""Shadow"" was my final decision, a big brother to the orphaned V-80's already adopted into my home.The moment of Truth is near for me, i can taste it. I hold the black cable in my hands, it feels good sliding through my fingers and i want to caress it. It has a microphone near the cabling that plugs into the cans, and a button, lower, more easily reached. But which side to use? There are plugs on either side of the cans. Choices. ""What a wonderful design,"" something that seems so simple to some is something i've actually thought and wished for many times, even building my own jacks into cans in the past. ""The little details are important,"" i think to myself. ""At least to me."" Making my decision, i lift the red line from from out of the cocoon.The headphones stretch and click as they embark from their chrysalis so perfectly formed around them, seemingly smaller than possible to hold the creature. They meet the new world they will soon inhabit. The skin is shiny, black, unscathed, a perfect design. There is a solidity and weight to its shell, he seems fearfully created.He clicks and pops as he forms a halo about my head, a symbiosis has begun. My small, elfin-ish ears fit perfectly into the hexigonal cups that squish with a decidedly-restricting yet comforting force.The little gas-pump-like plug is inserted into the slick device waiting in my hand, a GalaxyNexus.Sound eminates immediately as the PowerAmp app starts up itself and begins the journey we have all waited so patiently to face...There is a rumbling, a massively deep and gutteral vibration emanating from the creature. He is breathing, and alive, as the strong signal passes through the cloth-like red cable.His first words are unintelligible to me, and somewhat frighten me with their lack of smoothness and air, a feeling of force that maybe is just a protective nature, i surmise. But he continues, the voice is crying and unpleasant, incessant and deliberate. It angers me.Unhappy, i unplug his life-source.Silence, complete. Carrying him away from the light into another room, darkened and foreboding. Machines surround me, black metal cases with knobs and switches and lights and buttons, big boxes with round eyes all about, watching the punishment about to unfold upon this new inhabitant. My fingers quickly push buttons, slide faders. The creature's umbilical cord is then re-attached to the machines that surround, a humming sound begins, like many bees working in a hive.Thirty-one bands of pink-noise envelop his life-blood.""I shall wait, until he matures,"" i think. I cover him with many layers of cloth. It sleeps, quiet and still, the lights dancing and needles pulsing about in the dark room, as i close the door on him.The night passes, and i awake. But just as quickly as my anger had boiled over the day and a half before, i suddenly begin to feel pity, sorrow for my hastened punishment.""I am his father,"" the realization dawns upon me, ""where is my compassion, my grace and mercy?"" It is near Christmas-time, for God's sake, and some even say, the end of time itself is dawning!Hurriedly, i rush to his side, flinging the swaddling garments around him aside. He is still, but the buzzing sound about is deafening. A warm yellow light from one of the large black boxes shines brightly on him. I pick him up, hold him in my hands, unplug the cord that binds him to the other machines.Quiet, stillness. The Galaxy awaits in my other hand, and i choose again the red cable and begin anew the surge of energy into the creature. He awakes, refreshed, still full of life. But now he is calmer, more reserved, somehow maturing. I move buttons on the small device in my hand, sliding them around. So many choices, but in the end, happiness.He sings to me, his voice is now comforting but still so strong!Smooth, clear...i can now hear and understand his words. Oh, the sweetness. We are both happy, as a love of family, giving and sharing.I almost want to cry, laugh, rejoice. The wait is over. He is a gift, i now realize. A present i have chosen for myself, and for all of those who have waited so long for his coming.*****NOTES*****Upon a first cursorary listen, the bass was the only thing i could hear. Way too much. No smooth mid-range, not so great air and sparkle in the highs, just bass. And not good bass, but muddy bass. It seemed boomy, and bloomy. Covered, smothered, and scattered...all over the place. After plugging them up to my home (studio) system and playing pink noise a day or two, they really opened up, or broke in.The bass is by far still the most overwhelming center of attention in these phones, but the mids and highs are still very present and clean (But for my personal taste, and the majority of my preferred genre of regular listening, EQ is necessary to tame down the bass some, bring up the mids, and smooth the highs just a bit. After tweaking with PowerAmp (using the pre-amp, EQ, and seperate tone settings) on my phone and tablet, the sound is very good and pleasing to my ears).The SOUNDSTAGE on these phones is among the best I have ever heard, particularly with closed headphones. Imaging is beautiful and fun. Your eyes wander from side to side, glancing all over the place, from near to infinity, from east to west, constantly taking in the scene. Just amazing and so fun to listen to for headphones.(For reference, i have training as a recording engineer, design and build my own speaker systems from scratch, listen to music at home with studio-rack sytems including DACs, 31-band graphic/parametric EQs, expander, valve pre-amps, and high-end T-amps, among other things).BASS is absolutely powerful, engaging, alive. It has deepness, warmth, and fullness. After burn-in, it is now tight and controlled. It is so fun to listen to, even though some genres need to be tamed down a bit ;)MIDRANGE seems to be the most recessed of the sound spectrum. I've pulled it up considerably with EQ, and it does play well with the other octaves and is smooth and clean, but still not the strongest feature. It is somehow not as warm as the bass or mid-bass--more on the neutral side, but still pleasing.TREBLE is very good, maybe not quite as sparkly or clean as i like personally (i listen to ribbon tweeters in many of my custom-built home speaker monitors), but on the flip-side it is not fatiguing at all, it extends well and is never harsh or tinny. Also, these headphones are among the best i've heard for lack of sibilance!The impedance works well with PORTABLE devices; these are a dream can for portability. They play well with smartphones, tablets, without a seperate amp. The small size is perfect, they fold up so tightly and neatly and the small case is perfect to stow in a backpack. I love the dual input ports, and will personally use them as dual-source as well at times. Very nice feature, as i like to use different length cables as well as straight and coiled, and being able to plug in on either side is very nice depending on situation/where your source equipment is placed.CONSTRUCTION is top-notch. Nothing is sub-par or left to be desired. The look is pleasing to me as well, i have the Shadow version, and will probably get custom shields made at some point, another very nice customizable feature.Love the CABLES. I liked the fact that the M-80s had the button/mic, but the placement of the button with the mic was hard to reach. The mic is still high and near the mouth for phone use, but the control button is now seperate and placed lower on the cable with better reach. Perfect.The accessories, including the two cables, the case, etc. are all very well thought out and add to the experience and worth.The headphones are quite SMALL for full-size cans. This might be a factor that would make them less perfect for those with a larger pinna. My ears are small-ish and fit inside the padding well enough. COMFORT is good, but the band is a bit restrictive and compressing, but holds well on the head for movement. I've manually adjusted mine and it works well, however i do think that storing them in the small case seems to conform them back to the original shape somewhat ;)The overall SOUND signature: FUN, and ALIVE. These are not monitors for recording/mixing, nor are they marketed as such (i own other cans better-suited for those purposes). But they are nearly perfect for vibrant, fun music listening in portable, active-lifestyle settings. I am very happy, and am sure that i will enjoy using the Crossfade M-100 for many years.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 17, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3O0HQEGHWYFNY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00A39PPDK#wasThisHelpful","R3O0HQEGHWYFNY","A2RGWCT6K2C3EZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RGWCT6K2C3EZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As a fan of EBTG since the 1980's, ive listened to their organic transformation of sound along the way. But even though the musical textures have changed, the heart never has. The quality of songwriting, melody, musicianship, and the engaging voice of Tracey Thorn have remained. Thorn's voice has always been unique: both deep and strong and breathy and sensual at the same time. She masters it almost as a musical instrument in itself; the control and emotion resonates even as the musical genres and sound blend and swirl around the voice. Thorn and her partner Ben Watt have weathered decades of changing styles (as well as personal trials and triumphs), but somehow have kept the music fresh and engaging, as well as unique. In that respect, this ""solo"" release from Tracey is not any different from EBTG. But this is a highly thematic album of songs that flow together and make sense as a whole, while still offering spices of sound from one track to the next. It's just brilliant, haunting, melancholic, and beautiful. The more i listen, the more i appreciate it, just as every other EBTG album throughout the years.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 10, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1YUMW89Q13R97/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003E1QCEK#wasThisHelpful","R1YUMW89Q13R97","A2RGWCT6K2C3EZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RGWCT6K2C3EZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It seems i've searched forever for the perfect bag.Have i found it? No, but after so many years of ""collecting"" bags, i've come to realize there is no one perfect bag anyway. ;)The Lowepro Hatchback (16L) is a very versatile bag that can be used to carry some limited camera equipment, along with personal items for a day hike, walking around town, on sundry excursions, etc.As a working photojournalist, i wouldn't use it on a regular basis to WORK out of though. For that matter, i rarely use any backpack-style bag to work photo assignments. That's why i have so many bags to begin with. Just like lenses, each serves a different purpose. Most bags i work out of are small-ish shoulder-style bags that are easy to open and access, such as Domke (my favorites are the F3x and the F803).At first, i was a bit skeptical of the back-access panel. But it's really no harder to access than the front, in fact, i do think it is slightly easier. The point is that you DO have to take it off your back though, just like any other backpack, to get inside it. Sling-bags are really not much better. None of them are really quick-draw. That's why when i am actually working, i hardly ever keep a camera inside ANY bag. They are just to hold the needed extra lenses, flash, batteries, etc. for the particular job.That said, when you are walking/hiking, for recreation/commuting, and only need your camera occasionally, this bag does work well.The thing i like the most about it is the SIZE.It is NOT too small for it's purpose.But if you want to carry every lens, camera body, and flash you own, plus the kitchen sink, then it won't work for you, and your search for the perfect bag will resume. (i have enough lenses, flashes, camera gear to put in 10 bags, but only take what i need for a given opportunity).After one day, i've only taken one hour-long walk through the woods with it so far. It's comfortable enough. It perfectly carries my slim Thermos bottle (Thermos Vacuum Insulated Stainless Steel Hydration Bottle, 18 Ounce--love this bottle) in either side mesh pocket, or my cell phone (inside a case) in the other. You could put a bottle on both sides, or a very small tripod.The straps seem a bit hard, but maybe they will soften some with some use. They are supportive and the weight is distributed well though. Havent used the waist or sternum straps so far. I discovered that the waist straps can actually be tucked out of the way inside the little bottom pocket with the rain cover. Nothing i hate more than having all those long straps dangling everywhere in the way all the time. The sternum straps can be adjusted height-wise on a built-in bar on the shoulder straps, and they come wound up and tied with an elastic band, which is the way i've kept them.The material is light but seems STRONG. The whole pack is pleasingly LIGHT without any gear, which is another of my main reasons for purchase; some bags are just so heavy and cumbersome to begin with...before you even load them up!I'm really glad it has a rain cover. I like the light-colored cover with only the logo on it. It is attached to the bottom of the bag with a little strap and goes inside its own little pocket on the very bottom of the bag. It covers the bag well, but i havent tried it in the rain yet so see how well it works. Undoubtably i will at some point though, and i wanted a bag with a rain cover.I do not especially like the Lowepro name stencil-ized down the side of the front. Not to knock the brand, i think Lowepro makes some geat products, i just don't think i should have to advertise for them. Would rather it was smaller/less obtrusive or just the logo. Plus, everyone then knows its a bag to hold expensive camera gear.The look of the bag is otherwise nice. I got the plainer charcoal-gray so it would go with about anything and not be so noticeable. The blue looks nice, but i just don't personally like really loud bright colors for camera bags, although i suppose if you are hiking around in the middle of the woods where a lot of hunters are, the Pepper orange-red bag might be handy!Inside the main photo section (which can be removed if you want), the bag will fit one body (without grip) with a smaller attached lens. I've fit my Nikon D300s OR D7000 body with a Tamron 60mm f/2 Macro or Sigma 17-70mm f/2.8-4 (with hood in shooting position!)inside it, with a bit more room for a small prime such as a 50mm f/1.4 or Sigma 24mm f/1.8. Could even attach a 85mm f/1.4 (with hood reversed or off). With one body/lens combo, i can also fit my Fuji x10 inside this section and maybe a charger, extra battery or two. You can put a flash card or small battery in a elastic holder which is built-in to the flap.You're not going to ba able to fit a larger pro body with huge pro zoom lenses in here though. But you could fit 3-4 nice primes.The top section is quite roomy, is has two mesh pockets and a bigger zippered pocket, none padded. I can fit another body and smaller lens attached in the top pocket, or a 70-200 f/2.8 even. Keep in mind that this section is not particularly designed for photo gear, but it does work, and the padding around the other areas of the bag do provide some protection. I'll most likely use this section for various small personal items though, as intended. Phone, MP3 player, headphones, audio recorder, batteries, snacks, cap, etc. I will say that the zipper seems a bit hard to open on this top main compartment at times, wants to snag a bit as there is a built-in rain drip over the zipper. Its not a deal-breaker, but it doesnt open as smoothly as the other zippers for the tablet section or camera back section.Being the age we are in, i now have and carry a tablet with me at times, which was another of the primary reasons i wanted/needed a new bag.The front section of the bag is intended to hold a tablet, such as ipad. I have a Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 (loaded with PhotoshopTouch), which even in a faux leather cover, fits perfectly. A bigger laptop would not fit however. There is a sleeve-pocket inside this zippered pocket, which is padded and holds the tablet perfectly. You could even put something else, such a small Kindle in this section. This works great for me, and provides easy access. Maybe its easy access for a thief as well, but i'd think you could feel the zipper opening and the device being pulled out of the sleeve, so i'm not so worried.(You could also surmise that the photo section would be impossible to steal from though). This section is a perfect fit for a tablet (10-11 inches max), is padded for protection, and the other sections serve their intended functions well too.Overall, i am very happy with this bag. It holds what i want it to, and nothing more. The 22L version would be too cumbersome for me, and force me to carry too much, uncomfortably.I'm sure some day i'll be looking for another bag to suit another need, but for now, this one does the job quite nicely!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 6, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RP4JQ94WILIY5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008O8EGOQ#wasThisHelpful","RP4JQ94WILIY5","A2RGWCT6K2C3EZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RGWCT6K2C3EZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Ive put together several rc plane kits including the Eflite Jenny, which was one of my absolute favorites, so decided to get another ww1 bipe.THe problems began as soon as i opened the box...just lifting out the fuselage, i could tell the glue was cracking and falling apart at seams.To make long story...this model needed a lot of extra work to put it together, i also added lots of extra detailing including wooden landing gear over the wire. It now looks very good and flies well...but only after a lot of work.The instructions are not always accurate or detailed enough either. This model has to have plenty of dyhedral in the wings which is achieved only with proper rigging...this is a must, not an option, for proper flight characteristics and structural reinforcement, and the instructions say little or nothing helpful.With lots of love and extra parts you can make a nice SLOW FLYER, but not out of the box.I now love the plane, but not because of the manufacturers work or help.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 4, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RMF2W5IRQOXFC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000W7VC80#wasThisHelpful","RMF2W5IRQOXFC","A2RGWCT6K2C3EZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RGWCT6K2C3EZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Like many others, i read the horrid initial reviews spitting out the viral misinformation about this tablet and although i was interested in it, i almost dismissed it and continued to search for another tablet. I'm glad i didnt after reading actual USER reviews, and forums such as xda developers give much more enlightened information.Although i am still getting my feet wet after just a few days of ownership, i am very happy with my investment.This tablet is the perfect bridge for me between a smart phone and desktop, and in many ways adds functions that even a highend desktop is incapable of, in particular the stylus s-pen input. Personally i wanted to be able to use the device for drawing and photo manipulation, as i am a photographer/graphic artist. Is it perfect? No, but ive been using Photoshop since about vs.1 and seen it grow by bounds. PS Touch is still an infant, but is usable, it can only get much better with updates and new versions.If the prospect of writing drawing and input with a pen is not for you, then by all means maybe you should look for an alternative with a ""better"" screen. The pen input is the whole point (pun intended) of this device, and even though this is new to tablet tech, it works quite well. I have used a Wacom input tablet for years on my destop, but was always frustrated by the hand on tablet while looking at monitor issues. As an artist being able to draw on the device is so much more intuitive, precise, and FUN...the way it should be. Thats not to say there is not a learning curve with the softwares. But being able to bring a device this size with you anywhere and draw paint etc, without a bevy of actual paint tubes, pencils, other medium, is just amazing. The software is somewhat limited as yet, but is still useable and should only get better as developers and users realize how useful and desirable this can be. I am using Touch as well as Autodesk Sketchbook, Infinite Paint/Design, FrescoPro, among others so far.The battery life is just amazing...this thing can literally go all day long. If you dont use it continuously all day it can last for days without charging.Does it feel cheaply made? Not to me. But im more concerned with what i can use it for instead of the look or color of the shell or the brand logo emblazed on it. Seems quite sturdy and mine doesnt creak in my hands.I got the 16gb version as it was readily available, and i added a 64gb card to the slot, for less than the $50 extra for the 32g model. Thank you so much for adding the card slot, Samsung!The audio quality is very good. The builtin speakers are great for their size, lack bass, but have clean clarity. The actual output is very good though. Ive read that the opamp is made by Wolfson but cant confirm, it is comparable to the SQ of the GalaxyNexus phone though. My preferred music player is PowerAmp (amazing sq and user tweaking).Wifi and Bluetooth work very well. Great signal with good range. No problems connecting to any bt devices so far. Have also used my Epson 645 to print from tablet wirelessly.Email and browser apps work great as does the Multiscreen with limited but useful apps.This review was written using the Note with the on-screen keyboard.I will try to update with more information as i use the Note more. So far i am extremely happy with this tablet!*** UPDATE (10-7-2012):Still loving my Note.Am using several art apps successfully on the tablet, including AutoDesk SketchBook (i'm using the full paid version), Infinite Painter, FrescoPro, and ZenBrush.So far, really like it. The S-pan is pretty precise and i think there are a good many levels of gradation/pressure sensitivity.PS Touch is usable for editing photos on the fly. ""NexusMediaImporter"" is a great app for dowloading raw files into your Note.You will need this or similar adapter, which works quite well for the cheap price:http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005YWIRBS/ref=oh_details_o00_s00_i00(Sanoxy Female USB OTG adapter) which allows you to hook up a flash card reader or a USB thumb drive to your tablet. With the app you can see your files and download them into the tablet from the card or drive. I use the app on my smartphone as well (GalaxyNexus) to be able to able and transmit photos out of my DSLR in the field (i'm a photojournalist), and it works quite well.If you have read the comments, you'll see that a 64gb sd card will work great in the Note 10.1, AFTER the latest ICS upgrade to 4.04. Otherwise, you will need to reformat some of the newer cards that come formatted in the exFAT format to FAT32. But if you are just getting your Note, i would suggest waiting until you get the update before using the card so you can just use the exFAT format.My particular card is a Sandisk ""MobileUltra"" SDXC card with a Class10 rating. It works great in the Note, and i have over 50gb of content on it, including music (MP3) and photo (JPG) files.I have also opened text files, including MS WORD documents, that will successfully open using the included PolarisOffice app on the Note, and are then editable in Polaris ;) which seems to be a very nice included software on the tablet.Also, i just dont understand the reviews, comments on the Note's so-called horrid screen resolution. It seems quite sharp to me. No, it doesnt have the 'HD' resolution of some newer devices, but it is my no means bad. It is punchy with good blacks and looks plenty sharp at the normal viewing distance of a 10"" screen. I have also downloaded and am using different fonts, with i think look even sharper to my eyes.The Note10.1 is a nice tablet for the price, and is quite functional to actually DO THINGS with. Until the MS Surface tablets appear and we see how well the new Win8 touch interface works, S-pen is among the very best interfaces for writing and art there is at the moment, and the price is quite reasonable for this technology.***UPDATE 10-19-2012A few more comments with more use:The Polaris app will view, open, edit files including Word, PDF, etc., and is a very useful and well developed app.The sound quality of this device is very good, particularly when using apps such as PowerAmp to tweak the sound.Battery life is EXCELLENT, i can use the Note for generally 2-3 days of use (with at least 2-3 hours a day) before a recharge.Reading works well on the Note as well, including Kindle, Aldiko, Nook, and YouVersion apps. Also using some digital magazine subscriptions.As i almost waited for the release of MS Surface, with the price now being known to be $600 (with the keybord cover), i am happy i didnt. That's for the RT version, not the full Win8 version to be released next year, with a much higher price to be announced.And the Note's touch interface with S-pen is i'm sure still a more advanced input, as well as the limited app availability for WindowsRT at the moment.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 1, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3SKCEH2187VB3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008DWG5HE#wasThisHelpful","R3SKCEH2187VB3","A2RGWCT6K2C3EZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RGWCT6K2C3EZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Not much to say, but if you own the Fuji X10 you know that it has a somewhat rare filter thread.This filter fits it perfectly, and i have a 46mm UV filter attached to the stepup ring. Not only does it fit, it is almost perfectly flush with the camera's lens.Had originally bought the step-up ring/hood specifically for the X10 that steps up to 52mm filters, but the back has holes in it that let in dust, and light, and it sticks out much more, and blocks more of the image through the optical viewfinder. I already had a B+W infrared filter in a 46mm, so it also fits this ring perfectly. And works well with the camera, as no stray light comes thru the back as it would with the 52mm setup, for infrared photography.The seller was quick with delivery and the product seems well made. Works perfectly for my intended use. Very glad i found this solution to the Fuji X10 filter mount.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 27, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2PLKQ99CZ9FD1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0084TM1PG#wasThisHelpful","R2PLKQ99CZ9FD1","A2RGWCT6K2C3EZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RGWCT6K2C3EZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was about to purchase a lower-end model (545), but then found this one on sale for the same price. The only upgrade from the 545 is that the 645 is capable of printing on both sides of the paper, which for some might be quite useful. I like that is has it, but havent used it much yet.The printer connected well with my system (WIN 7) via USB. The usb cable is NOT supplied unfortunately, but i just swapped out an old printer anyway and had the cord hooked up already in place. I ALSO have the wireless wi-fi mode functioning well too, so i can print from the main computer corded, or another old computer in another room, AND my smartphone, which is very nice. Did take a little bit of thought getting the phone configured and you have to download the Epson app. I also have the GoogleCloudPrint app installed. I've even printed photographs from my phone wirelessly and it worked like a charm. Amazing!Overall the printer is fast, produces clean sharp lines for text, and good photo images with accurate color balance. I am a photographer, and have used Epson printers for years for photographs (since the PhotoEX model years ago), and currently use the PhotoR2400, so am not printing too many photographs on the 645, as i got it to replace a 10-year old general printer i had, mostly just for text printing, but the 645 seems to do a decent job with photos nontheless, just not to the level of the high-end photo-specific Epson models.I like the clean (black) look of the printer, the menu/settings buttons, and LCD readout. It also has several card inputs if you dont have them on your computer, you can use the printer to input files from your camera and such. Believe this may only work with the USB cord connected to your computer, not wifi though.The top flatbed scanner works quite well too, and you can use it as a fax machine if you connect a phone line to it.So far, my inks are lasting pretty well. I have purchased another set of inks for when i run out, but so far i havent needed to yet (about 2 months of occasional, mostly text printing). Think the inks are reasonable since they last a while, and the printing is consistant and clean.The printer just works, and well, without hassle. I'm VERY HAPPY with it. Think i made the right decision to go with the Epson make, and this model in particular for my general printing needs.Can't really say anything negative about it so far ;)","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 27, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3EZQLMKM8578S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005IVL0SC#wasThisHelpful","R3EZQLMKM8578S","A2RGWCT6K2C3EZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RGWCT6K2C3EZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is the first work by a prolific and profitable author.SYNOPSIS: a Canadian  60ish woman is living a comfortable life in her small town as a vampire.  She drinks blood, & sleeps in a coffin all day.  Her friends/neighbors have no doubts about her being a vampire because they witnesses her reverting from a 60ish widow back to a hottie 25 year old.  Her friends get together and attempt various match making schemes to secure a male vampire for their vampire friend.  When the book opens, the heroine doesn't know that there are several male vampires scheduled to meet the lady small town vamp a la the bachelorette.  One of the contestants is not only a 'real' vampire, but he's the bad A with a  capital A enforcer for the secretive Vampire Counsel, and he's in town to find out if he has to execute a rogue vampires for exposing vampires to the straights.  It's a romance, so there's some loving going on, and it's a suspense, so someone's trying to kill the vampires, and it's plain funny.I laughed several places, and not realizing The Reluctant Vampire is  the start of a long series, nodded my head saying to myself, this should become a series that I'd love to read.  It's charm is in the funny moments, and the romances, and even the stumbling awkward phrasing of the author - many times she used the phrase 'the X of her'.  After reading it for the 10th time, I decided it was a colloquialism  and decided it although distracting, added to the charm of the novel.IMO: read it and enjoy - it's fun.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R12N04UIR9RXYJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0061894591#wasThisHelpful","R12N04UIR9RXYJ","A3GVT2F2T0YIHE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3GVT2F2T0YIHE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the most beautiful work of art light bulb!!!!!  I was so surprised to see they are LED bulbs, which means as long as you don't smash them, they will last for years longer than regular light bulbs.  I have included a picture of a standard 60 watt soft white bulb, and this gorgeous art bulb.  The art or Edison bulb is not for reading, it's for setting a mood, or decorating.  It's interesting and would actually be something cool to give to someone as  a gift.  I love unusual items, and this one fits the bill in so many ways.  It's useful, you can screw it into a normal light bulb socket.  It's pretty - when you see one in person, you'll see why I called it a 'work of art'.  And it's a great way to inexpensively decorate and 'change up' the house without buying a new expensive couch or heck - a grand piano.  I was given a bulb in exchange for a review, and find myself salivating over it and contemplating purchasing more of them for the reasons stated above.  So buy this bulb and skip the grand piano.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R7VJT8S60VC52/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00U8LMV2Q#wasThisHelpful","R7VJT8S60VC52","A3GVT2F2T0YIHE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3GVT2F2T0YIHE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I travel and always have a fear of getting ripped off.  I have had a version of this and have always found them perfect for both my peace of mind and as part of my strategy of stashing money and credit  cards in different places so I don't have a nightmare scenario where I'm stranded in a foreign place if I lose my wallet/I'm a normal size American (ok a little on the fluffy/chunky side), and this $ belt stretches perfectly well to fit both my waist and that of  a smaller person.  The waist strap is adjustable and made of elastic, so it's comfortable. It has 2 zippered pockets, one on the outside, for stuffing a few 20s, and a more secure large pocket that can hold a lot of items/cards/cash.  Inside the main compartment, there is a mesh divider, with one side suitable for credit cards, and the other big enough to hold a passport.  The main inside pocket is quite roomy, and one could easily hide much in it.  My strategy is to keep pocket cash in my jeans pocket.  Occasionally, if I need more $, I slip into a restroom stall and remove cash where no one can see the money belt.  It's an effective and sensible way to protect your $.The material it is made of is the kind that whisks away moisture, so even if you're in Tangiers in the boiling sun,  sweat (glow if you're a gal) will not permeate the bag and I think it's also reasonable to believe that the bag is waterproof and will protect your $/etc in a downpour (or dropping off a liner into the ocean).

"This is such a beautiful 'hip', retro, old world, coooool, perfect for any hipsters apartment light.  This has to be installed by a professional or someone who goes on youtube and understands how to hook up an electrical light.  It's similar to installing a light/fan and is easy to accomplish.  Just don't miss that first step in the instructions where you shut off the power.  The instructions recommend placing the lights within 3 feet so they can hang separately.  This light is a work of art.  It's not for your regular LED or 60 watt bulbs.  It's made to showcase the delicate and beautiful Edison bulbs that are becoming popular.  It's meant to give off a mood, to create atmosphere, to bring art into your lighting scheme.IMO, it's easy enough to install, and pretty.  I was given a sample for a review.  My teenagers fought over who gets to have it installed in their room.  Since it's not for reading light, we decided to use it in an area as a decoration.

"This stuff is a tasty tea.  It's like a cross between a bold green tea and one of those specialty teas that someone gives you for Christmas that are all fruffy.

"This is for capturing VHS or other types of video to your computer.  I was given a sample to review, so I hooked it up to and ran the software on my laptop with windows 8, and after loading the two software programs was able to capture video from an old VHS VCR tape player.PROS:It is relatively simple to set up and it has windows movie maker type controls, only with more transitions and you can fuzz out a face if you like.It’s an inexpensive way to capture your old home movies.  Years ago, I bought a DVD recorder for saving my old movies.  This EZCAP will do the  trick and it’s many times cheaper.  If you send out your videos to some company to transfer over to DVD, they will charge you potentially hundreds of $$.There is a quick start guide with the item, but a more detailed and easy to understand manual is included on the disc.  I consulted the manual on the disc several times, and found it to be quite helpful.The box says it only works on XP and Vista, but  I was using Windows 8 and it worked ok.The editing software is easy and even has an “Upload to Youtube” option.You can edit (add names and dates or transitions or even make little movies) and burn them to a CD/DVD or just upload to Youtube.CONS:Remember there are TWO programs on the disc, they don’t automatically install - you have to install both the driver and the program “arc soft showbiz”.My video capture from VHS flickered to black occasionally.  I’m reasonably sure the tape and machine work, but as old as they are - and face it, they weren’t meant to last this many years - it could be a tape error.BOTTOM LINE:If you’re in the market to save your memories to digital, and don’t want to spend hundreds of $, this is a safe bet.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R196ZDZHARI8KY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012DRTEHW#wasThisHelpful","R196ZDZHARI8KY","A3GVT2F2T0YIHE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3GVT2F2T0YIHE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I got these so my pet sitter doesn't have to open or move my bird cages around too much to water my birds.  My one complaint is that since it's a new item, my birds decided to pull them off the cage wall and toss them into the bottom.  I would NOT rely on them as the sole source of water for your pet, but as a supplement or a bathing bowl, or for special food treats, it's a good investment.

"Bought these for a bd party - I used paper clips to hold them together rather than the provided double side tape.  For one reason it can be taken down and reused again - and another is that the double sided tape doesn't really hold them together.  I should deduct a start because several of them only had a hole in one side of the paper where you bring it together and hang it from the ceiling.  I had to punch a hole in the other side while standing on a 8 ft ladder and I did NOT appreciate that.  However, they are cute and festive and friendly and cheap and helped make my party a hit, so I'll give them the coveted 5th star.  Also it comes with little perhaps 12 inch string when tied - but I threw them away and used fishing line and paper clips to attach them to the drop ceiling.  Watch what kind of ceiling you're going to encounter, because a flat or popcorn ceiling can't hold them.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3VC3M0GMQ2DT1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004XATGIA#wasThisHelpful","R3VC3M0GMQ2DT1","A3GVT2F2T0YIHE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3GVT2F2T0YIHE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is such a beautiful subtle scent.  You would think the lavender would be overpowering since it's concentrated, but it's just right.  I put a few drops on a hanky and stuffed it into my purse, it provided a  whiff  of happiness every time I opened my purse.  I put a drop on a piece of paper next to my computer screen and have enjoyed the quiet scent enormously.  The concentrate can be dropped into a diffuser and make your whole room/house smell like lavender - but not the ""hey - someone dumped a lavender bush in here & stomped on it"" kind of smell, it's a grown up - subtle - ""I'm here when you notice me and I'm beautiful"" kind of scent.

You can pick up anything from your oven and the mitts do not transfer the heat to your hands.  They are a loud and fun color and come with a basting thing for BBQ as a bonus.  I love the fact that I hang them on my cabinet door, and simply grab them when pulling stuff in and out of the oven .Honestly, I was a little scared the first time I used them because they are so revolutionary and lightweight and so completely unlike anything I'd use to protect my hands from burns.

I don't think dogs care about flavor, (I mean they roll around in dead animals and poo!) but the flavor seems to be more than ok by the dog.The dog is not acting like a puppy, but the Glucosamine has a positive effect on him.

"My daughter loves her Nintendo, and this case is PERFECT for keeping all the little expensive cartridges in place.

It has a separator that pulls out that has a net like pouch to store the cord for the Nintendo unit.  The zipper comes with two pulls, and it has a clip on that can be attached to a belt, or a backpack.  This is designed for a young kid/teen, and it is made with durability in mind.

I found and settled on some Trader Joe's brand blueberries at my local Trader Joe's for 3.99 for 1.2 oz several days ago as an alternative, but thought I'd see what Amazon had to offer seeing that the flavor was not as good as the Crunchies brand. I decided to try the Honeyville Farms brand here. Although these are about $5 more expensive by weight for 12oz than the Crunchies brand blueberries, they are much more dry and crispier. They also have a very good flavor. Make sure you get a nice air tight sealing container to put them in after the can is opened.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RULCY3PEC7BN8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0006ZN4ZM#wasThisHelpful","RULCY3PEC7BN8","A3LIF253SVDRMW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LIF253SVDRMW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"After trying the Columbia, Timberland, and Quicksilver quarter socks, I ended up settling on the Timberland socks. The Columbia socks tend to have some annoying spots around the toes that rub. The Columbia socks are a bit thicker than the Timberlands, but the Timberlands are more comfortable all around. None of the 3 made my feet stink like some other brand socks.

"I just needed a large water pitcher since I hate having to constantly fill up the smaller ones since you have to wait what seems like hours for the water to flow through filters. Of course the LED didn't work on mine either when it arrived, but I don't really care since the pitcher is otherwise designed very well.The spout is narrow so that water doesn't go everywhere. If you start pouring water before the water has filtered through from the top, it doesn't leak. Also, the flip open top to refill the pitcher makes it so you don't have to take the entire top off to fill from a faucet like most pitchers.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RYHSCUGBHP7FN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IK5A68I#wasThisHelpful","RYHSCUGBHP7FN","A3LIF253SVDRMW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LIF253SVDRMW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I can't say enough good things about this camera. I've been working with IP and camera technology for many years, and have tested hundreds of cameras. This thing is spectacular for the price. I did purchased these elsewhere though since I found better pricing, but I had to patiently wait a month for the seller to ship them, and another 2 weeks for them to arrive. I also have only used these with firmware version 5.2.5 and 5.2.8. If you absolutely need pan/tilt, the Foscam FI9831W seems to be the only competition with a name brand manufacturer supporting it in this price range at this time, but still has nowhere near the features and functionality.Highlights:• Image quality is outstanding. It even has pretty fair low light capabilities with the IR LED disabled. (Make sure you enable WDR if need be - it's not enabled by default. Also I tweak up the brightness slightly).• The IR LED is amazing (and can be disabled if you're pointing it out a window)• The features available in the web interface are entirely unsurpassed.• Audio sensitivity is adjustable through the web interface, unlike other manufacturer’s cameras, and can be tweaked to be VERY sensitivity. Note that you need to go in and enable audio on the stream settings if you want to hear audio!• Video motion detection and local SD recording is great (make sure you get a fast SD card). If you're indoors though, and not facing out a window, you should be using the super awesome PIR sensor instead of video motion detection for 99.999% accuracy. If you're doing video motion detection, enable ""Dynamic Analysis for Motion"" and ""rules"" under location configuration so that it will draw rectangles around motion detection objects in the live view for fine tuning motion detection. SD card recording automatic overwrite of older recordings is enabled by default. It supports adjustable pre (up to 30s) and post (up to 10m) event recording. It also supports multiple NAS devices.• Endless customization options and settings! (Therefore don’t buy this if you’re an idiot, or if you’re an idiot and don’t have a 10 year old to help you set this up).  For any IP camera, you need to understand port forwarding, bandwidth, IP addressing, and frame rates, so don’t be lazy and do some reading first!!!• For people who are concerned about their privacy and don’t want others viewing your video, you can disable P2P (point to point) capabilities (this is under Platform Access). I don’t know why people are so lazy and sacrifice their privacy and buy those plug & play / point to point cameras!!• Be sure to choose the right lens when buying this. There are several options. I have these with 2.8mm and 4mm lenses that I use for different applications. Buy the 2.8 if you’re viewing close range and want a very wide angle of view such as a vestibule, garage, porch, etc.. Buy the 4mm, or larger, if the camera iss going to be looking down a hallway or down a street.• Wireless works great and supports all the latest security protocols.• PoE works fine.• Supports SSL,DDNS, NTP (make sure you adjust the DST settings since the timing is wrong, and make sure you set the offset to 60 minutes), FTP, SMTP alerts, QoS, SNMP, etc. etc.Drawbacks:• The biggest drawback is that the latest versions of firmware aren’t readily available. I’ve had these cameras for months now and have yet to see version 5.2.5 or 5.2.8 posted on any of Hikvision’s web sites. Hikvision, if you’re listening, please always post the latest versions of firmware on your site!!! You’re only hurting your sales by not posting firmware updates.• I haven’t been able to use talk back through the web interface and Firefox. This may just be a problem with my particular setup. When I try using talk back with Tinycam for Android, I get a bunch of static at first, then it works so-so. I don’t really care about the talk back since I’m not using them as a video intercom.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3TOS8UFI1LIEW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JWCV9CU#wasThisHelpful","R3TOS8UFI1LIEW","A3LIF253SVDRMW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LIF253SVDRMW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have an old Dell 1700 that I've got quite a bit of use out of. It was very straight forward to refill the cartridge for it. My advice would be to wear a painter's mask so that you don't breathe the stuff in, make sure you lay down a bunch of newspaper on the floor, and be sure to clip the top of the nozzle to make it larger. This stuff is super fine and very messy, especially as you're trying to squeeze the bottle to get it all in the cartridge - it sort of poofs up everywhere when you squeeze the bottle. So, if you clip the top of the nozzle there's more of a chance it will just pour into the cartridge rather than you have to squeeze the bottle. I also needed to use a piece of double sided scotch tape to mount the new chip on the cartridge.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RDC3GUDEOUKF3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004BH0VL6#wasThisHelpful","RDC3GUDEOUKF3","A3LIF253SVDRMW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LIF253SVDRMW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I read a lot of the reviews on this camera and similar cameras before purchasing it. First, I decided on this over the FI9826W which adds 3x optical zoom, since there appears to be no manual focus on that, and where these cameras are going, I don't really need it. Second, I can't believe people don't care about their privacy enough to avoid so called P2P (point to point)/Plug and Play cameras, which actually make use of a third party server to relay video to your portable device when it's outside of your home network - these cameras are for lazy people who don't want to bother reading how to or have someone setup VPN or port forwarding on their home router to access their home network, all at the expense of video from your home open for others to see! I'm happy to have a camera that is not P2P, and if you value your privacy, you should be avoiding P2P/Plug and Play cameras at all cost!!Also, even if you don't get the plug and play cameras, be sure to access your camera using SSL (HTTPS). This camera does support SSL access, you just need to be sure to use it that way and setup the appropriate port forward as necessary (the standard port is 443). Another option would be to use VPN to access your home network/cameras without https (less taxing on the camera CPU). If you don't use HTTPS, all of your video, as well as your username and password when you login are sent unencrypted over the Internet for anyone in between to view. Foscam cameras don't automatically redirect you to SSL. Android and Apple devices natively support PPTP VPN, so buy a router that supports PPTP VPN if yours does not, or install something like dd-wrt on your router if it supports it. Also, note that this camera has an option to enable dynamic DNS provided by the manufacturer so you can use the address shown in the camera's setup to access it.I fail to understand how anyone could have so much trouble setting these Foscam cameras up! I had mine up and running within 15 minutes!  If you don't know anything about computers, you're lazy, are illiterate, don't know how to use Google, don't have a 6 year old accessible to you, then you'll probable have a problem and I wouldn't buy this camera. People that are morons or too lazy to education themselves about what they're purchasing should have a stamp on their forehead and be blacklisted! They just bring up the price for everyone else with ridiculous tech support calls costing companies money and forcing them to outsource tech support to India. Think about how cheap this camera is relevant to what it can do and how much they have to pay tech support people to answer calls from lazy people! The rest of us are paying for their calls in the price of the camera. If you can't understand the concept of IP addressing, port forwarding, and dynamic DNS, and don't have someone around that does (pretty rare in today's world), just don't buy a network camera. End of story. If you choose to buy a P2P/Plug & Play camera, just be aware that your video is not private, and will also suffer from somewhat greater lag time.I did find a better deal elsewhere on a bundle of 2 of these cameras with mounts, power extension cables, and high gain antennas. I had no problems using Internet Explorer or Firefox to configure them, but had no real plans to use a browser to access them, and there's plenty of third party software you can use with this since it supports standard video and audio transport protocols, and you should plan on using third party software from the get go (ie Blue Iris, TinyCam, etc.). Android is the better platform for remote camera viewing in general since Android is an open platform, has more flexible API's, support, and there are better, and cheaper apps out there in general. There are plenty of software options out there for PC, Android, and Apple though. TinyCam is definitely the best for Android, and also supports accessing this camera with SSL. At the price, Foscam can't possibly support every odd-ball system out there, so please understand that. Let Foscam concentrate on delivering us the hardware at a reasonable price that works and that we can all afford!! Third party software is CHEAP (TinyCam has a free version, and a few dollars for the pro version), and as long as you get standards based cameras such as these, there won't be a problem. This camera supports both modern H.264 video streaming with dual streams, as well as MJPEG (continuous jpeg snapshots), and I had no problems using Blue Iris (PC Based) or TinyCam (for Android), or even VLC media player (RTSP/H.264) with the camera. If you are using TinyCam as your viewer with H.264 mode, the video had some artifacts in it for the first several seconds, but only when trying to use the H/W decoder option (a TinyCam/Android problem - so just stick with the default S/W decoder setting). Other than this, using TinyCam works great, including control over the pan/tilt, and IR LEDs, and two way audio.One VERY important note (following 4 paragraphs):When viewing the video over a cellular network, you need to have sufficient bandwidth and signal. I recommend viewing the RTSP sub stream, NOT the main stream, and setting the RTSP stream to a much lower resolution and frame rate than the Main stream so that you will be able to view it without connection errors, pauses, etc. due to delay lack of bandwidth on the cellular network. This will also save a ton on your bandwidth quota!  Also, on small screens, unless you are pinch zooming a lot, you're likely not going to notice a big difference. Never ever use the MJPEG stream over a cellular network - it consumes a ton of bandwidth, and you also don't get audio. The RTSP stream URLs for the Main and Sub streams are, assuming you left the camera on port 88 (replace username, password, and camera_ip_or_hostname with your values):rtsp://username:password@camera_ip_or_hostname:88/videoMainrtsp://username:password @ camera_ip_or_hostname:88/videoSubNote there are a couple different methods to access the MJPEG stream from this camera. I'll leave those for you to Google.When you are viewing the video locally, or over a remote network with high bandwidth available, obviously choose the main stream. If you are using TinyCam, there is a checkbox under Video Settings to choose ""2G Low-bandwidth Profile"". If you setup your Foscam cameras by specifying the make and model, TinyCam will use the sub stream when you select the ""2G Low-bandwidth profile"" checkbox.The stream selection and setup process is one thing that is not very well designed in the web interface and is very convoluted, but once you get it, it's understandable. It functions entirely different from most cameras on the market. In the web interface, when you go to the Settings tab, then click Video, then Video Settings, here you will find what are actually presets for the Main and Sub streams - they don't actually change the active stream settings, they are only presets. When you login to the camera, there is a drop down box that gives you the option of what stream to view. If you want to change the preset that the sub stream uses, you must change this from Main stream to Sub stream, then login. Under the Live Video tab (already selected if you just logged in), here you will select the preset that the stream actually uses (both when viewing through the web interface, or third party RTSP/MJPEG viewers). There is no save button, which almost leads someone to believe that this setting is just for the current viewing session in the browser, but it is not, it is actually setting the resolution for the RTSP stream!I also upgraded to the latest firmware after setting my FI9831W's up. Though there were two firmware files required for upgrading and it took several minutes, and a two step procedure, it was extremely easy.If you don't need the pan/tilt functionality, I recommend taking a look at an app called IP Webcam for Android. It will turn any old Android phone into a high res MJPEG surveillance camera. (Remember though that MJPEG compressesion consumes an enormous amount of bandwidth, so it is not generally practical for viewing over cellular networks). You do need a phone with a good low light camera though. Also, take a look at the Hikvision DS-2CD2432F-IW. There are plenty of discussions regarding it on the web if you want to read up on it, and you should be able to grab one for under $130 including shipping at the time I wrote this. Just make certain you specify the 2.8mm wide angle lens when you order it unless you are monitoring something far away from the camera, since if you do not specify, it will ship with the 4mm lens. You may also need an external IR illuminator since the internal LED is of limited range (see online reviews). The Hikvision camera also adds a PIR (passive infrared) sensor for motion detection, which unlike video motion detection that the Foscam cameras are limited by, as well as most others, it is not vulnerable to lighting and other artifacts - it's the same technology used in home and business motion detectors for security systems.Anyhow, I've tested and used nearly 60 different cameras over the last several years, and for the price, this Foscam camera is pretty decent and has a good feature set, hence the 4 star review. In reality, I would give it 3 stars.The cons for me are:¤ There are a couple bugs with the web browser/plugin interface display. The Stream selection drop down box under the Live Video tab is truncated, and the selection boxes for setting the motion detection area under the alarm settings are truncated.¤ I don't like the fact that you can't configure the camera without the plug-in installed and a compatible browser. Without the plug-in installed, it would be nice if you at least had some limited functionality that would just let you set the IP address, SSID, etc. and other settings that wouldn't necessarily require¤In low light without the IR LEDs enabled, the CMOS sensor and DSP starts producing strange artifacts in the video. However, compared to anything else out there in the price range, the FI9831W is still best in its class.¤The internal microphone produces a terrible digital static noise when the camera gets cold, specifically below about 35 degrees Fahrenheit.  It gets to the point that you can't hear anything besides the static noise. You can observe this on your camera by placing the camera in a freezer for a little while, giving it time to cool.  I wanted to place one of these cameras outside in an enclosed area, but learned quickly that wasn't going to be possible if I wanted audio. Even with an external microphone plugged in, there was still noise in colder temperatures. I brought this to Foscam's attention, and they're supposedly investigating the issue, but obviously to correct this issue, it's going to be more than just a firmware fix.¤There should be a gain control in the web interface to set the microphone sensitivity. Even though the microphone sensitivity is worlds better than previous models, I've heard better (and I've heard worse). IP Webcam for Android combined with most phones has amazing microphone sensitivity, for example. You can attach an external high gain microphone, though I haven't tried one out yet on this. If you Google, Foscam microphone fi9831w, the first hit is people complaining about the microphone issues. If you know about electronics, and don't mind voiding your warranty, you may be able to open the case, and put in a lower value resistor as mentioned in the link.¤You can't relocate the position of the on screen Date/Timestamp/Camera Name, or change the size, which is exceptionally massive when viewing the lower resolution streams, and can hide video. All you can do is disable it.¤ If you have problems with the alarm functionality, the camera being slow, or choppy video, you might want to reduce the frame rate to 10-12 fps. 12 fps is still pretty decent unless you're trying to catch cars driving by at 60mph. Other than adjusting the FPS, try reducing the video resolution (running this at 720P will be less taxing on the CPU). Video consumes a ton of CPU, and changing the FPS and res will spare some more CPU for motion detection, alarms, and other functionality.¤The motion detection area setup is buggy. The video motion detection area display hides the options in the browser (both IE and Firefox). I've notified Foscam about this issue. Also, although you can setup multiple detection areas, you can't control the sensitivity of each one individually.¤There is no external alarm input/output. Video motion detection is inherently inaccurate. It would be nice if these had alarm I/O like most other cameras to be able to hook up an external I/R sensor (they are about $10) for 99.9% motion detection accuracy.Some pros are:¤The pan/tilt through the browser and apps works very will, with a good network connection. Expect some lag over cellular networks. I've seen other cameras have all sorts of issues with Pan/Tilt. Mirror/Flip works well if you need to ceiling mount this.¤Very good video quality when there's lots of light, or when the IR LEDs are on (note that it switches to black/white).¤You can set the IR LEDs to manual or automatic. Many cameras out there don't give you the option.¤It has most of the features you can think of - SMTP mail alerts with attachments, upload to FTP server,PLEASE MARK THIS REVIEW HELPFUL , and so OTHERS CAN KNOW ABOUT THE DANGERS OF P2P (and how to select a camera)!","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R37BI33MYSIU2I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HVLDRAQ#wasThisHelpful","R37BI33MYSIU2I","A3LIF253SVDRMW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LIF253SVDRMW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I purchased this under a second listing here on Amazon. I've used this for about a week now, and it appears to be working pretty good. My only issue is that if you don't use the transmitter remote for a while, the display backlight will turn off for power saving(fine), and then the LCD display (low energy usage anyway) will completely turn off (not so fine since it will take longer if you want to see what your settings are first). When you press a button on the transmitter after going to sleep like this, the transmitter/remote wakes up and then the display looks like it's transmitting (the antenna icon on on the LCD flashes), but it's actually not. You actually have to wake the transmitter up first by hitting a button, then wait about a second (I tested - you can't just rapidly click the button you want twice) until the antenna icon shows on the LCD, then press a button again. If you forget this double step, or think your remote is already awake, it is often too late to catch your pet in the middle of doing something bad, especially since it'll probably take you at least several seconds to locate the remote, find the buttons you want, adding a critical delay.Since it takes about 4 hours to charge, and the battery lasts about 30 hours after being charged (I'm sure it won't last as long as the battery ages), you should consider purchasing the two receiver version of this (AT-211SW-2). Also, make sure you pay attention to the instructions as there are a few odd things, as well as a couple things I noted here. There is a red and a blue LED on the top. When the collar is active, the blue LED will blink about every 15 seconds. When it's charging the red LED will be lit. When charging is complete, the blue and red LED's will both be lit. After unplugging it, the red LED will be lit. The red LED will even stay lit after disconnecting the collar receiver from the charger. However, this means that it's waiting for a signal from the remote to pair with it. So, after each charge, you must repair the remote with the collar. I believe this is because you can have multiple remotes and collars with this system. This isn't really a big deal. If you aren't going to use the collar receiver immediately after disconnecting it from the charger, you should power it off by holding down the power button for about 5 seconds until it vibrates and beeps to indicate it's powering off. Also, you need to make sure the charger's plug snaps FIRMLY into the collar (it almost feels like you're going to break it). There should just be a spec of metal from the charger plug seen from the side. If you don't have it in all the way, charging will be erratic. The collar receiver takes about 4 hours to charge.Make sure you get a pretty snug fit (but that your pet can still breathe obviously), and once you get the position correct, to put a mark on the notch on the strap you're at with tape. The collar is made of very thick plastic, and is also about an inch wide. It's very long, but it looks like the length could be easily trimmed. You might want to consider purchasing a different collar as I did. Line of sight I can get about 180 ft range. With walls in the way I get about 90-120 ft. Also, the instructions are clearly written by someone who's primary language is definitely not English. Even though you barely need the instructions, except for an explanation of the LEDs and numbers, they should have just paid a high school student like $20 to proof read them first.It could also use a louder buzzer for locating - it's very quiet and could definitely only work outdoors in near pure silence when very close by. It would actually be nice if the volume of the buzzer followed the level set on the transmitter. The version I purchased happened to be the newer version that operates at 900MHz instead of 400MHz. I believe these were updated to 900MHz in February of 2014, so everything shipping now will be the newer version.We'll see how this holds up over time, how long the batteries will hold a charge for, and what the lifespan is on this. I haven't tried to open anything up yet to see if I can find replacement rechargeable batteries somewhere online (I'm sure they're very proprietary and need to be soldered in). It sure beats the competition in having to purchased massive quantities of those flat watch style batteries.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3L1OY0T5MDSNB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IJ33UIY#wasThisHelpful","R3L1OY0T5MDSNB","A3LIF253SVDRMW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LIF253SVDRMW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It seems these days there's so much junk out there and products that are shipped that are partially functional and have serious bugs and obvious design flaws. I expected there to be something seriously wrong with this, however, I ended up being surprised at how well it worked. I set this up with a T-Mobile prepaid SIM (the $3/month plan that gives you 30 minutes or texts and is good for 3 months, no data). I sent it a couple of programming commands via text message (all you need to know is how to read to set this up, so unless you're illiterate, or didn't make it past the 3rd grade, you shouldn't have a problem setting this up), and it was up and working. I read the reviews on here, and like a lot of negative reviews on technology products on Amazon, the negative reviews are due to owner confusion, failure to read the products description or directions, or just plain too lazy to use Google to educate themselves.Here’s how I set it up for SMS text message location trackingFirst text message: begin123456Second text message: admin123456 XXXXXXXXXX  (where the X's are your cell phone number - not sure if this is necessary for your primary number, but authorizes this cell phone number to communicate with the tracker)Third text message: monitor123456 (changes what happens when you call into the tracker so that you can listen in vs. having it send you a text message back)Text message to have tracker send you its location with a Google link: G123456# (obviously G stands for Google. I haven't tried hacking it with any other characters.)Note that there are two ways you can use this. The first is just by sending it an SMS text messaging or calling the phone number to have it send you an SMS text message back with a link to its location on Google Maps. The second is by using GPRS, which gives you online tracking via a web site, with location updates sent from the tracker at an interval that you set (default is every 2 minutes) This however also requires that you both have a data plan for the tracker to communicate over the Internet to a server in China (yes I verified the tkstar server is in China), and that you program your carrier’s APN information in the tracker). I did not attempt to use the GPRS option since it was completely unnecessary for me and a waste of $$.Also note that the manual for this left out the Monitor123456 command, which changes the tracker so that when you call into it, you can listen in to audio in the surroundings, instead of having it send you an SMS back with its location. It will still send you an SMS text with its location when you text G123456# to it. I believe the command to disable this and switch it back so that when you call it sends you an SMS message instead is Tracking123456.We'll see how it holds up with time, and how waterproof it is (there is a rubber grommet that goes into the USB/SIM port). I got this for a new cat that really wanted to go outside along with an Aetertek RF collar (since the Aetertek can be used as a close proximity locator/beeper once you get in the vicinity of your pet with GPS). They are both kind of big, but my cat has no problem wearing them both on her collar, and actually purrs when I put them on, probably because she knows she's about to go outside). If you think your cat or dog might have a serious problem with the size, I would try putting a wide dog collar around their neck with something bulky attached to it to see how your pet will react.Hints:You might want to disable the auto sleep option at first when you start to play around with it, or else it will automatically turn off the LED indicators and the GPS chip in 5 minutes, and there may be delays in it sending you its location.You may need to purchase a smaller or different size collar for it.I didn't use the GPRS option. I'm fine with just sending it text messages, and having it text me back with a location link on Google maps.The first time you turn it on make sure it has a nice clear unobstructed 360 degree path to the sky.Pros:The microphone actually works OK, though the sensitivity could be better.Light weight (it is kind of big, but my cat doesn't have any problem wearing it, though I did get a different collar for it).Sleep mode seems to work OK. It powers off the LED’s and GPS chip, but leaves the cellular radio on. With sleep mode off, the battery will drain much quicker since the GPS chip and LED lights will be on all the time, however it will return the location much quicker since it won't have to determine its location every time you wake it up.Improvements could be:1. It needs an on/off switch vs. a stupid momentary button that could get pressed by accident and needs to be pressed all the time, and it also makes this useless for anything else that would require a hard wire implementation down the road.2. It takes quite some time and pretty good signal strength to get a GPS lock at first.3. The Google maps URL cannot be reprogrammed. So, if Google ever decides to change the URL, the links sent by SMS to Google maps won’t work anymore.For the dummies out there:This is GSM. You can’t use a Verizon or Sprint SIM card (or MVNO’s that partner with/use Verizon or Sprint CDMA technology). Verizon and Sprint, use the older North American CDMA technology, unlike T-Mobile and AT&T that use GSM like the rest of the world. You can obviously use any AT&T or T-Mobile partner that uses GSM and lets you use unlocked phones on their network if you don’t want to use AT&T or T-Mobile.If you live in the boonies, make sure you have signal from whatever carrier you choose.Obviously you should have a Smartphone so you can click the link in the text message and have it take you directly to Google maps. If you don’t have a Smartphone, you probably aren’t technologically savvy enough to use this tracker anyhow, but obviously you could use an old school phone and copy the link and/or coordinates into Google on a PC with Internet access and find the location on a map that way.Don’t complain about monthly fees with this product.  LOL @ those morons! First off, there’s no other realistic alternative than using cellular networks to support this product and no way around paying cellular fees since the manufacturer isn’t going to build their own trillion dollar cellular network to support this product.  In fact, be happy that you have the freedom to choose whatever carrier you want to use with this product, and that the manufacturer hasn’t partnered with cellular companies to provide services for a monthly fee like other tracking or car systems that you have to pay $20/month or more for!","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3AD3AW7JWE8CR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OVY6VHC#wasThisHelpful","R3AD3AW7JWE8CR","A3LIF253SVDRMW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LIF253SVDRMW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I had been looking at this sofa for a while, and finally ended up purchasing it since it had the specs that I wanted:1. Short height padded armrests. This is nice for laying your head on or putting your feet up on if you're laying down. I can't stand those stupid high walled side sofas.2. Seat depth not too deep and sofa height not too tall. The vast majority of sofas out there seem to be made for people who are at least 7 feet tall - when you sit on them with normal posture, your feet don't touch the ground or your lower back doesn't touch the back of the sofa, eventually leading to back pain. This sofa has a shorter height, and comes with legs that you can add on if you choose for additional height (they come tucked under the rightmost cushion). Also, the seats aren't super deep on this sofa, and you can adjust the depth somewhat (1-2"" on or out) by pushing in the cushions more or pulling them out slightly since they're held in place with Velcro.3. Lumbar support. The rear cushions should have lower back support. The rear cushions on many sofas out there bulge out in the middle, leaving you with no lumbar support in your lower back. Just looking a the picture of this sofa, you can see the extra roll for lower back support.4. Easily replaceable foam in the rear and seat cushions. The seat cushions of this sofa are held in place with Velcro, and unzip in the back (they are not reversible though). There are also zippers on the bottom of the fabric in the rear (although they're sewn in as part of the sofa).5. Not leather or rough fabric. I detest leather. Many people purchase a leather sofa or choose leather in their car just as some sort of status symbol. Unless you plan on spilling all sorts of liquids on your furniture, leather is terrible. It's slippery, gets cold in the winter, sticky in the summer, etc. This sofa is made of pretty comfortable microfiber. It does however get a bit warm when sitting on it.6. Light weight and no recliner. I hate moving heavy sofas around. Not only is it a pain, but they always tend to end up getting ruined in the process. Clearly having a recliner is out of the picture, but you can always just add on an ottoman if you need something to put your legs up on. Non-electric recliners are annoying anyhow since they don't lock in place, and with any little movement in your body they tend to return to their unreclined position.So, this sofa met the above requirements. Unfortunately, starting within a week, the seat cushions started to soften up pretty bad, to the point where you would sit on them and they would go from 6"" to about 1""! The middle cushion of the sofa seems to be affected the worst, so perhaps the spring support underneath is also a factor in the softening of this sofa. However, I could tell that cheap low density foam is mostly responsible for this. Higher density foam contains more material, and is therefore more expensive. As a note I'm under 180lbs.I ended up ordering replacement 55 ILD High Quality Lux foam with Dacron wrap from foambymail for about $130. So plan on adding that into your purchase price for this sofa. I measured the foam to be 25"" deep, 24"" wide, and 5"" high. It actually ended up that the foam I ordered was not high enough, so it must've been 6"" that I needed. So, I ended up ripping off the Dacron wrap from the original foam, wrapping around the replacement foam that was already wrapped, and the cushions ended up perfect. My sofa is now nice and firm, but still has good support and molds to your rear end nicely.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RKS7W4FTGJEJA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005G4TXMQ#wasThisHelpful","RKS7W4FTGJEJA","A3LIF253SVDRMW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LIF253SVDRMW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I got this several weeks ago for a stray cat that would hang around once in a while. I would put food in it for her. It got really cold one night and I found her in there early in the morning shivering!! She died shortly after. 20 watts is not enough to heat anything on a cold night.Furthermore, when it rains, the entire thing gets sopping wet, including the interior and heated pad.

"I saw a good deal on these so I purchased 2 of these to try. This review is with the latest firmware and Android app as of the date of this review.First, it took me over 4 hours to program them. You enter your WiFi SSID and key in their app, then you hold your phone against the thing's sensor on top while it sends pulses of light for up to and around 20 seconds in order to program it. The power strip blinks back a series of cryptic varying color flashes of which there isn't really much explanation of what they mean, other than if you start seeing green flashing, you're good, and if not, you're not good. I tried programming them with 3 different devices, following some tips I read online (turn any light off in the room, use WPA encryption instead of WPA2, setting the phone brightness to max, trying a different access point, etc.) In the end, my problems turned out to be a combination of things - I needed to use a newer device that the screen was LED backlit, secondly I had to change the CPU governor in my phone to performance mode to be able to flash the screen quick enough (thankfully I'm running a modded Android operating system that lets me do that!), the dark room seemed to help, and finally there appeared to be a bug in the Android App in that once you go through one programming attempt, you have to go all the way back 6 steps, and re-enter your WiFi SSID and password because it loses it. Apparently Quirky didn't test programming the power strip with many devices, or else they would have made the flashes slower and would have designed these issues out of the Android app.After that was all said and done (note that these do in fact work with WPA2 encryption, and 802.11n 2.4GHz), I began testing them. Here are the problems (I sent these to Quirky, and they have not responded yet):1. It does not keep the last state of the relays in onboard flash memory. Therefore, in the event of a power outage and Internet connectivity is not available, the outlets remain off. In fact, after testing disconnecting my Internet, there seemed to be a timeout, and the outlets on both power strips would just turn off! I also tested with the outlets on, then powering off the power strips, disconnecting the Internet connection, powering the power strips back on, waiting a couple of minutes before reconnecting the Internet connection, and guess what? The ports remained off, and they even showed off in the app, whereas previously they were on! The ports would only return to on if there was an Internet connection immediately available upon powering up! After calling into their support number, they confirmed that if there is not Internet connection when they boot up, the outlets stay off! The engineer that thought that through needs to be banned forever from designing any electronic devices and would be much better at cleaning toilets somewhere, although they would probably manage to somehow screw that up too. What's weird is that I have the GE ZWave outdoor appliance module, and it does in fact go right back to state it was in when it lost power, regardless of connectivity.As I sit here, I just heard both relays click in the power strips, and lost power both of my devices connected to the 2 switchable ports, after working for about 12 hours (and my Internet connection is just fine). Oh joy, I get to waste more time fruitlessly trying to make these work.2. The Android app is dreadfully painful to use. The GUI needs to be completely redesigned and the person or person(s) responsible for its design banned from programming anything ever again as well! Even the standard Android back button actually closes the app when it should just go to the previous screen, and only the home button should close the app.Finally, the functionality of these is 100% dependent on access to Wink's cloud server. I did a full TCP port scan on these and there are no open TCP ports listening, meaning that even if you purchase a hub that lets you access it locally, it will still have to manage and communicate with these via Wink's cloud server! So if Wink's cloud server is ever down or they go out of business, guess what?I will be returning these shortly.","1.0 out of 5 stars","November 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ZHRC81BXR958/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GN92MC6#wasThisHelpful","R1ZHRC81BXR958","A3LIF253SVDRMW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LIF253SVDRMW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a great idea, but definitely needs further refinement. If you move around at all while you're sleeping, it will go off constantly as it doesn't have an accelerometer built into it to thwart false alarms from moving around. If either of the electrodes ever so slightly lose perfect contact with your skin while moving around it will continuously sound, rather than notice a discrepancy in the EMG readings and disable for a period of time. There should be some sort of detection threshold setting for it losing contact where it won't sound for several seconds. Also, it's buggy in that the alarm sound sometimes stays on for up to 5 seconds or more even after you stop clenching, then beeps several times before stopping. The piezo buzzer doesn't get that loud, and is just a single tone that you can easily end up getting used to, as I did. So, after a couple weeks of use, it was pretty much useless.If you can manage to stay perfectly still while sleeping, can deal with the bugs, and are a light sleeper, this may work for you, otherwise save your money until version 2.0 comes out with these issues addresses unless you're desperate. Also, make sure you’re using fresh batteries and you clean the electrodes nightly before use, or you'll end up with even more problems.

"I purchased the TL-WA5110G to replace an older failing wireless router that I used to connect to a wireless ISP. I also purchased a TP-LINK TL-WR741ND, and installed the latest version of DD-WRT on it. After spending an hour going back and forth between the two testing the performance, I found the WR741ND with DD-WRT performed significantly better by about 20%.

All I did was swap back and forth the LAN cable and external antenna connection between the two when I was comparing.

"I've been exclusively using JVC systems over the past 10 years, but after many failures due to poor quality component sourcing, specifically the buttons and knobs internal components failing, I figured I'd give this Kenwood a shot (even though they merged in 2008). What I was nervous about since Kenwood didn't specifically detail how it worked in the manual I found on their web site, was how having multiple phones paired to the system would work. Actually it works decent except for the bugs I'll outline below. You can have two phones simultaneously paired to the system and it will work with any phone that's paired automatically when a call is received. When a call is placed from any phone, it will automatically switch to that phone. When a call is placed from the stereo, the device with priority set is used.I installed this system myself in about 10 minutes since it used the same wiring harness style connector that my JVC had. The audio is phenomenal. It has plenty of options to set things the way you like them.  I ran the rear USB input to the glove compartment where I keep a USB stick in the cable. I wanted to leave the front open for when friends. Everything works decent with my android phones - Bluetooth, USB, Pandora, iHeart, AHA, and the dual USB inputs. I have a problem with iHeart radio though in that custom stations never load - the system stays in a buffering state.While this system's basic functionality is decent, I have found numerous severe problems and annoyances. To begin with, you can set a device priority for Bluetooth hands free and media audio. However, this priority isn't saved upon Bluetooth devices disconnected and reconnecting.  So this means if you have two phones, or you and your significant other both have your phones paired and are in the car at the same time, it could randomly use the wrong phone depending on whose phone opened the Bluetooth connection to the stereo first. Second, I find it annoying when you scroll through songs using USB memory, it displays the folder name as a number which is idiotic. You have to hit the music search button to scroll through folders by name, which first makes you wait several seconds while the display says MUSICSEARCH. At least it isn't like some systems with USB playback that order the files by the order they were written to the USB stick instead of alphabetically. Next, there are a couple really dumb Bluetooth default settings. First is that Bluetooth audio is set to only use the front speakers by default. This even includes Bluetooth media, not just hands free. Second, auto answer is automatically enabled after 8 seconds, forcing you to talk to the person who's calling. You have to make sure you go into the Bluetooth settings to change these settings. However, I have had this system about a month, and it has already randomly lost all of its Bluetooth settings (and phone pairings), so make sure you remember every time it loses its settings to do this. One other problem with the Bluetooth is if you have two phones paired, it doesn't disconnect the Bluetooth audio of the 2nd phone while you're on a call. Instead if you are on a call on Bluetooth, and your second phone or passenger whose phone also happens to be paired with the system gets a call, there will be an annoying repetitive high pitched beep through the system until Bluetooth on the second phone is manually disconnected.  Another problem is the display backlight is very dim so that it can barely be seen at all if you are wearing sunglasses while driving. Another thing is there aren't enough pixels in the display so you can have all the information you need on the display including cell phone battery, cell signal, etc. I do like that there are 3 configurable detailed lines of text though. Finally I wish they would find a better way to use presets, or just bring back the friggin preset buttons to systems.Just a couple note - make sure you go and check for firmware updates on Kenwood's web site for it.  Mine was pretty far behind.  Also make sure you read the directions and follow them precisely. There is a little tiny reset button behind the faceplate that you will need a paperclip or something small to press it with during the procedure. Second, be careful where you mount the Bluetooth microphone or you will sound like crap! The best spot for most cars seems to be up on the roof by the lights facing towards the driver's seat.  So, you will need to be skilled at carefully removing the plastic panels in your car to run the wire cleanly.","2.0 out of 5 stars","October 4, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R6414FJOUC5QM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00B7IRRI2#wasThisHelpful","R6414FJOUC5QM","A3LIF253SVDRMW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LIF253SVDRMW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I had been looking at this sofa for a while, and finally ended up purchasing it since it had the specs that I wanted:1.  Short height padded armrests.  This is nice for laying your head on or putting your feet up on if you're laying down.  I can't stand those stupid high walled side sofas.2.  Seat depth not too deep and sofa height not too tall.  The vast majority of sofas out there seem to be made for people who are at least 7 feet tall - when you sit on them with normal posture, your feet don't touch the ground or your lower back doesn't touch the back of the sofa, eventually leading to back pain.  This sofa has a shorter height, and comes with legs that you can add on if you choose for additional height (they come tucked under the rightmost cushion).  Also, the seats aren't super deep on this sofa, and you can adjust the depth somewhat (1-2"" on or out) by pushing in the cushions more or pulling them out slightly since they're held in place with Velcro.3.  Lumbar support.  The rear cushions should have lower back support.  The rear cushions on many sofas out there bulge out in the middle, leaving you with no lumbar support in your lower back.  Just looking a the picture of this sofa, you can see the extra roll for lower back support.4.  Easily replaceable foam in the rear and seat cushions.  The seat cushions of this sofa are held in place with Velcro, and unzip in the back (they are not reversible though).  There are also zippers on the bottom of the fabric in the rear (although they're sewn in as part of the sofa).5.  Not leather or rough fabric.  I detest leather.  Many people purchase a leather sofa or choose leather in their car just as some sort of status symbol.  Unless you plan on spilling all sorts of liquids on your furniture, leather is terrible.  It's slippery, gets cold in the winter, sticky in the summer, etc.  This sofa is made of pretty comfortable microfiber.  It does however get a bit warm when sitting on it.6.  Light weight and no recliner.  I hate moving heavy sofas around.  Not only is it a pain, but they always tend to end up getting ruined in the process.  Clearly having a recliner is out of the picture, but you can always just add on an ottoman if you need something to put your legs up on.  Non-electric recliners are annoying anyhow since they don't lock in place, and with any little movement in your body they tend to return to their unreclined position.So, this sofa met the above requirements.  Unfortunately, starting within a week, the seat cushions started to soften up pretty bad, to the point where you would sit on them and they would go from 6"" to about 1""!  The middle cushion of the sofa seems to be affected the worst, so perhaps the spring support underneath is also a factor in the softening of this sofa.  However, I could tell that cheap low density foam is mostly responsible for this.  Higher density foam contains more material, and is therefore more expensive.  As a note I'm under 180lbs.I ended up ordering replacement 55 ILD High Quality Lux foam with Dacron wrap from foambymail for about $130.  So plan on adding that into your purchase price for this sofa.  I measured the foam to be 25"" deep, 24"" wide, and 5"" high.  It actually ended up that the foam I ordered was not high enough, so it must've been 6"" that I needed.  So, I ended up ripping off the Dacron wrap from the original foam, wrapping around the replacement foam that was already wrapped, and the cushions ended up perfect.  My sofa is now nice and firm, but still has good support and molds to your rear end nicely.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 27, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RR0YI1K1JIVK5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007W1N7IM#wasThisHelpful","RR0YI1K1JIVK5","A3LIF253SVDRMW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LIF253SVDRMW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"OK But Has Drawbacks, Mangles Thin Paper, Pulls in Crooked!!I've had this scanner about 3 weeks now and the consumable status shows I've scanned over 9,000 pages with this scanner.  I thought I would share my experiences and the pros and cons that I've found with this scanner.  For general document archiving, it works ok, probably better than most if not all of the scanners that are currently for sale in its price range and category that I have read about. However it definitely has some caveats.  I wish I had a Brother ADS2000 to compare it to, which seems to be the most competitive scanner at this time.First I'll start by saying I'm using it with Windows.  The software that's included with the scanner, ScanSnap Organizer, makes scanning very smooth and quick so you can scan one set of documents after another with little interaction.  In my decision making, minimal interaction between scanning documents was an absolute requirement for me with the stacks of documents I need to scan.  When I first started looking at scanners, I was considering a Brother 8910DW MFC, but that would have been a nightmare because of the number of steps required to scan.  I didn't want anything where I had to click on multiple dialogs and confirm a million settings between scans.  I was hesitant to purchase this Fujitsu scanner since the interface and software is proprietary and doesn't support TWAIN or WIA.For the most part, the software developers did a pretty decent job with the included software.  First, there is the ScanSnap tray icon application that's responsible for low level interaction with the scanner.  You can access the scan settings by right clicking or double clicking on the tray icon.  These include settings and defaults for resolution, brightness, save directory, file type (pdf or jpg), blank page removal on/off, OCR, compression, etc.  This application is responsible for the major scanning activities, providing a small quick preview of each document as it is scanned, and warning and mitigation of scan errors (ie jams and multi-feeds).  There is also the ScanSnap Organizer software.  Each scanned document shows up in this application as a thumbnail, and there are forward and back buttons to move through the pages on each thumbnail without actually opening the scanned document.  A file folder structure shows up in a pane on the left where you can organize your scans into. If you want to rename the file to something other than the default (which is based on the scan date/time and you can also tweak), then you can rename with a single click.  Unfortunately, there are no PDF editing operations available from within SnapStream Organizer - you have to open the document in a separate PDF editor (Acrobat is included, but I use PDF-XChange since it's quicker) to perform simple common tasks such as deleting, rotating, and inserting pages.One wish for ScanSnap organizer is if you could trigger a scan from directly within the application, both simplex and duplex.  There should also be a way, either with scanning directly with ScanSnap organizer, or the tray icon, to scan using customized settings profiles that you can customize and create with different quality settings for different types of documents.  I would like to have a single point and click way of scanning using a customized scan profile for each.  There are pre-defined profiles that you can select from in the ScanSnap tray icon app, but you only customize one, and once you select another profile, it wipes out all your settings - very stupid design!  I realize Fujitsu is trying to keep things simple with a single button on the scanner, but the intelligence just isn't there yet to allow this to work well.One bug I've found with the ScanSnap Organizer software is if you try to change the case of a character or characters in any of your file or folder names, it won't take affect.  So, you either have to use another application like explorer to rename the file or folder, or change the name to something else and back.  For example, if you have a file or folder called ""My scans"" and you try to rename it to ""My Scans"", it will always revert back to ""My scans"".Also, there are some dumb defaults selected when you first install the Fujitsu software.  Please take these in mind when you install the software if you choose to purchase this.  One of them is that OCR settings by default only performing OCR on the first page.  Perhaps Fujitsu thought that this would be sufficient for finding documents and increase speed, but that should be up to the user to change to since the risk is that if you don't notice this foolish default immediately, you will lose out on being able to search the entirety of the documents you scan .  Second, the carrier sheet default is to scan in a two-sided document as a side by side document, not two separate pages.  Third, the preference ""Always link when one of the applications is running"" is not selected by default.  It is set to ""Link when one of the applications is active"".  I kept finding that the ScanSnap Manager dialog box would pop up annoyingly every so often when I would scan, and ask me what application I wanted to scan to, even though I had ScanSnap Organizer open and maximized.  I found that the determination of whether or not ScanSnap Organizer is running/active is flaky.  I've found that if you're scanning in a large document, and you click back to work on ScanSnap Organizer while the document is scanning, you will end up with the ScanSnap manager dialog popping up in your face.  In order for the linkage to work every time into ScanSnap Organizer, the scan status application has to be on top of ScanSnap Organizer, without ScanScap Organizer being active/selected.  Since I pretty much only scan to ScanSnap Organizer, changing the default setting to ""Always link when one of the applications is running"" solved this problem.  Therefore no matter what state ScanSnap Organizer is in, it will scan into it without asking.  I guess Fujitsu designed it this way in case you decided to have multiple Fujitsu scanner applications running, it would automatically choose the ""foreground"" application to scan into.  Unfortunately, it's a little buggy.  Also, note that the setting for application detection is not logically placed and hard to find.  You have to right click on the ScanSnap tray icon, then hover over Help, then click ""Preferences...""  As a note, I have installed the latest software updates available from Fujitsu's web site.The multifeed detection seems to work good.  Unfortunately, it's not absolutely perfect and you do still have to pay some attention to every sheet that gets sent through the scanner and/or count the number of pages you're scanning.  Out of the 9,000 pages I've scanned, I have caught two separate sets of pages that were multifed without the scanner detecting it.  The blank page removal works so-so.  If you're scanning in a letter that was previously folded, it will pick up the fold marks and flag the page as non-blank.  This mal-behavior is pretty consistent.  Bleedthrough also defeats the blank page detection on 2-sided documents.  This makes it impossible most of the time to leave the scanner on duplex scan mode, or forces you to manually do a simplex scan on single sided documents.  This is especially true for receipts. Blank page detection does however seem to work well with hole punched paper, interestingly enough.The image sensor is CMOS.  CMOS is a newer and cheaper technology than the older CCD type of image sensor; however, it requires a lot of light, as anyone would know who has tried to take a low light picture with a smart phone.  As a consequence, there is quite substantial bleed through when scanning 2-sided documents, most notably with thinner paper.  There is an option to reduce bleed-through in the scan settings, however this results in very faint text since apparently it just lowers the brightness on the scanner illuminator and doesn't really have any sort of intelligence such as comparing the front and back images of the document that was scanned.As far as scan quality goes, it is great for general document scanning.  I usually scan basic documents on the ""better"" setting (Color/Gray 200 DPI, B&W 400 DPI).  This seems to provide a decent combination of file size and quality.  I have tried scanning a few photos, and it seemed hit or miss.  Although the resolution provided clarity, the colors were fairly off in a few photos.  I would suggest a separate high resolution flatbed scanner if you're looking for something for photo archiving (this is max 600 DPI optical color, decent photo scanners at the moment are 9600 DPI optical resolution).Don't expect the paper exit tray to work very well either.  You need to sit there with your hand at the end of the exit tray to prevent your scanned documents from flying all over the place, especially if you are scanning in anything but new perfectly flat paper.  Fujitsu should have added paper guides to the exit tray, as well as a fold out adjustable paper stopper at the end.  Also, if you place the scanner to your right, you're going to have to reach over the exit tray to hit the scan button.  It's very annoying if you're scanning in a lot of documents, since you have to reach awkwardly over the exit tray to hit the scan button.  I completely gave up on using this fold-out exit tray because of this.  I kept hitting my arm on the end of the exit tray, and I figured it would eventually break off (the exit tray, not my arm), or I would end up breaking it off in frustration.  Finally, if you're scanning in stacks of stapled documents, you're bound to miss a staple somewhere.  There's no handling of this type of issue, so your document just gets pulled in, caught, and mangled, until a paper jam is triggered.Out of the 9,000 scans I've done, this scanner has also mangled about 120 pieces of paper. I see often that these pages have ended up not being pulled in straight.  I have noticed that this mostly seems to occur with thinner paper and notebook paper, or when scanning in a stack of paper, and it's nearing the last page.  It seems that there's not enough pressure on the pages to keep them in place and prevent them from going in crooked when getting pulled into the scanner.  Also, the 2 rollers seem to be able to function somewhat independently, as I see frequently that the left side of the paper (facing the front) often gets pulled in quicker than the right.  Fujitsu should have made the paper guides higher on the sides as well.  Even when guiding the paper in by hand, single remaining sheets and thin papers still get pulled in at an angle quite often.  The scanner sometimes has trouble with mangling thinner/notebook paper as well.  I've also noticed that in general as the pages get pulled into the scanner, they often pull up at the end of the page just enough so that they get pulled in crooked.  Again, this happens more when there are only a few pages being scanned or a few pages left in the scanner.  The deskewing seems to work OK.  If you purposely put in a piece of paper in the scanner so it scans skewed, it will deskew it very well.  The problem is that a lot of the times it pulls in documents at such an angle that portions don't even pass over the scanner element.  I selected the option to deskew based on the documents text, which isn't selected by default.  Without this option selected, the scanner will still attempt to deskew, but it doesn't always do a great job, and since papers do often get sucked in crooked, deskewing is important.  I also have meticulously cleaned the scanner as described in the manual with lint free cloth, but that didn't help with any of these issues.  It's surprising when it does end up mangling smooth pages since other times it seems to scan pages that are wrinkled or even torn on spots without a problem.I haven't used the wi-fi option to scan to an Android/Apple device yet, but the scanner had no problems connecting to my wireless router.  What's nice about this feature is that it doesn't scan your document to a cloud based service where the employees at the cloud service will be perusing through all your scans, it scans it directly to your phone.  So, for those of us who value your privacy and personal information, this is huge!  I do wish there was a Windows app out there that would let you scan to a regular PC with wireless.Finally I have had zero problems with the software installation, disconnects, power save mode, etc. that I read some users were having difficulties with. I am using this with a Western Digital USB 3.0 card.  Overall, I think Fujitsu did a pretty good job with this scanner.  I hope they will take into account some of the caveats in this model in their next mode.If anyone has any experience with the Brother ADS2000 and could share their experience with it compared to mine with the iX500, would you please share?  Just from reading reviews on here, Costco's site, and others, it appears the Brother also has issues pulling in documents crooked.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 9, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2TU4RHPWQ5D8F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ATZ9QMO#wasThisHelpful","R2TU4RHPWQ5D8F","A3LIF253SVDRMW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LIF253SVDRMW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Torturous To UseI gave this keyboard several days, but it was torture to use.  If this is going to be your only keyboard you’ll ever use, and you won’t know any better, than you may be OK.  For the rest of, forget it.  I fail to understand how anyone can give this a good review.  All most of us want is a keyboard with a layout and keys EXACTLY like an HP or Dell laptop, and a touchpad to the side or below.  Look at where they arrow keys are on a Dell or HP business laptop – it makes sense, and they’re easy to locate and press without looking.  Look at how the keys on these laptops are concave so your fingers easily press them.  What’s wrong with these compact keyboard manufacturers?  They also can’t think out of the box and keep trying to squeeze all the keys into a perfect rectangle.  Is that really necessary?The first problem with this keyboard is of course the right shift key location and miniature size which always makes you end up accidentally hitting the up arrow.  The next problem is that pressing certain combination of keys is not always recognized.  Next, there’s a difference between the left and right touchpad buttons which makes it difficult to feel when the buttons have registered a click, which has also been an ongoing manufacturing problem reported elsewhere.  Last, there’s not even fold out legs on the bottom, so typing is very uncomfortable.I stuck this back in the box and sent it home.  Unfortunately there really isn’t any competition for this.

I am an average adult male and this would need to be at least 2-4 inches taller to offer any support for my head/neck.

"I was looking for a neck support that would be taller than the Futuro ones they sell at all the retail chains since the Futuro one could only be good for a child size neck, and offers little support.  This neck support is bascially made up of two plastic strips with some very firm padding on one the top of one strip, and the bottom of the other.  The two strips Velcro together so that in order to adjust the height, you just Velcro the two strips at different positions.My first problem with neck support , is just as a reviewer said about the version of this with the chin support, is that it bites painfully into your neck area, both front and back, as the padding on the edges is very thin and hard.  I imaging I'm going to have to wrap it with cotton badding or something of the sort.My other problem with this is that there are no details on the sizes vs. neck size.  I have a pretty big neck and head, such that most shirts don't fit around my neck, and hats don't fit around my head, so I ordered the XL version.  Unfortunately, it's way too big.Overall, this product is a disappointment and a waste of a design effort.  People need to think through and test products a little better before putting them on the market just to have them fail.","2.0 out of 5 stars","November 24, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2WROGIZOSS4U8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00427JRO2#wasThisHelpful","R2WROGIZOSS4U8","A3LIF253SVDRMW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LIF253SVDRMW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I recently purchased this razor after seeing it in the store and being sick of draining my bank account on blades for my Gillette Fusion Proglide Power.  I'm happy someone finally came along and gave Gillette some competition! I wasn't really expecting a better shave from it, but wow, it's so much better than the Gillette - less cuts and a much smoother, quicker shave!  I have incredibly thick hair too, which an electric can't even touch.  I would always have problems getting under my jaw line with the Gillette, and this thing sailed right through it!  I don't have to go over every area 20-30x as I did with the Gillette.  Thank you Schick!One thing I didn't realize at first as I was shaving near my nose is that the plastic piece at the top of the razor blade flips back so yoy can get the edge of the blade right up close.My wishes for the next version of this would be:1.  The razor is so thick it's hard to grip.  It needs to be designed easier to grip.  The Gillette definitely has an advantage on size and weight.  The Gillette also has stronger vibration.2.  Make the power on button so that it starts off on high vibration, then decreases.  Or, just have some way of setting the vibration permanently since having to hit the button 3x is annoying.This really deserves 4 stars because of these annoyances, but I didn't want to deter anyone from buying it since it gives such a great shave.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 12, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R7E2A5JDNJYA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006DR2BO2#wasThisHelpful","R7E2A5JDNJYA","A3LIF253SVDRMW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LIF253SVDRMW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I had been looking all over for a good quality laptop riser stand for quite some time after junking a previous one that would fall out of the position I set it at and my laptop was not stable on.  Finally, I got desperate due to neck and back aches, pains, and noises from alternating between either sitting slouched back or looking down at my laptop screen.  I figured I had better fork out the cash for something good now or I'll end up be forking out a lot more in medical expenses down the road!  I was debating on this one or the 3M one, but decided to try this one out due to some bad comments about the 3M one.I definitely made the right decision.  This is a great riser stand.  It is light, yet not flimsy.  It has a super wide range of adjustability so that you have have your laptop almost vertical if you like your screen that high.  It has a nice rubberized base and top (the black parts you see in the picture) to keep your laptop snug without any parts getting in the way so you can remove your laptop quickly out of the stand.  It has a metal screw lock with a plastic knob to lock the stand position in the back.  There are also nice rubberized feet to stop it from sliding around.One thing to note is that packaging and instructions are in Japanese, but all you really need to figure out is how to get the stand locked in place.  I think a 3 year old could figure that out.Highly recommended!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 10, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R306MJQAJOX4TK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005ADQGJQ#wasThisHelpful","R306MJQAJOX4TK","A3LIF253SVDRMW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LIF253SVDRMW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I needed to replace my old, busted up crank set on my old Giant mountain bike.  I also needed something I could get a bash guard on, not just for protecting my outer chain ring from getting mangled on logs and rocks, but to protect the side of my leg as I probably lost a liter of blood once when my foot slipped and the side of my chain ring sliced up the side of my leg, landing me in urgent care and leaving with a collection of stitches.It was painful figuring out all the components and tools I would need to install this, the number of teeth on the chain rings, and the length of the crank arms (ended up with 175's).  It wasn't clear that this comes with the Hollowtech bottom bracket at first, but it does.  It appears there are different versions of this available with different tooth counts other than listed here and on the specs on Shimano's web site.  I also purchased this with the Deore front derailleur.  I wanted to keep my outer chain ring and have the benefits of a bash guard as well, so I got this with a Salsa Tooth Fairy triple bash guard.I've ridden on this about 5 times now.  The Hollowtech makes it so much lighter than my crappy stock crank set.  I love having the outer ring since one of the places where I go mountain biking is just a couple miles away so I can ride up there pretty quickly, but I'll probably end up dumping the outer ring and using an FSA toothed bash guard I ordered with this since the Salsa Tooth Fairy slightly interferes with my front derailleur.--Installation Notes--I had a 68mm bottom bracket space, so I used 1 spacer on the left, 2 on the right.  The spacers included with mine were all 2.5mm, though the instructions mentioned 3 different sizes included.--General Tools Used--Wrench set for removal and installation of pedalsLatex gloves to keep the nastiness off of my hands--Tools Used for Removal of Old Crank Set--Park Tool CCP-22Park Tool BBT-22--Tools Used for Installing This Crank Set--1/4"" Torque Wrench with 1/4"" extension and 1/4"" to 3/8"" adapter with 5mm 3/8"" hex socket.

Don't screw this up and guess!  The tools are cheap enough.Park Tool BBT9 to tighten down the bottom bracket (preferred over BBT19 since BBT9 has the pieces at both ends that you'll need).

"I'm not into the clipless pedals, and wanted some plastic pedals without sharp spikes as I had enough of the bloody, scarred shins from my foot slipping off those moron designed crappy steel/plastic/combo pedals and getting whacked in the shins with the grip spikes.  I had tried many of the generic type plastic pedals (i.e from Welgo), but they always felt like my foot was getting pushed up in the middle and list there was no grip in the middle of the pedal.  These are much nicer.  They are light weight, have a nice, flat, even feel to the surface, with decent grip.My only issues with these are I wish they had even more grip spikes across the surface, and they came with the black plastic side plug inserted and not the red ones.  It was nice that they came with the black ones though, but it was a huge pain to pull the red ones out, and impossible to get the black ones in.  I resorted to a rubber mallet, but they still didn't go in even.At first I was dissuaded from these as I had read that some people had issues with the grip pegs wearing down, but as far as I could tell that was just for BMX riders who do pedal grinds.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 6, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R25MAOHS2TE610/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00132G148#wasThisHelpful","R25MAOHS2TE610","A3LIF253SVDRMW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LIF253SVDRMW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I had been taking these for quite some time.  I had also been getting random stomach upset.  I didn't correlate anything until after having severe stomach upset and dizziness after trying a low strength magnesium supplement (80mg).

Otherwise, it's too bad since without the magnesium these would make a great multi - they are small, easy to swallow, and don't have 100x the RDA of what you need like most other multivitamins that try to ell you on ""more is better"".

"This is a comparison review of the DEI Viper 5704V, the AutoPage CS3-RS915 LCD, and the CodeAlarm ca6551sst. I also have a DEI Viper 5901aka 5702V (the previous version of the 5704), and an AutoPage RS855 LCD.---Background---I have always done and prefer to do all my own installs. Not only is it something that I have the skills for and I enjoy doing, but I don't like other people disrespecting my property. Nobody respects anything that's not theirs, and I like to ensure everything is done to perfection without ruining anything. If you are technical and have patience, these systems are not difficult to install by any means. It's just a matter of knowing a little bit about electricity (12 Volts DC), locating the wires in your car that you need to tap onto, knowing how to carefully remove the panels in your car without breaking anything, and using the proper test tools, connectors, and wire wrap to make a very clean install without even cutting wires or drilling holes.---Preface---After purchasing a third car, needing to upgrade the systems in my current two cars, and researching the current selection of alarms, I decided to try each of the Directed Electronics Viper 5704, the Audiovox CodeAlarm ca6551sst, and the AutoPage CS3-RS915-LCD. They are all in the same class of 2-way paging alarms with remote start, and use spread spectrum technology to communicate between the main unit and the key fob. For those of you that don't know, this technology has been around for a while, and simply means that the communications can occur on multiple frequencies. This is good in case there is interference on one frequency, the transmissions can potentially get through to the receiver on another frequency.Besides having long range 2-way and spread spectrum technology, the other things that are important to me when selecting a security system:*Rechargeable remote - I hated having to keep a stash of AAA batteries around for my previous security systems.*Good manufacturer reputation - I've had good luck with my AutoPage system, and I know that Audiovox has been around for a while. I gave DEI a shot again just based on their name. I have used a lot of their accessories in the past (shock sensors, motion sensor, power door lock actuators, etc.) and have had good luck. DEI is the largest car security system manufacturer out there. DEI was founded by Darrell Issa, who is currently a congressman with a new worth of approximately $ billion. One big problem I have with DEI is that they are very partner focused, and don't warranty their systems if they aren't installed by an authorized DEI dealer. This also means if you lose the (very un-detailed) install/wiring guide that the system comes with, you're not going to just be able to download it from their web site. So, make sure you take photos of it/make copies before you lose or destroy it.  AutoPage and Audiovox both make their install guides available for download on their web sites, and I suggest you review those as well as the user's manual entirely before deciding on a system to purchase since they will give you a lot of information as to the functionality.*Lots of customization options - one important thing for me is to be able to disable the arm and disarm chirps. Since the remotes for 2-way security systems such as these beep/vibrate to confirm that you've successfully armed/disarmed the systems, why would you want your car's siren or horn to chirp as well, unless you're trying to show off? I like to be stealth! The arm/disarm confirmation chirps can be enabled and disabled through the customization programming that's described in the install manual of all of these alarms.*Two car functionality - All these systems support 2 cars, with varying difficulty of switching the remote from one car to the other.*Vibrating remote - Being in a noisy place can easily drown out the high pitched sounds that the key fob makes when your alarm goes off.---The Reviews---I installed the DEI Viper 5901 in my older car several years ago. I purchased the 5901 and a competitive AutoPage alarm that came with a color OLED display at the same time. I decided to send the AutoPage alarm back and keep the 5901 in that car due to it having better range when comparing side by side, and the AutoPage's fob's color OLED display being impossible to see in sunlight. Had I have known the problems I was going to run into with DEI's junk 5901, I would have returned them both and purchased the AutoPage system with the non-color LCD display and with the spread spectrum technology. (Spread spectrum allows for communicating over multiple frequencies to get around interference.)Going back to my DEI Viper 5901, it has a major flaw where once every 2-3 months it will take 100's of tries of hitting the unlock button to disarm the system and unlock the car. I usually will end up having to use my key to get into my car, setting off the alarm along with making everyone around look and/or waking up all the neighbors, and quickly reaching under the dash and pulling the system's wire to the horn/power (whichever I could get to first). Pulling the power and resetting the system will fix the problem temporarily. The Viper 5901 would also frequently have a long delay before actually arming/locking and disarming/unlocking after hitting a button on the fob. Furthermore, sometimes pushing the buttons on the fob would have no effect at all, not even a confirmation beep like the fob would normally emit when pushing a button. I've read some other reviewers complain about this as well. I also have a couple other gripes with it, one being that the car finder will simply lay on the horn solid for several seconds, rather than a series of short beeps (like the CodeAlarm and the AutoPage systems will do). The way the 5901 and now the new 5704 just slams the horn solid for several seconds is a great way of getting people near your car pissed off and getting everyone to stare at you looking for your car. Maybe if you're the type to always pay attention to where you park or live in a small village somewhere and don't ever travel to a shopping mall this won't be a problem for you. Like many people out there though I have a very busy lifestyle with a lot of ADD and distractions, so I need to have a good functioning car finder! Second, even though you would have the system set to not chirp when arming/disarming, if the battery in the fob was low, it would chirp the horn for a long duration after about a 5-10 seconds from disarming the system. This was very frustrating at night when trying to wake everyone up, including the neighbors. The fob beeps when the battery is low anyhow, so why does it need to chirp your horn in addition? Also, if by design you're going to make the system chirp the horn when the battery in your fob is low, why have it chirp when you're going to the car???? It should chirp when you're leaving your car because that's when you're most likely going to go inside somewhere that you can charge it! There's also no option to disable this. Lastly, they decided it would be smart to integrate the shock sensor into the unit on the 5901. Ridiculous! This all just goes to show how little common sense the engineers who designed this thing have.I called DEI to mention these problems, and some cocky kid answered the phone that had no interest in my comments. They did verify that the car finder and fob battery low chirp issues I mentioned above had not been corrected, and I verified this after receiving the new Viper 5704V and testing it.After receiving each system, I first hooked them up on the bench to test. The first test was the power draw when armed and not alarming. This is important if you're going to let your car sit armed for an extended duration, like at an airport parking lot. The Viper and the CodeAlarm each drew ~40ma when armed, and the AutoPage ~24ma. Next was the range test. With the antennas all near each other, the range was almost identical when walking around my city neighborhood. Of course, it was no where near a mile that all the manufacturers claimed - more like 1200 feet down to the end of my street. Sometimes the CodeAlarm would work where the Viper wouldn't, and vice versa. I'm sure the FCC has a transmit power limit that the manufacturers must abide by. Expect around 1000-1500 feet at the most. If you really want to get notified, you can always get a prepaid SIM card and a 12v GSM alarm from eBay so you can get a text message on your cell phone. I will tell you I can park my car half way out in the parking lot of a typical WalMart or grocery store, and be able to communicate with my car half way into the store. Range is very dependant on obstructions.One thing to note is that these systems are not capable of full duplex communications between the system and the fob, meaning that if the system is transmitting to the fob, the system will not receive any button pushes on your fob. This is relevant in a couple scenarios. First, if your car is alarming, expect it to take up to 15 seconds of you standing there pushing the button on your fob for your system to stop alarming. This is because your system will be transmitting to alert your remote that there it is in alarm. The manufactures may have designed in periodic brief pauses in the transmission to allow for a signal from the remote to get through, and if you're lucky to press the button at just the right time, you might get your system to stop alarming sooner. In my tests, I was able to stop the AutoPage from alarming the soonest. This also applies to remote start. After your system starts your car, it will be transmitting to confirm that your car has started. You'll have to wait up to 15 seconds to be able to disarm your alarm and unlock your doors after using remote start. If I'm in a safe area, I'll usually disarm the system before activating remote start.Another thing to note with the fob communications is that for all of these systems it may take up to 10 seconds or so for your fob to be notified of your security system going off. The fobs from all manufacturers work similar to cell phones to conserve the battery life - they only turn the receiver on every so many seconds. So, if your security system happens to be triggered right after your fob went out of listening mode, you may have lost valuable time to nab the perpetrator who broke into or crashed into your car. From my tests, the AutoPage had the slowest frequency of checks and took the longest to be notified of an alarm condition.Each system has a ""warn away"" function that relies on the dual stage shock sensor they come with. When a lighter touch on your vehicle is detected, the siren/horn chirps quickly. I find that the ""warn away"" is pretty much useless, and is frequently set off by loud motorcycles driving by. The warn-away feature is complicated by the fact that the shock sensors that these systems come with only have a single adjustment, rather than a separate adjustment for each stage. So, you can't customize your sensitivity for full alarm vs. warn away and you may end up with lots of warn away pages/beeps if you like your shock sensor sensitive. You might be better off either not using the warn-away, or purchasing a separate shock sensor (they are cheap) just for the warn away function to be adjustable. In my case I installed a front and rear shock sensor in my daily driver for better coverage of my car.  In my car that I installed the AutoPage system in, I had to rig the warn-away wire over to the full alarm input to get better sensitivity.  I also had to use a DEI504D shock sensor with the AutoPage system due to the bug mentioned below and the fact that it has better sensitivity than the AutoPage OEM shock sensor.--Pros and Cons of the Systems--First, I'm very jaded against DEI with the bad experience I had with my 5901. Furthermore, the issues I had with the battery low warning chirping your horn/siren when you go to your car, and the car finder have been carried over to the 5704V. The other disaster with the 5901 was that the shock sensor was integrated into the 5901, which limited your installation locations. Thankfully, due to enough complaints, DEI did not carry this dumb idea over to the 5704.  The only thing that was nice about having the integrated shock sensor was that you could adjust the sensitivity from your remote, vs. having to potentially pull apart interior panels to adjust your shock sensor.  If these companies could come up with a standard to be able to adjust the shock sensor sensitivity from the system itself rather than the shock sensor, that would be great!The DEI 5704 has the most fine tuning options of any of the systems, as well as programmable output wires. The vast majority of people will not need to make use of these, and furthermore, you need to purchase a DEI Bitwriter to program many of those options. They could have just put a USB or serial port on the main system, but DEI wants to sell you an additional piece of hardware. Some of the Bitwriter options include remote start run time by the minute, smart start temperature, and siren duration by the seconds. You can also customize the key fob icon for each of the Aux outputs to Trunk, Window, and Sunroof with a Bitwriter. For me, I would rather not have the above problems, not have to buy a Bitwriter, and slightly less customization capabilities.In regards to the key fobs, the fob for the 5704 is the same as the one used with my older 5901. One complaint I had with that was that the rubber cover over the USB charging port only lasted a few months before disintegrating. Of all three of the fobs, none have an extremely noticeable vibration capability. During an alarm, the CodeAlarm and the Viper had the most noticeable vibrator, with the AutoPage being slightly less. I can tell you from the Viper that I've had mixed results with the vibrator alerting me. The problem is that none of the fobs actually vibrate and sound at the same time. Rather they sound, then vibrate briefly, then sound again. The piezzo buzzer on the AutoPage fob, however, is at least twice as loud as the one on both the Viper and the CodeAlarm.  In fact, I find myself having to use the AutoPage's fob while it's in my pocket sine it's so piercingly loud.The Viper 5704 and the AutoPage CS3-RS915LCD both have mini USB connectors on the key fobs. The CodeAlarm has the more modern style, micro USB charging connector. If you're an iPhone user, you're going to have to have multiple chargers in either scenario. If you're an Android user, you'll be happy with the CodeAlarm's fob since it's nice to have one universal charger that will work for your phone and your key fob, not to mention there will certainly be lots of your friends and coworkers that will have a micro-USB charger lying around if needed. The fobs that come with the AutoPage and the CodeAlarm both have painted fronts, and expect them to wear quickly.  The plating on the CodeAlarm and AutoPage's fobs have both disintegrated pretty well over several months.  I wish they would just leave the paint off and leave them rubberized black plastic. The silver paint on my Viper fob is half gone exposing an ugly greenish plastic underneath. Finally, I found with all the fobs, that it's very easy to accidentally hit one of the super large lock/unlock buttons when they're moving around in your pocket. One thing with the AutoPage, if you hit the lock button while the system is already armed, it triggers the car finder and will beep your horn - annoying. With the CodeAlarm, you have to hit a side button to trigger the car finder, which is difficult to do by accident. If you manage to hold down the unlock button, that ends up being a trunk release, if you have that functionality in your vehicle.The fob for the AutoPage is almost identical to the CodeAlarm (they both must be using the same manufacturer for the remotes), but the navigation is completely different. Getting to 2-car mode with the CodeAlarm is much easier - just press the F button, then lock and unlock together. With the AutoPage, you have to go through the menu, which can be tricky (though it's at least a menu vs. having to memorize some random key sequences). For the Viper, you have to hold down the F button as well to change to car 2.  I like how you can also customize the color on the Viper's and the AutoPage's fob's backlights. As far as battery life goes, you should get at the very minimum around 5 weeks or more per charge on any of the fobs depending on usage.From experience with the key fobs, the plastic LCD display covers get scratched and blurred very quickly from being in your pocket, bag, etc with other keys and items. At the same time you get one of these systems, get some good quality screen protectors with STRONG adhesive so they don't peel up. When you get the systems, they come with a cheap plastic sticky protector on the fob's display.  Peel that off and keep it to use as a template to cut screen protectors.  Put it on top of a screen protector, and trace around it with a fine tip marker (I use the fine tip Sharpies). Cut out inside the line you drew. It's not going to be perfect, but it's better than eventually having a blurry and scratched display. Oh, and make sure you clean the grease, etc. off your fob's display with rubbing alcohol before applying the screen protector.For the remote start functionality, they all behave pretty similarly, though I've only tested the CodeAlarm in practice. The only two difference I see are that first, you have more one more option with the AutoPage to avoid accidental starts. With all of them, you can at the very least set them so you need to hit the start button twice within a few seconds. Second, with both the AutoPage and Viper, you can have temperature controlled starts, with the AutoPage able to be set at 0 degrees F, and 15 degrees F, and Viper only 0 degrees, but the Viper customizable to 10 degree F increments if you also have a Bitwriter. The Viper can also start your car at a high temperature for cooling, where the AutoPage only has a low temperature. The viper might be helpful for you if you happened to need to leave a pet in the car in a hot climate. For me, I would never use temperature controller start, and I would carefully consider whether or not you would use it before making a decision based on this.So far, I've had no major issues with the remote start functionality of the ca6551sst. I tested it in combination with an iDatalink transponder bypass, as well as a DEI PKALL, but it took many, many tries to get the PKALL programmed, so I didn't trust it. With both bypasses I had to increase the crank time since they're slow to send the code, but the ca6551sst let me easily adjust that. And that leads me to one more difference in the remote start - the Viper and the AutoPage have several more options for crank time than the CodeAlarm, but again that hasn't posed an issue for me with the CodeAlarm.As far as the alarm functionality goes, the CodeAlarm has an enormous win over the Viper and AutoPage, and that is that if you use the horn for your alarm, when your alarm is triggered it will optionally (by default) hold on your horn with random brief pauses! This definitely is an attention getter - wow! Personally, I don't hook up the included sirens, I only use the horn since I don't like to drill a hole through the car's firewall to run a wire for the siren. Sometimes you can find an unused wire in your car to use for the siren, or just be able to slip a wire through an existing hole through the firewall.As with my Viper, when disarming the CodeAlarm I've found that once or twice a week it will take 1-2 button pushes to disarm the security system, where each time I'm standing within a few feet of the vehicle. Fortunately it hasn't been the 100's of times it would take  with the Viper.One other issue I have with the CodeAlarm is that there is a ""ground while armed"" wire on the CodeAlarm that I use for a secondary warning LED that I mounted on the dash of my vehicle. Unfortunately, it's also on during remote start even when the system is disarmed. Because of this, it stays on until I put my key in the ignition, turn it to on, and press the brake to release the system's control over the starter. This means I'm going to have to get a relay that will cut off ground to the LED during remote start. The Viper on the other hand has 4 programmable outputs that you can set either to validity, link to arm, link to disarm, link to arm/disarm, or remote start only. They're all controllable from the fob. It's nice that they have these built in, but you'll need a Bitwriter to program and fob icon and the latch time away from the default of 30 seconds if you're planning on using them for window rollup and/or sunroof closure. The AutoPage has 3 programmable outputs, and you can program the timer from 1 second to 2 minutes without any sort of add-on. For the CodeAlarm you'll need an external timer relay.The AutoPage is the only one of the three that doesn't have warning LEDs on the antenna, and comes with an external LED. This is important to me since the antenna can draw attention to the antenna's location. If someone is smart enough, they could break into your car and if they rip off the antenna quick enough, you would never get a page. On the other hand though, not having LEDs integrated into the antenna could be a drawback for the install since then you have to find a place to mount your LED, and potentially have to drill a hole somewhere. For me, I purchased a small black plastic project box, drill a hole in it, mounted the LED in, and mounted the box in the car using double sided 3m sticky mounting squares found at Walmart.One other note is that the CodeAlarm has no car temperature check functionality, whereas both the Viper and CodeAlarm do. Also, as alluded to above, both the AutoPage and the Viper have extra programmable outputs if you want them to close your windows, sunroof, etc. The CodeAlarm only has one programmable output, though on the Viper and AutoPage, those outputs have various limited functionality. I suggest downloading the manuals for more info.In regards to support, I did contact DEI three times - twice by phone, and once by email. I definitely have to give them credit as they answered me each time in a timely fashion by phone and email. I tried calling AutoPage, and was not able to get through on their consumer phone support number.  I also tried emailing AutoPage, and I never received a reply. I did not try contacting CodeAlarm's support.In summary, I think any of these can be winners depending on your requirements, likes, and dislikes. The AutoPage has everything the CodeAlarm has and then some, except for the random horn honk feature when alarming. The big thing that I really like about the CodeAlarm is definitely the random horn honks - that would really get people's attention in a parking lot full of cars where most people have learned to tune out car alarm honking. However, the AutoPage does have a slightly better fob with a more powerful vibrator and much louder sound which is really important to me. I also like how the AutoPage will let you change the fob's background color whereas the CodeAlarm will not, not that this should be a deciding factor. I would only go with the Viper if for some reason I didn't mind purchasing a Bitwriter, needed an extreme customization option, or the high temp auto start capability.Personally, my favorite is the CodeAlarm. I like the random horn honk feature, the micro USB charging port for the FOB, the fact that you can use a jeweler's screwdriver to release the wires that you don't need form the harness rather than cutting them (in case you move it to another car or decide to use a feature someday), and that it's virtually bug free except as noted with taking 1-2 extra unlock pushes on the FOB once in a while.Lastly, it should be mentioned that all three have the ability to link to optional cellular based add-ons that you pay subscription fees for so you can get alarm notifications, start your car, unlock your doors, etc. from a smart phone. AutoPage calls their's C3. DEI/Viper calls theirs SmartStart (not good reviews here on Amazon), and CodeAlarm (Audiovox) calls their add-on 220Carlink. The DEI/Viper and the AutoPage both have GPS tracking available. The subscription fees vary, so do some homework.---Major Bug with AutoPage System Received---Finally, I must mention that the AutoPage CS3-RS915 LCD systems apparently have a manufacturing bug at this time. I purchased two from different resellers, and they both had this bug. The majority of the time, triggering the warn-away stage on the shock sensor will subsequently trip the 2nd stage/full alarm for the majority of the time. Other times it behaves normally for a while until the unit is power cycled. Or, if the unit is power cycled, it will start misbehaving again. Sometimes when the 1st stage is tripped, the LED's for both stages go into a frenzy for a minute or so, though the alarm never gets triggered. When I remove the blue wire from the shock sensor harness (the 2nd stage trigger), the 2nd stage doesn't get triggered. When I have the system set in shock sensor test mode, it behaves fine. It also works fine when paired with a DEI 504d shock sensor. So, the problem appears to be a combination of the main unit and the shock sensor. This problem could go unnoticed since unless you are paying close attention, the only symptom one would see, depending on how and what you were doing when you set your shock sensor's sensitivity, is that occasionally it will either take much less of a shock to set the system off (if you set the shock sensor sensitivity when it was behaving normal), or it will take a much harder hit to set the system off (if you set the shock sensor when it was acting up). Personally, I hate the warn away feature since it's an annoyance, and I always pull the warn away wire out of the shock sensor's harness (the green wire in this case), so it's not a big deal. It's still a bug though that makes me doubt AutoPage's quality control.  I actually ended up using a DEI 504d shock sensor (relatively cheap) with one of these, and RMA's the other.If anyone else out there reads this review that has one of these system, please test your shock sensor out over a few days time and leave a comment here letting us know if you're experiencing the same issue. You will see this issue as it will be impossible to just trigger the warn-away feature of the shock sensor. With a light hit, the green LED will light first, followed by another blink of the green LED, then the red LED.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 3, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1U9NODYE1G3AV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004BE4D2C#wasThisHelpful","R1U9NODYE1G3AV","A3LIF253SVDRMW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LIF253SVDRMW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a comparison review of the DEI Viper 5704V, the AutoPage CS3-RS915 LCD, and the CodeAlarm ca6551sst. I also have a DEI Viper 5901aka 5702V (the previous version of the 5704), and an AutoPage RS855 LCD.---Background---I have always done and prefer to do all my own installs. Not only is it something that I have the skills for and I enjoy doing, but I don't like other people disrespecting my property. Nobody respects anything that's not theirs, and I like to ensure everything is done to perfection without ruining anything. If you are technical and have patience, these systems are not difficult to install by any means. It's just a matter of knowing a little bit about electricity (12 Volts DC), locating the wires in your car that you need to tap onto, knowing how to carefully remove the panels in your car without breaking anything, and using the proper test tools, connectors, and wire wrap to make a very clean install without even cutting wires or drilling holes.---Preface---After purchasing a third car, needing to upgrade the systems in my current two cars, and researching the current selection of alarms, I decided to try each of the Directed Electronics Viper 5704, the Audiovox CodeAlarm ca6551sst, and the AutoPage CS3-RS915-LCD. They are all in the same class of 2-way paging alarms with remote start, and use spread spectrum technology to communicate between the main unit and the key fob. For those of you that don't know, this technology has been around for a while, and simply means that the communications can occur on multiple frequencies. This is good in case there is interference on one frequency, the transmissions can potentially get through to the receiver on another frequency.Besides having long range 2-way and spread spectrum technology, the other things that are important to me when selecting a security system:*Rechargeable remote - I hated having to keep a stash of AAA batteries around for my previous security systems.*Good manufacturer reputation - I've had good luck with my AutoPage system, and I know that Audiovox has been around for a while. I gave DEI a shot again just based on their name. I have used a lot of their accessories in the past (shock sensors, motion sensor, power door lock actuators, etc.) and have had good luck. DEI is the largest car security system manufacturer out there. DEI was founded by Darrell Issa, who is currently a congressman with a new worth of approximately $½ billion. One big problem I have with DEI is that they are very partner focused, and don't warranty their systems if they aren't installed by an authorized DEI dealer. This also means if you lose the (very un-detailed) install/wiring guide that the system comes with, you're not going to just be able to download it from their web site. So, make sure you take photos of it/make copies before you lose or destroy it.  AutoPage and Audiovox both make their install guides available for download on their web sites, and I suggest you review those as well as the user's manual entirely before deciding on a system to purchase since they will give you a lot of information as to the functionality.*Lots of customization options - one important thing for me is to be able to disable the arm and disarm chirps. Since the remotes for 2-way security systems such as these beep/vibrate to confirm that you've successfully armed/disarmed the systems, why would you want your car's siren or horn to chirp as well, unless you're trying to show off? I like to be stealth! The arm/disarm confirmation chirps can be enabled and disabled through the customization programming that's described in the install manual of all of these alarms.*Two car functionality - All these systems support 2 cars, with varying difficulty of switching the remote from one car to the other.*Vibrating remote - Being in a noisy place can easily drown out the high pitched sounds that the key fob makes when your alarm goes off.---The Reviews---I installed the DEI Viper 5901 in my older car several years ago. I purchased the 5901 and a competitive AutoPage alarm that came with a color OLED display at the same time. I decided to send the AutoPage alarm back and keep the 5901 in that car due to it having better range when comparing side by side, and the AutoPage's fob's color OLED display being impossible to see in sunlight. Had I have known the problems I was going to run into with DEI's junk 5901, I would have returned them both and purchased the AutoPage system with the non-color LCD display and with the spread spectrum technology. (Spread spectrum allows for communicating over multiple frequencies to get around interference.)Going back to my DEI Viper 5901, it has a major flaw where once every 2-3 months it will take 100's of tries of hitting the unlock button to disarm the system and unlock the car. I usually will end up having to use my key to get into my car, setting off the alarm along with making everyone around look and/or waking up all the neighbors, and quickly reaching under the dash and pulling the system's wire to the horn/power (whichever I could get to first). Pulling the power and resetting the system will fix the problem temporarily. The Viper 5901 would also frequently have a long delay before actually arming/locking and disarming/unlocking after hitting a button on the fob. Furthermore, sometimes pushing the buttons on the fob would have no effect at all, not even a confirmation beep like the fob would normally emit when pushing a button. I've read some other reviewers complain about this as well. I also have a couple other gripes with it, one being that the car finder will simply lay on the horn solid for several seconds, rather than a series of short beeps (like the CodeAlarm and the AutoPage systems will do). The way the 5901 and now the new 5704 just slams the horn solid for several seconds is a great way of getting people near your car pissed off and getting everyone to stare at you looking for your car. Maybe if you're the type to always pay attention to where you park or live in a small village somewhere and don't ever travel to a shopping mall this won't be a problem for you. Like many people out there though I have a very busy lifestyle with a lot of ADD and distractions, so I need to have a good functioning car finder! Second, even though you would have the system set to not chirp when arming/disarming, if the battery in the fob was low, it would chirp the horn for a long duration after about a 5-10 seconds from disarming the system. This was very frustrating at night when trying to wake everyone up, including the neighbors. The fob beeps when the battery is low anyhow, so why does it need to chirp your horn in addition? Also, if by design you're going to make the system chirp the horn when the battery in your fob is low, why have it chirp when you're going to the car???? It should chirp when you're leaving your car because that's when you're most likely going to go inside somewhere that you can charge it! There's also no option to disable this. Lastly, they decided it would be smart to integrate the shock sensor into the unit on the 5901. Ridiculous! This all just goes to show how little common sense the engineers who designed this thing have.I called DEI to mention these problems, and some cocky kid answered the phone that had no interest in my comments. They did verify that the car finder and fob battery low chirp issues I mentioned above had not been corrected, and I verified this after receiving the new Viper 5704V and testing it.After receiving each system, I first hooked them up on the bench to test. The first test was the power draw when armed and not alarming. This is important if you're going to let your car sit armed for an extended duration, like at an airport parking lot. The Viper and the CodeAlarm each drew ~40ma when armed, and the AutoPage ~24ma. Next was the range test. With the antennas all near each other, the range was almost identical when walking around my city neighborhood. Of course, it was no where near a mile that all the manufacturers claimed - more like 1200 feet down to the end of my street. Sometimes the CodeAlarm would work where the Viper wouldn't, and vice versa. I'm sure the FCC has a transmit power limit that the manufacturers must abide by. Expect around 1000-1500 feet at the most. If you really want to get notified, you can always get a prepaid SIM card and a 12v GSM alarm from eBay so you can get a text message on your cell phone. I will tell you I can park my car half way out in the parking lot of a typical WalMart or grocery store, and be able to communicate with my car half way into the store. Range is very dependant on obstructions.One thing to note is that these systems are not capable of full duplex communications between the system and the fob, meaning that if the system is transmitting to the fob, the system will not receive any button pushes on your fob. This is relevant in a couple scenarios. First, if your car is alarming, expect it to take up to 15 seconds of you standing there pushing the button on your fob for your system to stop alarming. This is because your system will be transmitting to alert your remote that there it is in alarm. The manufactures may have designed in periodic brief pauses in the transmission to allow for a signal from the remote to get through, and if you're lucky to press the button at just the right time, you might get your system to stop alarming sooner. In my tests, I was able to stop the AutoPage from alarming the soonest. This also applies to remote start. After your system starts your car, it will be transmitting to confirm that your car has started. You'll have to wait up to 15 seconds to be able to disarm your alarm and unlock your doors after using remote start. If I'm in a safe area, I'll usually disarm the system before activating remote start.Another thing to note with the fob communications is that for all of these systems it may take up to 10 seconds or so for your fob to be notified of your security system going off. The fobs from all manufacturers work similar to cell phones to conserve the battery life - they only turn the receiver on every so many seconds. So, if your security system happens to be triggered right after your fob went out of listening mode, you may have lost valuable time to nab the perpetrator who broke into or crashed into your car.

The vast majority of people will not need to make use of these, and furthermore, you need to purchase a DEI Bitwriter to program many of those options. They could have just put a USB or serial port on the main system, but DEI wants to sell you an additional piece of hardware. Some of the Bitwriter options include remote start run time by the minute, smart start temperature, and siren duration by the seconds. You can also customize the key fob icon for each of the Aux outputs to Trunk, Window, and Sunroof with a Bitwriter. For me, I would rather not have the above problems, not have to buy a Bitwriter, and slightly less customization capabilities.In regards to the key fobs, the fob for the 5704 is the same as the one used with my older 5901.

The fobs that come with the AutoPage and the CodeAlarm both have painted fronts, and expect them to wear quickly.  The plating on the CodeAlarm and AutoPage's fobs have both disintegrated pretty well over several months.  I wish they would just leave the paint off and leave them rubberized black plastic.

Put it on top of a screen protector, and trace around it with a fine tip marker (I use the fine tip Sharpies). Cut out inside the line you drew. It's not going to be perfect, but it's better than eventually having a blurry and scratched display. Oh, and make sure you clean the grease, etc. off your fob's display with rubbing alcohol before applying the screen protector.For the remote start functionality, they all behave pretty similarly, though I've only tested the CodeAlarm in practice. The only two difference I see are that first, you have more one more option with the AutoPage to avoid accidental starts. With all of them, you can at the very least set them so you need to hit the start button twice within a few seconds. Second, with both the AutoPage and Viper, you can have temperature controlled starts, with the AutoPage able to be set at 0 degrees F, and 15 degrees F, and Viper only 0 degrees, but the Viper customizable to 10 degree F increments if you also have a Bitwriter. The Viper can also start your car at a high temperature for cooling, where the AutoPage only has a low temperature. The viper might be helpful for you if you happened to need to leave a pet in the car in a hot climate. For me, I would never use temperature controller start, and I would carefully consider whether or not you would use it before making a decision based on this.So far, I've had no major issues with the remote start functionality of the ca6551sst. I tested it in combination with an iDatalink transponder bypass, as well as a DEI PKALL, but it took many, many tries to get the PKALL programmed, so I didn't trust it. With both bypasses I had to increase the crank time since they're slow to send the code, but the ca6551sst let me easily adjust that. And that leads me to one more difference in the remote start - the Viper and the AutoPage have several more options for crank time than the CodeAlarm, but again that hasn't posed an issue for me with the CodeAlarm.As far as the alarm functionality goes, the CodeAlarm has an enormous win over the Viper and AutoPage, and that is that if you use the horn for your alarm, when your alarm is triggered it will optionally (by default) hold on your horn with random brief pauses! This definitely is an attention getter - wow! Personally, I don't hook up the included sirens, I only use the horn since I don't like to drill a hole through the car's firewall to run a wire for the siren. Sometimes you can find an unused wire in your car to use for the siren, or just be able to slip a wire through an existing hole through the firewall.As with my Viper, when disarming the CodeAlarm I've found that once or twice a week it will take 1-2 button pushes to disarm the security system, where each time I'm standing within a few feet of the vehicle. Fortunately it hasn't been the 100's of times it would take  with the Viper.One other issue I have with the CodeAlarm is that there is a ""ground while armed"" wire on the CodeAlarm that I use for a secondary warning LED that I mounted on the dash of my vehicle. Unfortunately, it's also on during remote start even when the system is disarmed. Because of this, it stays on until I put my key in the ignition, turn it to on, and press the brake to release the system's control over the starter. This means I'm going to have to get a relay that will cut off ground to the LED during remote start. The Viper on the other hand has 4 programmable outputs that you can set either to validity, link to arm, link to disarm, link to arm/disarm, or remote start only. They're all controllable from the fob. It's nice that they have these built in, but you'll need a Bitwriter to program and fob icon and the latch time away from the default of 30 seconds if you're planning on using them for window rollup and/or sunroof closure. The AutoPage has 3 programmable outputs, and you can program the timer from 1 second to 2 minutes without any sort of add-on. For the CodeAlarm you'll need an external timer relay.The AutoPage is the only one of the three that doesn't have warning LEDs on the antenna, and comes with an external LED. This is important to me since the antenna can draw attention to the antenna's location. If someone is smart enough, they could break into your car and if they rip off the antenna quick enough, you would never get a page. On the other hand though, not having LEDs integrated into the antenna could be a drawback for the install since then you have to find a place to mount your LED, and potentially have to drill a hole somewhere. For me, I purchased a small black plastic project box, drill a hole in it, mounted the LED in, and mounted the box in the car using double sided 3m sticky mounting squares found at Walmart.One other note is that the CodeAlarm has no car temperature check functionality, whereas both the Viper and CodeAlarm do. Also, as alluded to above, both the AutoPage and the Viper have extra programmable outputs if you want them to close your windows, sunroof, etc. The CodeAlarm only has one programmable output, though on the Viper and AutoPage, those outputs have various limited functionality. I suggest downloading the manuals for more info.In regards to support, I did contact DEI three times - twice by phone, and once by email. I definitely have to give them credit as they answered me each time in a timely fashion by phone and email. I tried calling AutoPage, and was not able to get through on their consumer phone support number.  I also tried emailing AutoPage, and I never received a reply. I did not try contacting CodeAlarm's support.In summary, I think any of these can be winners depending on your requirements, likes, and dislikes. The AutoPage has everything the CodeAlarm has and then some, except for the random horn honk feature when alarming. The big thing that I really like about the CodeAlarm is definitely the random horn honks - that would really get people's attention in a parking lot full of cars where most people have learned to tune out car alarm honking. However, the AutoPage does have a slightly better fob with a more powerful vibrator and much louder sound which is really important to me. I also like how the AutoPage will let you change the fob's background color whereas the CodeAlarm will not, not that this should be a deciding factor. I would only go with the Viper if for some reason I didn't mind purchasing a Bitwriter, needed an extreme customization option, or the high temp auto start capability.  Personally, my favorite is the CodeAlarm.Lastly, it should be mentioned that all three have the ability to link to optional cellular based add-ons that you pay subscription fees for so you can get alarm notifications, start your car, unlock your doors, etc. from a smart phone. AutoPage calls their's C3. DEI/Viper calls theirs SmartStart (not good reviews here on Amazon), and CodeAlarm (Audiovox) calls their add-on 220Carlink. The DEI/Viper and the AutoPage both have GPS tracking available. The subscription fees vary, so do some homework.---Major Bug with AutoPage System Received---Finally, I must mention that the AutoPage systems apparently have a manufacturing bug at this time. I purchased two from different resellers, and they both had this bug. The majority of the time, triggering the warn-away stage on the shock sensor will subsequently trip the 2nd stage/full alarm for the majority of the time. Other times it behaves normally for a while until the unit is power cycled. Or, if the unit is power cycle, it will start misbehaving again. Sometimes when the 1st stage is tripped, the LED's for both stages go into a frenzy for a minute or so, though the alarm never gets triggered. When I remove the blue wire from the shock sensor harness (the 2nd stage trigger), the 2nd stage doesn't get triggered. When I have the system set in shock sensor test mode, it behaves fine. It also works fine when paired with a DEI 504d shock sensor. So, the problem appears to be a combination of the main unit and the shock sensor. This problem could go unnoticed since unless you are paying close attention, the only symptom one would see, depending on how and what you were doing you set your shock sensor's sensitivity, is that occasionally it will either take much less of a hit to set the system off (if you set the shock sensor sensitivity when it was behaving normal), or it will take a much harder hit to set the system off (if you set the shock sensor when it was acting up). Personally, I hate the warn away feature since it's an annoyance, and I always pull the warn away wire out of the shock sensor's harness (the green wire in this case), so it's not a big deal. It's still a bug though that makes me doubt AutoPage's quality control.If anyone else out there reads this review that has one of these system, please test your shock sensor out over a few days time and leave a comment here letting us know if you're experiencing the same issue. You will see this issue as it will be impossible to just trigger the warn-away feature of the shock sensor. With a light hit, the green LED will light first, followed by another blink of the green LED, then the red LED.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 3, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3HWCY2RNB8T7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0034DZMKS#wasThisHelpful","R3HWCY2RNB8T7","A3LIF253SVDRMW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LIF253SVDRMW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I purchased this to use with my 2009 Toyota along with an iDatalink module, which is the competing module for this.  They both worked fine.  I ended up sticking with the iDatalink.  One thing to note with these modules is that after the stupidly named ""while running"" wire has been sent ground grounded, there is a long delay before the code is actually sent to your vehicles transpoonder system, so you may have to increase the crank time for your remote start.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 18, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2JXQA04X7TOS7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001N7RE44#wasThisHelpful","R2JXQA04X7TOS7","A3LIF253SVDRMW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LIF253SVDRMW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This worked really well for me.  I already knew from reading on the forums out there that the color wasn't an exact match, but it's not that far off.  One thing you need to know is make absolutely sure that you push up on the thing while you start screwing back in the bolts that secure it to the chassis, or else you will end up with a gap on top between the kit and where your vents are.  I was going to get a double DIN unit, but I really like having the pocket there with my single DIN unit to stash my things in.  I ended up putting an extra security LED in there in a mini project box, along with the bluetooth microphone for my stereo.  I figured the microphone would actually be better in there vs. mounting up aboce on the windshield with the walls around it to help block out feedback from the door speakers and road noise.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 18, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3T6ZMEHFXXO7O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000YR2LNS#wasThisHelpful","R3T6ZMEHFXXO7O","A3LIF253SVDRMW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LIF253SVDRMW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a comparison review of the DEI Viper 5704V, the AutoPage CS3-RS915 LCD, and the CodeAlarm ca6551sst. I also have a DEI Viper 5901aka 5702V (the previous version of the 5704), and an AutoPage RS855 LCD.---Background---I have always done and prefer to do all my own installs. Not only is it something that I have the skills for and I enjoy doing, but I don't like other people disrespecting my property. Nobody respects anything that's not theirs, and I like to ensure everything is done to perfection without ruining anything. If you are technical and have patience, these systems are not difficult to install by any means. It's just a matter of knowing a little bit about electricity (12 Volts DC), locating the wires in your car that you need to tap onto, knowing how to carefully remove the panels in your car without breaking anything, and using the proper test tools, connectors, and wire wrap to make a very clean install without even cutting wires or drilling holes.---Preface---After purchasing a third car, needing to upgrade the systems in my current two cars, and researching the current selection of alarms, I decided to try each of the Directed Electronics Viper 5704, the Audiovox CodeAlarm ca6551sst, and the AutoPage CS3-RS915-LCD. They are all in the same class of 2-way paging alarms with remote start, and use spread spectrum technology to communicate between the main unit and the key fob. For those of you that don't know, this technology has been around for a while, and simply means that the communications can occur on multiple frequencies. This is good in case there is interference on one frequency, the transmissions can potentially get through to the receiver on another frequency.Besides having long range 2-way and spread spectrum technology, the other things that are important to me when selecting a security system:*Rechargeable remote - I hated having to keep a stash of AAA batteries around for my previous security systems.*Good manufacturer reputation - I've had good luck with my AutoPage system, and I know that Audiovox has been around for a while. I gave DEI a shot again just based on their name. I have used a lot of their accessories in the past (shock sensors, motion sensor, power door lock actuators, etc.) and have had good luck. DEI is the largest car security system manufacturer out there. DEI was founded by Darrell Issa, who is currently a congressman with a new worth of approximately $½ billion. One big problem I have with DEI is that they are very partner focused, and don't warranty their systems if they aren't installed by an authorized DEI dealer. This also means if you lose the (very un-detailed) install/wiring guide that the system comes with, you're not going to just be able to download it from their web site. So, make sure you take photos of it/make copies before you lose or destroy it.  AutoPage and Audiovox both make their install guides available for download on their web sites, and I suggest you review those as well as the user's manual entirely before deciding on a system to purchase since they will give you a lot of information as to the functionality.*Lots of customization options - one important thing for me is to be able to disable the arm and disarm chirps. Since the remotes for 2-way security systems such as these beep/vibrate to confirm that you've successfully armed/disarmed the systems, why would you want your car's siren or horn to chirp as well, unless you're trying to show off? I like to be stealth! The arm/disarm confirmation chirps can be enabled and disabled through the customization programming that's described in the install manual of all of these alarms.*Two car functionality - All these systems support 2 cars, with varying difficulty of switching the remote from one car to the other.*Vibrating remote - Being in a noisy place can easily drown out the high pitched sounds that the key fob makes when your alarm goes off.---The Reviews---I installed the DEI Viper 5901 in my older car several years ago. I purchased the 5901 and a competitive AutoPage alarm that came with a color OLED display at the same time. I decided to send the AutoPage alarm back and keep the 5901 in that car due to it having better range when comparing side by side, and the AutoPage's fob's color OLED display being impossible to see in sunlight. Had I have known the problems I was going to run into with DEI's junk 5901, I would have returned them both and purchased the AutoPage system with the non-color LCD display and with the spread spectrum technology. (Spread spectrum allows for communicating over multiple frequencies to get around interference.)Going back to my DEI Viper 5901, it has a major flaw where once every 2-3 months it will take 100's of tries of hitting the unlock button to disarm the system and unlock the car. I usually will end up having to use my key to get into my car, setting off the alarm along with making everyone around look and/or waking up all the neighbors, and quickly reaching under the dash and pulling the system's wire to the horn/power (whichever I could get to first). Pulling the power and resetting the system will fix the problem temporarily. The Viper 5901 would also frequently have a long delay before actually arming/locking and disarming/unlocking after hitting a button on the fob. Furthermore, sometimes pushing the buttons on the fob would have no effect at all, not even a confirmation beep like the fob would normally emit when pushing a button. I've read some other reviewers complain about this as well. I also have a couple other gripes with it, one being that the car finder will simply lay on the horn solid for several seconds, rather than a series of short beeps (like the CodeAlarm and the AutoPage systems will do). The way the 5901 and now the new 5704 just slams the horn solid for several seconds is a great way of getting people near your car pissed off and getting everyone to stare at you looking for your car. Maybe if you're the type to always pay attention to where you park or live in a small village somewhere and don't ever travel to a shopping mall this won't be a problem for you. Like many people out there though I have a very busy lifestyle with a lot of ADD and distractions, so I need to have a good functioning car finder! Second, even though you would have the system set to not chirp when arming/disarming, if the battery in the fob was low, it would chirp the horn for a long duration after about a 5-10 seconds from disarming the system. This was very frustrating at night when trying to wake everyone up, including the neighbors. The fob beeps when the battery is low anyhow, so why does it need to chirp your horn in addition? Also, if by design you're going to make the system chirp the horn when the battery in your fob is low, why have it chirp when you're going to the car???? It should chirp when you're leaving your car because that's when you're most likely going to go inside somewhere that you can charge it! There's also no option to disable this. Lastly, they decided it would be smart to integrate the shock sensor into the unit on the 5901. Ridiculous! This all just goes to show how little common sense the engineers who designed this thing have.I called DEI to mention these problems, and some cocky kid answered the phone that had no interest in my comments. They did verify that the car finder and fob battery low chirp issues I mentioned above had not been corrected, and I verified this after receiving the new Viper 5704V and testing it.After receiving each system, I first hooked them up on the bench to test. The first test was the power draw when armed and not alarming. This is important if you're going to let your car sit armed for an extended duration, like at an airport parking lot. The Viper and the CodeAlarm each drew ~40ma when armed, and the AutoPage ~24ma. Next was the range test. With the antennas all near each other, the range was almost identical when walking around my city neighborhood. Of course, it was no where near a mile that all the manufacturers claimed - more like 1200 feet down to the end of my street. Sometimes the CodeAlarm would work where the Viper wouldn't, and vice versa. I'm sure the FCC has a transmit power limit that the manufacturers must abide by. Expect around 1000-1500 feet at the most. If you really want to get notified, you can always get a prepaid SIM card and a 12v GSM alarm from eBay so you can get a text message on your cell phone. I will tell you I can park my car half way out in the parking lot of a typical WalMart or grocery store, and be able to communicate with my car half way into the store. Range is very dependant on obstructions.One thing to note is that these systems are not capable of full duplex communications between the system and the fob, meaning that if the system is transmitting to the fob, the system will not receive any button pushes on your fob. This is relevant in a couple scenarios. First, if your car is alarming, expect it to take up to 15 seconds of you standing there pushing the button on your fob for your system to stop alarming. This is because your system will be transmitting to alert your remote that there it is in alarm. The manufactures may have designed in periodic brief pauses in the transmission to allow for a signal from the remote to get through, and if you're lucky to press the button at just the right time, you might get your system to stop alarming sooner. In my tests, I was able to stop the AutoPage from alarming the soonest. This also applies to remote start. After your system starts your car, it will be transmitting to confirm that your car has started. You'll have to wait up to 15 seconds to be able to disarm your alarm and unlock your doors after using remote start. If I'm in a safe area, I'll usually disarm the system before activating remote start.Another thing to note with the fob communications is that for all of these systems it may take up to 10 seconds or so for your fob to be notified of your security system going off. The fobs from all manufacturers work similar to cell phones to conserve the battery life - they only turn the receiver on every so many seconds. So, if your security system happens to be triggered right after your fob went out of listening mode, you may have lost valuable time to nab the perpetrator who broke into or crashed into your car. From my tests, the AutoPage had the slowest frequency of checks and took the longest to be notified of an alarm condition.Each system has a ""warn away"" function that relies on the dual stage shock sensor they come with. When a lighter touch on your vehicle is detected, the siren/horn chirps quickly. I find that the ""warn away"" is pretty much useless, and is frequently set off by loud motorcycles driving by. The warn-away feature is complicated by the fact that the shock sensors that these systems come with only have a single adjustment, rather than a separate adjustment for each stage. So, you can't customize your sensitivity for full alarm vs. warn away and you may end up with lots of warn away pages/beeps if you like your shock sensor sensitive. You might be better off either not using the warn-away, or purchasing a separate shock sensor (they are cheap) just for the warn away function to be adjustable. In my case I installed a front and rear shock sensor in my daily driver for better coverage of my car.  In my car that I installed the AutoPage system in, I had to rig the warn-away wire over to the full alarm input to get better sensitivity.  I also had to use a DEI504D shock sensor with the AutoPage system due to the bug mentioned below and the fact that it has better sensitivity than the AutoPage OEM shock sensor.--Pros and Cons of the Systems--First, I'm very jaded against DEI with the bad experience I had with my 5901. Furthermore, the issues I had with the battery low warning chirping your horn/siren when you go to your car, and the car finder have been carried over to the 5704V. The other disaster with the 5901 was that the shock sensor was integrated into the 5901, which limited your installation locations. Thankfully, due to enough complaints, DEI did not carry this dumb idea over to the 5704.  The only thing that was nice about having the integrated shock sensor was that you could adjust the sensitivity from your remote, vs. having to potentially pull apart interior panels to adjust your shock sensor.  If these companies could come up with a standard to be able to adjust the shock sensor sensitivity from the system itself rather than the shock sensor, that would be great!The DEI 5704 has the most fine tuning options of any of the systems, as well as programmable output wires. The vast majority of people will not need to make use of these, and furthermore, you need to purchase a DEI Bitwriter to program many of those options. They could have just put a USB or serial port on the main system, but DEI wants to sell you an additional piece of hardware. Some of the Bitwriter options include remote start run time by the minute, smart start temperature, and siren duration by the seconds. You can also customize the key fob icon for each of the Aux outputs to Trunk, Window, and Sunroof with a Bitwriter. For me, I would rather not have the above problems, not have to buy a Bitwriter, and slightly less customization capabilities.In regards to the key fobs, the fob for the 5704 is the same as the one used with my older 5901. One complaint I had with that was that the rubber cover over the USB charging port only lasted a few months before disintegrating. Of all three of the fobs, none have an extremely noticeable vibration capability. During an alarm, the CodeAlarm and the Viper had the most noticeable vibrator, with the AutoPage being slightly less. I can tell you from the Viper that I've had mixed results with the vibrator alerting me. The problem is that none of the fobs actually vibrate and sound at the same time. Rather they sound, then vibrate briefly, then sound again. The piezzo buzzer on the AutoPage fob, however, is at least twice as loud as the one on both the Viper and the CodeAlarm.  In fact, I find myself having to use the AutoPage's fob while it's in my pocket sine it's so piercingly loud.The Viper 5704 and the AutoPage CS3-RS915LCD both have mini USB connectors on the key fobs. The CodeAlarm has the more modern style, micro USB charging connector. If you're an iPhone user, you're going to have to have multiple chargers in either scenario. If you're an Android user, you'll be happy with the CodeAlarm's fob since it's nice to have one universal charger that will work for your phone and your key fob, not to mention there will certainly be lots of your friends and coworkers that will have a micro-USB charger lying around if needed. The fobs that come with the AutoPage and the CodeAlarm both have painted fronts, and expect them to wear quickly.  The plating on the CodeAlarm and AutoPage's fobs have both disintegrated pretty well over several months.  I wish they would just leave the paint off and leave them rubberized black plastic. The silver paint on my Viper fob is half gone exposing an ugly greenish plastic underneath. Finally, I found with all the fobs, that it's very easy to accidentally hit one of the super large lock/unlock buttons when they're moving around in your pocket. One thing with the AutoPage, if you hit the lock button while the system is already armed, it triggers the car finder and will beep your horn - annoying. With the CodeAlarm, you have to hit a side button to trigger the car finder, which is difficult to do by accident. If you manage to hold down the unlock button, that ends up being a trunk release, if you have that functionality in your vehicle.The fob for the AutoPage is almost identical to the CodeAlarm (they both must be using the same manufacturer for the remotes), but the navigation is completely different. Getting to 2-car mode with the CodeAlarm is much easier - just press the F button, then lock and unlock together. With the AutoPage, you have to go through the menu, which can be tricky (though it's at least a menu vs. having to memorize some random key sequences). For the Viper, you have to hold down the F button as well to change to car 2.  I like how you can also customize the color on the Viper's and the AutoPage's fob's backlights. As far as battery life goes, you should get at the very minimum around 5 weeks or more per charge on any of the fobs depending on usage.From experience with the key fobs, the plastic LCD display covers get scratched and blurred very quickly from being in your pocket, bag, etc with other keys and items. At the same time you get one of these systems, get some good quality screen protectors with STRONG adhesive so they don't peel up. When you get the systems, they come with a cheap plastic sticky protector on the fob's display.  Peel that off and keep it to use as a template to cut screen protectors.  Put it on top of a screen protector, and trace around it with a fine tip marker (I use the fine tip Sharpies). Cut out inside the line you drew. It's not going to be perfect, but it's better than eventually having a blurry and scratched display. Oh, and make sure you clean the grease, etc. off your fob's display with rubbing alcohol before applying the screen protector.For the remote start functionality, they all behave pretty similarly, though I've only tested the CodeAlarm in practice. The only two difference I see are that first, you have more one more option with the AutoPage to avoid accidental starts. With all of them, you can at the very least set them so you need to hit the start button twice within a few seconds. Second, with both the AutoPage and Viper, you can have temperature controlled starts, with the AutoPage able to be set at 0 degrees F, and 15 degrees F, and Viper only 0 degrees, but the Viper customizable to 10 degree F increments if you also have a Bitwriter. The Viper can also start your car at a high temperature for cooling, where the AutoPage only has a low temperature. The viper might be helpful for you if you happened to need to leave a pet in the car in a hot climate. For me, I would never use temperature controller start, and I would carefully consider whether or not you would use it before making a decision based on this.So far, I've had no major issues with the remote start functionality of the ca6551sst. I tested it in combination with an iDatalink transponder bypass, as well as a DEI PKALL, but it took many, many tries to get the PKALL programmed, so I didn't trust it. With both bypasses I had to increase the crank time since they're slow to send the code, but the ca6551sst let me easily adjust that. And that leads me to one more difference in the remote start - the Viper and the AutoPage have several more options for crank time than the CodeAlarm, but again that hasn't posed an issue for me with the CodeAlarm.As far as the alarm functionality goes, the CodeAlarm has an enormous win over the Viper and AutoPage, and that is that if you use the horn for your alarm, when your alarm is triggered it will optionally (by default) hold on your horn with random brief pauses! This definitely is an attention getter - wow! Personally, I don't hook up the included sirens, I only use the horn since I don't like to drill a hole through the car's firewall to run a wire for the siren. Sometimes you can find an unused wire in your car to use for the siren, or just be able to slip a wire through an existing hole through the firewall.As with my Viper, when disarming the CodeAlarm I've found that once or twice a week it will take 1-2 button pushes to disarm the security system, where each time I'm standing within a few feet of the vehicle. Fortunately it hasn't been the 100's of times it would take  with the Viper.One other issue I have with the CodeAlarm is that there is a ""ground while armed"" wire on the CodeAlarm that I use for a secondary warning LED that I mounted on the dash of my vehicle. Unfortunately, it's also on during remote start even when the system is disarmed. Because of this, it stays on until I put my key in the ignition, turn it to on, and press the brake to release the system's control over the starter. This means I'm going to have to get a relay that will cut off ground to the LED during remote start. The Viper on the other hand has 4 programmable outputs that you can set either to validity, link to arm, link to disarm, link to arm/disarm, or remote start only. They're all controllable from the fob. It's nice that they have these built in, but you'll need a Bitwriter to program and fob icon and the latch time away from the default of 30 seconds if you're planning on using them for window rollup and/or sunroof closure. The AutoPage has 3 programmable outputs, and you can program the timer from 1 second to 2 minutes without any sort of add-on. For the CodeAlarm you'll need an external timer relay.The AutoPage is the only one of the three that doesn't have warning LEDs on the antenna, and comes with an external LED. This is important to me since the antenna can draw attention to the antenna's location. If someone is smart enough, they could break into your car and if they rip off the antenna quick enough, you would never get a page. On the other hand though, not having LEDs integrated into the antenna could be a drawback for the install since then you have to find a place to mount your LED, and potentially have to drill a hole somewhere. For me, I purchased a small black plastic project box, drill a hole in it, mounted the LED in, and mounted the box in the car using double sided 3m sticky mounting squares found at Walmart.One other note is that the CodeAlarm has no car temperature check functionality, whereas both the Viper and CodeAlarm do. Also, as alluded to above, both the AutoPage and the Viper have extra programmable outputs if you want them to close your windows, sunroof, etc. The CodeAlarm only has one programmable output, though on the Viper and AutoPage, those outputs have various limited functionality. I suggest downloading the manuals for more info.In regards to support, I did contact DEI three times - twice by phone, and once by email. I definitely have to give them credit as they answered me each time in a timely fashion by phone and email. I tried calling AutoPage, and was not able to get through on their consumer phone support number.  I also tried emailing AutoPage, and I never received a reply. I did not try contacting CodeAlarm's support.In summary, I think any of these can be winners depending on your requirements, likes, and dislikes. The AutoPage has everything the CodeAlarm has and then some, except for the random horn honk feature when alarming. The big thing that I really like about the CodeAlarm is definitely the random horn honks - that would really get people's attention in a parking lot full of cars where most people have learned to tune out car alarm honking. However, the AutoPage does have a slightly better fob with a more powerful vibrator and much louder sound which is really important to me. I also like how the AutoPage will let you change the fob's background color whereas the CodeAlarm will not, not that this should be a deciding factor. I would only go with the Viper if for some reason I didn't mind purchasing a Bitwriter, needed an extreme customization option, or the high temp auto start capability.Personally, my favorite is the CodeAlarm. I like the random horn honk feature, the micro USB charging port for the FOB, the fact that you can use a jeweler's screwdriver to release the wires that you don't need form the harness rather than cutting them (in case you move it to another car or decide to use a feature someday), and that it's virtually bug free except as noted with taking 1-2 extra unlock pushes on the FOB once in a while.Lastly, it should be mentioned that all three have the ability to link to optional cellular based add-ons that you pay subscription fees for so you can get alarm notifications, start your car, unlock your doors, etc. from a smart phone. AutoPage calls their's C3. DEI/Viper calls theirs SmartStart (not good reviews here on Amazon), and CodeAlarm (Audiovox) calls their add-on 220Carlink. The DEI/Viper and the AutoPage both have GPS tracking available. The subscription fees vary, so do some homework.---Major Bug with AutoPage System Received---Finally, I must mention that the AutoPage CS3-RS915 LCD systems apparently have a manufacturing bug at this time. I purchased two from different resellers, and they both had this bug. The majority of the time, triggering the warn-away stage on the shock sensor will subsequently trip the 2nd stage/full alarm for the majority of the time. Other times it behaves normally for a while until the unit is power cycled. Or, if the unit is power cycled, it will start misbehaving again. Sometimes when the 1st stage is tripped, the LED's for both stages go into a frenzy for a minute or so, though the alarm never gets triggered. When I remove the blue wire from the shock sensor harness (the 2nd stage trigger), the 2nd stage doesn't get triggered. When I have the system set in shock sensor test mode, it behaves fine. It also works fine when paired with a DEI 504d shock sensor. So, the problem appears to be a combination of the main unit and the shock sensor. This problem could go unnoticed since unless you are paying close attention, the only symptom one would see, depending on how and what you were doing when you set your shock sensor's sensitivity, is that occasionally it will either take much less of a shock to set the system off (if you set the shock sensor sensitivity when it was behaving normal), or it will take a much harder hit to set the system off (if you set the shock sensor when it was acting up). Personally, I hate the warn away feature since it's an annoyance, and I always pull the warn away wire out of the shock sensor's harness (the green wire in this case), so it's not a big deal. It's still a bug though that makes me doubt AutoPage's quality control.  I actually ended up using a DEI 504d shock sensor (relatively cheap) with one of these, and RMA's the other.If anyone else out there reads this review that has one of these system, please test your shock sensor out over a few days time and leave a comment here letting us know if you're experiencing the same issue. You will see this issue as it will be impossible to just trigger the warn-away feature of the shock sensor. With a light hit, the green LED will light first, followed by another blink of the green LED, then the red LED.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 13, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RIQVQIHC01E5F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005ZHFXKU#wasThisHelpful","RIQVQIHC01E5F","A3LIF253SVDRMW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LIF253SVDRMW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book is (all about) garbage - and it’s great!Following up his excellent memoir, My Friend Dahmer (a book about actually going to school with cannibal serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer), John “Derf” Backderf takes a look at the American trash industry in Trashed. Part fiction, part memoir (Backderf was briefly a garbageman in 1980) and part non-fiction (the facts presented in this book are meticulously researched), Trashed follows 21 year old JB through the four seasons, learning the trade of trash collecting.It’s a juggling act between styles that Backderf manages really well. A book that would just list facts about garbage would be too dry and one just about his experiences as a garbageman, or the misadventures of the fictional JB, would be a bit insubstantial. But merged together, Trashed is a very strong comic.Through JB, we see the horrors of being a garbageman: maggots in bins, bin soup, dead cats, headless deer, diaper bombs (when compacted, you get flying s***!), yellow torpedoes (plastic bottles of pee tossed out of car windows), and the worst of the worst, cheap bin bags that break leaving the garbageman to scoop up the trash with his arms.Trashed is very informative and the reader will get a brief history of garbage through the ages, how recycling works, the biodegrading of various materials, how trash trucks are designed, how landfills operate, and the landfills’ legacy on the ecological landscape. These facts are seamlessly woven into JB’s story as he encounters them, eg. when he’s picking up dirty diapers, there are facts on how many diapers Americans go through and how long they’ll take to break down.It IS a bit depressing in just how much garbage there is and how our culture has become more enamoured with throwing stuff out over the last few decades. In fact, Western economies seem built around the short lifespan of products with everyday devices intended to only last a few years before needing to be replaced. But as gloomy as it may be, it’s still a fascinating read.Backderf makes the book palatable through our likeable everyman protagonist JB, a young man disgusted with our society’s garbage culture but who approaches it from a practical and light perspective. Joining him are a colourful cast of characters like his perpetually pissed-off manager, Wile E, his flatmate, the hipster Magee, his colleagues Mike and Bone, and Marv the (far too old) Village Dog Catcher.There isn’t too much of a plot as it’s mostly on-the-job anecdotes though these are plenty as these episodes are interesting and bring home the variety of crap we throw out. The fiction ties it all together even if it isn’t a terribly gripping read.Trashed is a very American-centric book and, while Backderf briefly mentions the various alternative methods of trash disposal used by Europeans who don’t have the luxury of endless space like America, I would’ve liked to have seen a wider look at the issue. Backderf’s conclusion at the end seems to be bigger landfills in remoter places like Alaska which seems a bit pointless when there are better methods out there than simply burying the problem. Then again, there’s real money behind landfills so I guess Americans are stuck with the crap solution for now.A book about garbage doesn’t seem the likeliest choice for a good read but Derf Backderf pulls it off in Trashed! It’s entertaining and a little sad, but very revealing, it’s one of the most memorable comics I’ve read all year. Definitely worth checking out!","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R240HWNYMSQEG7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1419714546#wasThisHelpful","R240HWNYMSQEG7","A3I8FT707XKQAJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3I8FT707XKQAJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Kamala Khan: Muslim? American? No – Inhuman!Kamala, a teenager from New Jersey, gets superpowers after encountering the Terrigen Mist (the fallout cloud from the Terrigen bomb detonated by Black Bolt during Thanos’ latest invasion of Earth). She has a healing factor, she can grow large or small, and she can shapeshift; Kamala Khan is the new Ms Marvel!In this second book, Kamala’s still on the trail of The Inventor, a mad villain with the head of a cockatiel who’s been abducting school children with his robots – but for what sinister purpose? Also, because Kamala’s new at this superhero-ing stuff she gets a helping hand and paw from two veterans of the Marvel Universe: Wolverine and Lockjaw. It’s team-up time for Ms Marvel as she makes the jump from writing Wolverine fan-fiction to saving his ass for reals!The two-issue team-up with Wolverine is so good, it made me wish Wilson had written Death of Wolverine instead of Charles Soule. Soule’s a fine writer but his Wolverine was cold – Wilson made me care about Wolverine in a way I hadn’t in some time.So obviously this is pre-latest death of Wolverine and he’s lost his healing factor. On the trail of a missing student from the Jean Grey School, Wolverine and Kamala’s paths cross and the two fight urban legends come true: crocodiles in the sewers. With cybernetic implants courtesy of The Inventor, of course!It’s not so much the story but the interactions between Wolverine and Kamala that’s awesome. Wolverine alone is usually always boring and a good Wolverine solo comic is rare (ditto the movies). Put him with a kid he has to look after/mentor? Watch him shine. Kitty Pryde, Jubilee, now Kamala Khan – there’s something about pairing Logan with a young girl that brings out the best in his character. He finds out Kamala has a healing factor like he used to and, when she’s about to do something dangerous, he says “It’s gotta hurt. That’s how this works. You just gotta trust yourself to come through it.” – it sounds true and wise even though it’s impossible. That’s why I like Willow’s treatment of Wolverine so much.You might think with a bigger name, Kamala would be overshadowed, but she’s not. She doesn’t get saved by Wolverine, she saves him – it’s her story all the way through, he’s just along for the ride. As if to emphasise the relationship, there’s even a Luke on Dagobah-type scene where Kamala carries an injured Wolverine on her back!But the best team-up in the book is Kamala and Lockjaw. Who’s Lockjaw? A giant bulldog-type creature with a tuning fork on his head and teleportation powers, who is the Inhuman Royal Family’s escort and the most adorable, cuddly, beautiful Marvel character ever! Lockjaw’s sent by Queen Medusa to watch over Kamala, protecting her and eventually guiding her to Attilan where she discovers her true nature as an Inhuman.Without giving away where the story’s headed, it’s a wonderfully, embiggeningly positive message to send to younger readers as well as fitting in with the fun, light tone of the series. Kamala is quickly becoming a lightning rod of attention for Marvel to the wider world and it’s great that they’re using her in such an inclusive way with other non-super-powered characters her age as well as the rest of the Marvel Universe.Terrific writing from G Willow Wilson aside, how’s the art? I really liked Jacob Wyatt’s work on the two-issue Kamala/Wolverine story. It’s a good blend of comical cartoonishness and solid superhero artwork, and I loved Kamala’s goofy fangirl dance when she first meets Logan! Series regular Adrian Alphona picks up art duties for the rest of the book and it’s as delightful as ever. There’s also giant robot action, and the most delightful scenes between Kamala and Lockjaw, heart-warming for dog lovers everywhere. The Jamie McKelvie covers are awesome as always and Kris Anka’s covers are brilliant too. The art team is first class all the way on this one!G. Willow Wilson and Adrian Alphona’s Ms Marvel is the finest comic Marvel is publishing right now. That’s it. Go read Volume 2: Generation Why, it’s THE BEST!","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1SZ4QWQA7QHS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0785190228#wasThisHelpful","R1SZ4QWQA7QHS","A3I8FT707XKQAJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3I8FT707XKQAJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"1930s: Sheldon Sampson leads a group, including his brother Walter and girlfriend Grace, to an island that doesn’t appear on any maps and that he’s only seen in his dreams. They find it and gain superpowers from aliens - as you do.Present day: Sheldon and Grace’s kids, Chloe and Brandon, are spoilt celebrity brats, leeching off of their parents’ fame, the two greatest superheroes that ever were. It’s tough to follow that legacy so they don’t do anything superheroic, preferring to do drugs, drink, screw groupies, and chase sponsorship deals.Feeling emasculated after a public quarrel with his dad, Brandon jumps at his uncle Walter’s suggestion that they do away with Sheldon, the Superman of this world, who’s adamant that superheroes should stay out of politics, the economy, etc. But superheroes have so much more to offer than saving the world from Darkseid-esque villains... right?The idea of “the superhero fixing real world problems from a position of power” has been done before, and better, in Warren Ellis’ The Authority (which Mark Millar wrote a few issues of, way back when), so Jupiter’s Legacy doesn’t really offer up anything original. In fact, there’s nothing original about this book! It’s a collection of other pop culture artefacts like the Star Wars prequels and Marvel’s Civil War (also written by Millar), with shades of Zack Snyder’s Man of Steel.I remember reading an interview before this comic came out where Millar said he was inspired by Carrie Fisher’s autobiography (another Star Wars reference!) where she talked about growing up in the shadow of two celebrity parents. The stress of feeling that she had to live up to them led her to find escape with drugs. Except Millar doesn’t really explore this angle enough with Chloe and Brandon. We see them partying while their parents are off saving the world, then later the parents and kids arguing, and that’s about it. Real insightful!Millar then drops that idea entirely to do his Authority rip-off which, again, is surface-level only and unsatisfying. Duuh, turns out superheroes aren’t better at fixing the world than politicians! Then he turns to writing Civil War - again! The fast-moving story - and it jumps from the 1930s to the present day to 10 years from now really quickly - doesn’t help either so it reads like very superficial episodes barely strung together into a cohesive thread.Evil uncle Walter uses young Brandon so deftly, manipulating him to suit his plans so easily, that it felt like the Palpatine/Anakin relationship in Revenge of the Sith. He’s clearly evil, why are you listening to him!? Why does Brandon - and every single superhero in existence - so readily agree to murder the Utopian and his wife? Because he was sometimes bossy and stopped his drunken son from accidentally killing innocent people? He’s Walter’s brother and Brandon’s father but they very casually decide to just kill him - it makes no sense! Unless you want to make the argument that Walter’s using his psychic powers to influence them all, a la the Emperor using the Force to influence Anakin’s decisions (if that was the case).And, as if the Star Wars influence wasn’t already felt enough, one of the characters has a lightsaber - but of course it’s not called that, it’s a “power rod”!Then, just like that, we’re right back into, arguably Millar’s most famous storyline, Civil War, where the Marvel Universe was divided into those who were willing to unmask and register their identities with the government (led by Tony Stark) and those who weren’t (led by Captain America). This aspect is almost worse than the Star Wars prequel stuff because Millar actually wrote Civil War and he’s simply repeating himself with his own set of cheap superhero characters. It’s so lazy and derivative!As for the Man of Steel stuff, those are all spoilers so I’ll leave them out in this review, but the references couldn’t be more obvious and they come off just as dumb on the page as they did on the big screen.While I largely disliked Millar’s script, I’ll give him this: Chloe and Hutch’s escape sequence was very exciting and well done – though that was helped enormously by the artist’s contributions.Which brings me to the best part of Jupiter’s Legacy: Frank Quitely.Quitely is one of my all-time favourite comics artists. Most comics, I’ll look for the writer’s name on the cover - Quitely is one of the few artists whose books I’ll pick up regardless of who wrote it.I love the use of space in Quitely’s panels - not outer space but the room he gives his characters and their environment. There’s always a lot of room to breathe, they’re never over-cluttered - it’s almost zen in approach! The action is drawn superbly, the characters’ expressions are almost unnaturally real in how arresting they are, Walter’s psychic constructs were beautifully rendered in showing how they’re “built”, and I loved the futuristic designs of the totalitarian flying craft and the aliens.If I have one complaint about Quitely’s work on this comic, it’s the superheroes’ outfits. Utopian’s costume looks like pyjamas and nearly all the women dress like strippers. For reference, think of Emma Frost in New X-Men - that.Jupiter’s Legacy (who’s Jupiter?) is Millar’s best comic of the last couple years but that’s not saying much considering his output has been poor to abysmal (Kick Ass 3, Secret Service, MPH, Starlight). It’s worth checking out if you’re a fan of Quitely’s art and the story doesn’t bore all of the time, but it’s not a great comic either.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RH2EFLRXIRLWY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1632153106#wasThisHelpful","RH2EFLRXIRLWY","A3I8FT707XKQAJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3I8FT707XKQAJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Ten years ago, Brian Bendis wrote House of M, an X-Men storyline where mutants stopped being born and their numbers shrunk to a mere few thousand. The day that happened became known as M-Day. Then, a year or so later, a single mutant - the first since M-Day - was born: Hope. She became the target of Mr Sinister who wanted to vivisect her and Cable ended up saving her, taking her back to the future with him and raising her as his own daughter. That storyline was a subplot in X-Men: Messiah CompleX.So what does this have to do with Justin Jordan and Kyle Strahm’s Spread? Here’s their setup: humanity is on the ropes as something is killing them off. A baby holds our only salvation - a baby named Hope. No (that’s his name), a scavenger warrior, must protect Hope from harm as sinister forces hunt them. The two must somehow defeat what’s killing everything and save the world.If you replace “humanity” with “mutantkind”, you’ve basically got the same storyline as Messiah CompleX. Real original, Justin Jordan!Then again nothing is very original about Spread. It’s your basic end of the world scenario. Like in every post-apocalyptic story there are a few surviving humans huddled in makeshift camps, living a hardscrabble existence now that civilisation has been destroyed. Scavengers roam the blighted countryside with mohawks and outfits with spikes like in Mad Max. The monsters are big toothy red things that splosh around the land like the Dune Sandworms - even their designs are near identical to what was in the movie! When the monsters/things infect humans, the humans become zombies. A post-apocalyptic zombie landscape - as if the market’s not saturated enough with those kind of stories! There’s even a bad guy straight out of a generic manga: he looks like a model with long flowing hair and he’s straight up evil, vain, and handy with a sword. Oh and let’s not forget the evil preacher too!There isn’t much to say about the paper-thin story: No and Hope (“No Hope”, geddit, that’s the subtitle AND describes their mission! Oh boy the layers on this thing...) survive against the Spread monsters, the manga villain and the evil preacher, and that’s about it. Tedious hyper-violent action (is there any other kind in a Jordan comic?) takes up most of the superficial plot.It’s completely unengaging to see these non-characters go through the motions and yet again I found myself wondering how Justin Jordan wrote something so poor. I think he’s a one-trick pony - Luther Strode was good, but everything else? Really, really bad. (I suppose the Shadowman reboot was ok - a two-trick pony!)X-Men: Messiah CompleX wasn’t that great a book either but compared to Spread, it’s a bona fide masterpiece! This is a really unimaginative take on the post-apocalyptic genre that does nothing new and totally fails to entertain. The art is so-so but, once again, Justin Jordan’s script is a massive let down. Who knew post-apocalyptic monster madness could be so boring?","2.0 out of 5 stars","May 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2RHJRBCC1MUWX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1632152568#wasThisHelpful","R2RHJRBCC1MUWX","A3I8FT707XKQAJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3I8FT707XKQAJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Sheltered is about a group of survivalist nutters whose even nuttier children decide to murder them. This is what the kids did next!Try as they might, the troubled, paranoid kids of Safe Haven are unable to keep the outside world away from their increasingly anarchic enclave. In this final volume, the police discover what’s been happening in the remote compound and soon the FBI descend for a Waco-like standoff.One of the aspects I liked so much about the second volume was the potential direction the story could’ve gone. It was about a few non-crazy kids trying to make it out alive while the brainwashed maniacs with guns set out to hunt them down. The possibility (and certainty as it turns out) was always for a recreation of Waco but I was hoping Ed Brisson would take it in a less obvious direction.Unfortunately, obviousness prevails and we get an armed standoff, just like every other cult cornered by the government. The story plays out in the most predictable way once the police are made aware of the murders. Negotiators show up, more shooting, more armed police, more shooting, splosions, people die, the end. It’s not badly written, just weakly plotted. There are no surprises in the script and therefore no tension either which is unfortunate for the finale.About halfway through the book, as yet another scene that’s been done a hundred times before played out, I began thinking about how I’d want it to end. Once Brisson went down this road, the standoff between the US government and teenagers with assault rifles was the only one way this could end, but beyond that, how to go out with something more? I instantly knew how I wanted it to end but I didn’t think Brisson would do it – but, right there in the final panel, he did! Kudos, guys! (The clue is in the series subtitle)I like the limited series format and, while Sheltered isn’t an amazing book, I think it’s benefitted from the compactness of a 3 volume/15 issue run. It kept things fast-moving and exciting unlike a title like, say, Sweet Tooth, which went on about two volumes too many. Long form indie comics don’t need to be 10 volumes like Scalped, Transmetropolitan or Y: The Last Man, or even 7-9 volumes like The Invisibles or Preacher, and I’m glad to see the limited series format getting a new lease on life over at Image (the brilliant Alex + Ada is another three volume series).Sheltered disappointingly bows out in an acceptable but lacklustre way with an unimaginative third act – even that final page, as crazy as I thought it’d be, was predictable. It’s not a bad series to check out though keep your expectations low going in.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R182ISRASK8UDW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1632152681#wasThisHelpful","R182ISRASK8UDW","A3I8FT707XKQAJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3I8FT707XKQAJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Agent John Harrow works for a covert government organisation that makes sure secrets stay secret. And what better hiding place than in plain sight? Like the conspiracy theory of the moon landings: we did land on the moon in 1969 – but it wasn’t our first time there. Back in 1964 man landed on the moon for the first time only to discover something hostile living in what we once thought was an uninhabited rock. Today that… thing… has finally made it to Earth and it’s up to Harrow, along with his newest recruit Branch, to neutralise it and hush everything up again.I think Justin Jordan saw Men in Black and The X Files and said “me too!” because almost nothing about this series feels original in the slightest. For example, male and female government agents chasing aliens and conspiracies – sound familiar? Granted, unlike Fox Mulder, they know that aliens exist because they’re trying to stop that information from getting out to protect the world – which is what Men in Black is!Story-wise, it’s nothing most horror fans haven’t already seen before: evil thingy possesses people turning them into mindless puppets. Seeing the horror in the vintage Russian spacesuit reminded me of at least a dozen BPRD issues where the same thing has been done - better – by Mike Mignola and Scott Allie.I suppose there is some mild variation in Harrow’s mysterious past and generally Ariela Kristantina’s art is quite nice to look at, but it’s basically a very shallow storyline that’s been done a thousand times already. It’s disappointing, not least because this is coming from the writer of the excellent Luther Strode series at Image, but because the story starts so promisingly before descending into tedious generic schlock.Though I’m amazed at how consistently bad Boom’s catalogue is, I have to say kudos to Jordan/Kristantina – Deep State is going to be a TV series!

"In Superior Spider-Man, a dying Doc Ock successfully switched his mind with Peter Parker’s, putting Peter into his body and himself into Peter’s. While retaining some of his super-villain mindset, he nevertheless became an extremely effective Spider-Man – the Superior Spider-Man. Some Spidey fans objected to the radical change but most readers enjoyed it, secure in the knowledge that Peter would inevitably return and the dull status quo reinstated (which it was). Superior Spider-Man, critically and commercially, was a resounding success.Which brings us to Superior Iron Man, which is not. Marvel are using the goodwill and integrity of the “Superior” label to draw readers into this far crappier title – “Superior” apparently meaning “superhero gone temporarily bad”.Spinning out of the Axis Marvel Event, Tony Stark’s personality has been warped so he’s no longer the good guy. What does that mean? It means he’s a selfish, arrogant prick who enjoys his booze and women. Um – how is that different from old Tony? Well, this new Tony has a Starlight Express Iron Man armor and he’s all about the Benjamins (and I suppose he was sober before).This is the pitiful and baffling setup to Superior Iron Man: Tony’s developed Extremis 3.0, an app that somehow turns you into a supermodel version of you – for a limited time. Because if you don’t renew your subscription daily for a hundred bucks, you go back to regular old you. It’s not quite as extreme as Spider-Man executing his foes in public or building a robot army and demolishing enemy strongholds, is it? (That said, writer Tom Taylor does use the city-wide surveillance network of drones idea from Superior Spider-Man for his story.)Seriously, money? That’s what Tony Stark’s interested in – the richest dude in the Marvel Universe? What could he possibly need money for that he can’t already acquire? And why is every single opening Iron Man story in a series about Extremis!? If you’re wondering how on earth an APP you click on your phone could possibly transform you physically, a half-assed explanation appears towards the end of the book that’s totally unsatisfactory.Other non-highlights include Daredevil (the story is set in San Francisco, Daredevil’s current residence) getting repeatedly beaten because he’s written out of character, while a terrible new character, Teen Abomination, has his name mocked numerous times because isn’t it hilarious how lame his name is?! Let’s make fun of it constantly because the readers are laughing hysterically every time we do!I can’t say I’m a fan of Yildiray Cinar’s art either. Not only does Tony’s new base actually look like an upside down toilet, but the way he draws ordinary people vs their “extremis” selves is barely distinguishable. And why would a perfectly fine-looking teenager need Extremis 3.0 – surely the appeal to look younger and trimmer would be aimed at the older crowd rather than those who already look that way?Tom Taylor seems to be the go-to guy for “superheroes gone bad” storylines, like his DC titles Injustice: Gods Among Us and Earth 2. His Superior Iron Man though is utterly lame. “I’m gonna make money from a sinister app, bwahahaha!” isn’t exactly as heinous as Superman murdering a pregnant Lois and deciding to take over the world!Bad writing and plotting, uninteresting story, mediocre art - Tom Taylor’s Iron Man series is anything but superior.","2.0 out of 5 stars","May 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R374VLZ9ILB4LM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=184653657X#wasThisHelpful","R374VLZ9ILB4LM","A3I8FT707XKQAJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3I8FT707XKQAJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Aw, man – double disappointment! Not only is this the end of Charles Soule and Javier Pulido’s She-Hulk but the second volume also falls short of the first!An elderly Steve Rogers (not sure what’s going on there but as long as Rick Remender’s still writing Cap, I won’t be reading his comics to find out!) approaches Jen to represent him in a wrongful death case dating back to 1940, before he became Captain America. The court case is set in California, and what other Marvel superhero lawyer is currently out west? It’s Jen vs Matt Murdock/Daredevil!Elsewhere, Jen and Patsy Walker/Hellcat team up with Hank Pym/Ant-Man for a miniature adventure in someone’s garden; Jen’s nemesis Titania shows up for a throw-down; and the secret behind the blue notebook is revealed…What I liked about the first book was that it mixed Jen’s lawyerly and superhero sides together in a perfectly balanced way so you got a bit of both in each issue. This second book distinctly splits the two in half with three issues for a court drama and three issues for superhero shenanigans. And it turns out that too much of the lawyerly half without the superhero side makes those sequences especially cumbersome to get through.It doesn’t help that the wrongful death case against Cap isn’t in the least bit interesting and draaaaaaaaags for half the book, but seeing Jen and Matt talk and talk and talk through legal technicalities… wow, it’s super boring!I know it’s going to make me sound like a shallow comics reader, but I much preferred the superhero action bits to the extensive law-speak chapters - they’re just more fun and more imaginative which is why I read Marvel in the first place.Jen and Patsy fight bugs and cats as they’re shrunk to a tiny size – BAM! Titania and Jen trade punches across the east coast - BIFF! Another villain reveals their identity in the final chapter - POW! It helps that Javier Pulido’s art makes the action look so good aided by Muntsa Vicente’s real purty colours.Then we get to the ending which is unfortunately very anti-climactic. I know my way around most of the Marvel Universe but going into a character like She-Hulk’s past and dredging up someone from way back when? You’ve completely lost me. Worse is that that whole plotline was so muted up til then that it felt like there was no build up to it at all, even though it’s been explored here and there between stories. I didn’t feel like it was a great payoff, ending the series on a whimper rather than a bang, which isn’t how the title has been for the most part.I did like that Soule’s contribution to Jen’s world - the superhero offices run by a former mutant - is lasting outside of this series with a cameo from Howard the Duck at the end confirming this is where he’s going to based. And there’s a hint that, though the series is over, we might see Jen pop up in Soule’s Inhuman series as their lawyer. I’m also delighted that Jen’s going to be written by G Willow Wilson (current writer on Ms Marvel) in a new ongoing, all-female superhero team, A-Force (love everything about it except that terrible name!), and Soule’s going to be the new Daredevil writer, bringing his knowledge and experience of the courts to another Marvel superhero lawyer.While Soule’s script is patchy but good in places, Javier Pulido’s art, Muntsa Vicente’s colours, and Kevin Wada’s covers couldn’t be more superb. And though it’s a shame to see Jen go, I’m sure we’ll get another solo Shulkie series soon. It’s just a shame she didn’t go out in as great a book as her first with Soule/Pulido.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3DEZG18FKLQ0V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0785190201#wasThisHelpful","R3DEZG18FKLQ0V","A3I8FT707XKQAJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3I8FT707XKQAJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Eric Powell’s back with his first long-form story in quite some time with Occasion of Revenge. The Zombie Priest’s former coven of witches and sorcerers have decided that Lonely St is to be their new home - but not if The Goon can help it! We also see the tragic tale of Fred Paulsey and Sandy Wayne, the origin of Willie Nagel (the daisy-hatted zombie geetar playa), and the terrifying new villain, Longfingers. Oh, and Revenge S*** Giuseppe who… well, you can guess what the crack is with him!I really, really want to say Occasion of Revenge was an amazing, awesome, totally killer read because I think Eric Powell is an incredible comics creator and I do usually genuinely enjoy Goon books (and here’s the BUT) BUT… no, not this time unfortunately.Powell’s adopted the structure of most of Mike Mignola’s comics where storylines are numbered in parts rather than the actual numbering of the comics. So Occasion of Revenge #1 is actually The Goon #46, and so on, but Dark Horse want more readers jumping on and it helps sometimes if you scale back the numbering rather than intimidate the reader with big numbers. That said, I was expecting this 4 part story to be self-contained and it wasn’t so I really don’t know what’s going on with the numbering!Fred Paulsey and Sandy Wayne’s story was too miserable to really enjoy and it went nowhere, ending in some bizarre, open-ended fashion that was unsatisfying. Longfingers and the rest of the evil coven remain at large, having spent the book popping up now and then to battle Goon and his men. There was also this weak romance story between Goon and Some Lady which you knew wasn’t going to end well and, of course, didn’t.Instead this book was mostly about a bastard getting even with his step-brother for the way their dad treated his mum. It read like a watered down version of a Sin City story only it wasn’t dark enough without enough bite.The story I really liked was Willie Nagel’s origin which is sad like every other story here, but was an engaging aside. Revenge S*** Giuseppe was another mad character who gets thrown in now and then for comic relief but it’s a momentary respite of silliness before plunging back into the despair.Powell’s art continues to be truly impressive switching from a variety of styles that also intelligently utilises space to tell the various tales. If Powell’s writing sometimes fluctuates across the many Goon books, the one constant is his far-ranging and wonderful illustration skills that make his comics stand out.Unfortunately though the many stories that make up Occasion of Revenge don’t add up to much. It reads more like an extended prologue than its own story with several odds and ends thrown in for padding. That’s not to say it’s an unenjoyable read, it’s just not of the same calibre as some of Powell’s better Goon books. Of course I’m coming back for the next arc though I’m hoping the story is a bit tighter.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3AGYNPQN3ZN0E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1616555963#wasThisHelpful","R3AGYNPQN3ZN0E","A3I8FT707XKQAJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3I8FT707XKQAJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I guess DC were aiming for the Fifty Shades crowd with the subtitle: “Discipline and Punish”? The only thing masochistic about Suicide Squad is that I keep reading the series even though it’s never been good, including this one!Ales Kot has (briefly) taken over from Adam Glass and the series has become slightly more fun as a result - that fun manifesting as “wacky captions”! But that’s it. Otherwise this is still overly-angsty moronic bees in a jar being shook up.There’s a couple of changes to the lineup which now looks like this: Deadshot, Harley Quinn, Voltaic, Unknown Soldier, King Shark, Cheetah, James Gordon Jr and Amanda Waller. I missed Vol 3 so I’m not sure when the new guys showed up or why (Unknown Soldier, really?). There doesn’t seem to be a real reason for James Jr. to be here besides people liked him in Scott Snyder’s Batman stories.They idiots fight each other, fight some giant dead monster in Las Vegas, and fight some superhero stand-ins (nobody major) in what looks like an African country literally described as “Some Country Far Away” (that’s the level of care we’re dealing with). They also have those neck bomb implants taken out so there’s no real reason to still be on the Squad… but that’s an angle that’s glossed over.The characters are barely different from one another - they’re all mean and violent and that’s it. Except for Harley who’s still got the spotlight and Deadshot who’s only singled out because he and Harley are fuckbuddies. Nothing to ‘em. The same could be said for the “stories”. Kot spends no time setting up anything, he just throws the Squad at some “threat” and expects the reader to be immediately caught up and engaged with what’s going on. That’s not how it works. If you build up a storyline, explaining what they’re aiming for and why, taking that time makes it meaningful to read; having bland “characters” fight even blander “villains” is totally uninteresting.I really liked Patrick Zircher’s art though, he’s an artist who needs to be doing more high profile stuff. His work on XO Manowar was great and that experience translates well to the action-heavy Suicide Squad. Shame he only draws half the book.This slim volume rounds out with two Villain’s Month issues: Harley Quinn and Deadshot, both written by Matt “Just Earning a Paycheck” Kindt. Blech, is all I can say. Bad origin stories (find out how Harley got an outfit! Deadshot becomes a bullet because his parents wuz killed by bullets!) are the worst and Kindt’s hacky scripts are always a slog to get through. Villain’s Month was such a pointless gimmick.The subtitle was half right - this is punishment.","2.0 out of 5 stars","May 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/REKVX7CVX7JCD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1401247016#wasThisHelpful","REKVX7CVX7JCD","A3I8FT707XKQAJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3I8FT707XKQAJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Captain Marvel gets a new number one volume. Why? Because she’s now in spaaaaaaaace!Carol will team up with four nobodies to form the poor man’s Guardians of the Galaxy - with a cameo from the actual Guardians of the Galaxy in a desperate attempt to leech off of their popularity! Carol will help an alien get back to her alien people and find them a home on some alien world - but not before some baddie aliens try to kill them! You won’t believe how disinterested you’ll be in this super-bland comic!I didn’t think Kelly Sue DeConnick’s Captain Marvel could get worse but she found a way to do it and it was to send her into a mega-crap Star Wars prequel knockoff storyline. DeConnick is so unfunny and lame she literally has Carol say the line “These are not the droids you’re looking for” - HAHAHA that was funny, what, 30 years ago? Maybe never? And it’s been done to death since.Arguably the worst parts of the Star Wars prequels were the tedious scenes where the galactic senate debated trade talks, diplomatic sanctions and more crap you couldn’t believe you were seeing in a Star Wars movie. Good news if you loved that because there’s a ton of that in this book! More one-dimensional alien characters debate alien laws you couldn’t care less about while Captain Marvel hangs about as uselessly as a Hollywood celebrity acting as a UN Ambassador. Even the bad guy - King J’Son of Spartax, Star-Lord’s pop - appears as a hologram like the Emperor and her cat’s called Chewie!The story is the most shallow and forgettable one imaginable. I’m still at a loss as to why Captain Marvel could be considered an interesting character because DeConnick is utterly unable to write her that way. Her dialogue is cliched and flat and you better believe that if she can’t make the main character seem compelling, she can’t make any of the supporting cast either. David Lopez’s art is fine but nothing special and wholly unremarkable. This volume is a total bust and even with a new number one, Captain Marvel remains one of the lowest selling titles on the roster.Rather than reboot the series by sending Carol arbitrarily into space, they need to replace the writer. DeConnick’s tried for, what, 4 years now? She’s failed. Get someone else in, Marvel.","1.0 out of 5 stars","March 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2QV3YXLETU4NN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NAHL15I#wasThisHelpful","R2QV3YXLETU4NN","A3I8FT707XKQAJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3I8FT707XKQAJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"X-Men comics fans like to talk about how underserved Cyclops is in the movies. He’s basically written as the bland good guy foil to Wolverine’s bad boy rebel in their rubbish love triangle with Jean. But in the comics? He’s a badass! And I’ll give them that, he is a much more interesting character in the comics. So ok, a solo title might be fun.Except there are currently two Cyclopses (what is the correct plural of Cyclops - Cyclopi?) in the Marvel Universe. One is currently a fugitive wanted for the murder of Charles Xavier and leading the Mutant Underground. The other is awkward teenage Scott from the past, irresponsibly brought to the present by Hank McCoy for reasons even he’s not sure about anymore because they barely made sense to begin with (thanks, Bendis!). He fancies teenage Jean and that’s about it. This book is about the latter. Right again, Marvel!At the end of The Trial of Jean Grey, teenage Scott met his dad, Corsair, the space-pirate leader of the not at all porn-sounding group the Starjammers. He decided to spend time with his pop in space and this is where the series begins.Part of me wanted to give this a chance because it’s a book that might have resonance with younger readers: teenager getting to know his estranged father and his stepmom; there could be some heart here. But another part of me said, look at the writer - has Greg Rucka ever written anything good? And moreover this is a spinoff of Bendis’ plotless X-Men series - will there be a story here at all?And, unfortunately, this proved to be as lacking as the Bendis X-Men comics. I won’t even go into how idiotic that teenage Scott still being in the present is, but instead focus on the total absence of story. Because unless you already love young Cyclops and Corsair and are satisfied with just reading about the two of them getting to know one another, you’re going to be horribly bored with this comic. They learn about each others’ lives, go hunting, get stranded, get rescued, and fight some aliens, winning easily because of course they would. In other words, nothing happens.This isn’t much of a spoiler given that this is a new, disposable character nobody will know, but the book ends “triumphantly” with the impending death of a young girl courtesy of father and son. And amazingly there’s going to be a Volume 2 (though Rucka is out, replaced by John Layman)!The only positive I’ll give it is that Russell Dauterman (artist on Jason Aaron’s female Thor series) and Carmen Carnero’s art looks terrific. Otherwise, Rucka’s script, continuing Bendis’ aimless approach to Marvel’s mutant characters, is thoroughly tedious to read. Cyclops is a cool character in the comics except Marvel have managed to make another, younger version of Cyclops to co-exist alongside him who’s as one-note as James Marsden’s. Golf clap...","1.0 out of 5 stars","March 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2PNI6L1S5F584/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0785190759#wasThisHelpful","R2PNI6L1S5F584","A3I8FT707XKQAJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3I8FT707XKQAJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Abbey Road was The Beatles’ last record and arguably their best. After recording a patchy album in Let It Be, the Fab Four joined producer George Martin at Abbey Road for the final time together and went out superbly with some of their best music ever (though Let It Be would be released after Abbey Road because of Phil Spector’s elaborate, time-consuming production).I didn’t realise I Want You (She’s So Heavy), the sixth track on the record, was the last Beatles recording as a group (it was originally planned to close the album - in the end it only closed out Side 1) and I expected James Woodall’s account of singling out this song to be a bit more meaningful and illuminating than it was. As it is, Woodall uses the song as a jumping off point to discuss The Beatles’ last year together and John and Yoko’s relationship, none of which is especially new or unique ground to cover.If you already know a bit about The Beatles last years, there’s not a whole lot here that’ll be new to you. John and Yoko did heroin a lot, produced a lot of crap avant-garde art including unlistenable music, posed naked on an album cover, stayed in bed protesting the Vietnam war. Meanwhile their company Apple was a mess financially and there were squabbles over who their management was (it was five years post-break-up before all of the legalities were resolved).As for the recording of Abbey Road, there’s not a whole lot to it. It seemed to go more or less smoothly, a lot better than the Let It Be sessions, and everyone was producing good work, hard drugs and crazy partners aside. What’s there to say about the song itself, I Want You? It’s about Yoko, it’s a bit avant-garde (all that hiss and distortion that makes up the second half of the song), and possibly indicates the bold and exciting music The Beatles would have made had they stayed together and continued to make music. Possibly.Woodall’s writing is competent for the most part but his sentences are sometimes quite clumsily constructed. For example:“While no one in the wider world knew what, apart from recording and releasing records - with the green-skin outside of a Granny Smith apple on the A-side, its sliced white interior on the B-side - The Beatles were really doing (starting to fight), they, the band, knew intuitively how much real music they could still make.”The Story of The Beatles’ Last Song doesn’t contain a whole lot that’s original or insightful for those who already know about The Beatles’ breakup. But, for the more casual fan, it’s a sometimes compelling piece about the greatest band’s last gasp put to tape. Helluva haunting riff too!","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQA6RVR4YNDA1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00R1E8T8S#wasThisHelpful","RQA6RVR4YNDA1","A3I8FT707XKQAJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3I8FT707XKQAJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It’s been a couple years since I read the first crummy volume of Jonathan Hickman’s Avengers and I think I’m just about ready to face the second. Maybe I was wrong and Hickman needed some time to get going, maybe his writing got better, maybe I’d find a new appreciation for his Marvel stuff now, maybe… not. The Last White Event (which sounds like something the Klan would attend) is yet another poor Avengers book to add to the pile of crap Avengers books Marvel has, and continues to, put out.From my understanding of this odd tale: Earth is evolving into a new phase and is somehow becoming sentient - this process being called a White Event - and something called a Starbrand - a being with the power equal to the power behind the White Event but with the aim of potentially destroying the planet rather than cause it to evolve - is formed. There is a Nightmask - the dude with the glowing tattoos - who was born 47 days ago (he’s an adult by the way) to shepherd the Starbrand into fulfilling the White Event. Or something.This volume introduces us to the Starbrand, a nerdy university student who doesn’t realise he has the power (of Greyskull) to destroy the world, who fights the Avengers - they’ve got to have something to do in their own book!I could sort of follow along with Hickman’s ambitious if convoluted story and, now that Secret Wars (the final chapter in his Avengers run) is almost upon us, I can see this volume is a building block in the overall story - I just don’t care. White Events, Starbrands, sentient planets - I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again: Hickman is a great ideas man but he’s a lousy writer. His Starbrand character really doesn’t seem interesting at all, despite all the importance suddenly heaped upon him. And all this talk of other new things, White Events and so on - meh. I can too easily take it or leave it.Rounding out this underwhelming volume are two issues, the first of which might well be the most forgettable superhero comic I’ve ever read. It’s about a father and daughter sharing a secret about some person somewhere who does something - again the Avengers are background characters in their own comic - and then it’s over. No idea what was accomplished or why.The other issue has the Avengers trying to do an Ocean’s 11 and failing. They try to pull of a heist in a casino where a black market auction is taking place, except all the baddies, mostly AIM personnel, know who they are despite trying to keep a low profile. They play casino games and win some, lose some, then fly away at the end. While not as bad as the last issue, it certainly feels as throwaway.On the one hand I think Hickman’s big, cosmic ideas are well suited to the Avengers title. They should face massive threats and be challenged. Dustin Weaver and Mike Deodato’s delightfully cinematic art backs up this approach. It’s just Hickman’s limited writing ability that gets in the way of realising that in a compelling comic. He’s all surface texture, like those symbols representing the characters at the start of each issue (what, I’m not going to read it if my favourite character’s not in it?) - style without substance yet again and the effect is like reading an outline rather than a finished comic.The Last White Event is like a game of sci-fi D&D where the Dungeon Master is intoning an incredibly boring story except you have no choices - you just have to sit there and listen to him drone on without any control over what to do next. If that sounds appealing, Hickman’s Avengers might be for you. Me, I think it’ll be at least another two years before I attempt Volume 3!","2.0 out of 5 stars","March 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2337MQ4E3YF14/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DP1E2HS#wasThisHelpful","R2337MQ4E3YF14","A3I8FT707XKQAJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3I8FT707XKQAJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"From The Brothers Grimm to Disney, fairy tales have been sanitised to appeal to all ages - family-friendly entertainment! - except, as most people know, they had very dark origins. Stories like Beauty and the Beast and Rapunzel featured “grown up” themes even though fairy tales, until the 19th century, were consumed mainly by adults.Beautiful Darkness is writer Fabien Vehlmann and artist Kerascoet’s subversive take on the well-defined genre as little people living inside a young girl escape when she dies and try to survive in the woods. But life in an increasingly harsh environment overwhelms any fairy tale niceties and the unpleasant side of human nature - prejudice, lies, and taking advantage of innocence - takes over their charming society.Kerascoet’s watercolours and childish/cartoony art style is perfect for Vehlmann’s increasingly dark tale. It starts off making you think this is some fluffy kid’s book and then before the title page we see the corpse of a little girl - and THAT’S where our characters have been living?! There’s also something sinister about seeing the many horrible things the characters go through via the prism of this cutesy art.A character, hungry, sneaks into a bird’s nest thinking the mother bird will believe she’s one of hers. The bird does and sticks her beak way down into the character’s throat but it’s too big and the character’s insides are punctured, blood welling in her throat until she dies. Later another character is carried off by some ants and gets buried alive. A deformed character, who’s also a transvestite, is killed for being different. One character is eaten by a larger one. And all the while the art looks perfectly sweet and suitable for kids - but the story isn’t!Kerascoet’s art really is gorgeous. The sunset landscape page is stunning and when he draws humans, it looks almost photographic it’s so real. The colours too are very vivid and the comic as a whole looks very impressive.While this book’s not badly written, I did wonder what the point of it was. A Tom Thumb/Borrowers-style story but messed up - ok, and? It also gets predictable once you notice the characters’ world falling apart and pretty one-note too. By the end, I wasn’t sure what I was supposed to take away from it - people can be dicks to one another, fairy tales can be edgy? I’m not sure. If it was just to entertain, it only half accomplished that.Beautiful Darkness is an ok comic but definitely not the best work from either creator. Vehlmann’s best remains the brilliant and underrated Green Manor series, and his 7 Psychopaths book with Sean Phillips (of Criminal/Fatale/Incognito/Sleeper fame) is worth checking out too. Kerascoet’s best remains the Miss Don’t Touch Me books.Beautiful Darkness is a pretty book with some interesting scenes but the post-modern fairy tale has been done to death at this point and this comic doesn’t have anything new to add.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2L12WS9URA6UY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1770461299#wasThisHelpful","R2L12WS9URA6UY","A3I8FT707XKQAJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3I8FT707XKQAJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Like Mark Waid’s other Marvel series, Daredevil, Hulk gets a reboot as adjective-less Hulk for no particular reason. At least in Daredevil it was because Matt moved to the West Coast. Here? No clue, I didn’t read Indestructible Hulk Volume 4 so not sure what happened there. They told him his armour was crap so he took it off and Marvel said “new #1 time!”? From what I can tell anyway, that’s the only change from that series and this.So someone’s shot Bruce Banner in the head for some reason. Bruce might no longer be the brainy opposite of Hulk as his injury has reduced him to a simpleton, much like Hulk minus the strength! And here comes Abomination for the umpteenth time! Hulk (yawn) smash…Considering he walks in the same circles as geniuses like Tony Stark and Reed Richards, reversing brain damage shouldn’t sound as impossible as it does in the real world - and, in the Marvel Universe, it isn’t! Tension: gone! But as Maria Hill tells him, if Banner keeps turning into the Hulk while he, Banner, is still recovering from his head injury, he won’t heal properly, like broken bones not set correctly. He can’t Hulk out and fight Abomination - he could get permanent brain damage and wind up a vegetable! Wasn’t this a plot from one of the Rocky movies?The subtitle - Banner DOA - is just stupid because at no point is Banner dead, and the question posed on the cover - Who Shot Bruce Banner? - is barely explored. We are left unsatisfied as the motives for the shadowy organisation behind the shooting are never revealed, nor are they recognisable as characters when we do see them.And why would they want to create an Abomination anyway? It seemed like they wanted to harvest Banner’s DNA to create their own Hulks/Abominations, but they already had that - so why were they still chasing Banner? Because they wanted to see yet another fight between Hulk and an Abomination? Like Tony Stark and Extremis, Abomination gets used way too much in Hulk stories.There’s little substance to this volume as it seems to be a lame excuse for another lengthy Hulk/Abomination battle with some Avengers tossed in and little else. The whole Banner-as-simpleton storyline is presented and wrapped up in a couple of issues. The measly four-issue length underlines the disposable nature of the book (most Marvel trade paperbacks are five or six issues long). Waid’s Hulk, reboot or otherwise, remains unimpressive and increasingly tired and stale - no wonder he left the title after this!","2.0 out of 5 stars","March 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RSTYCVPQBEG3I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NEW45WA#wasThisHelpful","RSTYCVPQBEG3I","A3I8FT707XKQAJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3I8FT707XKQAJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Stray Bullets, Volume 4: Dark Days lives up its title. Wow. This is an extremely dark, twisted story of two children who’re abducted by a madman, held captive for a few weeks, raped and tortured, and finally escape. On the face of it, that kind of story would make me hesitate to pick it up, but David Lapham’s Stray Bullets has been so incredibly good, I knew he would not only present this in a tasteful way but also in a gripping narrative – which he does on both counts!The kids (who most certainly are not alright) are Amy and Bobby. There’s a whole backstory to this pair that regular readers of the series will know – Amy’s alter ego is Amy Racecar who stars in her own fantastical side stories written by Amy and drawn by Bobby as comics that appear in the books – who met in the last volume, Other People, after Amy decided school wasn’t for her and hid out in Bobby’s parents’ basement.But, like all of the Stray Bullets books, you can pick up any volume, read it as a standalone story, and still completely understand what’s happening. It’s just that fans who’ve been following since the start will see recurring characters develop richly as their backgrounds become more textured with their experiences. It’s a little extra flavour to know what’s gone before and seeing what happens next and I think if you read this first, you’re definitely going to want to go back and read the others too.Amy meeting Ron (the abductor/paedo-psycho), Amy and Bobby getting taken, their horrific stay in Ron’s home in the Hollywood hills, their eventual escape, and the other stories surrounding it, are told with enormous skill and imagination by Lapham. His approach is to tell the scenes out of chronological sequence and from the perspectives of different characters which is ingenious – we get Amy’s perspective up until Ron tells her and Bobby they can’t leave, then, to keep up the tension, we switch to Amy’s pretend sister Beth, who’s drinking herself stupid because she’s worried for Amy. Beth enlists the help of mob enforcer Monster, who has his own designs on Amy, then we get the first-hand experience of Amy and Bobby’s ordeal in Ron’s house via Roger, the cop we met in the last book who’s also connected to Beth in this book when...I’ll stop there because it’s too insanely, perfectly intertwined a story and I don’t want to spoil the reading experience. But know that Lapham is at the top of his game with Stray Bullets – you know exactly what you need to, at the right time, in the most memorable way. This is his masterpiece and it’s breathtaking to see a comic like this when its creator is telling a story this compelling and doing so in wonderfully creative and inspired ways. Black and white, eight panel grid pages: the most basic approach to comics and look at the quality of work!I read Dark Days in one go without blinking (alright, that’s not true but it was a riveting book) and I’m stunned once again to see how few people have actually read Stray Bullets. This series deserves to be as widely-read as Frank Miller’s Sin City, another title by a creator who was firing on all cylinders when he was making it. There’s an energy below the surface of this book that builds in such a powerful way, you can’t stop reading until it’s carried you all the way to the end.No part of the book feels weak, unnecessary, or boring - it’s as lean as it needs to be and as sleek a story as possible. Even though the Amy/Bobby/Ron storyline is the core, the other stories, from Spanish Scott and his disturbed nephew Joey’s unfortunate day out, to another strange but brilliant Amy Racecar strip, and Beth’s continued, totally unpredictable arc from drunk to saviour to something else entirely - all of it is an absolute treat to read. In the same way that the Marvel/DC Universes are populated with recurring characters, so too is the Stray Bullets Universe, and it’s just as exciting to see a familiar face pop up out of nowhere even without a costume or superpowers.The subject matter is grim but its telling is exuberant. Light or dark, tone doesn’t matter so long as a story is told well, and Dark Days is definitely that. It’s another first class addition to the truly remarkable Stray Bullets series. Somehow it keeps getting better. Bravo, David Lapham!","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2KVK95PPQV4IF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0972714553#wasThisHelpful","R2KVK95PPQV4IF","A3I8FT707XKQAJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3I8FT707XKQAJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Dark Knight series has been Gregg Hurwitz’s vehicle for showcasing Batman’s rogues gallery from Scarecrow to The Mad Hatter with varying results - the Scarecrow book, Cycle of Violence, was silly but The Mad Hatter book was unexpectedly brilliant. This fourth volume focuses on Clayface aka Basil Karlo, though unfortunately it’s not very good.If you’ve read one Clayface story, you’ve read them all. He used to be an actor, now he’s a poo monster cosplayer who shape-shifts and robs jewellery stores. Usually in these stories there’s a familiar character like Gordon or Alfred acting strangely before it’s revealed – shock poo! – it’s actually Clayface! Same story structure here.He’s just not that great a character and his origin is even less interesting. LIke every other kid, he wanted to be thought of as cool, he wanted the ladies, and he thought acting was a shortcut to fame and fortune. None of that happens until he snorts magic clay that the Penguin got from Contrived Plot Device Land, and suddenly he’s able to look uncannily like the character he’s portraying.Because that’s what real acting is right? Not bringing the lines to life with your delivery or presence or talent - no, real acting is wearing convincing makeup! Basil goes from being a mediocre actor to a great one just because he is able to look the part. So why do crap actors remain crap with the aid of makeup, costumes, prosthetics and even CGI? Take note, wannabe actors: get really good makeup and you will somehow become the next Daniel Day-Lewis! Clayface’s origin suuuuuucks!And one weird detail stuck out about the end of the Clayface story: (view spoiler)The two-part silent story, Voiceless, about an immigrant mother and daughter who come to Gotham hoping for a better life and encounter hardship and abuse, was the best of the three stories. Alberto Ponticelli’s art brilliantly carries the tale so that the reader knows exactly what’s happening at all times even without dialogue or narration.The book closes with the worst of the three, a Manbat story. Like Clayface stories, all Manbat stories are the same: turn the manbat back into human form and then lock whoever, usually Kirk, up until it happens again, exactly the same way, next time, again and again and again. This time it stars Kirk Langstrom’s corporate raider father, Abraham, who decides to transform into a manbat for giggles.Hurwitz not at all subtly tells a rich preying on the poor story as this Ayn Randian character literally sucks the blood of the homeless. The 1% are bad, see, they’re preying on the poor of society! Yeesh. But Batman saves the day and Bruce Wayne is definitely in the top 1% himself so, mixed messages Hurwitz!I sort of liked Voiceless even though I’ve read Batman stories like it before but mostly I felt Hurwitz’s scripts to be very sub-par in this volume. The artists carry the book. Alex Maleev’s work is wonderful, I love his inky clear Gotham, Ponticelli’s art is great too, and Ethan van Sciver does what he always does, which is to say fine but nothing special art.The Dark Knight, Volume 4: Clay is a very unimpressive and boring Batman book about two of his worst villains.","2.0 out of 5 stars","March 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RHNU5NHYN7BGA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00M0YAA1S#wasThisHelpful","RHNU5NHYN7BGA","A3I8FT707XKQAJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3I8FT707XKQAJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Daniel’s parents, Chris and Tilde, have retired to a farm in the Swedish countryside. All is going well, he thinks, and the only problem is how he’s going to reveal to them that he’s gay. That is until he receives a strange email from his mother and then a phone call from his father - Tilde is insane, says Chris, and she needs help. Meanwhile Tilde, arriving in London alone to meet Daniel, insists that she’s being hunted by a group of murderers, including Chris, after she uncovered a horrific conspiracy. Daniel has only hours to decide: who’s telling the truth?That setup is a bit misleading - it makes you think that there are two sides to this story when it’s basically all Tilde. With all the comparisons other reviewers have made to Gone Girl I was expecting a half and half approach, with Chris and Tilde telling their stories to Daniel. Instead Chris is more of a background character and The Farm is mostly Tilde’s tale. That’s not to say that’s bad in any way at all, it’s just a warning for what to expect going in.I flew through The Farm at a pace I rarely set with novels these days. Tilde’s increasingly dark tale is so beguiling and the atmosphere conjured up is so menacing and paranoid, you find yourself putting off things you should be doing so you can read 10 more pages… and then 10 more… and then you realise you’ve read a third of the book in one sitting, your eyes are tired but you so want to keep going, you have to see what happens next! In other words, the best kind of story any fiction fan would want to read.The supporting cast are wonderfully intimidating. At the head of it all is the farmer Hakan, a giant of a man who controls the small community under him including the sleazy mayor and the celebrity “doctor” who uses his power to have Tilde committed. Tilde takes Daniel (and us) through the beautiful Swedish landscape where terrible things happen - young girls go missing, trolls lurk in the shadows, convoys of cars travel through the night, and hidden, locked doors hold forgotten secrets deep within.Because the story is so one-sided, there were only really a few ways the story could’ve ended but, without giving anything away, I’ll say that the finale is a bit unsatisfying. Tilde’s story leading up to the final act was so breathless and exciting. The ending is a let down because it’s not as dramatic, though it does explain everything in a level-headed way. It’s like in some mystery stories where the focus is so intense on this one villainous character that it’s like it couldn’t be them in the end because that’d be too obvious, so the reveal of the baddie is instead some character who’s barely in the story - that kind of resolution is ok but not great.Aside from the weak third act, The Farm is a really fun, really engrossing read that I highly recommend. There’s some interesting themes explored like the power of storytelling and families and secrets but mostly it’s a terrific thriller that does exactly that.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1JFHBU0OQ9I2D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009R6FO2M#wasThisHelpful","R1JFHBU0OQ9I2D","A3I8FT707XKQAJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3I8FT707XKQAJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Like a cheating partner, the Parliament of Trees has to choose who it wants to be Avatar of the Green: Swampy or the usurper Seeder. As the two train for their title match, we explore the mysterious world of the Green and the host of colourful new characters who inhabit it. It’s kinda like a grown up Fern Gully!Swamp Thing’s a tough cookie to get right, eh? Charles Soule comes close but I’m still not completely in love with his run on the character. You can split this book right down the middle into two halves, one which I liked and one which I didn’t. I really liked Soule’s expansion of Swampy’s world. The history of the Swamp Things goes back millennia so we see the very first prehistoric jellyfish-like Swamp Thing to a giant dinosaur Avatar and a caveman Swamp Thing who bears an uncanny resemblance to Alan Moore!In particular the Green itself is portrayed as an enchanting fantasyland. There’s The Wolf, the greatest Avatar before Alec Holland, is an 18th century nobleman who travels about on an enormous flower petal, and Lady Weeds, a vicious and cynical fighter who lives in a cave and teaches Swampy to use his powers to their full potential.Kano and Jesus Saiz’s gorgeous art flesh out Soule’s ideas to create this rich, whimsical world where I really hope more future stories take place. The Swamp Thing designs – really all the character designs - are absolutely brilliant and the horror element is maintained with the way flesh and foliage merge together into something visually unusual and disturbing.Then there’s the second half which is just empty fighting. Swampy and Seeder throw branches, spit seeds, ‘splode one another, regenerate, do it again. Is there anything more tedious than watching two people who can’t be killed fight? For all the imaginative training Swampy undergoes with his floral Yoda, Lady Weeds, his final fight with Seeder is so boring – “I’m gonna punch you hard” “Yeah? I’m gonna punch you harder!”, etc. (not actual dialogue but it captures the essence).Much like Red Lanterns Volume 5, Soule rushes the hell out of the ending, wrapping everything up in six pages. It literally goes from doom and the end of the world to Swampy saving the day and defeating everyone – in six pages!! Also, Seeder has never been an interesting character to me and the backstory he recounts is so played out and generic. Maybe if you’re a fan of the Alan Moore run you might enjoy it more as he’s from those comics, but even so I thought he’s only ever been an average baddie.The Killing Field isn’t a bad book, it’s just disappointing that for all the thought and imagination put into its build-up, it’s all in service to that most mundane of superhero stories: hero fighting villain. It’s an unsatisfying payoff. But I love the world-building Soule imbues into the series and hope it’s not discarded or forgotten after the forthcoming Convergence whirlwind. Like the last volume, Soule’s Swamp Thing continues to be pretty decent but not by any means amazing.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3JVILYWULNLKG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1401250521#wasThisHelpful","R3JVILYWULNLKG","A3I8FT707XKQAJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3I8FT707XKQAJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Mums and dads play a major role in superhero stories. Frequently they are the hero’s main motivation for becoming the superhero in the first place: Bruce Wayne’s parents were shot dead, Kal-El’s parents’ last act was to send him to Earth where he became Superman, Peter Parker’s father figure Uncle Ben was killed by a mugger, Hal Jordan’s dad died in a plane crash, Odin gave Thor his powers by forging Mjolnir, Charles Xavier shepherded untold numbers of young mutants to realise their full potential, and so on.Brian K Vaughan’s Runaways are similar in that the characters are made into superheroes through their parents - except they’re forced to step up and make that choice because their parents are supervillains trying to kill them!Alex, Gertrude, Karolina, Chase, Molly and Nico are the teenage offspring of well-to-do Californian philanthropists. When their parents gather to decide which charities to patronise for the following year, the bored kids decide to spy on the dull grown-ups - and then discover that their parents are secretly supervillains in a group called The Pride! The murder of an innocent at the hands of their mums and dads makes up their minds for them - they have to run away, or they could be next!I’m a big Brian K Vaughan fan so I’m not sure how it’s taken me this long to get around to this series but I’m glad I did because Runaways is terrific! Like Joss Whedon, Vaughan’s speciality is self-aware drama with the right amount of levity, as well as writing superb dialogue for convincing young characters. There’s not a single member of the group that doesn’t feel like a real teenager or unlikeable in any strong way. They’re charming and obnoxious, wise-ish but still kinda dumb, vulnerable, idealistic and guileless, thoughtless, fearful and brave - they’re teenagers.Runaways’ concept is still remarkably fresh so that even in 2015 this comic from 2003 reads really well. It’s also Marvel in name only with a handful of pages at the start and the occasional reference tossed in denoting this is set in the Marvel Universe. I’m convinced if Vaughan were to write this today, he’d publish it via Image as his own independent superhero comic and it’d still work as perfectly.The only giveaway that this is from several years ago is Adrian Alphona’s art. I’m a fan of the guy’s work from his recent run on G. Willow Wilson’s Ms Marvel so it’s surprising to see how different it looks here. It’s not as stylised or unique, not as eye-catching - it’s fine, it’s just a bit bland and generic, so much so that if I hadn’t seen his name on the cover, I would never have guessed he drew this book.That and Vaughan’s occasionally too cool for school dialogue (Nico yawns, Gertrude points and deadpans: “What she said”) are the only critiques I’ll say about this book, but they’re minor quibbles really.Runaways is brilliant. I wasn’t expecting it to grab me like it did but I was really drawn into the story with its unpredictable twists and turns and I loved getting to know this completely new set of characters. In fact the unpredictability comes from not knowing the characters and what they can do, so the two go hand in hand.It’s definitely my favourite of all Vaughan’s work for hire Marvel stuff, maybe because it doesn’t feel like a Marvel comic or that it tries something a little different and succeeds. I think if you liked Kieron Gillen and Jamie McKelvie’s Young Avengers, you’ll get a lot out of Vaughan and Alphona’s Runaways, though even readers who don’t especially like superhero comics might find themselves turned by this one.

"Hollywoodland, 1948, the tail end of the Golden Era of Film. Charlie Parish is a screenwriter for Victory Street Pictures, one of the largest studios in Los Angeles, who, after a wild party, wakes up near the corpse of his latest film’s starlet, Valeria Sommers. She’d been strangled and left on the floor, just feet away from a passed out Charlie! Besides a police investigation, the death of the leading lady means expensive reshoots for the studio and rewriting for Charlie.But then later he sees the police report on Valeria: “suicide” with the death photo showing her hanging from a door - there’s corruption afoot! Rape, murder, alcoholism, drug abuse, hell, abuse of all kinds - this is show business, where behind the glitz and glamour lurk dark secrets, mysteries, and danger. What’s Charlie stumbled into?The Fade Out is a stone cold masterpiece.Before the first chapter was down I knew this was going to be epic, and, WOW, it is one helluva ride! It’s a corny thing to say but it’s true, and that’s The Fade Out is like a portal into the past. Really! Sure there’s a plot here but Ed Brubaker, Sean Phillips, and Elizabeth Breitweiser have gone further and somehow brought the past to life. They’ve created a living, breathing world that’s so richly atmospheric and real (Brubaker was so committed to period detail he hired a research assistant for this project), it envelopes the reader completely.And what a fascinating - if sordid - world! Brubaker takes us behind the scenes to reveal drunken brawls between movie stars in studio bungalows, starlets lining up to service celebrities and studio execs in sleazy sex parties, substance abuse, violence, and studio PR hiding it all from the press, including keeping closeted famous actors in the closet (of course none of these things happen in today’s Hollywood… coughTomCruisecough).While the mystery of the dead starlet plays menacingly in the background, we get to know the key players in the series. Our protagonist is Charlie, the screenwriter who was so traumatised by his experiences in the war, he’s unable to write. So how is he kept on the payroll? His buddy Gil secretly dictates the scripts and Charlie types them up. It’s a shadowy partnership because Gil got blacklisted from all of the studios during the McCarthy witch hunts. But who sold out Gil?There’s Earl Rath, a Gregory Peck lookalike who’s always chasing the ladies; Maya Silver, Valeria’s replacement and a starlet who’s willing to do anything to get to the top; and Thursby, the studio head, whose own past is mired with illicit dealings. There are more but those characters’ pasts are explored the most in this first volume. Real movie stars like Clark Gable are thrown in to make the world that much more convincing.The characters are so compelling. They easily make this book stand out as a high quality work and Brubaker ensures no-one is free from blame - not everyone is a villain but everyone’s complicit in the harsh reality of make believe.The Fade Out is such a smooth read, it doesn’t feel like reading. With the words on the page, it’s more like watching a brilliant, stylish subtitled movie (about the movie business!) so it’s easy to take for granted Sean Phillips’ artwork. But every single page is first rate and, coupled with Brubaker’s script, they fly by.And then you come across a panel without words and the imagery stops you dead. For me that panel was Charlie stepping into his apartment building at night in a dingy part of town, and it was stunning. So elegant, so understated in its beauty - amazing. Colourist Elizabeth Breitweiser is the icing on the cake with her choice of aquamarine for the sky and the land, the colour bleeding together in the panel? Inspired!In The Fade Out, everyone has secrets and there’s a tantalising mystery at its core, but this first volume doesn’t have much of an arc. That’s fine though when the characters are so well created like they are here. It’s the first volume and I can’t wait to read more about both the plot and the characters.I loved Criminal (which is getting relaunched this year, hooray!) but The Fade Out, for me, is now definitely the best of the Brubaker/Phillips collaborations. James Ellroy fans especially will get a kick out of this as it’s very much in the vein of LA Confidential and The Black Dahlia, though I recommend this book to EVERYONE! Besides being Brubaker/Phillips' finest, The Fade Out is easily one of the year’s best comics!Cut!","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1OP4FT3L4JXK9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1632151715#wasThisHelpful","R1OP4FT3L4JXK9","A3I8FT707XKQAJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3I8FT707XKQAJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Suzie and Jon both have a special superpower: when they orgasm, they can stop time. Then they meet, fall in love, and decide to save Suzie’s library from foreclosure by the bank by robbing said bank of its filthy lucre! And so they ran like the sex criminals they were – in love, robbing the rich to give to the needy, and evading the sex police. A perfect ending!Or it would’ve been if there wasn’t a Volume 2!The initial burst of romance is over and Suzie and Jon are settling into their new relationship just as Jon’s depression looms. They also didn’t steal as much as they thought but enough to keep the wolf from the door – for now – while the sex police, led by Kegelface herself, is still on their trail. And, as Suzie and Jon are about to discover, they are not alone and the world is full of people with unusual sex powers. The battle between the sex criminals and the sex police just got taken up a notch – brimp it on!Tonally, the second volume of Sex Criminals is more of a downer than the first. Jon’s mental issues take over his life after he stops taking his medication and there’s more backstory exploring his confused and lonely childhood. Depression atrophies his relationship with Suzie who is going through her own problems, one of which is: does she love Jon or was it just a sex thing? This is the only sour note I had for this book and I love Suzie but what the hell – walking out on Jon when he needed her the most? What a s***y thing to do!Sex Criminals has always been a character-driven series so it’s great that Matt Fraction and Chip Zdarsky are expanding their cast beyond Suzie and Jon to include some awesome new additions. There’s Robert Rainbow, Suzie’s OBGYN and coincidentally Jon’s childhood buddy; Rach, Suzie’s bestie who taught her about sex in a bathroom stall in high school (not really new but returning); and Ana Kincaid who’s led a really interesting life – she’s definitely the character you’ll remember the most from this book!I also really liked Jon’s new psychiatrist, who, rather than throw pills at him, gives Jon some sound advice on his depression: exercise daily for 45 minutes and have a friend you can speak to. And that’s the other thing about Sex Criminals that’s so good: it’s full of useful, practical information about sensitive issues and handles them so well. Like when Suzie goes to see Robert Rainbow and he does a sexy striptease (albeit in her mind) while telling her about the various methods of birth control. Kids/teens reading this (and I’m sure there’s more than a few who do) can get all edumacated while enjoying an adult comic! No bathroom stall sketches for this generation!But it’s also lots and lots of fun to read and the humour keeps the mental/sexual health issues from overwhelming the generally light tone. There’s a lightsaber-ish fight with dildos, the sex police tracking device is ingeniously called a cumpass, there’s a fast food joint in the mall called Salad Cake – “Have you cake and eat salad too!”, and there’s an awesome The Wicked + The Divine porn parody, The Lick-ed + The Divine, featuring cameos from Kieron Gillen and Jamie McKelvie! I also noticed for the first time how sexual the names of our characters are: Suzie Dickson, Jon Johnson, and Myrtle Spurge (Kegelface).It is a grown-up book though so you do see T&A though never gratuitously and surprisingly, considering Ana’s chapter (her porn name WAS Jazmine St Cocaine!), it doesn’t feel sleazy either. Also, given that the approach to this volume is “the honeymoon is over”, it’s more about relationships after the initial frenzy of sex, and the more sporadic nature of it afterwards.Suzie and Jon take the fight to the sex police though the story itself only progresses so far in this second volume – like I said, it’s about the characters than the plot itself, but the cast are so good you almost forget about it entirely! If you enjoyed the first book, you’ll love this one just as much. Fraction and Zdarsky continue to do great things with this original title - what a brilliant comic this is!And so we ran, like the Sex Criminals fans we are, onto the next volume!","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R15PU7VPCRJOZF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1632151936#wasThisHelpful","R15PU7VPCRJOZF","A3I8FT707XKQAJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3I8FT707XKQAJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Tony’s hunt for The Collector, his sister’s murderer, is sidelined with personal matters and trivial cases that take him around the world. Meanwhile his friends and colleagues conspire to take down the dangerous killer themselves without Tony finding out. Will they succeed - and, if not, who will pay the price for failure?I wish I could say this ninth volume is amazing and wonderful and so on buuuuuuut… no. It’s not bad but it’s not great either. The first half of the book feels repetitive for no real reason besides treading water, which is basically what it’s doing. Then the second half is filled with some major WTF?! moments - especially THAT page - that feel rushed and ultimately kinda stupid.Tony’s daughter Olive is secretly being trained by Tony’s partner Colby, his former partner and criminal on the lam Mason Savoy, and Mason’s partner Cesar to become part of their task force against The Collector. Of course Tony would go mental if he found out his teenage kid was being put in harm’s way but especially since she’s going up against her aunt Toni’s killer.And that’s what really confused me: 1) why would they think they’d succeed, and 2) how would they think Tony would feel either way? If they succeed then he doesn’t have the closure of taking out Toni’s killer himself and if they don’t then he’s lost his daughter!Plus, you know Tony, as the main character, is going to defeat The Collector or at least be there when he goes down, so the result was predictable. That whole plotline didn’t make sense to me and felt forced into the book because the series has lately been a bit too casual in developing the main plot of the story.Worse is THAT page - you’ll know it when you read it - which made the subtitle, Chicken Tenders, make sense but otherwise came out of nowhere! It was designed to be the suckeriest of sucker punches and felt cheap.Despite the muddled main story, there’s plenty of nice moments here and there like some of the characters getting hitched in (where else?) Vegas, and we meet Applebee’s (gross) extended family. The snowman with tattoos made me laugh for no other reason than he’s a snowman with tattoos though the Babycakes the squirrel joke fell totally flat.And then there’s the one unequivocally perfect issue in the book: Warrior Chicken Poyo, the spin-off Poyo comic! It’s a subversive Middle-Earth/Tolkien-esque story where Poyo goes up against the Grocerymancer whose killer vegetables are terrorising the little people. Without going into the delightful details, I’ll just agree with the wizard who says “Poyo is one bad-ass motherfuckin’ bird!”Though John Layman’s script is average and too scattershot for my liking, Rob Guillory’s art is as perfect as ever. Layman’s rambling approach is almost worth it just to allow Guillory the freedom to draw the nuttiest things you’ll ever see in a comic! He really excels in the Poyo issue, especially with that panel where Poyo defeats the Grocerymancer.I wish I could say the ninth Chew volume is the best ever, etc. but in truth I felt it was very hit and miss throughout. It’s still good for a laugh here and there but, even though the main cast go through changes, I felt like the story just wasn’t that good. Still, I’m glad to hear that Chew is becoming an animated feature starring Steven Yuen (Glenn from The Walking Dead)!Now I’m off to mourn the loss of… well, you’ll see (sobs).","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R387L1ZMRSPH1N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1632152894#wasThisHelpful","R387L1ZMRSPH1N","A3I8FT707XKQAJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3I8FT707XKQAJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the format of the book: 60-ish pages, about half are blank (to signify memory gaps – geddit? ART!) and there are about 15 vignettes of “characters” who have memory problems. One page has a small picture of the “character” with their name underneath, the next page has two, three, sometimes four sentences describing their memory problem, then the third page is a full page illustration. These three pages repeat for each of the “characters” and then the book ends with a quote from Jorge Luis Borges – ART!None of the vignettes are particularly interesting. To give you an idea of their banality, here’s one:“Valentin does not remember how certain objects look, thus he often mistakes one thing for another. Lately, he has been carrying around all kinds of bouquets. It appears the little boy is in love.”That’s the text portion. The picture shows a little boy holding some cutlery and smiling. Repeat 15 times or so.I suppose the vignettes might be representative of how people are affected by memory issues though I don’t know anyone with memory loss/dementia so I couldn’t say. Except it’s presented in such a light, unimpressive way as to barely scratch the surface of the subject and completely fails to provide any insight whatsoever.I’m not sure who this book is aimed at – its format is child-like but the subject is clearly grown-up. Nor do I think any child, or adult for that matter, is likely to be engaged with the bland, brief material (the whole book takes five minutes max to read). The blurb describes it as “hauntingly funny” but all I got from it was that everyone in the book has a miserable life because of memory loss. I suppose somebody would find that funny but again I’m not sure who.The Book of Memory Gaps is pretentious rubbish. One might even say it was… forgettable?

"One of the most pretentious people I ever met was an anthropologist (the person would literally sniff and turn their noses up after making a point), so it’s no surprise to me that a novel featuring an anthropologist would turn out to be a load of pretentious crap. Because Satin Island is essentially a narrative about narratives (sniffs, turns up nose).Our main character is U, a corporate anthropologist working for a major London consultancy firm that advises global corporations and governments on how to spot trends and manipulate them for future gain. U is hired by Peyman, the head of the firm, to write the “great report” on the age we’re living in - an extraordinarily abstract and humongous project and one that U unsurprisingly fails to accomplish. Nevertheless he attempts to write it by focusing on seemingly random events like parachutists who plummeted to their deaths after their chutes didn’t open, oil spills, and internet buffering and trying to find connections between them(!).I think the narrator “U“ is Tom McCarthy’s way of putting “you”, the reader, into the same position as the protagonist. You are reading this novel and, in the reading, you are looking for clues as to what it’s about: its themes, meanings, etc. in much the same way that U is looking at random events and trying to figure out how it comes together as an understandable narrative. U and you are one and the same, and the effect is like reading a novel about someone experiencing a novel. Reading fiction is as much a way of understanding our world as an anthropologist taking random glimpses of humanity from various sources and teasing a narrative from them.At least that’s what I took to be the point of the book. Because despite the meandering tangents on zombie parades, Amazonian tribes, the Shroud of Turin, and a hundred other things, McCarthy never really brings it all together into anything meaningful. There are no insights into our modern age and we’re no clearer to understanding it by the end of the book.Then I realised as I was sitting there thinking about what I’d just read, I was doing what U does for much of the book: sitting in his increasingly Beautiful Mind-esque basement room trying to understand the information presented to him. Like the mirror effects of certain aspects of the story - the cancer that spreads through Petr’s body likened to the oil spill that spreads across the surface of the world - U and the reader are meant to be made parallel.Which isn’t to say that that interesting-ish approach to a novel makes it worth reading or even enjoyable because it doesn’t and isn’t. It’s written well though it’s such a slight book because it’s all style that doesn’t leave much of an impression that I doubt it’s something I’ll remember for very long or return to ever again. Because like most self-consciously literary novels, Satin Island is unbearably tedious most of the time. It has an enormously dull protagonist with unconvincingly portrayed non-characters making up the rest of the small cast, a non-plot and a non-story to keep you from really connecting with the book, and a purpose that could be described as self-serving and self-satisfied at best.Literary novels tend to have a thoughtful concept at its base, a few well-written lines, an idea or two worth pondering, and little else besides. I’d say at least 90%, probably more, of Satin Island is pure guff. That Tom McCarthy writes in the acknowledgments that “I spent (my artist’s residency in Stockholm) projecting images of oil spills onto huge white walls and gazing at them for days on end” and was paid to “sit and think about the general impossibility of writing a novel about the general impossibility of etc.” makes me want to slap him - assuming I could reach his head stuffed firmly up his arse!I suppose some fans of Nicholson Baker might find elements to enjoy in Satin Island. Baker famously writes two kinds of novel - the ridiculously overtly sexy kind (House of Holes, Vox), and the most determinedly mundane ones possible. Box of Matches is about a man sat in front of a hearth staring at a fire; The Mezzanine takes place during an office worker’s lunchtime as he eats a hot dog; The Anthologist (probably the one closest to Satin Island) is about a poet attempting to put together a poetry anthology.That readership plus anthropologists will probably enjoy this. Anyone else though is unlikely to know or care what the hell is going on.","2.0 out of 5 stars","March 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2DMYU8RIPZWP8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0307593959#wasThisHelpful","R2DMYU8RIPZWP8","A3I8FT707XKQAJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3I8FT707XKQAJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Red Lanterns: mean, angry, blood-spewing idiots who’re angry and mean – but are slowly becoming more cuddly? In this volume, Guy Gardner’s Red Lanterns square off against Atrocitus’s Red Lanterns – grrr! Then Supergirl becomes a (temporary) Red Lantern - rarrr! Then there are suddenly hundreds of Red Lanterns – GRRRRAAARRR! But the Red Lanterns are all buddies so they’re gonna save everything together, yay!So much – too much - of this chunky book is filler. Skallox and Zilius Zox go sight-seeing on Earth! Guy woos ex-girlfriend Ice unsuccessfully! A new, uninteresting character called The Judge is introduced! Supergirl becomes a Red Lantern and then turns back! Two pointless crossovers are thrown in! There’s meaningless cameos galore: Batman, Superman, John Stewart! And watch as one boring fight after another happens!The bloated volume could have been condensed into a strong, tight four or five issue book - instead we’ve got eleven issues!! The search for Atrocitus and the nine red rings is a fine story and that alone could’ve been enough. Have the Red Lanterns focus on this rather than send them here, there and everywhere else. All that extra stuff can easily go, like what was the point of having Supergirl become a Red Lantern? None, except to fill up a lot of space - it didn’t go anywhere anyway!I really hate crossovers because it forces you to read titles you’re not reading for a reason. So having Robert Venditti’s Green Lantern and Tony Bedard’s Supergirl comics shoe-horned into this book were unwelcome additions. Not only were they boring but they added nothing to the overall story that wasn’t already in it.The ending definitely the worst part as it’s really rushed and poorly put together – thrown together really! After spending scores of pages on irrelevant fluff, Charles Soule crams: Guy Gardner’s showdown with Atrocitus, major changes to the cast and series direction, and Guy’s new life in about five pages! Compare this to a useless fight between Skallox, Zilius Zox, and Shadow Thief earlier in the book which ran to more pages!In addition to the overlong page count, the panels are packed with dialogue giving it a claustrophobic look. Soule makes sure every character has a lot to say about everything so trudging through this book is an exhausting read! When Soule does get around to focusing on the story of the Reds vs Atrocitus and his growing army of other Reds, things are good – it’s just so much of it is watered down making it less effective.Soule writes the characters to be much more likeable than they’ve previously been presented which somehow feels wrong – they’re Red Lanterns, they’re not supposed to be about the feels! And why have Guy Gardner frequently make the point that he’s not a leader and the Reds are independent, when all he does is lead and the rest follow?Art-wise, it’s difficult to say because there are a ton of artists contributing pages. It’s more or less consistently fine but it’s the usual story with DC mashing together an issue by having one artist draw the first five pages, then another drawing the next seven, another drawing three, and another drawing the remaining pages – multiplied by 11!The book could’ve benefitted from Soule culling a lot of his dialogue, focusing more on the main story, and giving the finale the space it deserved rather than barrelling through it at breakneck speed. As a result, Red Lanterns Volume 5: Atrocities is just an ok book when it had the potential to be much better.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2GNKJ8ITAQISO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1401250904#wasThisHelpful","R2GNKJ8ITAQISO","A3I8FT707XKQAJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3I8FT707XKQAJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The idea to Mark Waid and Barry Kitson’s Empire is sound: what if a Doctor Doom-type beat the superheroes and established an empire that was slowly taking over the world. What would that empire look like? What would the story of villainy triumphant be like? There’s certainly merit to the idea because a lot of it is new ground - except Waid doesn’t realise any of it in this very tedious comic.Probably the biggest problem is the lack of a compelling main narrative. There are a few attempts at plotting here and there but most fizzle out quickly and none have any real bearing on the lead character, Golgoth. Because there are no superheroes to fight the supervillain, Waid focuses on Golgoth’s inner circle of crazies and their petty squabbles amongst themselves which is as riveting as it sounds.One of them, the chief assassin Xanna, wants more of this amazing drug Golgoth feeds them to keep them in line, so she goes looking for how it’s made - and stumbles across a big secret. Another of his lieutenants, Lucullan, looks to be secretly working with the pathetic resistance, supplying them with weapons. And Some Guy is boning Golgoth’s daughter, Delfi - hope papa doesn’t find out!Where do those subplots go? Nowhere. But you gotta have something to fill up those eight issues, no matter how dull and pointless they are!Maybe this is a character study of a supervillain? Nope! He’s a little less megalomaniacal in one flashback but otherwise he’s one-dimensional at the end as he is at the beginning. Plus he’s overpowered to the point where no-one can touch him. Great, he’s unstoppable - now I’m really on the edge of my seat!I don’t think of Mark Waid as a stupid writer but he does write extremely simplistically here. I mean, the drug Golgoth uses to control his inner circle is called Eucharist and it’s administered in a church like environment - geddit? That image is hammered home even more once you find out what Eucharist is. How about Golgoth for a villain’s name - can we be more obvious?The superhero is called Endymion and… well, that’s a spoiler but look up Keat’s Endymion and compare that to the superhero here. Any similarities?! There’s a communications guy whose role is shamelessly ripped out of Nineteen Eighty-Four, “amending” the news so that the Empire comes off as positive every time. Oh, and in one panel his daughter is reading Machiavelli’s The Prince - think she’s got something to do with the “twist” ending?I really didn’t like the world Waid dreamt up in Empire because it’s so flat! In this dreary world, crazy evil guys behead people and then play basketball with their heads - they’re EVIL! They take over other countries and kill kids - they’re EVIL! The leader goes around killing anyone on a whim - he’s EVIL!I kept thinking: so, what’s the point? Is Waid trying to say something as banal as absolute power corrupts absolutely or something even less insightful such as once evil supervillain wins, they continue doing evil supervillain stuff ad nauseam? Am I supposed to be enjoying this/fascinated with what I’m reading? Everything about this comic is so uninteresting!Barry Kitson’s art isn’t bad but I had some problems with his character designs. Three of his female characters and two of his male characters looked identical. I was wondering, what’s the ambassador of Greenland doing in Golgoth’s daughter’s bed only to discover he was a completely separate character halfway through the book! Granted two of the female characters are related, but still, is it so hard to get characters who look different?I’ll give Waid this: he’s consistent. The ending is so bleakly miserable, like the rest of the book, it’s ballsy how nihilistic his vision is for Empire, and he commits to it totally. But, frankly, so what? Was the whole point just to have a superhero-type comic where the supervillain wins all the time from start to finish? At least we know why this doesn’t happen every often: it’s incredibly boring to read!I’d been looking forward to reading Empire for a while now and I have enjoyed some of Waid’s comics, but this one was disappointing. It’s lacking in imagination, the writing, from the pitiful story to the paper thin characters, was very weak, and the premise proves to be a mistake, at least in Waid’s hands, who does nothing to expand upon it in any meaningful way.This Empire was less Strikes Back and more Phantom Menace!","2.0 out of 5 stars","March 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2UHQ7Y56K73PK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0006SC8CO#wasThisHelpful","R2UHQ7Y56K73PK","A3I8FT707XKQAJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3I8FT707XKQAJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Last year (2013) in the run up to the Guardians of the Galaxy movie this past summer (2014), Brian Michael Bendis was given the task of re-launching the Guardians of the Galaxy comic to prep and gee up the audience in advance. His Guardians series was fairly good (at least to start with) and did the job nicely - Guardians is now a top 10 bestselling comic for Marvel AND a major hit movie.To accompany the print issues, Bendis wrote a limited run of four Infinite Comics - Marvel's digital line - with each one focusing on an individual character in the team: Drax, Gamora, Groot and Rocket (Star Lord had the first print issue all to himself).The Ming Doyle-drawn Rocket story ended with him realising he wasn't the last of his kind, as he previously thought. Skottie Young picks up this strand and kicks off his Rocket (and Groot) solo (but really duo) series with the mysterious other hunting down Rocket in A Chasing Tale.I've been a fan of Young's art for a long time now but I wasn't sure if he had the writing chops to pull off a title on his own steam. And while he's not as great a writer as he is an artist, his Rocket series does read quite well. The first issue is a blisteringly good start, riffing on Luke's rescue of Leia in A New Hope before switching to Groot in an alien WWE-style wrestling match, and then throwing in one action set piece after another: foot chase, gun fight, imprisonment, and multiple villains appearing.It's probably my fault for expecting that level of intensity for the rest of the story as things do slow down from then on and, though it's never boring, the rest of the book never reaches those initial giddy heights. Young's art though is sensational. From the splash page of Rocket and Groot's escape from the prison planet, to the space battle in the seafood Cadillac, to the space fish wormhole; Young's vision, imagination and skill in producing some truly outstanding pages is breath-taking.Young's ability to tell a story with just visuals is most evident in one of the two standalone issues that closes out the volume. The Groot issue is Rocket's pal telling a troop of space scouts a fireside tale but, being Groot, he can only say three words: I. Am. Groot. So the entire issue, bar the framing, is told using those three words - even the signs in the story say I Am Groot! But Young's layouts, along with artist Jake Parker who draws this and the other standalone issue, really sell the story so you can totally understand what's happening from the art alone.The final standalone issue is a pretty forgettable story of Cosmo hiring Rocket to help out some Transformers-esque robots break free or something. I suppose it has its moments - Rocket complaining about never having a sidekick with any vocabulary is a cute aside and I guess fans of the Abnett/Lanning run will enjoy seeing Cosmo and Knowhere again.Rocket is for the most part the brash and charming ladies', er, ""man"", the animal equivalent of Han Solo, but Young does try here and there to give him a more rounded personality. Like in the movie, an unexpectedly touching moment emerges from Rocket and we catch a glimpse of his inner self that's at odds with his outward wild, whacky and fun character that sets the overall tone of the book. But mostly this volume is silly over-the-top action/humour!There are a couple of great issues here, and I love that Marvel published that cray-cray Groot story, but a lot of the book is fairly ordinary scripting - maybe trying a bit too hard to be funny in places - with consistently strong art throughout. It's a fine, fun comic that's definitely worth checking out for fans of the two best Guardians which, after the success of the movie, is pretty much everyone!3.5 stars","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2M068HTDYF399/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0785193898#wasThisHelpful","R2M068HTDYF399","A3I8FT707XKQAJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3I8FT707XKQAJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Laney Griffith’s wife was murdered and his son has leukemia. Oh and here’s another kick in the nards: his money’s running out because of the stupid American healthcare system which bankrupts the sick and vulnerable. So when a maniac killer is running about the woods near his home slashing up innocents, Laney’s forced to take a major risk in trying to hunt down the murderer and claim the sizeable bounty. And then he finds out the killer’s a kerazy werewolf, say whaaaaaaat?!If a comic could be a cheap made for SF Channel movie, it’d be this one. Writers Michael Moreci and Tim Daniel serve up an uninteresting and clichéd horror story with overwrought scenarios, one-dimensional characters, and a predictable plot with one rather large hole. That one would be that when Laney captures the killer, he takes him down to his basement and leaves him there chained up. Why doesn’t he turn him in for the bounty? Who knows. He finds out some information about his wife from the werewolf later on but there’s no way he would’ve known he would get that information so I don’t know why the whole jailer/prisoner scenario was set up.Laney is your average, uninteresting put-upon father tryna do right by his blah blah, let’s just call it what it is: unconvincing “motivation”. He has some tedious conflict with his sister-in-law sheriff and hillbilly in-and-out-of-jail neighbour, whom he suspects had something to do with his wife’s disappearance. To be fair four issues isn’t a long time to do much but that doesn’t mean a hackneyed story has to be trotted out either.I did like one detail which was that the werewolf, when in human form, slowly builds up to the transformation over the course of the month rather than instantly turning at once. That’s a more troubling situation for werewolves and really sells the tragic aspect of their existence.Riley Rossmo and Colin Lorimer’s art is definitely the best part of the book. It’s detailed, it’s sleek, it shows a lot of potential, and I liked some scenes’ framing. The art easily outweighs the writing here. The one failing would be, unfortunately, at the crucial part of the story when the resolution to the werewolf and Laney’s story collides and it’s utterly indistinguishable as to who’s doing what on the page. Which character am I looking at? Is that a blur effect or are there really three figures in this panel? Which one is duplicated or are they all dissimilar? It’s like watching a Transformers movie once the good and bad robots start fighting – you can’t tell who’s who!I can’t recommend Curse – and that’s another thing, “Curse”? Could you come up with a more generic, forgettable, hard to find when typing into a search engine, name for your book?! Then again forgettable is what this comic is so it’s an appropriately chosen title! Curse is a badly written/conceived horror comic that’s definitely miss-able.","2.0 out of 5 stars","March 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R18HO77JVINAQ0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1608864626#wasThisHelpful","R18HO77JVINAQ0","A3I8FT707XKQAJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3I8FT707XKQAJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When the New 52 launched in September 2011, I expected the line-wide reboot to begin with the character’s origin stories as DC were aiming to familiarise new readers who perhaps didn’t know much about them; it didn’t. Justice League started five years in the past for some reason, and DC’s big cheeses, Batman and Superman, carried on, business as usual with their numbering back to #1 being the only change. In fact hardly any characters got origin stories!In September 2012 DC half-heartedly attempted each character’s origins with a series of #0 issues which pretty much did the job. Now - well over three years after the New 52 launched! - we have Secret Origins, a series dedicated to the origin stories of DC’s characters. Perfect timing, guys! Now we can finally discover what Batman’s deal is and where Superman came from...The origin stories in this book are: Superman, Dick Grayson/Robin #1, Supergirl, Batman, Aquaman, Starfire, Green Lantern, Batwoman, Tim Drake/Red Robin, Harley Quinn, Green Arrow, Damian Wayne/Robin #5.The only demographic I can imagine this series appealing to would be readers completely new to DC Comics. Because who doesn’t know Batman or Superman’s origins? Even people who don’t read comics know these guys’ origin stories! It’s not like the New 52 altered them in any way, it’s still the same “gunned down outside theatre showing Zorro/Yes Father, I shall become a bat”, and “sent from doomed planet/raised by kindly farm couple in Smallville, Kansas”.As if retelling Batman’s origins weren’t redundant enough, Scott Snyder just got done telling Batman’s New 52 origin story in Zero Year!! Even Damian Wayne’s origin is a summary of Grant Morrison’s early Batman run after Bruce was sent hurtling back in time post-Final Crisis/Batman RIP, and Damian and Dick Grayson became the new Batman and Robin. So… are those books part of the New 52 or something?For more experienced comics readers, getting through each origin is going to be dull at best especially with the way they’re written in quick summary form. There is no differentiation between most of these origins and the pre-New 52 origins - I really don’t know why they bothered!Scott Lobdell though… man, I hate this guy’s work! He writes the two worst origins in this book: Starfire and Red Robin.I don’t mind that Lobdell changed the origin for the New 52 Tim Drake where his parents weren’t killed/crippled but sent away for witness protection, because rebooting a character allows for that change. But it doesn’t make sense to me that when Bruce adopts Tim that Tim skips the mantle of Robin and instantly becomes Red Robin - that’s so stupid!We’re also never told the full story of Jason Todd which “frees up the position of Robin” that Tim’s so eager to fill even though he doesn’t take up the position anyway! Anyway, it’s hinted that Jason’s fate is essentially the same as the pre-New 52 version told in Batman: Death in the Family, once again making the whole reboot idea redundant.Worse is Starfire’s origin, the only character in this book whose origin I know nothing about (nor really want to - and what is she doing in this A-list lineup anyway!?). I’ve read most of the New 52 titles but I purposely avoided Red Hood and the Outlaws partly because it’s written by Lobdell but also because I heard terrible things about the way he wrote Starfire as some kind of sex doll that gets passed around indiscriminately. Well, I got to experience Lobdell’s hideous rendering of the character in Starfire’s origin! These two details sum it up: she’s sold into sex slavery and is forcefully injected with drugs to become dependent and compliant for her captors.LOBDEEELLLLLLLLLLLLLL!!!Tony Bedard’s Supergirl origin is pretty stupid too, though it’s Tony Bedard and I didn’t have high hopes when I saw his name credited. In his bizarre reality, the North Koreans have a space program! North Korea - one of the world’s poorest nations that relies upon UN food schemes to feed their population - has a space program! Did Bedard have any involvement in writing the Red Dawn remake where North Korea inexplicably invades the US?!But hey, if you wondered where Harley Quinn got that stuffed beaver she’s always talking to in her solo New 52 title, you find out in her origin here! Yeesh…Lee Bermejo’s covers are the only positive I can think of for this book - they are outstanding like all of his work.Secret Origins really is a pointless, tedious series because so many of its origins have already been explained elsewhere in the New 52. Maybe newer readers will find this more useful because it acts as a sort of comic wiki for DC’s characters but I can’t say that makes me like it any better.There are some great retellings of these character’s origin stories in other books that are worth checking out instead of this AND you’ll find the origins are the same anyway. They are:Superman: BirthrightBatman: Year OneBatman: Zero YearGreen Arrow: Year OneGreen Lantern: RebirthBatman and Son (Damian Wayne)Batwoman: ElegyBatman: Mad Love (Harley Quinn)","1.0 out of 5 stars","March 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2RBZYOD87ETK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1401250491#wasThisHelpful","R2RBZYOD87ETK","A3I8FT707XKQAJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3I8FT707XKQAJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The country music hit from the 1920s, Big Rock Candy Mountain, is made real in The Delinquents as Valiant’s wackiest duos Archer & Armstrong and Quantum & Woody team-up for an adventure to find the Hobo King’s treasure!Fred Van Lente’s Archer & Armstrong and James Asmus’ Quantum & Woody are both great titles, arguably the two best Valiant have right now, so putting two great tastes together should make them taste even better – right? Mmm… no, unfortunately.The two teams ridin’ the rails just isn’t that funny a setup as Van Lente/Asmus thought. The whole joke is that these “superheroes” are getting drunk, sleeping rough and getting stinkier – that’s pretty much it. The joke wears thin quick over the four issues and what was something of a cute story becomes quite dreary by the end.I suppose there are a couple of fun moments in the book. Woody taking Archer under his wing and introducing him to alcohol was alright, and I really liked the way they went about the big final battle in the last issue.The writers wryly acknowledge the cliché of the superhero medium where many pages are spent with everyone bashing one another until the heroes win, so rather than portray that tedium again, they have a double-page spread of the setting and actual cut-out figures of the characters with cut-out sound effects so the reader can use their imagination to construct their own battle – brilliant! Van Lente/Asmus have a story to tell and an elongated fight scene won’t add anything to that!If the whole book had had that subversive and inspired approach, I’d have liked it a lot more. But it’s mostly the characters being predictably silly in an obvious way to little effect – they’re not funny and it’s not a great story to watch them bumble about. “We’re delinquents, look how crazy we are, woooah!” pretty much sums up the “comedy”.

"Reading Ben Templesmith’s The Squidder is a game of “spot the reference”. I don’t think there’s a single original element to it that hasn’t already been used two or three times already in much more famous books or movies.In some post-apocalyptic world (like Mad Max, The Road, The Walking Dead, I Am Legend), humans have become like crops to be harvested by flying squid monsters - THE MATRIX anyone? Our hero is Jack aka a Squidder, a genetically enhanced soldier (like 2000AD’s Rogue Trooper) whose nanites cause any harm to him becomes magically healed (like Valiant’s Bloodshot) who lost his wife and kids to the squids because losing your family counts as instant audience empathy, right?Together with a female human sidekick, who’s a squid mage whatever that means, the two must travel the post-apocalyptic world (like The Book of Eli) to battle a female baddie who controls the hive mind of the squids. Anyone play Starcraft? This character screams KERRIGAN so much I bet Blizzard could sue and win if they wanted. I swear she’s even drawn like her in some panels.This book elicited two emotions from me: hatred and boredom. When I wasn’t feeling one, I was feeling the other. By the end, I was feeling both! Every page is dull action (it’s always tense when your main character is invincible) or cliched dialogue with plot and visuals borrowed from multiple sources. This was one long slog through utterly crap writing following two non-characters on an incoherent quest to do something that I can’t even muster up the energy to not care about. I kind of wanted the squids to win, that’s how much I loathed our “heroes”, but really I just wanted it to end.There was one scene here that seemed original, where the female squid mage becomes instantly pregnant and births a sword - yup, that squeezes it way out of there! - but what a monumentally stupid scene. I mean really, birthing a sword?The Squidder is a horrendously written and conceived comic. Templesmith’s a decent artist but he’s not a good writer. Those other things I mentioned earlier?

"Hans Fallada was a German writer from the first half of the 20th century who struggled alternately with addiction to alcohol, morphine, ether and cocaine for most of his adult life. This small book collects two autobiographical stories - Short Treatise on the Joys of Morphinism and Three Years of Life - the first of which is a harrowing account of his time as a morphine/cocaine junkie, and the second addressing his self-imposed jail-time for stealing to finance his alcoholism.Of the two, Short Treatise is definitely the best. It’s a day in the life of Hans, who wakes up hungering for morphine, and we follow his journey to salve that hunger. Going from his cheap lodgings, he meets up with a fellow junkie desperate for a fix and the two try to fill fake scripts at various pharmacies, all while their pains are getting more unbearable. Hans decides to try his luck on his own, going to a doctor for a morphine injection, and from there it’s a nightmarish descent from needle to needle until his fickle lady - the drug - embraces him fully.It’s a short 18 page story but it’s one of the most gripping accounts of drug addiction I’ve ever read. Fallada’s writing is so intense that I was actually on edge and nervous the entire time I was reading it, feeling as jittery as Hans was as his anguish over withdrawal enveloped him. I breathed deeply once he got his fix but, once again, Fallada whips up more tension as Hans goes looking for more drugs to shoot into his veins, this time finding cocaine… It’s a bitterly ironic title with little joy to be found in the drug habit.Three Years of Life is tangentially about addiction. Fallada is so desperate, he decides to beat his alcoholism by spending time in jail. He’d been falsifying accounts and stealing money to finance his addiction and turns himself in to the police. This is surprisingly difficult to do at first as the police think he’s just another delusional wino, but eventually he gets thrown in the slammer and from there it’s an often dreary account of how he survived in prison.It’s actually more about nicotine addiction than alcohol as Fallada spends quite a lot of the story talking about how cigarettes become currency in prison, the difficulty of finding a light inside, and the various disgusting ways an addict satisfies his needs. If Short Treatise is a pedal-to-the-metal frenzied ride through the blazing madness of drug addiction, Three Years is an uncomfortable but still amiable stroll through the inanity of prison life and the constant search for cigarettes. It’s a much less interesting story but illustrates the still further difficulties that Fallada’s addictions put him through (and would eventually kill him. Fallada died of a morphine overdose in 1947).This is worth a look for the white-hot writing of Short Treatise but there are also some passages that stand out in Three Years. If the first story is five stars and the second three, let’s split the difference and call this a four star read.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RBE7FN1SWRBKV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0141195800#wasThisHelpful","RBE7FN1SWRBKV","A3I8FT707XKQAJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3I8FT707XKQAJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As a much younger man, Duke McQueen saved an alien world called Tantalus from the baddies and became their hero. Then he returned to Earth and no-one believed him, not even his own family. Today, Duke’s a grandfather whose wife has passed away and his kids have grown up and started families of their own. Then a spaceship arrives on his front lawn and a young boy from Tantalus steps out – they need Duke McQueen to help them again.I quite like the setup, which is a twist on the adventure pulps of the early 20th century but, wow, Mark Millar’s script is pure faecal matter! He completely trashes what could’ve been a half-decent story with his lazy writing.I mean, the influences are so obvious – Buck Rogers, Star Wars, to name a couple – as to be almost cut’n’pasted into this comic wholesale! Here’s a female Han Solo-type, behaving just like Han Solo! Here’s the rebel base on Endor! Here’s Buck Rogers aka Duke McQueen!The characters couldn’t be more one-dimensional. Duke is the hero, Starboy is his sidekick, the Kingfisher is the villain, that’s it. Their motivations are equally simple – hero wants to stop villain who in turn just wants to enslave everyone to get boringly rich. And Duke is so invincible – even as an old man – that there’s zero tension in watching him demolish hordes of alien soldiers. He’s never in any danger because he’s the hero. Can you get more contrived?The “plot” is so horribly predictable it’s insulting to the reader. Duke arrives on the planet to save everyone – guess what happens in the end? Starboy’s parents were killed by some sneering villain, and he promises that he’ll avenge his parents and kill their killer - guess what happens in the end? When Duke and Starboy get thrown into an alien cell, they meet an unusually friendly character who plies them for information on the rebels – duh, d’you think he’s a spy working for the bad guys?There isn’t a single redeeming feature to Millar’s writing on this book. It is straight up cold-hearted and brazenly cynical all the way through. The only quality about the book I liked was Goran Parlov’s art. His work with Garth Ennis on Fury MAX and The Punisher was excellent and the art in this book is no less brilliant. The comic looks like an 80s space opera, in the best possible way. Fresh, exciting, a bit simplistic but no less compelling to look at, though, like I said, some of the designs are unashamedly pulled straight out of Star Wars.In the lead up to this series, Millar said Starlight would be the book that unites his many Millarworld books – and it totally doesn’t. More fool me, I know, given that Millar is the PT Barnum of comics, but still, does this man have any integrity at all?The latest Millarworld releases have been exceedingly sub-par: The Secret Service was woeful, Kick Ass 3 was a helluva disappointment, as was Jupiter’s Legacy (which is plagued with delays, though that’s down to Frank Quitely rather than Millar), and MPH is arguably the worst thing Millar’s written, though Starlight comes close to claiming that title! What a miserable place the Millarworld is.Mark Millar could not have written a more bland, generic space adventure comic than Starlight. I’m flabbergasted that anyone could have anything remotely positive to say about something this void of originality, imagination or soul.","1.0 out of 5 stars","March 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1SGGC7UYRZQ2T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1632150174#wasThisHelpful","R1SGGC7UYRZQ2T","A3I8FT707XKQAJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3I8FT707XKQAJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Ten years ago alien life made contact with humanity - by putting what look like giant waste pipes all around the planet and every so often pumping toxic waste out of them! But that was it. They didn’t bother making “first contact” or talking to us because it seems like we don’t interest them. As it says in the opening monologue, “we learned that there is intelligent life in the universe but that they did not recognise us as intelligent or alive”. Instead, Earth is to be their alien landfill - what else would you expect from misanthropic Warren Ellis? I love it!The story begins ten years after the trees (the giant alien waste pipes) appeared and the world has changed. Environments have altered: Manhattan has flooded, democratic governments have toppled to be replaced by fascistic ones. Though war still prevails, particularly amongst the African nations and China is still happily ignoring basic human rights. Also, the Chinese set up a “special cultural zone” around their tree, allowing artists and whoever wanted to live there, experiment with an alternate form of life.On the surface you might think this would be a humans vs aliens storyline and expect some kind of concerted and focused fightback against the invasion - but it’s not. Instead humanity has learned to live with the trees and the book is instead about day to day life and human individuals surviving in this new world with the trees as background, but still “exerting a silent pressure” on us - an inspired take on the alien invasion template.I read this book as single issues which, while good, wasn’t that impressive month by month because it felt like Warren Ellis had written this long story, intended to be read as a singlular narrative, and then chopped it up into eight issue-sized pieces. Re-reading all of the issues together in one go definitely reinforces that feeling and actually makes for a different, much better reading experience.The characters’ storylines feel much more involving and interesting too. There’s Eligia, a young woman, in Cefalu, Italy who is the sex slave of a local mob leader. She wants to break free of her dependence on him and become self-sufficient, asking a mysterious old man for help. In the Chinese city of Shu, a young artist called Tian Chenglei arrives to draw the trees and falls in love. In Mogadishu, Somalia, the head of state decides to use their tree - the world’s smallest - to wage war on a nearby neighbour over a territorial dispute. And in Blindhail Station, Spitzbergen, Norway, a team of international scientists make a startling discovery about the trees.It’s a credit to Ellis that he sets up an alien invasion storyline then totally ignores the aliens and makes the humans and what they do amongst themselves be even more fascinating than any action-heavy approach could achieve. Our characters’ storylines also emphasises the idea that the aliens don’t view us as intelligent or civilised when there’s so much violence and bloodshed in the book - humans killing other humans for power, money, sex, etc. Why would they see us otherwise? We must seem like idiotic barbarians to a more advanced culture!It also shows our reactions to the trees with us humans attempting to show that we still have control over some things like each other even though we have no control over the trees or any ability to get rid of them. Their toxic waste decimates Rio de Janeiro in the opening scene and there’s no retaliation! Ellis further develops this futuristic world by making the point that cities with trees face decreasing populations and economies leading to the characters’ problems in the story. It’s a really clever, inspired take.As great as the characters’ stories are in this first book, Ellis does acknowledge the aliens’ purpose towards the end by bringing about their first “communication” of sorts to us. I especially like how Ellis isn’t rushing things and telling the story he wants at his own speed. It’s an exciting finale to the first act of this series and makes me anticipate the next volume all the more.Jason Howard’s covers to the series have been terrific - some of the best comics covers I’ve seen in the last year! They’re very stylish, eye-catching with a wonderful use of colour giving each issue a unique look. The interiors are also wonderful with very dynamic action scenes, beautifully captured landscapes with the trees as silent monoliths in the background, and the characters are drawn very expressively. Howard’s range is impressive too, confidently drawing city scenes like Cefalu and Shu as masterfully as the more barren regions of Spitzbergen and Mogadishu. Great colours, great art - I hope Jason Howard gets a lot more work and recognition after people read this book.Trees Volume 1 is an outstanding comic. It’s Ellis’ most interesting book since Supergod and definitely one of his best and most original stories ever. With an able collaborator in Jason Howard, Warren Ellis has created a fantastic work here that’s highly recommend to fans of quality comics.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RI8D4R2X3QIQI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1632152703#wasThisHelpful","RI8D4R2X3QIQI","A3I8FT707XKQAJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3I8FT707XKQAJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The simple summary of this book is that Julie decides to leave The Maxx behind to sort her life out and he’s not chuffed about it! Wow, that sounds… boring.There’s some weird stuff about the Outback, which is imaginary or something, Mr Gone, who’s dead but isn’t, some kid with his arm stuck in a wall that’s also a portal, and a flashback issue to Julie’s childhood. But mostly it’s a very muddled and meandering book with little substance for all its self-conscious “artiness”.I liked The Maxx initially because it’s a peculiar take on the usual superhero story. It’s a bit whacky with lots of cartoony animals like the Isz showing up (eyeless gremlins) and there’s some question over what The Maxx is anyway - is he some crazy homeless friend of Julie’s? Her spirit animal? Just a lost kid dreaming it all up? But a lot of those interesting questions get pushed to the side in this third volume of the re-mastered series to be replaced with…... a whole lotta nothing instead! There are entire issues here where I couldn’t tell you what the point was, like the kid with the arm stuck in the wall - why was that relevant? And what is Mr Gone’s deal anyway - so many pages with this guy sitting against a wall talking gibberish! A random kid who wants to be a supervillain for some reason? The Maxx sulks the whole time while Julie dithers about, as is her wont, until she packs her bags and goes.So. What.Sam Kieth’s art is fine but his and William Messner-Loeb’s script is tedious to say the least. I’m struggling to understand why I should care about anything that happened in this book. The Maxx is an interesting character but without a story to match, it’s the dullest comic to read. Kieth and Messner-Loeb being weird for the sake of it is much too trying to enjoy. This third volume is the worst one yet in a series that continues to decline in quality.","2.0 out of 5 stars","March 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1N4ZLJMJUDMEA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1631402021#wasThisHelpful","R1N4ZLJMJUDMEA","A3I8FT707XKQAJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3I8FT707XKQAJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Tracy Lawless is on the hunt for his brother’s killer. But his brother, Rick, was mixed up with some ne’er do wells who are planning a Christmas heist. Tracy’s got to infiltrate the group and figure out who offed his little brother - and make them pay!Ed Brubaker and Sean Phillips’ Criminal is my favourite title from among their many collaborations (Sleeper, Incognito, Fatale) but I think this second volume is the least in the series. It’s definitely hard-boiled noir, kind of like a more realistic version of Frank Miller’s hyper-stylised Sin City, but the story isn’t as gripping.Tracy’s hunt for his brother’s killer feels like a subplot instead of the main, and his search is very slow and unfocused. He gets into his brother’s old gang and then basically goes along with their plans. His “search” doesn’t feel in the least bit urgent and it’s almost surprising when he does discover his brother’s killer at the end. Compare it to Sin City: The Hard Goodbye where Marv is relentlessly killing his way to the truth, and it’s like Tracy barely has any drive at all!Meanwhile, Tracy’s just going with the gang’s plan, a storyline which isn’t all that great to read. Sure there’s a car chase here, knocking over an ATM there, sleeping with the femme fatale, but it seems rote and it’s not a whole lot for a full-length story. It doesn’t help that the characters feel like cliches and Tracy himself, despite the numerous flashbacks to a troubled youth, isn’t that interesting a protagonist. Brubaker tries though, making him this tough guy who also occasionally does some kinda good things, eg. killing bad guys. Like a lot of Criminal’s cast, Tracy’s a little bit of good and bad so there’s a frisson of unpredictability to all of his actions.I’m always impressed with the ease with which Brubaker’s created the Criminal world. In just a few pages the Undertow bar feels very lived in, Brubaker focusing on a child waitress who has the run of the bar to draw us into the atmosphere of the place. That authorial confidence and originality, along with Sean Phillips’ ink-heavy artwork, is why the series is so well-regarded. And Phillips’ realistic art style is certainly good in this one. The snowy Christmas backdrop mixes with the noir for a very moody setting which is perfect for the book.Lawless isn’t a terrible comic by any stretch but for a revenge story it’s surprisingly slow and plodding, and doesn’t grab you like other Criminal books do. I did like that the ending is counter-intuitive to the standard revenge arc, which usually ends with the killer getting theirs, but you can see the twist coming after the childhood flashbacks start coming thick and fast towards the end, asking the reader to wonder about Rick’s character, who is largely unknown for much of the book - was he a good guy or a bad guy and, if the latter, do you want him to be avenged?The Criminal books are great because Brubaker spins some great stories with the most unpleasant cast, and the series as a whole is definitely worth checking out. It’s especially a good time now as it’s being republished by Image after being out of print for a while. Lawless though ain’t flawless.","3.0 out of 5 stars","February 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3UCS4K6FK4NIT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1632152037#wasThisHelpful","R3UCS4K6FK4NIT","A3I8FT707XKQAJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3I8FT707XKQAJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When last we left Frank he was escaping the Howling Commandos with a bullet in his chest. He’s now south of the border and desperate for a doctor – and that’s when he’s captured by a drug cartel and handed over to the villainous Crossbones. Frank’s rambling quest to end the supply of drugs into LA takes him into the jungles of Central America, a Mexican prison, a covert ship, an unexpected crossover with Black Widow, and the murder of the current Fantastic Four movie cast (but not really)!Boring - that pretty much sums up this series of The Punisher! I love the character but Nathan Edmondson’s treatment of him really isn’t winning me over. Frank’s just so blah in this book! I think this shows how The Punisher isn’t just some psycho with a skull t-shirt shooting criminals repeatedly. Garth Ennis can take Frank Castle and make him the most interesting person in the Marvel Universe; in the hands of a lesser writer, the same character is rendered sterile and lifeless.Edmondson tries, I’ll give him that. Frank teams up with a special ops guy as they fight their way out of the jungle, which sounds exciting but was just ok. The only thing that stood out to me was the sudden use of military acronyms, and, looking at the credits, someone called “bestselling author Kevin Maurer” co-wrote these two issues with Edmondson (a quick google shows that he’s written several books on modern warfare). Find out that CAS and ISR stand for Close Air Support and Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance, then wonder why you should care.The other issues felt like lesser versions of stories already told. The Black Widow crossover was a lot like the night raid from the Winter Soldier movie when Cap and Black Widow storm a boat (the “was he wearing a parachute?” scene), but not as exciting. Also, Frank getting the hell out of the Mexican prison was a crappier version of Garth Ennis’ The Cell (check out The Punisher MAX: From First to Last, for that story). The Black Widow crossover was so pointless it may as well not have happened.Also, I’m not sold on Frank in LA - I’m not sure why the location is being emphasised for the character so much but it’s not jibing for me. Those last few pages too, when Frank goes to all that trouble for THAT, just felt stupid and out of character to me. Why is Frank so enamoured with LA all of a sudden - because he’s got himself a coyote?!I know Marvel have to legally claim otherwise but three of the four cast members of the latest Fantastic Four make a cameo in the final chapter. This issue got some attention when it came out because some people said Marvel was having Frank kill them, but that’s not true. They’re in a building near to an explosion but there’s no indication that they’re hurt in any way - and Frank’s definitely not responsible (the movie’s going to bomb without Frank planting any near the cast anyway!).Mitch Gerads and Carmen Carnero’s art isn’t bad, it just doesn’t stand out. Much like Edmondson’s script, the art is just there. It doesn’t make you pay attention, there’s no eye-catching style, it’s got this generic look to it, and it’s workmanlike more than anything. It’ll do and nothing else. Phil Noto’s artwork on the Black Widow issue was nice though.The Punisher, Volume 2: Border Crossing is a very poor follow up to an average first book. I wish Edmondson’s Punisher series was as good as Ennis’ or Jason Aaron’s but it’s instead very far away from those quality writers’ books.","2.0 out of 5 stars","February 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/ROXOTY6UIAQQC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0785154442#wasThisHelpful","ROXOTY6UIAQQC","A3I8FT707XKQAJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3I8FT707XKQAJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Streets of Laredo is a four-part Western-type story of The Punisher going to a small Texan town and raining righteous fury on the gun traffickers he finds there. Also included in this book are three one-shots (two drawn by Steve Dillon, yay!) that sees an injured Frank team up with Joan, an old friend from Welcome Back, Frank; Elektra and Punisher having the bloodiest courtship ever; and punching bag Detective Soap getting one more kick in the nards from (Garth Ennis and Steve Dillon)life. In short, this book is all kinds of awesome!I enjoyed the one-shots more than the main story, partly for the Dillon art, partly for the variety. Seeing a bedridden Frank Home-Alone the hell out of a quaint country cottage against a horde of murderous Russian gangsters was enormous fun, especially with soft-spoken Joan delicately helping Frank mow them down by feeding bullets into his gun!The Soap story… man, Ennis/Dillon love socking it to that guy, don’t they? Earlier in the series they had him (unknowingly) sleep with his mum and this time around they… I can’t, it’s too horrible to mention (and that last page is too funny to spoil in a review anyway)! Needless to say, Soap tells his comically unlucky life story and of course it only gets worse. Gotta love that dope!The Elektra team-up story was fun too, even though I’m not a fan of Tom Mandrake’s art. Elektra’s been taking out Frank’s mob targets before he has a chance to off them himself – a woman after his own heart! It’s a deeply gory tale with an unexpectedly romantic end.The main story, Streets of Laredo, is like the classic Western: small town in thrall to villainy, hero walks in and shoots up a storm/brings the justice, etc. Minor differences are the villain is a single mother and the hero, aside from Frank, is a gay Sheriff (some parts of Texas ain’t so backward after all), but otherwise it’s your standard Western and who doesn’t love one of those?The shootout is exciting, I liked the sheriff and the gun smuggling mum – I’m always surprised at how effortlessly Ennis introduces new characters and in the shortest amount of time endears them to the reader – and overall its terrific Punisher storytelling.The only critique I’d make is with Cam Kennedy’s art. Generally I like his work, particularly on Judge Dredd, but his goons – the villain’s lackeys – all look alike. There’s this one character design that has long, straw-like hair with an overbite and wearing a wifebeater, and I’d swear this guy got killed multiple times in the story – but it turns out this was a different guy each time! A little bit more diversity would have gone a long way.Otherwise, I can’t fault Ennis’ work on this volume. It’s a great recovery from the lacklustre Full Auto, and a real pleasure to read. The Punisher, Volume 5: Streets of Laredo is Ennis’ brand of fun, carnage-filled Punisher mayhem at its best!","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2Y557NDG7IS0L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0785110968#wasThisHelpful","R2Y557NDG7IS0L","A3I8FT707XKQAJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3I8FT707XKQAJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I’ve been re-reading a lot of books that I enjoyed years ago recently and it’s been very rewarding for the most part, rediscovering books I loved all over again. Unfortunately Sandman - a series I really liked the first time round - is not among them and it’s so disappointing! What I remember of Sandman was that the first two volumes weren’t that great (and that checks out) but that the series starts to take off in this third volume, Dream Country, and… it doesn’t. It’s basically stuck in the mud for the third time.Unlike the last two books which were lengthy narratives, Dream Country is a series of four thematically linked short stories with Dream and Death making cameos but not taking centre stage. I almost gave up this re-read after the first few pages where we see a woman getting raped. Wow, this was darker than I remembered! If I never see another rape in a comic, it’ll be too soon.That story is Calliope where a desperate author attempts to overcome writer’s block by taking the physical manifestation of Homer’s muse back to his house, locking her in a room, and raping her for years. Turns out rape is just what he needs because he becomes a terrific success - except he doesn’t realise that Calliope is Morpheus’ ex. And the Dream King has very recent unpleasant memories of being held against his will…I suppose it’s a noteworthy story for giving the reader more of Morpheus’ life story - he has a son, he had a partner - and it sets up one of the book’s two main themes: disguise/deception. But I felt the writer’s success was contrived and unconvincing and the story overall deeply repulsive. Not a good start at all and it may have coloured my overall perception of the book for the worse.The second story is a whimsical fable of talking cats, one of whom recounts the story of how they once ruled the world until the humans dreamed that they were the rulers and reversed the roles. It’s cute and underlines the series theme of the power of dreams, and this volume’s other major theme of power displacement, but it’s kinda forgettable. It’s also the first time we see Morpheus live up to his name, shape-shifting from his human-ish form into a Dream cat, showing that he is Dream for all beings, not just humans.The World Fantasy Award-winning A Midsummer Night’s Dream is the third and best story of the book. It’s 1593 and Will Shakespeare and his troupe of actors, Lord Strange’s Men, are in the provinces, about to perform Shakespeare’s Dream for the first time - and in front of a unique audience of faerie folk, guests of the Dream King himself.I’m quite surprised that this is the second story in the book where a writer has had their abilities gifted to them by an ethereal presence. It annoys me a bit that Neil Gaiman is, in a way, undercutting humanity’s achievements by saying this - it’s just so reductive! And, though I can appreciate the clever way that Gaiman basically retells the Dream during the performance of the Dream (with Dream in the audience), it still felt like a pretty flat story.But I am a huge fan of Charles Vess’ art and his Robin Goodfellow was wonderfully creepy (think a smaller Grinch-esque figure with a twisted mindset). And that scene between the Lady Titania (the real Faerie Queene) and Shakespeare’s son, Hamnet, was especially chilling, as she hints of a plan to abduct him to her realm. In real life, Hamnet would die three years later aged 11 and a few years after that Shakespeare would write Hamlet, but the suggestion that Titania stole him away to live amongst the faeriefolk is both charming and horrifying at once - a brilliant writerly flourish from Gaiman.The fourth and final story closes out the volume on the same miserable tone it opened with as Urania Blackwell aka DC superhero and Metamorpho-lookalike Element Girl sits alone in a flat, depressed and suicidal. Yup, this is the sad death of a minor superhero! Yeesh…Goth chick Death makes a cameo that lightens the mood a bit but otherwise this wasn’t that great a story either. Again it hits the themes of power transference and deception (she can change her appearance using different elements), but that unshakeable gloomy tone is hard to like. This came out in the early 90s and it’s clear we’re still feeling the after effects of Alan Moore’s Watchmen where all superheroes must be dark and gritty beyond belief. I’m just not into that.On the whole I wasn’t that impressed with Gaiman’s work in this book. Midsummer is the only story worth reading while the others range from horrible to miserable to lightweight. Charles Vess’ artwork is great and, though I didn’t love it, there’s nothing wrong with Kelley Jones, Colleen Doran and Malcolm Jones III’s work here. I almost want to stop re-reading the series now and preserve my fond memories of the later books - what if the rest of Sandman is as average as the first three volumes are? Eh, in this instance I’ll take reality over dreams - onwards!(By the way, if you like Vess’ art and faerie stories, check out Susanna Clarke’s The Ladies of Grace Adieu and Other Stories, illustrated by Vess with a corking collection of tales by Clarke!)","3.0 out of 5 stars","February 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R25A85KK7WY8DY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1401229352#wasThisHelpful","R25A85KK7WY8DY","A3I8FT707XKQAJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3I8FT707XKQAJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In the first book, we saw Shizuo give up his job as a salaryman (office worker) to pursue his dream of becoming a manga artist, despite being in his 40s and manga being an incredibly competitive field. The second book is more of the same. Really - read the first book? Then you’ve basically read the second one too as nearly the same things happen. Shizuo submits manga and it gets rejected. He bums around playing games and watching cartoons when he’s not creating manga or working at his fast food job.We learn a little bit more about him and his father’s fraught relationship, which stems from childhood, and Shizuo moves out and into his quiet and surly friend’s apartment. But really, that’s all that happens? That’s so disappointing! I was hoping SOMETHING would happen to Shizuo that’d advance his story a little. I mean, I guess it’s realistic in that someone who tries their hand at manga is going to have to go pay their dues long before they get to play the blues, but still - it’s not very interesting to read!Shizuo’s quiet and surly friend, Ichinosawa, gets more pages though I don’t really like him much as a character. He’s a bit like Shizuo being aimless and unsure of what he wants to do, though he’s 26 and could really do anything - he just needs a push. Instead he’s a part-time waiter at a hostess bar. Alright but he still seems very one-dimensional and boring to me.There’s some really heavy-handed imagery in one of Shizuo’s many pep-talk sequences as he once more mentions being middle-aged and failing - cut to sun setting! - but still clinging to his dreams regardless - cut to kid’s balloon flying off and Shizuo jumping up to catch it! Subtle, eh?Even the format of the book is similar to the first, ending with a short story about a female character. This time her life isn’t changed by a chance encounter with Shizuo, but it’s still a young-woman-in-trouble story. Ichinosawa’s sister tries her hand at prostitution, gets away with not sleeping with her johns for a while, gets caught and roughed up, then decides that maybe she ought to get a real job. Eh. It wasn’t bad and at least it was something as opposed to nothing for much of the preceding book!I still like the series premise so I’ll stick with it but this second book is a very poor follow-up to a fresh and interesting first volume.","2.0 out of 5 stars","February 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1E9I2REL0E33Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1421533871#wasThisHelpful","R1E9I2REL0E33Y","A3I8FT707XKQAJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3I8FT707XKQAJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Joe Sacco is the acclaimed, Eisner Award-winning cartoonist of Palestine, Safe Area Gorazde, and several noteworthy non-fictional comics on real world conflicts. More recently he released the extraordinary work The Great War, a 24-foot panoramic look at the first day of the Battle of the Somme. So it’s surprising - in a good way - to see that he’s really gone in the other direction for Bumf, Volume 1, subtitled I Buggered the Kaiser!The double splash page at the start pretty much sets the tone: a young boy gives a priest a blowjob while some guy gets shot in the head. Taste and subtlety are out the window for this relentless satire on… the Obama administration?It’s a satire on something and a lot of the issues touch on Obama’s America (who is portrayed throughout as Nixon) but there’s a lot of targets here that include Bush 2’s administration, the prominence of religion in politics, the increase of paranoia and fear in Western culture, and the unstoppable military industrial complex.That’s partly the problem of Bumf - Sacco is going all out but he’s targeting so many things that he lacks focus on any one thing. There’s that and tone. The first story looks to be set in WW1 and a deranged general decides to try a new strategy: get every soldier naked, give them massive erections by staring at a photo of his bum, and then charging towards the Germans en masse to bugger them all!Bizarre crude comedy then morphs into horror as we see the victims of a firebombing raid burning alive, and then we’re into critiques on religion, the surveillance state, drone attacks, and Guantanamo torture victims. Then later we switch from political commentary to a weird love story between two prisoners with bags over their heads, then we’re in space and…Sacco’s spraying bullets everywhere and only occasionally nailing a target. Torture has become disturbingly normalised, while drone attacks are a terrifying development in warfare, removing the human element entirely for the controllers making it easier to kill. The proliferation of digital media and the internet has led to a spate of hacks on personal information leading to a more paranoid contemporary mindset and, unfortunately, Obama wasn’t the major change everyone hoped he would be when he was elected (though I still think generally he’s been a force for good).The rest of it? It’s a rambling, uneven quasi-narrative that goes off on some very strange tangents more than once. Even Sacco becomes a character, “directing” the President in his speech after bombing a group of civilians from his bed. Stringing together a bunch of political cartoons and hoping for them to hang together isn’t the best approach to a book and it doesn’t really work here.Sacco’s art throughout is fantastic, as it always is, and the splash page showing the trench warfare of WW1 is a taste of his ambitious work in The Great War. That and the religious orgy are the standouts as the most accomplished pieces though all of the pages are drawn in very high quality. The art is definitely much better than the scattershot writing/story.Bumf is an interesting satirical comic that by turns amuses, horrifies and bores but doesn’t add up to much. It’s not wholly convincing as an indictment of Obama’s terms in office but Sacco’s righteous anger at… many things, is palpable. It’s worth a look for being such an unusual, edgy comic from a brilliant cartoonist, though it’s not among Sacco’s best work.","3.0 out of 5 stars","February 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RLUIHML8JPIAO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1606997483#wasThisHelpful","RLUIHML8JPIAO","A3I8FT707XKQAJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3I8FT707XKQAJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I realised a couple things after reading just a few pages of this book: 1) I’d read the first story before in Jaime Hernandez’s God and Science: Return of the Ti-Girls book, and 2) of all the Hernandez brothers, Gilbert is the only one whose stories I really enjoy. Jaime’s art is fine but his writing and Mario’s are beyond boring. God and Science? I gave up on that one after just 6 pages! In fact, I don’t think I’ve finished a single Jaime book and only got through ones with his name on because of his Gilbert’s work tacked on.I powered through Love and Rockets: New Stories #1 as I paid for a copy (it was on sale for peanuts) and wanted to get my money’s worth. Jaime’s Ti-Girls story, that’s been chopped up and takes up about half the book, is a generic superhero story starring older, heavier women than the usual stock female superheroes. That’s about all I’ll say it does differently, otherwise it’s your average superhero story. Villain threatens Earth, heroes fight villain, world is saved. It’s honestly that rote, except Jaime writes it like an older-style superhero comic so there’s lots and lots of badly written caption boxes to torture the reader with.After 26 excruciatingly dull pages we get to the first of Gilbert’s comics and it’s a simple one-pager of Sunday paper funnies but it’s instantly more entertaining than the preceding chapter of crap. Then we’re onto a short story by Gilbert and immediately I recognised it as part of Julio’s Day, Gilbert’s wonderful book from a couple years ago. It’s a fine comic but I’ve already read it so it was disappointing to see it here instead of something different (later on another section from Julio’s Day crops up).To be totally fair to Jaime, Gilbert’s other offerings aren’t much better either. The space story of two crooners was stupid, and his kangaroo gambler/penis story was such a throwaway, I’m not sure why it was even printed except for filling up space. Mario Hernandez’s satirical story of native Americans was much too overwritten and uninteresting, while Gilbert’s final offering was simply nonsense. The book closes out with yet another part of the maddeningly tedious Ti-Girls story from Jaime.What a let-down! I usually turn to the Hernandez brothers - well, Gilbert at least - for some quality comics and Love and Rockets: New Stories #1 was unfortunately anything but! The Julio’s Day sections were good but I’d already read them. The rest? I wish I hadn’t bothered.Dammit, I bought three other L&R: New Stories books in the sale at the same time!

"Wow, I didn’t think it was possible but Full Auto is the first Garth Ennis/Punisher book that I didn’t love. That’s not to say it’s bad but a couple of the stories here are just too blah for me to say it was good. Plus Steve Dillon disappears for the last three issues, replaced by Tom Mandrake. Ennis Punisher without Dillon just doesn’t feel right.The three part Brotherhood storyline was the best one here. Even Frank Castle has rules and not killing cops is one of them. So when he’s faced with two crooked detectives, he decides to indirectly screw up their corrupt plans than shoot them in the face. One of them has a weakness for cards and is so heavily in debt to the mob that he’s swiping parcels of drugs from crime scenes to reduce his debt; meanwhile his partner is an alcoholic wifebeater.Once again it’s amazing how Ennis puts Frank in the background (who hangs about menacingly and swoops in to periodically mete out death), introduces two new characters and still manages to fully engage the reader’s attention. I never wanted to see more of Frank than we do in the story because I wanted to see how the two detectives’ fates played out. And though it’s compelling, it’s also grim reading, especially the way Ennis/Dillon unflinchingly show the drunk beating his wife to bring home the brutality of domestic violence and how pathetic the detective is for stooping so low.The one-shot story of a mob guy fascinated with the search for a giant squid in the New York harbour was one of Ennis’ jokey Punisher stories but this one was very average. It’s not very funny and you can see the ending coming a mile off.Steve Dillon steps aside for Tom Mandrake who illustrates Ennis’ tale of a sicko living in the underground tunnels of New York, hiring homeless people to abduct their own for his bizarre plan. This is the low point. The story’s not very interesting, the villain’s motives are stupid (though they kinda make sense in Ennis’ twisted way), and Frank is stuck with a temporary sidekick who acts as a tedious mouthpiece for every critic of The Punisher. The story drags on for three issues and was totally boring. I’m almost glad Dillon didn’t illustrate this as it would’ve been even more disappointing.Garth Ennis is THE greatest Punisher writer and, while this one is worth checking out for the Dillon-drawn stories, I’d recommend reading any other Punisher book with Ennis’ name on instead. Here it is if you’re wondering: the worst Punisher volume Garth Ennis ever produced (which is still better than many other writers’ efforts on the character) - Full Auto!","3.0 out of 5 stars","February 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1QKG9HCZJVPR1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0785111492#wasThisHelpful","R1QKG9HCZJVPR1","A3I8FT707XKQAJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3I8FT707XKQAJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"One of the most interesting and best comics writers, Grant Morrison, has produced a chronicle of comics from their inception in the late 30s to the present day, along the way talking about superheroes and their effect on our culture as well as providing a look into his own turbulent life from quiet teen to superstar writer. ""Supergods"" is throughout a fascinating look at this wondrous creation, the superhero.For me, a huge fan of comics and superhero comics, the book was great fun to look at the inauspicious beginnings of the genre, the creators Joe Shuster and Jerry Siegel and Bob Kane and the oft forgotten Bill Finger, through its various incarnations through the years. Morrison goes through the book chronologically and devotes the first chapter to an extensive look at the front covers of ""Action Comics #1"" and ""Detective Comics #27"", the first appearances of Superman and Batman respectively, setting the tone of the book as an in-depth look at Morrison's two favourite characters in comics.He divides the evolution of comics into different ""ages"" from the Golden Age, Silver Age, Dark Age, and Renaissance Age (which we're currently in), and I won't go into detail as to every age but suffice it to say for those who believe Morrison wasn't detailed enough, I found him more than adequately explaining the relevant heroes and writers of the time in the context of the era and its effect down the line on future writers, innovators and characters.Morrison could quite easily have written a memoir of his own life in this book but chooses to occasionally throw in tidbits of his autobiography amidst the intricate pontificating upon superheroes. We find out about his modest childhood and his journey into comics through endless writing and drawing and sheer persistence before landing a job with 2000AD and from there to DC's ""Animal Man"". There are some gossipy bits thrown in like an anecdote of Glenn Fabry biting Karen Berger's ass during a party welcoming the British Invasion of writers and artists to America, as well as a glimpse into why Morrison's relationship with Marvel soured following the dissolution of ""New X-Men"" (it also might explain why Marvel didn't allow Morrison to use any of the covers of their comics for reproduction in this book, unlike DC who did) though Morrison's breakup with protégé Mark Millar is ignored (unlike in the documentary about Morrison ""Talking with Gods"" where he says if he was in a car and saw Millar on the street, he'd change course and accelerate).Then there's the vast wealth of information scattered throughout the text like a shotgun that fires genius like buckshot onto the blank page. Morrison stayed up writing for 50 hours straight before ransacking his teenage dream diaries to get into the mindset and create the nightmarish imagery to write ""Arkham Asylum"", a book he wrote in 1 month. He gave to Neil Gaiman a book with a story called ""The New Mother"" by Lucy Lane Clifford that set him onto the path of creating ""Coraline"". Jim Lee is a Princeton Physics graduate. He also provides an explanation for Warren Ellis' series ""Planetary"" which I'd read recently, baffled - it's an abstract reckoning between ""good"" imagination and ""bad"" imagination. He also explains the even more baffling ""Final Crisis"" book he wrote a few years ago - it was a story of a bad story devouring a good one. Who knew?One of the best chapters in the book is ""Hollywood Smells Blood"" which goes into great detail about Batman's on-screen adaptations which for me began with the Adam West TV show but Morrison goes back to 1943 when Batman had his own TV serial. This part of the book was utter hilarity and showed Morrison's strengths as a comedic writer in the description of these early serials. One of my favourite passages describing Robert Lowery's Batman of 1943: ""This wrinkled costume he wore would be unable to stop a lit cigarette let alone a slug from a .45. With his pitiful fighting skills, which relied on clumsy haymaker punches and off-balance lunges, Lowery's Batman could expect a crime-fighting life span of three weeks, with a career ending abruptly the moment any half-trained yellow belt tae kwon do novice punched him in the head."" (p.333)And his teardown of Joel Schumacher's Batman films is equally hilarious.Morrison occasionally lost me such as when he described in painstaking detail his journey to Alpha Centauri where he saw beings of another dimension and spoke with what we call Gods. He really does believe this happened and I totally respect him for it, but I feel the story loses some of its impact when he begins it by telling you he swallowed a ton of hash before the aliens stepped from the walls. Some might also criticise his views on comics such as his excellent interpretation of Alan Moore's ""Watchmen"" which he does not hold in the same high regard as many of his peers do - he felt it was too self-referential and knowing.As long as this review's been, I haven't tapped the surface of the content of this book. I'll just say that any comics fan would love this book as it's written by one comics fan for others. It's full of knowledge and views on comics that are well worth reading, it feels like you're eavesdropping on the most interesting conversationalist you'll ever meet. And his writing style too is of such shockingly high quality, you'll be astonished of his vocabulary and descriptive abilities.I was glad also to know that my favourite of Morrison's books - ""All Star Superman"" - is also his favourite and his anecdote of meeting the real-life Superman is also included here. He finishes the book with a powerfully inspiring message of hope and optimism that I dare anyone to feel cynical about, it's so purely expressed and beautiful. So I'll end it here, urging you the reader to pick up this book and see the superhero through Grant Morrison's eyes.In Morrison's own words that end this book ""There's only one way to find out what happens next...""","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RWEJUAZQ5J13S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0099546671#wasThisHelpful","RWEJUAZQ5J13S","A3I8FT707XKQAJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3I8FT707XKQAJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"James Bond. George Smiley. Jason Bourne. Edward Zero? Nuh-uh. Although Ales Kot really wishes it were so, his spy/secret agent “character”, Zero, is as archetypical as they get - a bland, yes I’ll make the obvious pun, zero who never feels vaguely real or interesting. But he’s the “star” of this series so settle in for some generic spy stories in this first volume, An Emergency.The subtitle is a good indicator of what’s wrong with this book. Kot thinks that by throwing in mindless action, showing car chases and gunfights and sex, all without context, that the reader will be enraptured with what they’re reading. It’s An Emergency, Kot says, willing the potential drama those words have as if that were enough - and it’s not.Zero is telling his life story to a kid assassin pointing a gun at his head. The kid is sent from his old taskmasters, The Agency (oh, the imagination that must’ve gone into dreaming up that name!), who trained him up from a child into an adult killing machine. Um - why is the kid standing there waiting politely for Zero to tell his numerous boring stories? Why doesn’t he just pull the trigger and be done with the assignment - or, as we find out, why doesn’t the adult assassin, who accompanies all the kid assassins, do it for him if the kid can’t pull the trigger? Contrived much?Zero’s stories are the most generic spy stories ever. He goes to Israel to kill some dude and steal some tech. He goes to Belfast to kill a former IRA terrorist. He goes to Asia to kill a wealthy enemy target. He goes to South America to kill a former spook with secrets. It’s always the same: Zero goes somewhere exotic and fights a bunch of people, killing them. How rote can you get?Kot tries to add variety to his one-note stories by having a different artist draw a different issue but it doesn’t make them any better to read. The art however is the only positive thing I can say about this book. One of my favourite new artists, Tradd Moore, draws the IRA issue and it looks awesome. Check out his work on Luther Strode and All-New Ghost Rider for some high quality comics.Morgan Jeske’s art in the South American escapade was noteworthy for carrying the entire issue. It’s almost entirely wordless with Zero and the target fighting and then driving through a densely populated urban environment at speed, and Jeske pulls off the sequences with style, showing a strong understanding of good action.But really I didn’t mind any of the artists in this book, all of whom put in some great pages - Michael Walsh, Mateus Santolouco, and Will Tempest, who round out the artist roster for this first volume. And Jordie Bellaire’s colours are perfect as usual. The background panels in the Asian issue were coloured alternately yellow and red which for some reason I can’t fathom made it look so eye-catching and exciting - but then that’s why she’s the award-winning colourist and not me!Kot dedicates the IRA issue to Garth Ennis, partly I’m sure because Ennis is from Northern Ireland, but probably because Kot is a fan, much like I am. There’s even a nod to the second volume of Preacher where Jesse Custer got locked up in a box and thrown to the bottom of a lake, as a kid - the exact same thing happens to Zero. Unfortunately, Kot’s writing is nowhere near Ennis’ standard.There is no story to Zero Volume 1; it’s an episodic, unconnected blur of stories plucked from different points in Zero’s life without rhyme or reason. Worse, they’re all dull, cliche-ridden pap. The art might be good but it’s not reason enough to pick up this book. I read this tedious comic and felt as emotionless afterwards as Zero is trained up to be.","2.0 out of 5 stars","February 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ROZEBVHEZ36S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=160706863X#wasThisHelpful","R2ROZEBVHEZ36S","A3I8FT707XKQAJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3I8FT707XKQAJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"But Mousie, thou are no thy-lane,In proving foresight may be vain:The best laid schemes o' Mice an' Men,Gang aft agley,An' lea'e us nought but grief an' pain,For promis'd joy!To a Mouse - A Poem by Robert BurnsSet in Depression-era America, Of Mice and Men follows two bindle-stiffs, George and Lennie, on their way to their next job working as ranch hands on a California farm. They’re the best of friends but Lennie, a simple-minded giant with enormous strength, is constantly, and unintentionally, getting into trouble, and George is constantly helping them get away. But how long can George protect his friend?I haven’t read many novels that I could say hand on heart were perfect but Of Mice and Men is definitely one of them. John Steinbeck was an early 20th century novelist whose best work looked at the social and economic problems brought about by the Wall Street Crash in his home state of California as explored in the epics East of Eden and The Grapes of Wrath and on smaller canvases like Of Mice and Men and Cannery Row. He’s also a writer who has aged remarkably well. Re-reading Of Mice and Men today, the prose is still fresh, the story fast-moving (The New York Times’ cover blurb accurately describes it as a “thriller” - you will fly through this book, it’s so damn gripping!), and the characters and time as clear and real today as they’ve ever been.But though it’s not the most complex book ever, the book’s strength lies in a deceptive simplicity. Basic writing techniques like foreshadowing and repetition are used, but used well and Steinbeck shows how these ordinary narrative techniques can be deployed to devastating effect when applied by a master.For example, we can see Lennie’s future problems in the mice he accidentally kills because he pets them too hard. Later on, it’s a puppy that he doesn’t mean to kill, and earlier George mentions a woman’s dress he clung to because he liked stroking the fabric and wouldn’t let go when she started screaming at him to stop.Once Curley’s wife is introduced at the farm, and George pointedly tells Lennie to keep away from her, you can tell what’s going to happen. You can also see Lennie’s fate mirrored in Candy, an elderly crippled swamper, and his old dog, and what George will have to do to Lennie.The repetition of closing the story with the same location and the same speech from George is also extremely powerful. It’s essentially the same scene but something terrible has happened in between, lending new weight to George’s words, even though he’s just repeating what he told Lennie before in happier times.For being a relatively short book at around 120 pages, the book manages to memorably touch on a number of themes like loneliness, thwarted dreams, and social issues. Crooks, the black stable hand, talks of being miserable because he’s excluded from the other men for being black, and he just wants a friend. Curley’s wife is also isolated. She’s the only woman on the farm and nobody will talk to her because she’s married and her husband is the boss’s son. She wants someone to talk to and she’s made all the more bitter for being shied away from.She also talks of wanting to make it in show business but having that dream taken away for rushing into marriage with a man she doesn’t love. George and Lennie also dream of owning their own farm and being their own bosses someday, but we know none of these dreams will ever be realised.The main reason why Of Mice and Men is rightly a classic of world literature is the beautiful friendship between George and Lennie. There’s real love between the two as George looks after Lennie like a father will a son, and even when he screws up - and, sadly, Lennie does this a lot because he’s got the mind of a child - George still stands by and never leaves him. It adds to the tragedy of that final scene when George knows what he has to do to Lennie and that it has to be him that does it.And what a final scene. I remember crying like a baby the first time I read it and I cried again re-reading it today. It’s beyond sad, especially once Lennie asks George to tell him of their dream, the farm they’ll own one day and live happily ever after on. Oh. I’ve read few scenes quite so moving and heartbreaking as that in all of literature.Steinbeck also captures the California of the day so eloquently in his prose. I’m sure it helped that he actually lived the life of a bindle-stiff, just like he lived among the migrant workers while he was researching The Grapes of Wrath, because that world and existence is so tangible in this book.It’s this heady mixture of evocative prose and raw storytelling that made me a fan of Steinbeck’s for life - I think I’ve read nearly everything the man wrote at this point (except for that odd King Arthur book right at the end of his life - what was that all about!?).Of Mice and Men by John Steinbeck - there’s nothing quite like it.

"Kyle Barnes is an outcast exorcist. He exorcises demons - but he can’t exorcise his own personal demons! Ironyyyyyyy! In this book we’ll meet a kindly reverend who’ll team up with Kyle to rid West Virginia of as many possessed people (which turns out to be quite a few!) as they can in between moping sessions. Settle in, folks, this is volume one of probably several dozen if his other titles Invincible and The Walking Dead are anything to go by, because Kirkman’s more interested in setting up long-running franchises than telling tightly plotted stories, especially when he can sell these comics’ pitches to TV execs!It sounds like I didn’t like Outcast Volume 1, and I didn’t love it, but it wasn’t that bad. Southern Gothic is a great subgenre that Kirkman nails and, while he’s not one of the best comics writers out there, he does know how to put together a comic. His years of experience in the industry shows and makes this book a smooth read.The story switches from Kyle and his gloomy life to “possession of the week” where he and the reverend play dual Constantines, exorcising demons. This approach works fine for a single volume - but over who knows how many books? It’s gonna get very formulaic, real quick. For this one though, there’s enough variety to keep it from being a boring read.Unlike The Walking Dead, Outcast is a fully-coloured comic and Elizabeth Breitweiser’s work wonderfully complements Paul Azaceta’s fine art in this volume. There are some lovely scenic shots of rural West Virginia and some of the horror panels of a leering possessed person were creepy. It didn’t hurt that Azaceta’s style reminded me of David Aja’s work on Hawkeye.So while the art team produce great pages, Kirkman’s script is the only major stumbling block to this series. The thing with enormously successful writers - comics or otherwise - is that once they reach a certain level, they are untouchable. No editor can tell them to cut pages or tighten up a plotline - said writer can eschew any and all advice and do whatever the hell they like. Which is what Kirkman does here. And there’s a lot of bloat in this book.From the numerous flashback sequences of Kyle remembering his abusive childhood where his possessed mother beat him, to the numerous scenes where he’s sat around his house sulking, to repeated scenes of the reverend trying to get Kyle to use his special exorcist powers (his touch burns the possessed while forcing the demons out), I just kept wishing it had less repetition to it. There’s too much setup and not enough story.And, like a lot of Kirkman’s stories, Outcast’s is super, super miserable! Kyle’s depressed, his wife left with his daughter and won’t let him talk to her, everyone thinks he beat them which is why they left, and he also put his mother into a vegetative state! Meanwhile the reverend’s son won’t speak to him for some reason leading to many panels where characters are holding their head in their hands. Families are breaking up, people are punching other people, there’s plenty of gore. It’s so humourless and dark that it’s a very grim read.At least with The Walking Dead there was excitement and tension to balance out the mopiness. Here, we’re not given much of a story and Kirkman really lays the misery on thickly. And, while the characters do seem real, they just aren’t interesting. I get that Kyle’s had a difficult life but I really don’t care - these aren’t characters you can feel close to.Outcast’s horror is cliched Hollywood pap. Jump scares abound and the corny possessed routine plays out with no originality. Ever seen The Exorcist or any of its many ripoffs where a possessed person has contorted their body, spat blood and/or vomit at someone while swearing and laughing, and a priest or holy person has stood over them splashing holy water and waving a cross/rosary combo in their face? Get ready to see it again, many times in this book alone! And what about that creepy old guy with the weird eyes? Oh it’s Satan. Zzz....What’s weird is that Kirkman actually BELIEVES demon possession is real. In the afterword to the first issue he writes:“The scariest things are REAL. Ever seen… The Exorcist? … Very real, very scary. There is evidence that supports the possibility that demonic possession is very much real.”...right. Sure it is, Kirkman.The first volume of Outcast isn’t bad. Kyle’s not the most compelling protagonist but the story, while scattered, does hold the attention, and the art is pretty good too. But the formula of miseryguts main character exorcising yet another possessed person playing out in volume after volume? It’s fine for one book but I’m not sure this setup is enough to sustain readers’ attention over the long run.One thing’s for sure: expect the Outcast TV show to be headed our way very soon!","3.0 out of 5 stars","February 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1DC91P345ETWB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1632150530#wasThisHelpful","R1DC91P345ETWB","A3I8FT707XKQAJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3I8FT707XKQAJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Matt Fraction and Chip Zdarsky’s Sex Criminals has arguably the most unusual and varied array of readers’ letters at the back of each issue. All are sex-related letters of embarrassing and funny stories, questions, jokes, and so on.Just the Tips collects a number of these into one hardcover coffee table book. It’s all here from True Tales of Finding Porn to True Tales of First Times, Ask The Sexperts, and Sex Tips, including some new material like the Fraction/Zdarsky written/drawn Hot Positions, Movie Reviews of the movies featured in the comic’s sex shop, Cumworld, like Hard-On Fink, Pick Up Lines and Dirty Talk.Some are amusing, some fall flat, and more than a few are just meh. As you’d expect from a book made up of letters, the book is mostly text with a few line drawings thrown in every now and then. It’s nicely laid out though. It’s also not at all necessary to read this to understand the main series comics - this is instead an oddball spinoff.I’m a huge Sex Criminals fan but Just the Tips is a very one-note kind of book that’s fine for picking up for a few pages while on the loo, but not that great to read like you would a normal book.

"I have been up and down the California coastline several times, so I'm no stranger to the treasures found along the way. A problem arises when trying to remember exactly where some of the more wonderful places are located.I had my hopes on a guide which could remind me of the types of coastline I would encounter. There are certain spots I greatly enjoy, and if only this guide had more coastal photos, it would be more useful. It does have a few photos, but I could have envisioned the crowded southern California beach without a photo.One thing this guide does well is list amenities, and nearby physical attractions for each area. Plenty of detailed information is available to make travel easier.It doesn't do what I wanted it to do for me, so I simply don't like it.","2.0 out of 5 stars","October 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RMRKL5VADHAWT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1743607040#wasThisHelpful","RMRKL5VADHAWT","A3VI2VETB90ZG5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3VI2VETB90ZG5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This binder might be too much for some, but for anyone who can make good use its upright files slots, huge three ring binder, and covered outer pocket, this self-contained unit might be a good choice.It almost helps to run this through its paces beforehand, just to know hoe to make the most of it. The binder section slip out of its spot to act as a writing surface, so it has some flexibility.The binder is very stylish looking, and everything zips, seals, or clips shut into an organizational accessory that is too large for the bookbag, but being equipped with its own carry strap, acts as one more item to carry around. It's actually rather nice keeping it seperate from the books, but you need to not mind carrying an extra item over your shoulders to like this binder.The binder is made from quality materials, and is well constructed. It seems a bit pricey for a binder, but again, if you can make use of all the available compartments, this is an impressive way to go.

"The goji berry experience is new to me, so I have neither testimony for their benefits, nor do I know of recipes which can make the goji berry really stand out. I can share my impression of the superfruit, having eaten these both plain, and cooked into my oatmeal.Goji berries are not gross, but they are not mouthwateringly yummy, either. Straight out of the bag, these are rather mealy berries, with a texture similar to that of a dehydrated strawberry as found in some breakfast cereals, but nowhere nearly as sweet. Perhaps, I could acquire a taste for them over time, otherwise, I am willing to eat them for their fiber, and high Vitamin A content.I like to start my day with my whole, five-minute boil oatmeal, and I take advantage of having goji berries to sprinkle in, just to make it more interesting. I throw them in for the final two minutes of bubbling down, to allow the berries to hydrate a bit. These are decent in oatmeal, though still with a foreign, unfamiliar flavor. Their color fades a tad, and the flavor is subtle.The quality of the product is satisfactory. My berries came in a bag, within another bag. If I open the outer bag, I can smell the berries within their sealed inner bag. The second bag could be to help maintain freshness, though since these are dry berries, The second bag could be used to contain the scent.I would recommend this product for those seeking more options for their organic pantry. I find them edible, though I'm accustomed to my domestic fruits, so I cannot really see myself ordering more of them. I prefer delicious berries, over peculiar-tasting berries of Chinese origins. With eight servings per bag, I get only a potion of the benefits as listed, because I'm not about to eat one-eighth of a bag in one sitting, nor dump the same quantity into a single bowl of oatmeal. The product quality is excellent, but goji berries are just not my thing.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2BD0MIE1S7J5E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00W8AZPWI#wasThisHelpful","R2BD0MIE1S7J5E","A3VI2VETB90ZG5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3VI2VETB90ZG5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love having both a CD player, and an AM/FM tuner in such a compact unit. The modest features include an audio line in, a Bose Link connection, and an external antenna port. The power cord acts as an antenna, but the power cord reception works fine for my needs.At moderate listening levels, the audio quality sounds just as good as my Denon 987 home theater receiver, only it runs much cooler. I can play back sources with perfect reception, or CDs, at higher levels, and the sonic quality is still magnificent. I love this unit. I also appreciate not having to power on an entirely different unit just to play a CD, as I would with my receiver.The panel display is easy to understand at a glance, with its clear clock reading, active alarms, and RDS information. The remote is simple, though it has no illumination, the controls are relatively basic; volume, tuner, presets, alarms, source. Everything is laid out in a sensible manner.The top of the unit is equipped with touch-sensitivity, and it makes it quite easy to snooze the alarm, or toggle the radio on or off. It's quite convenient when in dark surroundings.The unit is sturdily built. It's not too heavy, but it certainly feels like a solid unit, in regards to manufacture. It is an attractive design, and it looks great on my nightstand.With its incredibly rich, full sound, and its sleek, compact design, the Bose Wave Music System IV is not only a wonderful alarm clock, but also an amazing music playing machine.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1FA84NI13SB0P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011IH6MBO#wasThisHelpful","R1FA84NI13SB0P","A3VI2VETB90ZG5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3VI2VETB90ZG5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"With Barilla Pronto Pasta, the dry pasta gets covered in a saucepan with three cups of cold water, and then crank it up to the highest heat the pan will tolerate, until able to stabilize a soft boil, and occasionally stir for ten minutes, the time my cooking also took, allowing most all of the water to have been absorbed. Finally, simmer in the sauce to consistency.Everything went as directed cooking this pasta, using a garlic and olive oil jar sauce, with sliced black olive, and garnished with some bagged grocery store meatballs. The noodles are of consistent texture, rather thin as egg noodle, and somewhat flavorless.These Rotini are capable of making a decent dish of pasta. I would most recommend Barilla Pronto Pasta for people who prefer a soft noodle. People who prefer one skillet, no-drain cooking, may be happy with it, too.I will likely continue to make use of my traditional Barilla seven to nine minute, boil then drain pastas, for they can easily be prepared with more bite, and I consider them heartier, more flavorful noodles.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQG40O1G4OUPA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00S7NA4XU#wasThisHelpful","RQG40O1G4OUPA","A3VI2VETB90ZG5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3VI2VETB90ZG5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a decent multitool, especially for anyone who often relies upon pliers. The pliers have a narrowing, trapezoidal beak with a square bite.In order to use anything this tool offers, the pliers must be deployed. The remaining tools are stored in the handle, arranged by alternating lengths for access for the fingernail groove to pull each tool out; for the shorter tools, especially the phillips-head driver, it's easier to pull the entire bunch out, and then close the unwanted tools afterward.This multitool appears to be well constructed. The riveted pin that holds the tool lock levers in place seems a tad thin.

Rather than a using a panel of physical buttons, every control, other than the main brew button, is accessible through the intuitive, touchscreen LED display; cup size, coffee strength, cocoa (or I suppose any other non-filtered brew) - it's all so easy to do, I probably could have done without reading the instructions, though I always do so as not to miss out on anything. It's just an awesome system.There is a carafe available as an option. I have yet to see carafe-sized pods for sale, but my frind has seen them.I can't detract from the product rating simply because coffee pods are more expensive than coffee for filtered pods, but there are great deals in club stores for eighty-pod packs or thereabouts, and the convenience of single cup brewing is absolutely justifiable, with an added benefit for myself that I moderate my coffee consumption much better when I don't feel as if I'm wasting already brewed coffee that I feel somewhat obligated to drink.The brewer comes with a small variety of starter pods, one of which is the Swiss Miss Cocoa. All of them are fantastic, and I have already bought some dark blends that I like, such as Green Mountain Dark Magic, and McCafe French Roast. I love them.A water filter kit is included, though I use water that is filtered at the refrigerator level, so far. Also a descaling solution is included for the first treatment.When I bought my Nespresso mahine, I saw many reviews comparing its noise level to the more silent Keurig. The Keurig is exceptionally quiet in comparison, but they are two completely different things, both of which are welcome in my kitchen. I'll add that I'll be using my Keurig far more than my Nespresso, for the fact that it's not only awesome, but also that the pods are so readily available.I believe that anyone who drinks coffee woulf love the K250 as much as I do. It is wonderful, and I will continue to use it regularly. This machine is also an excellent small appliance for persons who like to entertain, or who have frequent guests, and would like to provide a variety of drink options from among the numerous available choices.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2QVI25JQF4YCS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WWEAXPY#wasThisHelpful","R2QVI25JQF4YCS","A3VI2VETB90ZG5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3VI2VETB90ZG5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Though it looks cool in the picture, the tool you get certainly isn't as cool as you would expect it to be.It has a locking knife and a locking sawblade. Both are sharp, and of decent quality, but you really need to trust the cheap, plastic housing in order to feel safe using either.The housing is bulky. The LED light protrudes from the side excessively; on top of that, mine doesn't even light. There was no battery in the packaging, and there are no instructions on opening the light for battery replacement.I like the small tweezers. Unfortunately, I have tweezers, but no magnifying glass to make sure use of them, unlike my Swiss Army knife, which features both.I love the signal mirror, a true survival tool. The flint is a great feature too.It has a small compass on an emergency string that clips onto the body of the tool.The knife sharpener is a unique feature compared to either my Swiss Army or my Leatherman tools, and can be used with any v-cut blade.Finally, its high-pitched whistle may come in handy for catching attention from afar.So, my Smith's tool has a few cool features, yet a few drawbacks as well. If you don't mind the bulk, and find any combination of features indispensible, then this is a decent blade.I'm not terribly excited with it, but it is lighter than many tools, making it a good tool to throw into my car for an emergency. It is not as likely to be put to use as much as either of my other multi tools.","2.0 out of 5 stars","June 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R26RNLB4260UP0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VTO5FLK#wasThisHelpful","R26RNLB4260UP0","A3VI2VETB90ZG5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3VI2VETB90ZG5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a useful wheel chock, in that it is lighter than a block of wood, and it also offers a docking slot into which to settle a post.The docking pit will accommodate a wheel or post up to 2 1/2 inches by 3 inches.The form has thick walls, and is sturdy.

"The stainless steel clippers are awesome; the jaws open less than my cheap drugstore clippers, but the rigidity of the tool, along with its razor sharp bite, make the Zwilling J.A. Henckels a fine nail clipper.Its nail clipper housing seems cumbersome to deal with, filling up as fast as it does, and having nails wedged between the inner meeting of the clipper halves. The housing slides straight off, which is my preference while clipping my nails outside as I do.The clipper housing features a thin, smoothing emery board along one of its sides, though with its curvature, it would be better with one on the other side as well. It feels strange when swithing hands using the same side.This is an awesome set of clippers, though I would be equally as happy with the thickly constructed, stainless steel, logo clippers without its plastic sleeve. I would opt for a less costly clippers-only version if it would save me a few dollars.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1RZXNYCJ494P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002MGYDGW#wasThisHelpful","R1RZXNYCJ494P","A3VI2VETB90ZG5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3VI2VETB90ZG5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I am very surprised at what a nice phone this is.  I saw that it has a super capacity 6250 mAh battery so I did some research about it and was really curious about it.  For $145 I ordered it.  It took a little over 2 weeks delivery, it ships from Singapore.  It is well worth the wait.  The build quality is excellent.  It is a bit heavier than most because of the battery, but it is not uncomfortable to hold.  The screen is beautiful, clear and sharp.  It took no time at all to set up.  It is fast with no lag at all.  I have been using it for 4 days and still haven'the had to charge it.  It came charged half way and it still has 41% of battery left.  Unbelieveable!!  It is just an excellent phone, I am very pleased with it.  You get so much for very little money.  It even comes with a very nice silicone case installed!  I think it is as good, if not better than my Nexus 6. I have owned many Samsung and LG and Nexus high end phones over the years and this Homtom HD 5.5"" is right up there with them!!

"I have owned a variety of tablets over the last few years and I always gravitate to Samsung.  This new Galaxy Tab S2 is the best of all.  I love everything about it.  I love the 8"" size.  The screen is brilliant and clear.  It is so light and thin.  I love the 4:3 aspect ratio.  The sound is excellent, clear and relatively loud.  It is fast and smooth.  Very easy to set up and use.  The battery life could be better, but it lasts a day or 2 for what I use the tablet for.  I highly recommend this fantastic tablet.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3KZHIEGP7I152/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010OTFZBU#wasThisHelpful","R3KZHIEGP7I152","A2SR7S6ZJJDGNB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2SR7S6ZJJDGNB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I ordered the Nexus 6 when Amazon offered it at half price.  There is no way I could afford the original price of $600!  But at $360 I jumped at it.  I was looking for a large 6"" phone and this fits the bill.  It is a pretty nice phone.  I do miss a notification light, vibration as it turns on and it is slippery in the hand, minor things that I can do without.  The screen is beautiful, bright and clear, the sound is fantastic, loud and not tinny as most phones are.  It is pure Google Android which I like.  Very easy to operate.  The battery life could be a bit better, but I do get a full day of heavy use.  All in all a nice phone.  Nothing extraordinary but a nice phone.  Glad I bought it for the much lower cost.

"I bought Emmy's to use on spots where our little dog has urinated on various spots.  I have bought many other brands that did nothing.  After reading the reviews on Amazon I decided to try it and it really does work.  It has totally removed the smell and she doesn't go to the spots and smell anymore.  She hasn't gone in the room since I've used the spray.  It is quite expensive but it is worth every penny since it works.

This is VERY quiet.  All I hear now are the rollers sliding along the tracks.Regarding the installation - many of the reviews on this unit mention that the instructions are a bit lacking.. I don't think they were too bad.  The first unit took me just under three hours to install.  The second and third units took about an hour each.  I used my existing wiring to my wall control panels (just two wires per control panel), but re-wired the safety sensors from scratch as my sensor wiring was very old.These do not use the manual stop sensors like the older units did (where the carriage hits a stop sensor spring for up/down) - instead, you initially program what open and closed is and the unit remembers these locations and knows where to stop.  This is a great feature.  Everything was very easy to program.  Also, the included remote controls come paired to the units right out of the box.I also purchased the MyQ Internet Gateway, which is a great product to compliment these openers.  This must be purchased separately.Overall, I'm very impressed with these - I'm surprised they can put out such a nice product at such a low cost.  A great upgrade from my 20+ year old screw-drive units.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1QAU2WJM2BB02/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00APL6Q0W#wasThisHelpful","R1QAU2WJM2BB02","A2LFWJ8X817QGX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2LFWJ8X817QGX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I've owned a couple of massage chairs in the past, in the range of $1500-$2500.  The Inada is in a completely different world than those chairs.You know that feeling of such great relaxation and euphoria that you get when you get off of the massage table after an hour long massage (with a masseuse)?  The Inada Dreamwave is as close as you'll get to that feeling from a chair.  I called around looking for a local store which had one on display that I could test out, but ended up being put on hold or getting answering machines from my local back stores.  After days of research and reading countless reviews, I decided to take the plunge and buy one without a test drive.I've only owned this for a few days so far, but have spent a lot of time in it.  I've read some reviews which say the rollers aren't intense enough.  I like a tough massage - keep in mind that you can use the back-3D function to push out the back area which helps with the intensity.Yes, it is expensive, but if you're looking for the best, this is it.  In my opinion, here are the pros and cons of this chair:Pros:- Manual functions are wonderful, and the ability to combine different functions at once is great.  I've found that I really don't use the preset programs much - I use the manual functions far more often.- The remote is easy to use.  It takes a bit of time to figure out what functions can be combined, but once you do, you're good to go.- It is heavy.  This is a good thing in my opinion.  In my previous massage chairs, some of the more intense functions (heavy tapping) would cause the chair to slightly rock around a bit (not much, but enough to notice).  This is not the case with the Inada - it feels very solid.- The rollers are big.  In my previous chairs, the rollers were too small and a bit painful at times.  These rollers are larger, and the width between rollers can be adjusted (a great feature).- The fact that this chair gives you that ""just left the masseuse"" feeling.  This is priceless in my opinion.- The build quality is excellent.  No cheap parts or fittings.  During assembly, it was obvious that high quality components were used.- No useless frills (like built-in MP3 players, lights, cup holders, etc).Cons (keep in mind, I'm being VERY picky to find any cons with this chair.. but if I were to improve upon anything, these would be what I'd improve on):- The heat output is minimal, almost useless in my opinion.  This isn't very important to me anyways.- The motor is a bit loud - if you have music or the TV on, you won't notice the noise of the motor much, but if you plan to use this in a quiet room with no background noise, be aware that the motor is a bit loud.- It would be nice if the neck/shoulder areas were a bit stronger.  I feel that I have to push myself into the neck/shoulder areas to get enough pressure in these areas.  The neck piece actually moves up and down - it would be nice if it could somehow ""lock"" into place and therefore provide more downward pressure on your shoulders.UPDATE:  I found that if you remove the neck/shoulder attachment, the rollers at the top of the back area provide plenty of massage strength for the neck/shoulder area.  There are instructions on how to remove the neck/shoulder attachment in the manual.I understand that there is now an updated model of this chair where the heat and noise have been improved.  I'd be curious to hear from somebody regarding this who has used both this model and the newer model.  It would be great if Inada had some sort of trade-up program.If anybody has any questions, feel free to post them in a comment and I'll do my best to provide answers.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R5NH0JFH3P4B8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007PN212A#wasThisHelpful","R5NH0JFH3P4B8","A2LFWJ8X817QGX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2LFWJ8X817QGX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have a 3300sq/ft single level home with 2 HVAC units (one on each side of the house).  For the last few years I've been using two Nest units - initially the first generation, then the second generation.  Never had any problems with Nest, but I've really been wanting a remote temperature sensor, as the master bedroom gets really warm compared to the hallway where the Nest unit is located, so it requires a bit more tweaking to get the temp just right than I'd prefer to have to do.So after reading into the Ecobee3 and its remote sensor functionality, I thought it would be a good solution.  Installation was VERY easy, took less than 10 minutes to wire it up and connect it to my network (I already had the C wire so I didn't need to run the extra connection cable).  The unit then went into ""Calibrating"" mode for about 30-40 minutes.  After it was done calibrating, I noticed the temperature reading was about 5 degrees too high.  Odd.  Within the next hour or so, the reading eventually adjusted itself (without the AC or heater turned on) to the proper temperature.. Ok, so the unit needs a good 60-90 minutes to fully calibrate itself, no big deal.  At this point, I got around to using the interface - I really like that its a touch screen, and it was very responsive.  No sluggishness at all - every menu responded immediately, and I like how you just touch and pull up/down to adjust the temperature.I then pulled the plastic tab out of the remote temperature sensor, and the Ecobee3 unit immediately detected the sensor and prompted me to pair/activate it.  I then put the remote sensor in the master bedroom, which is only about 25-30ft away from the Ecobee3 main unit - its almost a direct line of sight between the sensor and main unit.  Throughout the night, I got 8 alerts that the remote sensor had disconnected and reconnected.  I do have a lot of tech in the house, although not more than a few wireless devices are on in the evenings.  The next night, I decided to place the remote sensor within 5ft of the Ecobee3 unit, just to determine if the 25-30ft distance was the issue the previous night.  Sure enough, another several disconnects/reconnects occurred, even with the remote sensor just 5ft away from the main unit.  I also pulled the battery out of the remote sensor, replaced it with a new one, then re-paired it.  No change - still disconnected several times.So in summary, I really like the Ecobee3 main unit and its interface - it is very responsive and has a great feel to it.. I like the touch-screen on the Ecobee3 better than the wheel control on the Nest.  However, in my particular case, the remote temperature sensor would not maintain a reliable connection to the main unit, which rendered its functionality useless.  I understand that every home is different, and perhaps mine was disconnecting due to some sort of interference, but I don't have anything particularly unique (as far as wireless devices go) in my home, and I really don't want to spend hours or days troubleshooting this thing.  Perhaps I just had a defective remote sensor.  I returned it and went back to my Nest for now.  Maybe if they release a new revision in the future I'll give it another shot.","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2FOHMJ9EWO60/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NXRYUDA#wasThisHelpful","R2FOHMJ9EWO60","A2LFWJ8X817QGX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2LFWJ8X817QGX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought this to replace my two year old Oral B electric toothbrush.  This Sonicare seems to vibrate at a MUCH higher speed and leaves my teeth feeling cleaner than my old unit did.The charging glass is great - you just set the toothbrush in the glass and it starts to charge.. you don't have to snap it into any place in particular in the glass, just set it in there and it starts charging.  Same with the travel case - you just plug the travel case into a USB port or power charger and it charges the toothbrush inside.The only downside I've found is that if you turn it on, then try to turn it off within a few seconds, you have to cycle through its cleaning modes before it will turn ""off"".  A minor annoyance but not a big deal.This seems to keep itself cleaner than my old unit as well - I don't see nearly as much built up gunk to clean up on this one as my old unit used to collect.As somebody else said, this really does feel like the ""Apple"" of electric toothbrushes.Would highly recommend!","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Q0ZLV6XZ1I52/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FS2N3FE#wasThisHelpful","R1Q0ZLV6XZ1I52","A2LFWJ8X817QGX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2LFWJ8X817QGX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"These are GREAT cameras for the money.. small, well built and very easy to setup.  I ordered four of these and had them all up, running and functional within a matter of minutes.  The firmware updates are easy to install.  I previously had four analog cameras which were state of the art in 2005.  These new IP cameras blow my old cameras out of the water - the picture quality difference is significant.What would be nice is if they offered a longer extension (between the base and the camera).. I can't seem to find a longer version of this extension anywhere.  They do include AC power adapters (which I am not using because I'm using PoE).  I ended up running new CAT6 to all four of these new cameras and using a TPLink PoE switch.Note that you DO need to use the included power splitters if you are going to use PoE - these ""splitters"" take your PoE RJ45 in, and breaks it out to an RJ45 and a male power plug, which both plug into the pigtail attached to the IP camera.I can't comment on the longevity of these, as I've only had them installed for a few days, but I will say that Microseven was very quick to respond when I e-mailed and called them (with pre-sales questions).","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R22A10EEG7166L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00M5PHAYW#wasThisHelpful","R22A10EEG7166L","A2LFWJ8X817QGX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2LFWJ8X817QGX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

When I first took it out of the box and plugged it in, I thought it would be way too loud (even on its lowest setting), but once placed at the opposite side of the room, it's perfect.Update - 01/18/2015:  I still love this device.. however, a TIMER would be wonderful!

"I installed this cable on my 17' fishing boat so that I could have one Lowrance HDS unit on the steering console, and another on the bow of the boat. After fighting the boat for a few hours (it did not want another cable installed, or was it that I didn’t want to cram my arms and hands into the tightest areas of the boat?) I connected the two units and they work seamlessly.One note about my installation: the cable hole in my dash was not big enough to fit another connector through it. I didn't want to drill another hole in my dash just for one additional cable, so I cut the cable and fed the cut end through the existing hole in my dash. Then I spliced it together with conventional connectors. I was concerned about how well it would work after doing that, but it turned out to work perfectly.

"The concept of this fender is fantastic. It is easily stowable and can also be used as cushioning in your storage compartments. It is durable and comes with good quality rope and Velcro tape. Its construction is three layers of closed cell foam. The two outer layers are textured to aid in keeping it in place instead of slipping off easily when under compression between your boat and a dock.But here is the issue to be aware of before purchasing it: it won't help fend off your boat from a dock if the dock has poles on the outside of the dock framing and if your boat has a thick bumper lip. It is too thin for that. For example, my boat has a bumper trim that protrudes from the side of the boat. This protrusion sticks out slightly more than the thickness of this fender (taking into consideration the inward taper of my freeboard). Therefore, the bumper trim on my boat is hitting the poles, while the fender is not touching the dock or the poles. This leaves my boat still slamming on the dock poles when waves approach. Therefore, I need to continue to use the thicker, round fenders.So check the configuration of your boat carefully to ensure it will work for your boat. In my case, I have limited points where I can tie up this fender; so it is ineffective for me to get it tied up to the point of where it will protect my bumper trim.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2STZIH9VGIY61/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000MJHK84#wasThisHelpful","R2STZIH9VGIY61","A2WZYLIWSNY2M8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WZYLIWSNY2M8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I own low quality dial indicators, and some very high quality ones. On a scale of 1 to 10, I would rate this indicator a 7, which is a pretty good rating considering there are lots and lots of crappy indicators currently on the market. Just to put this further into perspective: most of the dial indicators on the market today, which are going for $60 or less, I would rate them as 1s or 2s. For the price ($20 at the time of this writing), this Steelex dial indicator is a steel.Its movement is smooth and has shown to be very accurate. The dial lock nut is a bit small, but a normal size for low cost indicators.My only complaint about this unit is that the pointer tabs are not that good to work with. They are just the small clip on style that can be tough to move when your hands are oily, and they pop off too easily.

"This speaker packs more punch than I expected. I am not going to review this in comparison with more substantial speakers as that would not be fair. However, as a small portable speaker of its class, it has great sound and a wonderful shape.It also has the ability to connect to others speaker and headphones and have them all run at the same time.Size: this is only 1 7/8 inches (47mm) tall and 2 3/8 inches (60mm) wide when in the closed position. In the open position, it is 2 9/16 inches (65mm) tall.Shape: The round shape makes it great to transporting; no corners to get caught on things in your bag or pockets.Build: It is made with a plastic housing. The housing is coated with a thin rubber that makes it easy to handle the unit. The housing is a little flexible when squeezed hard, but this is good to keep it from cracking under pressure. The expandable tube is also durable as it has not split or broken from the constant opening and closing. This unit also has rubber feet to keep it from moving around.Switch and dial: It has an on/off switch that is sturdy and makes solid contact. The volume dial is strong and turns easily. The volume dial does not cause scratching sounds in the sound when it is adjusted. I have seen happen this on lower quality units.Locking position: Since this is an expandable unit, it operates by a simple twist lock action. There is a mark on the side to show its alignment, but it does not really need it since the twist action is very strong and easy to use. It locks in place and does not come loose accidentally.Speaker protection: The only protection for the speaker (and my only complaint about the unit) is a single plastic bar that goes across. It leaves two large gaps on either side of the speaker which are unprotected. If you throw this item in a bag or backpack with other floating items, then pens or such can poke at the speaker and ruin it. You will need to store it separately from other items. I do, however, know that if too much protection is placed over the speaker, then that can degrade sound quality; one of the very few tradeoffs with this item.Sound quality: The sound is great for a small portable speaker. The expanding feature of it is necessary to get better sound quality, but you can also use it in its collapsed position.Connection cord: it has one cord permanently attached to it. This cord is a mini plug that fits in almost all cell phone earphone connections. The cord is only 3.5 inches (90mm) long which means you cannot plug it into things that are located any decent distance away. But, one nice feature is that the plug tucks away securely so that it does not interfere with anything else when in storage.Recharging: It is rechargeable with built in batteries. It comes with a cable for recharging. Having its own power keeps a cellphone battery from draining fast.Compatibility: It works on all devices that accept 3.5mm speaker plugs. It does not matter about software or anything; if you have a speaker port, it will work on it.Accessories:It comes with an additional cord for plugging it into other items to receive sound or send sound. This cord makes up for the installed short cord if you need more distance since it is 3 feet (1 meter) long. This cord comes with a Velcro strap to keep it wound up nicely.It also comes with a multi-use cord that has the standard mini sound jack, a USB connection, and a mini HDMI connection. This cord is just shy of 2 feet long.A fabric bad is included that is large enough to hold the speaker and cords. It uses a draw string to keep it closed.Instructions: very short, simple, and clearly written; but the text it very small.I'm not much for small portable speakers in general; but based on what I have seen from this one, I highly recommend it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RDPH2DQU8VAM7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0082E9K7U#wasThisHelpful","RDPH2DQU8VAM7","A2WZYLIWSNY2M8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WZYLIWSNY2M8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Overall, I am very pleased with this machine and I highly recommend it, but there are some details I noted further in this review that you may be interested in.I bought this for its variable speed option. I use it for buffing instead of grinding. Buffing should be done at about 1500rpm instead of 3400rpm. The lower buffing speed helps the material from becoming overheated. Even though this grinder runs at a minimum of 2000rpm, it is still much better than buffing at 3400rpm.I posted some photos as reference to what I am talking about in this review.Adjustable speed:The dial for adjusting speed is located on the front to the right of the power switch. It is a durable dial and feels like it is mounted well. You can adjust speed from 2000rpm to 3300rpm. Then there is a click at the highest setting that jumps the speed up to a max of 3450prm. It does not take long for the speed to adjust, and you can kind of tell when the processor it regulating to the correct speed. The processor is located within the base of the machine.Power at different speeds:I tested several different parts and pressures to see if the torque was reduced at lower speeds. I did not notice any difference in the power that it gave. It held a good amount of torque at any speed and seemed to be a little stronger than my Black and Decker grinder that I also converted to a buffer; even though both have the same horse power rating.Power switch:It works well, but its mounting is weak. It almost feels like it will pop out of the machine. It hasn't yet.Vibration:There is some vibration, but it is minimal for a machine in this price category. Vibration is a tricky thing since the grinding wheels can cause more vibration than a machine does. When I tested this Palmgren machine with the grinding wheels on, it had about the same vibration as my Black & Decker grinder, but less than my old (1970s model) Craftsman grinder. With the grinding wheels off, it had some vibration, but it was evident the wheels were causing most of the vibration.Grinding wheel manufacturers aren't the best at balancing their wheels. Therefore, if you get a machine that has lots of vibration, try changing the wheels to see of that helps.Stability:This machine is fantastically stable and has a wider base than my other grinders. When not mounted to a table or stand, my other grinding machines vibrate all over the place and cannot be used until they are mounted. However, I tried this machine not mounted and it stayed in place. I don't recommend using the machine not mounted, but I just wanted point out how well the base is designed.Wheel housings:The housings that go around the grinding wheels are very durable and well built; much better than other grinders (within this price point) I have used. The vacuum attachments are placed in a good position to keep the machine functional and suck up most of the debris.Resting platforms and guards:The resting platforms are thick metal and have secure mounting. They are also a good large size instead of being small like on other grinders. My other grinders have cheap and thin platforms that move too easily and bend with little effort. The eye shields of this Palmgren are ok; they are the same as my Black & Decker grinder. This means they are good for a home shop, but not what I consider to be good enough for an industrial shop.Motor housing:What I really like about this machine design is that the motor housing is long and narrow rather than fat. The large diameter motor housings get in the way of grinding or buffing large items, but this Palmgren housing is small enough to allow for grinding large items without bumping the motor.Wheel washers:If you note in one of the photos I posted, each side of the grinder has different types of washers which hold the wheels. The coarse side as the large, thick washers; and the fine grit side has the normal grinder washers. I don’t know what the benefit this design is, but I just wanted to note it for your reference in case you are using this machine for other purposes like I am.So far, this machine has performed very well for me. I will probably get another one to replace the junky, vibrating Craftsman grinder I currently have.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 6, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1RJZR1F5O3WUZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00068U82Q#wasThisHelpful","R1RJZR1F5O3WUZ","A2WZYLIWSNY2M8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WZYLIWSNY2M8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I got these to use with my tie down straps when I transport my small tractor (weighs close to 2000 pounds). I also use them as extensions to get more length when I am strapping down larger items.  The webbing is durable, and the protective sleeves work great at keeping the webbing from fraying when laid over cornered areas.The metal rings are very strong and big enough to easily accept the larger hooks from bigger tie down straps.I like the 36 inch length better than my other 24 inch straps since it makes it easier to access the rings under a vehicle.These work great and I recommend them.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 21, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1316M33KRZ2ZU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BDTU8BI#wasThisHelpful","R1316M33KRZ2ZU","A2WZYLIWSNY2M8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WZYLIWSNY2M8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have a 17 foot fishing boat and didn't want a boat hook that was too big, but I also didn't want one that was too short when extended. This pole is the perfect size! When contracted, it is short enough to fit easily into the side compartment, but gets long enough to reach what we need it to.The pole is very strong when extended. It does not flex and the twist lock feature holds the sections in place very tightly.The plastic hook is also very strong and the shape is convenient to work with. The rubber tip seems like it can pop off easily, but so far ours has stayed in place.Case-in-point for how well this boat hook works: there was a log in our local river that became an obstruction and had already been hit by a few boats. We used this hook to lasso a rope around the log, tow the log and then used the hook again to remove the rope. My story may sound easy enough, but it was actually much tougher to accomplish because of several factors working against us such as: the heavy current, strong wind, and other obstructions around when we parked the log and tried to remove the rope at a distance while keeping the boat from hitting surrounding objects.This is one great boat hook and I highly recommend it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 21, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZ8C46V5E4B8J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001441HLM#wasThisHelpful","RZ8C46V5E4B8J","A2WZYLIWSNY2M8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WZYLIWSNY2M8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I had roughly seven 10x15 foot areas of my yard that needed seeding. I tried grass seed from my local hardware store where they had their own special mix and some generic brands. That grass only lasted a year before it died. I then tried this Scotts high traffic mix seed. Wow, it did work great! These areas now look better than my old grass.The special coating on each seed really does work well. Many years ago, I was a landscape foreman and was leery about the coated seed just being a gimmick. However, the coating seemed to help tremendously.I did not do anything special when I applied the seed. I typically add hay and peat moss, rake it in, and etc. But I was lazy when this seed arrived, so I just threw it on the yard and watered it once a day, nothing else. I even missed a few days of watering because I was busy with other stuff. Low-and-behold, this seed came through with charm and has become very lush and deep green while my old grass is a little on the brown side. It took this seed about 8 days to germinate and I was mowing it in another 14 days after that.I highly recommend this seed since it can be neglected a little and still grow into something nice. My next job is to reseed the rest of my lawn to get the entire lawn back to looking lush.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 19, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1LOGJS3YO8QSX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001OENY04#wasThisHelpful","R1LOGJS3YO8QSX","A2WZYLIWSNY2M8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WZYLIWSNY2M8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I purchased this to cook bacon and vegetables on the grill.  My wife does not like the smoke and smell that bacon generates in the house when cooked on the stove or in the oven. I, on the other hand, think of it as an air freshener for the house. Since I did not win that battle-of-the-bacon, I decided to start cooking it on the grill with much better results. However, I was making pans with tinfoil and wanted something more durable.This griddle is very durable being made of heavy gauge steel. It is heavy and the seams are welded. It has a riser on the backside so you can fold it in to have the pan lie flat, and fold it out to have the pan sit up at an angle for draining liquids. It is so well made that it will perform flawlessly with continuous use such as in a busy restaurant.The advertising makes it look much larger than it is: The display image of the pan shows three sausage links, scrambled eggs, and two pancakes. In reality, you will only get one normal size pancake on it since the entire pan is only 9x11 inches. Because of its size, it actually fits perfect on my side burner, but is too close to the grill's adjustment knob in that configuration.I don't recommend cooking anything more than just a few strips of bacon on it. The drip trough is not very big and will not accommodate holding much grease. Besides, bacon tastes better when it is cooked in its own grease. Therefore, I am still using the tinfoil-pan method of cooking bacon which is working well as I can cook one pound at one time on a normal size gas grill.Overall, this pan works great for cooking vegetables and maybe a pancake, plus it is well made. I feel it is a great deal for the money. I recommend it, but not for cooking items that need a larger size griddle.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 19, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R10K3ZYTAGWQ4V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00B58A0R4#wasThisHelpful","R10K3ZYTAGWQ4V","A2WZYLIWSNY2M8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WZYLIWSNY2M8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have tried a few different kinds of receiver pin locks, and this one has done a great job so far. Other locks of this style have rusted quickly or did not have durable locking mechanisms. Last winter I had to cut off a receiver lock that rusted shut. However this lock has performed great. I will update this review once I have had it on my vehicle for a long period of time.It is made of stainless steel, but that does not mean much unless it is made of quality stainless. This lock seems to fit that bill. It is very heavy duty. It also has a rubber cap and an O-ring to help keep out the bad elements. I have removed the lock several times and not had any issues with the cap or the O-ring.I have a factory installed receiver on my F150 truck. The length of this pin lock fits it perfectly with a little extra length. I like having the little extra length because a tight fitting receiver lock can give trouble getting it off when they start to fail.I recommend this receiver lock over many others as I have tried several of them.UPDATE: I have had this on my truck for over a year now. It went through a rough winter of heavily salted roads, and through a very wet spring and summer.

"The individually packaged wipes are what attracted me to this product. I keep a box on my boat, so they are stored for long periods in the heat, and I don't want them to dry out like the bulk packaged wipes will do even if they have a zip-lock style seal.In the regard of them being individually packaged, they are fantastic. These are far more convenient than any other packaging. I can throw them in a backpack without worry of a can accidentally spraying or a bottle accidentally spilling.As far as how well they work; well I have never seen ""Off"" brand products work that great. I have used many different brands of insect repellent and the best I have seen is the brand Repel. We have a large mosquito and biting fly population where I live because of all the swamp land. Repel brand wipes have worked the best for us to keep all the bugs away. The Off brand products seem to wear off easy and needs to be reapplied every hour. These wipes dry far too quickly and are useless after you only get your arms and neck covered. You have to break out another wipe to get more body parts covered.If you are in great need of the convince of individually packaged bug repellent wipes, then get these, but if you can deal with bulk packaged wipes, then these are a much better product:Repel 94100 Sportsmen 30-Percent Deet Mosquito Repellent Wipes, 15 Count 6-PackI hope that Repel will soon start providing their product in individually packaged wipes.","2.0 out of 5 stars","August 19, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3DBMMII01HY3H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000Q64DI8#wasThisHelpful","R3DBMMII01HY3H","A2WZYLIWSNY2M8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WZYLIWSNY2M8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I installed this on my 17 foot deep V boat. It has helped tremendously for my mapping of the local rivers and lakes, because the waters where I boat are dangerous with unmarked shallow points and numerous deadheads. It can be very hard to find the channel when a fog drifts in or when the water becomes murky.What is comes with:Antenna/4' NEMA 2000 cableMEMA 2000 T connectorSpat/pole mountMounting hardwareGasket sealInstall GuideAdditional items needed for install:It comes with everything you need to mount the Point-1, except a pipe (pipe is needed if you don't mount the Point 1 on a flat surface).If you don't have a NEMA2000 installed already, then you will need to get the NEMA2000 network starter kit; there is no way around this option. Thankfully, the only difficult thing about installing a NEMA2000 network is working in the tight areas of your boat. Lowrance made its network set-up very easy to establish. Now that I have installed the NEMA2000, I am thinking of adding a Sirius weather receiver to my boat.Mounting:The directions say not to mount this item within 3.3 feet of your motor or trolling motor. That left me with mounting it near the helm. Because the Point-1 is only 3.5"" in diameter, I could have mounted directly to a flat area on the front of my console. However, I was not ready to drill holes in the console, so I decided to use a pole attached to the vertical flat area on the front of my console.The Point-1 comes with an attachment to mount it to threaded plumbing pipe if you need the unit to be elevated. I found a 10"" long plastic threaded pipe at my local hardware store that worked perfectly. I was able to string the Point-1 cord through the pipe and out the bottom through a gap in the boat console. The attachment also has a notch in the bottom of it so you can run the cord outside of the pipe if you don't want to run the cord in the pipe.There is an arrow on the top of the Point-1 device to let you know which direction to point it. You don't have to be perfect in aligning the arrow with the bow of the boat since you can also make an offset adjustment in your Lowrance unit. I had to set mine for -8 degrees.Keeps structure scan straight with your heading:One good surprise I noted is that the Point 1 will compensate your structure scan imaging for sideways drifting of your boat. If your boat is moving against a wind and current going different directions, then keeping your boat straight at slow speeds can be difficult. The Point 1 will sense this and change the alignment of your structure scan image to continue reading straight according to your heading. I have found this feature is most effective during mapping the contours of lake and river bottoms. Then I know my data is aligned properly when I upload the files into my mapping program, such as InsightGenesis.Software updates:Another great feature is that you can update the software of the Point 1 through your HDS unit as Lowrance makes improvements. This will help lengthen the usefulness of the Point 1 and keep it from going out of date too early as technology changes.Calibration:Easy! Just push the calibrate button on your HDS unit and drive the boat in a circle until it tells you it is complete. That is usually 1.5 circles for me. I only needed to calibrate it once so far, but I did a few more times just in case. I then drove the boat around and found it was not showing my point pointed straight forward on the HDS unit. I then set an offset in the HDS unit until I found that -8 degrees was the correct offset. It now shows my boat moving straight when I am moving straight.GPS:It is as accurate as the HDS unit internal GPS. If your HDS unit is mounted in an area that prevents it from getting good signal, then get this unit to compensate for that problem.  The HDS units receive GPS signal at 5hz (5 times per second), but the Point 1 receives signal at 10hz. This feature does not improve signal reception for the Point 1, but it gives faster location readings if you are traveling at high speed.Problems:There are only two problems I have found:1. It is slow to compensate for turns. If I am traveling at high speed (for me that is 20 to 40mph) then the Point 1 takes about 10 seconds to turn the arrow on the HDS unit to the correct direction my boat is facing.2. Shows a zigzag course: While traveling at 1 to 3mph, a trail on the HDS unit will show as very spikey and zigzag as the Point 1 is not incredibly accurate with its coordinates. It is accurate enough and comparable with the HDS unit internal GPS, but I have not seen the Point 1 be more accurate than the internal unit. Only survey equipment GPS units are spot -on accurate. That is why Lowrance says to not use the Point-1 for autopilot functions. You have to get a more expensive GPS unit if you need it for autopilot; I am not sure if Lowrance has one of those too.Overall:Overall, it is a very good accessory to have for showing your boat heading, getting proper structure scan alignment, and improving signal for HDS units that are obstructed from a clear view of the sky. It is great that Lowrance will continue to give it software support after you purchase it. I recommend the Point 1.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 13, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3IXEKZP0FXIMA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00C1L0SZI#wasThisHelpful","R3IXEKZP0FXIMA","A2WZYLIWSNY2M8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WZYLIWSNY2M8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have this bulb and the Tuwago 9.5W Globe CREE® LED Bulb - Warm White 2700K bulb, both of which are installed side by side in my bathroom. Both are great bulbs. However, I find this Satco S8784 bulb to be better.The 5000 kelvin light color is a true 5000K. It is not blue like 5500K and 6000K bulbs, and it is not yellow like the 4000K and 3000K bulbs. Mine seemed to be slightly on the bluish side when I first installed it, but then I realized that my bathroom walls are painted a pale blue. I tried the light in a different location and saw that this bulb is truly at the rated 5000K color, I even compared it to my photography lamps. Just in case you are unaware: 5000k is the rating for true white light. Incandescent bulbs are usually rated at around 2700k and give a yellowish light. Any bulb called ""Daylight"" is not really daylight unless its color temperature is 5000k.The box says it is only 460 lumens in brightness, and the product photo says it is 200 lumens. I thought I got a dim bulb since 460 lumens is not very bright. However, once turned on, it was a little brighter than my fluorescent and other LED bulbs. I think they might have underrated the lumens for this bulb. I can say for sure that it is at least as bright as the Tuwago bulb, which is rated at 480 lumens.Its size is the same as the typical bathroom globe bulbs that are incandescent and fluorescent. The Tuwago® 9.5W Globe CREE® LED Bulb - Warm White 2700K bulb is much larger, which is nice too but kind of bulky. I am glad this Satco bulb is the same size as the regular style bulbs.When turned on, there is no delay; it is instant on.I need to state that the product description is not correct at the time of writing this review: It states this is a 7 watt bulb, but the bulb is actually 8 watts as listed on the box. This misrepresentation almost wants to make me mark this review as a 4 star rating, but the product itself is very quality, so I left it at 5 stars.So far, this is the best LED globe style bulb I have tried out. I highly recommend it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 17, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RA0CSB4132U3E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003AC9EZM#wasThisHelpful","RA0CSB4132U3E","A2WZYLIWSNY2M8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WZYLIWSNY2M8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I would have uploaded a photo of the lights as they compared to my current 32 watt fluorescent fixtures to show these LED bulbs are not as bright as the seller states they are; however, that option is not available when I view this particular product.Seller issues - Micropoint Optoelectronics:I purchased a package of 10 of these bulbs under the product description of being 18 watts per bulb which were described to replace 50 watt fluorescent replacement. I was then sent 16 watt bulbs. I informed the seller of the issue, and they said they downgraded the lights as per their engineer to support their guarantee, and wanted to give me a 5% discount off my next purchase. This was not an acceptable resolve since I need 18 watt bulbs for a certain brightness level in my shop. This is what the description stated when I placed my order:New arrival! Micropoint T8 LED Fluorescent Tube,SMD5730 LED Lamp,10pcs/package,48"",18watt,1800lm-2000lm,High Brightness, No Dark Area, Color Temperature:  4000-4500k,Natural White,Ac85-265v,Diffused Pc Cover & aluminum Alloy,50w-55w Standard Fluorescent Tube ReplacementProduct good points:The 16 watt bulbs are a good product. I installed them in one of my fixtures before I realized I was sent 16 watt bulbs instead of 18 watt bulbs. They installed easily. When turned on, it takes them only 1 to 1.5 seconds to light up. The wiring connection diagram is located right on the bulb to prevent any confusion or lost instructions.Product bad points:At the time of this writing, the product title was changed to read (changed right after my complaint to them):New arrival! Micropoint T8 LED Fluorescent Tube,SMD5730 LED Lamp,10pcs/package,48"",16watt,1400lm-1600lm,High Brightness, No Dark Area, Color Temperature:4000-4500k,Natural White,Ac85-265v,Diffused Pc Cover & aluminum Alloy,50w-55w Standard Fluorescent Tube ReplacementThese bulbs do not put out the described amount of light of 1400-1600 lumens; they put out about only 900-1000 lumens. They also only shed light at 180 degrees of spread; normal fluorescent bulbs shed light at 360 degrees. This 360 degrees of emitted light causes light to reflect from the fluorescent fixture and  increase the light being shed in a room. These Micropoint LED bulbs do not reflect any light from the fixture, so therefore they do not equate to the claimed 50-55watt equivalent as stated in their description, nor do they even equate to 32 watts. These actually put out a little less light than my current 32 watt fluorescent T8 bulbs.While these lights seem to be constructed well and do put out an even amount of light (albeit at 180 degrees), the company has done a poor job of properly representing this product and ended up stating their products equate to higher brightness bulbs then they actually do. The company has shown a very poor ability to support their claims and clearly do not want to support their customers as based on the issues I had with them.Overall:If you are looking for 16 watt T8 LED bulbs that put out about 900-1000 lumens, then get these while they are at a good price. But beware that if you have issues with the lights after they arrive, you may not get much help form the company who sells them.","2.0 out of 5 stars","July 16, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R353S9KQI9M4K8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DKPQ1IM#wasThisHelpful","R353S9KQI9M4K8","A2WZYLIWSNY2M8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WZYLIWSNY2M8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I got this to keep on my boat for those just-in-case situations. I have a small boat, so I didn't need a kit that was very big. It has all of the items I will probably need, plus a few extras.It arrives with a strong plastic seal on it that has a serial number. I did not need that, so I cut it off so I could get access to the contents of the bag with very little trouble when an emergency happens.Double zipper does not mean the bag is extra water tight; it means there are two zipper pulls instead of one. I am not sure if having the extra pull was really necessary, but was probably more for attaching the serial number seal than anything.The bag is not water tight; water slowly seeps through the seams and through the zipper if the bag becomes saturated from the outside.The contents are packed into three different plastic bags:1. General first aid bag- 10 fabric 1x3 inch adhesive strips- 2 fabric knuckle bandages- 2 fabric fingertip bandages- 2 fabric extra-large strips- 4 butterfly closures (large)- 2 gauze pads 3x3 inch- 1 adhesive tape ½ inch- 4 motion sickness tablets- 2 Triple antibiotic ointment packets- 2 first aid/burn cream packets- 20 antiseptic wipes- 4 extra strength non-aspirin tablets- 1 sting relief wipe- 2 latex exam glovesThere is a note for several of the items stating that you should check packets for expiration dates before use.2. Wound treatment bag- 1 5x9 inch sterile large wound dressing- 4 sterile 4 inch gauze pads- 1 sterile 4 inch gauze bandage with clips- 6 antiseptic towelettes- 1 pair latex exam gloves3. Sprain and limb injuries bag- 1ea 4 inch elastic bandage- 1 instant cold pack- 1 triangular bandage- 1 pair latex exam glovesEach of the three plastic bags is water tight with a zip-lock style seal. The bags are not heat sealed on all four edges, which mean the bags are easier to get into since you simply open the zip-lock and then can reseal it.The product description says there is room for adding extra items, but there is actually very little extra room.Overall, this is a good kit and will serve its purpose for my small 17 foot fishing boat. However, I would get a more water tight kit if I had boat that did not have dry compartments.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 9, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RTASND2G9URI3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000FOUL7S#wasThisHelpful","RTASND2G9URI3","A2WZYLIWSNY2M8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WZYLIWSNY2M8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I use this cord with the Wagan 5 Amp AC to 12V DC Power Adapter so that I can operate my Lowrance HDS Touch in my house.The cord is constructed with typical Lowrance high quality. It has two cables that connect into the cannon plug: a cable with the cigarette lighter attachment, and an additional cable that is for connecting a transducer. Since I am not using this cable with a transducer. I just put small wire nuts over the exposed wires of the transducer cable to prevent them from shorting.The power cable is 12 feet long. The transducer cable is 46 inches long.I am very happy with this cable. I have used it for several hours when checking waypoints, maps, down loads, and uploads without having to get in and out of the boat each time. This cable will also allow me to use it in my car while the wife drives and I set up the settings for the next lake we are traveling to.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 9, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2UL3C10WXFG9N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000OTORG0#wasThisHelpful","R2UL3C10WXFG9N","A2WZYLIWSNY2M8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WZYLIWSNY2M8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought this to apply on the bottom side of my new truck's running boards. These running boards take the most abuse from flying road debris.The Eastwood rubberized encapsulator is good for use as an undercoating. The best way to apply it is by spraying it. However, I did not spray it because I was only doing my running boards which had areas that only a brush could get to. I used foam brushes, but I think a bristle brush would have been better.You must use this in a well-ventilated area. The fumes are very strong.It applies thicker than paint. Two coats are necessary. You only have to wait 30 to 45 minutes before recoating.A can of this will not go too far because it goes on thick. Just the two running boards used up ¾ of a can. Each of the running boards measure 7 feet long and 6 inches wide.It is best to wear gloves when using this product. It dries quickly and will stick firmly to your hands (making your fingers stick together). However, it does clean up well with mineral spirits.I cannot speak for its long term durability since this was my first time using it. I should be able to update this review in a few years when I see how well it performs through our hot, humid summers and salty, snowy winters.UPDATE July 2015: I just checked it and it is doing well. No peeling, and no rust that I can find. The underside of the running boards take a lot of abuse, so i would say that this stuff has some pretty good long term durability, especially in my northern environment where they heavily salt the roads. This stuff now has 60,000 miles on it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 7, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RXV3HODDMM9PB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008H3UVH4#wasThisHelpful","RXV3HODDMM9PB","A2WZYLIWSNY2M8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WZYLIWSNY2M8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This rope is fantastic; very strong! I have a 17' boat that can use 3/8 inch diameter rope, and 25 foot length. This seems to be the perfect size for my size boat.The quality is exceptional. It does not fray easily. It has a loop at one end that is secured with string like they used to make them in the old days. It is done so well that it seems like it will never loosen up.After getting wet, the rope dries quickly.The description says it is a gold color. It is actually a blend of gold and white.It is easy to handle and I like it much better than other ropes I have tried. I got two of these for the first order and then got two more once I saw it is a quality product.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 26, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1DQ81M2E3P8AJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005XWJSM6#wasThisHelpful","R1DQ81M2E3P8AJ","A2WZYLIWSNY2M8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WZYLIWSNY2M8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I purchased this to keep on my boat in case I needed some tools. It is not a kit I will use very often; and thank goodness I will not need it often...Case:The case is larger than I expected for it having so few tools. It's just 20 pieces of tools, but there is lots of wasted room in the case. The case measures 11 1/8 inches wide x 7 inches deep x 2 7/8"" thick. I wanted a smaller case so it would not take up much room.The tools are a pain to remove from their slots. You can't just pop out the sockets and get to work; you have to really work at getting them out because they are held in at both ends and not enough room to slide fingers between the sockets to pry them out. There is also not enough of the socket poking out of the surface to get a good grip on both ends to pull them out. I normally have to use the extension bar to stick between the sockets to pop them out. What a waste of time.Tools:The quality of the tools is OK, but nothing special. Stanley has not been producing quality tools for decades, so I was already not expecting much from this set. For the price, and my occasional use, I should get a good life from them.Since the product description does not tell you what is inside, I will list it here:Socket ratchet wrench, 7 ¼ inch longExtension bar, 2 ½ inchMetric sockets: 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13mmSAE sockets: 5/32, 3/16, 7/32, ¼, 9/32, 5/16, 11/32, 3/8, 7/16, 1/2For as small as this kit was, I was expecting an all SAE set; however, as you can see, it comes with a few of each metric and SAE.Overall, this is a good kit to have ready in a pinch; but otherwise, there are far better kits on the market if you are looking for good quality.","2.0 out of 5 stars","June 26, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2QL2PNULDWDIV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000NIK9Z0#wasThisHelpful","R2QL2PNULDWDIV","A2WZYLIWSNY2M8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WZYLIWSNY2M8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Keep in mind that this review includes information about the LSS2 structure scan transducer, but this particular product does not come with it. You will need to look for the other item on Amazon which includes the LSS2 transducer if you want to order the fish finder and LSS2 in one package. The combo package is here: Lowrance 000-10778-001 HDS-7 Gen2 Touch Combination Chartplotter/Fishfinder with 83/200KHz and StructureScan TransducerI have had the Lowrance non-touch models and two Humminbird down scan models. In my experience, the Lowrance Touch is far better than those. I have only one recommendation: if you can afford the touch models larger than the HDS 7, get them. The 7 inch model works very well and suits me for the budget I have, but if I had more money, I would get the larger screen so that I see more imagery.Here is what I find superb about the HDS7 touch:1. The touch screen is far more user friendly to use than the key pad models. I can access many different options with just a press or two, and do it fast. The non-touch requires clicking through lots of stuff just to find basic functions, and those models also responds slower.2. The screen imagery is very visible in sunlight.3. The resolution is great. I used Humminbird models who say they have better resolution than Lowrance, but I actually see better definition on the Lowrance Touch. This was one reason why I switched back to Lowrance after trying the Humminbirds for a while.4. GPS accuracy has been fantastic. My older Lowrance had average accuracy, and my Hummingbirds had poor accuracy. This HDS7 has been spot on every time within about a 10 to 14 foot radius. Most consumer grade GPS units have an accuracy of 20 to 30 foot radius.5. It includes the structure scan hardware. This means there is no need to buy a separate Structure scan module if you want to upgrade later (assuming you purchased a unit without the structure scan transducer). The sales guys at the sporting store told me you had to buy the structure module, but they were wrong. Lowrance customer service was very good at explaining to me what the truth is: you only need the structure scan transducer and nothing else but the fish finder itself.6. Networking is easy.  It works with all of their Lowrance models which can be networked; with both newer units and older units. Therefore I was able to hook up my new HDS7 touch with my older HDS8 and have them work seamlessly at opposite ends of the boat. All you have to do is set witch fish finder is the master unit, and you can swap that setting anytime you want. One network cable is all you need to get two units to be networked. It is that simple. Again, Lowrance customer service was great at explaining the process, which I initially could not believe was really that simple.7. As normal, Lowrance builds very durable cases for their units. This one is no exception. The casing is strong and water tight. Even the door for the SD card is strong and has a water resistant seal.Mapping with chartplotter:I do boating on a few lakes in my area which have no charts. These lakes are very tricky to navigate since they are flooded areas for hydro dams. There are lots of dangers that are just below the water surface. I used the depth recording feature of the HDS7 and then transferred that data to the Insight Genesis program. The program quickly created graphical depth maps of these lakes and I am now able to navigate them safely. This increased the speed at which I can travel on the lakes, and I was able to locate a few new fishing spots.SD card:From what I understand, this unit can accept an SD card up to 32 gigs. I am running a 16 gig card in my unit. It also worked with a micro SD card using the adapter.Waypoints:Before using insight genesis for mapping, I plotted safe routes in the lakes using waypoints. I still use these to mark hazards. The best part of the HDS Touch is that you set waypoints just by touching the screen where you want the waypoint, and then the menu screen pops up with options for setting a waypoint. No more scrolling with the touch pad as older units required you to do. I love it! In addition, moving a waypoint is super easy too. Also, you can easily make a series of waypoints into a route.Base unit mounting:The included mount bracket will fit great on a flat surface. However, I don't have enough room on my dash to accommodate a unit of this size. I used a ram mount and drilled holes in the ram mount plate to get it work with the Lowrance bracket. It is holding very well.Cables:The cables fit great on my 17 foot boat. There is a few more feet of cable that will allow them to work on a longer boat.Using the touch screen with gloves:It gets cold here, so gloves are needed. I found a pair of good quality touch screen gloves here on Amazon that work well with this unit.180s Enduro Tec Touch GlovesTransducers:The regular transducer seems to be the same as the transducers Lowrance has been using for several years. It is the same size and shape. The LSS2 transducer plugs directly into the HDS Touch units. No need for the module box.Face cover:My HDS7 Touch came with a front cover to protect it from damage when in storage. I remove my fish finder every time I pull the boat out to of the water to keep from getting damaged on the road and from theft. This cover is very durable and takes a beating.I have been using this unit for a while and have loved every minute of it. I recommend any of the HDS Touch units over the older units.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 25, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3BIEIBFJOYPRI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009L35JKS#wasThisHelpful","R3BIEIBFJOYPRI","A2WZYLIWSNY2M8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WZYLIWSNY2M8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

This one is my favorite, so much so that I had to get some dark green boots to go with!  The tan colored trim looks like suede up close, the wool is very nappy, like boucle fabric.  It is so heavy and warm, I love it!  It looks cute with leggings and high heel boots, or jeans with shorter boots.  I wear it with everything.

"I ordered this coat because my other coats are too nice to wear outside, i.e. to the dog park.  This coat is perfect for outdoor activities, as it is really comfortable, washable, and absolutely WARM.  It has nice faux fur inside, the hood is lined with warm knitted fabric.  The sleeves are lined with a type of quilted material and have a knitted cuff. I am a size S and here I ordered an XXL.  In reading the reviews on these coats from China, I believe the size you order is best chosen by crossing your fingers while you check the size box.  I'm 5'2"", weigh about 120 and the XXL is perfect, it fits as in the picture.  The fur around the (non-detachable) hood is good enough for doll clothes...I ordered a new fur trim to put on mine.  The coat is now perfect.  I hope it lasts a long time.  I gave this jacket five stars because I would have paid at least $100 for this at the mall.

"One of my book clubs read The Girl in the Spider's Web this month and I just did not have time to read all of the book so I picked up this companion so that I could at least take part in the discussion. I am very glad that I did as the author has summarised the book in great details and provided an in-depth analysis of every point of the book. I probably got far more out of this than if I had read the original a couple of times as there are a number of underlying themes that I would not have picked up on. The section on discussion topics was very useful for the actual meeting as it gave us extra points to talk about that no one else had thought of.Overall a well written and well-presented​ companion to A Girl in the Spider's Web.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJ8VPTN993J0B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014XIMDMW#wasThisHelpful","RJ8VPTN993J0B","A2P311B5U711NO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2P311B5U711NO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Behind Closed Doors is an excellent book and a very powerful story. It is very well written with brilliantly crafted characters that are very real and feel very alive. The book shows the effects abuse can have on the lives of different people and how it does not affect everyone in the same way but it always has an effect. I like however that the author has shown that people can overcome it and grow strong in spite of it.Overall an excellent story that is well written and grips you from the very beginning.

"My wife read this book first and recommended it to me. Even though it is aimed at women I really enjoyed the book and found it to be very well written with great humour and genuinely empowering advice. Me and my wife both love to write and have both experienced those times when you really want to put pen to paper but when you do you have nothing. Your mind goes blank and all those brilliant ideas you had are gone. The author has an excellent outlook on life that resonates strongly throughout this book and even though I have not had any kind of writers block for a while I still found myself writing more since reading it and enjoying the experience more and I found I could pull from more aspects of my life than I realised.Overall an excellent book that is well written, well presented and enjoyable to read.

"Harry Watt, Bounty Hunter is a book with a real classic sci-fi feel. I love books like this with an adventure spanning through space on multiple planets. This if done right can offer a dynamic that you cannot find on just one planet and Rob Guy has done it very well. Harry is a brilliantly crafted character who is very easy to relate too and you really want to know his story and what happens next. A great story needs a character you can invest in and Harry Watt is that character.The plot is excellent and action packed with something going on at every turn.

"We bought this for our Lab who was constantly barking at night. The collar has been fantastic and we saw a reduction in the barking really quickly. After a few weeks of using the collar he has almost completely stopped barking through the night. The collar is really easy to put on and it is adjustable so we are able to put it on him quite comfortably. The collar adjusts itself to your dog so that they do not receive too great a shock or too small a shock that they do not notice. There is also a built-in limiter so that if the dog barks a lot in a small period of time it will stop so as not to cause harm with repeated shocks.Overall this is an excellent product for anyone who needs help to train a dog with problem barking. Well made with plenty of safety protocols in place.

"As my schedule has gotten more hectic recently I have read a number of books on stress reduction and this has been by far the best one. Stephen L Hunter has written a easy to read and understand guide that tells you how to prevent stress and if it does occur how you can reduce it.

"The Sheikh: The Search for Yaser Abdel Said: Vol. 2 is an excellent book with a varied and very interesting cast of characters. The author obviously has a good understanding of middle eastern politics and has really done his research making the book feel much more real and the story that much more relatable. Although this is a political thriller and categorised as such there are elements of the supernatural throughout the story including body swapping and Private Detective Bernard Piffy's various areas of expertise. There is also quite a large cast of historical figures turing up at different points in the book and each of them has been very well written to the point that although they are technically out of place they fit ver well with the narrative.Overall an excellent book and I am definitely​ going to go back and read the first (I did not realise this was Volume 2) and will look forward to any future releases.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2YDQ9QOU3BVUI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KGKF4NW#wasThisHelpful","R2YDQ9QOU3BVUI","A2P311B5U711NO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2P311B5U711NO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have done a few of those online personality tests in the past that you see on facebook just for fun really but recently a friend of mine told me a little of how they worked and it got me interested. I picked up this book for a more in-depth look at how and why they work and what that can mean for me. I was very impressed with the way this book as been written as this is a relatively complicated subject yet the author has broken it down into terms that someone with no prior knowledge like me could easily understand it. I really did identify a lot with what the author described and I can see from previous tests I have taken and my own experiences how accurate it is.Overall a very interesting book that has everything you need to know about INTJ and personality tests in general. Well written in clear and understandable language that anyone can understand.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R23I05AUBXN7DB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01592G908#wasThisHelpful","R23I05AUBXN7DB","A2P311B5U711NO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2P311B5U711NO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Fantasy has long been one of my favorite genres and over the last year I have really gotten into Steampunk style books. I love the imagery that comes with these types of stories when you can really picture the city like in Beasts of Tabat. The author has done a brilliant job of bringing the original and in-depth world to life on the page so it feels like you are really there. I was gripped from the very beginning and even though this book is a little longer than what I would usually read in one sitting I could not put it down.The story takes place in the city of Tabat at a time of change as the Duke is supposed to step down after 300 years of rule at the end of this year and allow a democracy to take his place. Teo and Bella are brilliant characters and you really root for them to succeed from the very beginning. Teo is part of a race that is hunted for who they are and Bellas continual victories in the magical gladiator contests haver caused long winters aggravating the powerful people of the city. Overall​ this is an excellent steampunk fantasy and will definately not be the last book I read by Cat Ramb.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R26STLQODO8DSI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UENRR8Q#wasThisHelpful","R26STLQODO8DSI","A2P311B5U711NO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2P311B5U711NO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Martian is one of my favorite all time Sci-Fi books and with the movie about to come out soon my book club decided to read it this month. I have been really pushed for time this month and not been able to re-read the who book so I picked up this companion book to refresh my memory. I was really impressed at the quality fo this summary and realised that I had actually missed a bit the first time reading which the author of the summary picked up on. the author has obviously read the original a number of times and paid real attention to every detail to include such an in depth summary.Ovall an excellent companion to The Martian perfect for refreshing your memory or to get an in-depth​ summary for book clubs, reports or just before the movie comes out.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RE0SSDU5VNCGX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015HSAZ0Y#wasThisHelpful","RE0SSDU5VNCGX","A2P311B5U711NO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2P311B5U711NO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I only read Go Set A Watchman recently after my friend had been bugging me for months to read it. Afterwards when discussing the book with them they seemed to have a much better understanding of the story than I did. I decided that instead of reading the whole book again I would look for a companion book and came across this one. After reading this I really felt I had a much better understanding of the story, the underlying themes and each character and their motivations.

"Dating a Hero is the third book I have read by Tirza Schaefer in as many days. As with the previous two I found that once I had started I could not put it down and finished the book in just one sitting. I liked the idea of their relationship starting on a dating site as this is becoming more and more common yet so few authors use it in their books. The characters are great and you genuinely want everything to work out for them as the story takes a few twists and turns that could potentially end their relationship.Overall a fantastic adult book with real substance.

"Birthday Present is the second book I have read by Tirza Schaefer and she really does have a talent for putting two characters that on first glance do not go together and really making them work. Tirza Schaefer is one of very few authors who write adult fiction that has actual depth, character progression and realistic dialogue. This is a genre filled with a lot of trash lately and it is refreshing to find a quality author who can write books with substance for actual adults. Chahna and Hunter are brilliant characters and it is great to see their relationship grow from their meeting in a bar in Germany. It is a whirlwind romance that you cannot help but get caught up in and swept away by. Overall an excellent book that any adult fiction fans will enjoy.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RLFI7CIE38G53/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015BONONY#wasThisHelpful","RLFI7CIE38G53","A2P311B5U711NO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2P311B5U711NO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Alvin Slater has a considerable library of books under his belt now and you would think that with over 50 titles to his name at this point and every one of them is excellent. Alvin Slater specialises in providing adult fiction with real plot, character development that is well written and almost impossible to put down. Legal Tender is no different with an interesting and gripping plot that has you hooked from the first page. Although there is a considerable age gap between Ava and Richard she knows what she wants and she is going to get it. A brilliant story that really sheds light on a relationship that many would consider odd or even wrong yet it really does work really well here.

"I love fantasy books and Lana Axe might just be one of my new favorite fantasy authors. At Rivers End has it all with excellent characters, a well written and interesting story with deep lore in an original and beautifully crafted world. River is a brilliant character that it is easy to get behind and you really do root for him throughout. Had I not started the book so late I would have finished it in one sitting as it was almost impossible to put down. I really liked how even though this was not the first story in this world or even with these characters I was not feeling lost at any point and understood what was going on perfectly.

"Born To Be Wild is an action packed and exciting book from start to finish. I actually read the whole book in one sitting as once I got a few pages in I couldn't put it down. I really liked how the author has woven quite a bit of humour into the story and how well written each character was especially Carry and Dan who at first appeared a bit incompatible but you see how well the work together very quickly in the story and really root for them throughout. Although the erotic scenes were excellent and very well written I liked how they were not the sole focus of the story and there was a solid plot behind it with plenty going on.Overall an excellent adult book that is very hard to put down once you start.

"A Killer Love Story is the first book I have read by Dennis Browne but I can definitely day it will not be the last. The author has an excellent writing style and what I really liked was how natural the dialogue feels throughout the book. Allison and Samantha are very different yet equally captivating and it is very enjoyable to watch how their relationship grows especially due to their mutual hatred of each other. This leads to a very interesting and complex relationship that grips you from the beginning.The thriller aspect of the story is equally well written as the author manages to keep you guessing without throwing red herrings at you every few seconds. Instead we are treated to a story that unravels slowly leading up to a fantastic ending that I highly doubt anyone will see coming. Overall a solid book that is very hard to put down. I just need to go and read the previous books that I have missed now.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R185NQTXKXUKL2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014DQ34FE#wasThisHelpful","R185NQTXKXUKL2","A2P311B5U711NO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2P311B5U711NO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Sci-fi is my favorite genre and has been since I was a child so I am always on the lookout for new series to get stuck into. Rebel lexis looks to be the start of a brilliant series that I am really looking forward to continuing after reading book 1. The author has a brilliant writing style and really knows sci-fi and how to draw you into this dystopian future so that it feels like you are really there. I really enjoy depictions of earth many years into the future when we are more or less gone and this book really shows off how earth can become very alien and different to the world we know now. Jason Bjorn is a great character who is easy to relate to, he wants to get ahead in life like we all do but is he ready for the challenge that awaits him on earth?Overall an excellent example of futuristic sci-fi and a promising start to the series.

Like many people my life can be hectic and stressful but the techniques in this book really do help a lot. They are very simple and easy to implement. Most of these I do most of the time but after reading this I am more mindful and try to do each more often.

As nearly everyone has a smart phone these days and most people take it everywhere we always have a camera at our disposal and this is definitely part of the reason we see so many selfies online.

"I read a lot both fiction and non-fiction. along with loads of articles online and often find that I have more bookmarked and put aside than I have time to read. usually I have just prioritised them and because of this there are a lot of things that I never get around to. This book is brilliant and has a number of different methods so there is something that will work for everyone inside. I found that a couple of the methods did not work for me but work for my partner and vice versa so I recommend trying them all out to find which suits you best.Overall a great book that will save you time and most importantly help you read more.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R45GPNHC9Y9BT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0147JIAZG#wasThisHelpful","R45GPNHC9Y9BT","A2P311B5U711NO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2P311B5U711NO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I play a lot of Scrabble-like games and I enjoy expanding my vocabulary both for these games and for everyday life. I picked this up thinking there would be at least a couple of words I had never heard of or did not really know the meaning of. Of course you can get this from a dictionary but the author here has collected together just 500 interesting ones so that you do not have to wade through the mundane to learn some new ones. I was actually pleasantly surprised at how much I actually took away from this book as there were a number of words that I had literally never seen before with interesting and sometimes a little obscure meanings.Overall a very interesting book that is kind of like the dictionary if you take out all the boring words and just keep the interesting or unusual ones.

"I picked this up as in previous years I have had similar books that I can read one Affirmation from each day. I have read through this one and as with others I read 1 each day. What I really like about this one is that it is categorised so I can pick a category that feels most appropriate on that day such as the Achieve Success category before work and read one of the affirmations there to start my day. I have always liked books like this as it is a great way to start your day with some positive reinforcement which you can then take forward and put into action throughout the day. It can be a great boost that can help you get through and make the most of every situation every day.Overall a great book that will give you a different affirmation each day for a year. If you have never tried a book like this before I highly recommend giving it a try and just reading one affirmation each day and keeping it in mind as you go about your business.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R37IIPTLZW77O2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0147KOCR0#wasThisHelpful","R37IIPTLZW77O2","A2P311B5U711NO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2P311B5U711NO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Myself, both my brothers and my son play a ton of Minecraft so I picked this up to read through with my son. We both really enjoyed this book and have read it multiple times since purchase as it has become on of his favorite books for bedtime. It is always difficult to get him off to computer and reading a book but as this one merges the two he was more than happy to read it the first time and it has since made him more willing to read more books.Overall if you children like Minecraft then this is the perfect book to get them interested in reading.

"To Kill a Mockingbird is one of those books that everyone has heard of and pretty much everyone will read at some point in their life. It is an excellent book and truly deserves its status.

This companions is very well written and as promised really does enhance your experience and understanding of the original book. I really liked the section on the characters of the story as the author of this companion has really delved deep into what motivated and drives them for a very interesting analysis.Overall if you are a fan of To Kill A Mockingbird then this companion book is for you.

"The Colony is an excellent sci-fi book which offers an action packed and believable vision of the future. The action scenes are smartly staged and really come alive on the page. The characters are brilliantly crafted and relatable. Pace Warner was my favorite as he has a kind of vigilante hero vibe about him but with a more grounded approach than superhero books. The plot is very fast moving from pretty early on and I actually finished the book in 1 sitting as I could not put it down.Overall a brilliant and creative sci-fi book.

"For an inexpensive mass marketed type of perfume, this is a really nice fragrance. The vanilla is more of a top note than the rose, making this more of a gourmand vs floral for me, which I love and prefer. It's not too heavy, and while the scent lingers, it's not overwhelming. It does have a great dry down, hinting at a warmth without losing the sweet.It's fairly long lasting, and a great benefit to the mass market nature of a Revlon scent is that its really geared towards a bigger crowd, meaning that I haven't gotten any complaints about this scent at work, or with my family.Add on the beautiful bottle, amazing price, all in all to my surprise, this is a wonderful addition to my fragrance arsenal.Love is on, and I love putting it on!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/ROFJSMX43XB0M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015QHS18Y#wasThisHelpful","ROFJSMX43XB0M","A5BJMAHZWGJ7N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A5BJMAHZWGJ7N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"While not a bad sunscreen face lotion, this is not my favorite. The texture is nice, it's thick but doesn't pull on the skin when spreading. It's got a nice citrus scent, and does a nice job of making my skin feel moisturized. However, it doesn't work well underneath my makeup, it gives my foundation the problem of early oxidation, and after about an hour my skin looks shiny. And while I have used it alone, it still feels slick in about an hours time.I love the pump dispenser, and the price per ounce is a value. But, it hasn't given my skin the promised boost of brightening, and is only okay on it's own.

"I drink a lot of coffee, and have a quite the travel and regular mug collection to contain and consume it all. This was a thoughtful gift from a student, and I adore it. For being double wall ceramic it's much lighter than other ceramic travel mugs I have, most likely because of the higher quality porcelain that Lenox is known for.My coffee stays hot longer than my regular ceramic mug, and about the same length of time in my Tervis. Being double walled ceramic there is a small hole on the bottom, I rarely have drips of condensed water, but when I have had it's small, and evaporates or wipes up quickly with a tissue. Hardly a deal breaker, and with hand washing I have not had any dripping problems.The design is beautifully fired onto the mug, very soothing with the blue and butterfly, but I really like the tiny little bee.The lid fits snugly, and I haven't had any lid popping off mishaps.The only negative to this beautiful, and well priced heirloom quality travel mug, is that while it says 12 oz, it's really more like 10.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R21V9LX8Q7HKX1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00H4F2E94#wasThisHelpful","R21V9LX8Q7HKX1","A5BJMAHZWGJ7N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A5BJMAHZWGJ7N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"First off this is made with the most cuddly and super soft material. It's like touching a cloud, it's thick and fluffy and the tactile part of me loves just touching it. Even without the heat element, it's a nice weight and feel for just using as a wrap/lap blanket. I use this typically at my desk wrapped shawl like around my shoulders. There is (ha, was) a huge satin tag that telling me which way is up, and other warnings, right smack dab in the most inconvenient of places, so I took my seam ripper and very gently removed it, no more irritating tag. (I did note which way is up in a tiny arrow with sharpie, because well, I can.)Yes it has those wire feeling heating 'coils' inside, but they don't bother me, especially since they keep me so comfy and warm. This has been an excellent, and much better alternative for me, then running a space heater.The size is generous without being too big or too small. The cord is long enough that I don't worry about it being in the way. My only downside to this wrap? The price tag. It seemed pretty expensive for a not even full size 'blanket.' Even I balked about it before realizing this solid justification: my office mate paid about the same price for an unheated shawl, and because it's outerwear not blink. She keeps it at her desk, does the same with it as I do, puts it on to keep off the chill, and rarely takes it outside the office, yet uses this while running a space heater. My Serta cuddler does the job of both her things, with less annoyance to other office dwellers who don't mind the temperature (or the green energy team who checks the office efficiency) with less energy usage and comfortable warmth by a low wattage plug in. Suddenly, the price is really good for a two in one product.Plus, price aside, it keeps me warm, comfortable and that is worth a lot while I'm working. Excellent heated wrap!","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2IP9CWEO8DKPI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013EHJQKU#wasThisHelpful","R2IP9CWEO8DKPI","A5BJMAHZWGJ7N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A5BJMAHZWGJ7N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is one of those instances where the actual product is better than in the picture. I liked the bold watch face, but worried that the hands and date would get lost in the black background. This worry was unfounded, not only are the hands/date/hourly markers very reflective, but the face is not a flat black. It picks up light, and even in low light settings I am able to easily see the time. This models styling reminds me of a classic vinyl record, with micro grooves, and is so much more interesting to look at. It is a larger size, but the casing is slim and the weight is light, but not flimsy feeling.Setting the time was simple, and even though the handsome, gifting worthy, packaging came with instructions I found them unnecessary. A half pull of the crown and you can set the date, a full pull of the crown and you set the time.The band did take me a moment. But, once I figured it out, it's easier than the standard leather strap. Instead of always having to find the right hole, you set the sizing and then it's an easy slip on, clip close, clasp. A gentle tug opens the mechanism, and I was pretty happy I didn't have to size any links!The time has held accurately, and when I accidentally left it on while taking a shower I was happy for the water resistant feature! No fog behind the glass, and no worse for wear from the water.Bottom line for me, Lucien Piccard has provided a luxurious watch, at an affordable price.

"This is a swift moving short story, which I really enjoyed because I was entertained and felt a sense of satisfaction when I finished. I found that for being short it still had a really well developed fantasy realm and while I read I remained fully immersed in the landscape.I enjoyed the wild ride through our lead heroines gripping beginnings, (giant creature fighting always works for me!), to her sense of moral right.Nothing too deep, but still really fun.

"This is an adorable addition to my sons toy box. The volume only has two settings, neither of which is too soft or too loud.The songs are cute, and the instruction booklet actually has the lyrics so you can learn them to sing along! i can't think of any other singing toy I've bought that has that, I really liked it because after hearing it enough times I always end up trying to ramble along with the music.The animal sections attach together easily with magnets, but also come apart fairly easily, which is nice for little fingers.He likes sliding the switch to different play/game choices, and it's easy to tap the animals to answers.Fun, functional, and adorable!","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R25A1CCFRKKVSK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZCZV1R4#wasThisHelpful","R25A1CCFRKKVSK","A5BJMAHZWGJ7N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A5BJMAHZWGJ7N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The game started off with display bugs from the start. Although the beginning animation was interesting, the framing was way off and continued to get worse as the game progressed.Soon the game controls suffered untill the game went to a quarter screen mode and crashed. Only made it to Act One before I couldn't stand the game problems any longer and this is when I uninstalled it. The game is huge in size weighing in at over 500MB, so the time downloading this game was wasted.I am running Android Lollipop; the game should run on it. This game is truly an illusion because it only appears to be a good game but plays as if it were in the alpha (beginning) stages of development where bugs are everywhere. Too bad as the game looked fun, but the horrible controls and crash bugs makes this unplayable.

"I was trying to make up my mind between the new Amazon Fire 7-inch tablet and the NeuTab Air7. After going back and forth on the decision for several days, I landed on the side of the NeuTab.First, a little background. We owned an Amazon Kindle Fire HD 7"" previously, and disliked the modified Android OS strongly due to having to jump through hoops to get it to play online videos by installing Dolphin browser and Flash Player, needing to installing apps so we could read ePub books, not being able to access the Google Play store, plus an ongoing problem where the tablet would not charge fully and show zero percent, it would occasionally turn off by itself, and other random glitches. All of these reasons pushed us to try Neutab.The NeuTab Air7 is a nice looking tablet that looks more expensive than its bargain basement price. The back is made out of brushed aluminum, which gives it a classy look, and the weight and size of it fits very well in the hand. The quad-core processor makes this tablet very responsive. Opening apps, streaming videos, playing games, and surfing the Internet are quick and snappy with no observable lag.Resolution on the screen is sharp, and details are nice and crisp. Although there are slightly higher resolution tablets out there in this class, you may find it hard to tell the difference. If you are a pixel wonk, this may bother you, but the 1024x600 pixel display is good. And we did compare it next to a higher resolution screen, and the difference is negligible, imho. The camera, both the front and rear, aren't high-end, but for quick snap shots, it'll do the job. Just don't expect iPad quality.Speaking of the screen, we saw an overall greenish/cyan tint over the whole display. This was particularly noticeable when viewing skin tones on movies or looking at photos; the colors weren't true overall. I like photography so color balance is important. However, I was able to fix this issue easily by simply downloading an app from the Google Play store that allows you to add color correction to the display. It worked perfectly and now all the colors are good.Speaking of Google Play, (nice segue, eh?) because this tablet runs on 100% Android and is not adulterated or customized in anyway, this means you get the full Android experience. You can access the huuuuuuge app library at the Google Play Store and get stuff you wouldn't otherwise be able to download if you were running a modified version of Android. This also means you're free of ""bloatware,"" programs, apps and features that you don't really want.The NeuTab Air7 runs on the latest version of Android, which is 5.0, aka Lollipop. I like the new settings interface, and other nice upgrades to it. Operationally, there are a few new things to learn, but if you're comfortable with Android, you'll be fine. You can add additional storage space by flipping open the flap located on the back of the tablet. A nice touch.The NeuTab Air7's volume isn't as loud as I would like, even at the full setting, but if you're just watching videos by yourself, it should be just enough for this purpose. If you want the full sound treatment, just bring out your own set of earphones, plug it in, and you're good to go. For the price, there is a lot of value here. Plus, this tablet has a 1-year warranty, unlike other tablets that only have a short 90-day period. This tablet was for a family member and I set it up for her. As a tech guy, I really like this tablet. And I liked her's so much that I am planning on buying one too.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R8JMPB94CCI64/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0152GNFXA#wasThisHelpful","R8JMPB94CCI64","A1TUUSQODOPXOE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TUUSQODOPXOE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've purchased a good number of aquarium heaters over the years and they were all variations of the same function and design, and has virtually remained unchanged for over five decades--a long tube, glass or plastic housing, with heating elements, which were then connected to some sort of thermostat circuitry. My last one, an Aqueon unit, malfunctioned and almost wiped out my whole tank's population because it overheated the aquarium and did not have a safety defeat mechanism. I lost 3 neon tetras, and two nerite snails in this incident and swore, (not verbally), that I would never use tube-type heaters again.Enter the Neo-Therm heater. I was struck by the new, sleek look; very modern and high tech. It wasn't a tube form factor, but was flat, which seems to provide more surface area to be in contact with the water.The LED readout is a great way to check on the water's temperature at a glance, and tells you whether you're up or down in the desired temperature you preset for the unit. One solid LED means your set temp and tank temp are the same. A flashing light before or after your set temp means it is higher or lower. To adjust the temp, you press a button located at the top of the heater, which is a bit difficult to push because it is small, and a bit slippery. But no biggie.Unlike tube type heaters, the numbers on the LED dial actually mean something, whereas, tube style heater numbers don't even correlate to the real temperatures at all, in most cases. All they do is act as a reference point for setting the temperature and this can be extremely inaccurate.I purchased the Neo-Therm and had it up and running in no time at all, not counting the recommended 15-minutes (or more) for the heater to calibrate itself when you first put it into your tank. After this I plugged it in and watched the LED dial display the water temperature. It already has a factory default temperature setting for 78 degrees F., so this makes it very easy to set up.This heater is solid-state, and according to the manufacturer, in the unlikely event that the unit fails, it will simply turn off, and not continue to heat the water. This feature alone makes the purchase worthwhile for me. The accuracy of the Neo-Therm is spot on as I verified the +/- 0.5 Fahrenheit degree accuracy of the unit with a digital thermometer. I was very impressed.The Neo-Therm is sturdy and the outer casing is made from shatter resistant plastic and should hold up for a very long time to bumps and bruises.There were a few issues though. The first unit I ordered was inaccurate to about 1-2 degrees and persisted in this false reading over two week's time. I return this unit, received a new one via Amazon's outstanding customer service, and the replacement unit is flawless.The second one is subjective and doesn't affect the Neo-Therm's functionality, but may be an issue for some. The temperature display numbers, which circle the LED readout from 66 to 96 degrees, are set in multiples of two, or in other words, all even numbers. So if your tank temperature is really 79 degrees F., the display will still show it as either 78 or 80, depending if it decides to round off up or down. So for OCD types, this may be a deal breaker.I've seen the Neo-Therm flash two numbers simultaneously, and perhaps this is the way it tries to show you the in-between numbers, but I only saw this happen once, and it happened with the unit that I returned, so it was probably a fluke. Maybe in the next software update, this could actually be a feature to show the ""tweener"" numbers.But outside of these two issues, I am very happy with the purchase. Yes, it is more expensive than other aquarium heaters, but if you total the cost of all the heaters you've bought over the years, and have failed or become inaccurate, this makes the Neo-Therm a bargain when you compare the price differentials and performance.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3KZN9L5G50KPX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008AGWZOK#wasThisHelpful","R3KZN9L5G50KPX","A1TUUSQODOPXOE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TUUSQODOPXOE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As simulations go for pinball, this isn't too bad. But it's really puzzling why the coders made this game so huge in app size--over 250MB, just for one table? It eats up too much memory, and I found that the graphics of the pinball playing area, while detailed, was just too small and busy to really see what was going on as you played. When you can't really even see the ball's action and where it is at any given moment, what's the point of playing?I have a good-sized 5"" screen display on my Android device, and even this larger screen wasn't enough to see everything clearly. I understand that there are a ton of user options to play this pinball game, but the primary goal of any good pinball game is being able to see the entire playing area clearly.

"I needed a good basic table vise in order to grip a watch case holder to change the watch battery. I didn't need anything fancy or something expensive that would cost $30 and upwards. As long as a vise was sturdy, reasonably priced, and worked, that would be my ideal. The SE 8436MVC 3"" universal table vice may have a pretty pedestrian name, but it delivers in functionality.This vise has a ball joint that allows you to tilt and angle the vise head in any direction you please. I needed a certain angle to apply pressure to the watch case back, and the feature of an adjustable vise head was perfect for what I needed to do. I applied quite a lot of pressure to the case back to unscrew it, and the vise held up well.The only minus to this was that because I was applying force at an angle by twisting, this moved the vise in the same direction and the table clamp slipped a bit. But by positioning the c-clamp against the table edge, this stabilized the unit. Another thing to watch out for is not to unloosen the ball clamp screw too much. I did this and the collar fell off. No biggie as I had to screw it back on, but it's a minor design flaw in the unit that could have been fixed by the manufacturer.The universal table vice has a solid feel to it and hopefully it will hold up over time. It's very handy and I plan to use it on other DIY projects. For under $20, this is a good buy.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1E96LZG3GQ3Q7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0013E2AQY#wasThisHelpful","R1E96LZG3GQ3Q7","A1TUUSQODOPXOE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TUUSQODOPXOE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"After reading the manual on how to set up the display unit and outdoor sensor, the instructions recommended that both units be allowed to equalize or settle down in temperature indoors. I calibrated both units to an accurate digital thermometer. However the requested 30 minute settling time seems to be way too short for the sensors to equalize. It's actually more in the range of 1 hour or more.However, after placing the outdoor unit on a garage door post that was shaded by an eave, the sensor was off by as much as six degrees higher than the digital thermometer. It turns out that outdoor sensor placement is critical in getting an accurate reading because it is very sensitive to ambient heat sources including the wall it is mounted to. This in effect is good and bad news. Good because it is accurate to even slight temperature fluctuations. Bad because it will be inaccurate since it can pick up stray heat from its mounting source.The solution to this is to either hang the sensor from a string or fishing line or hang it from a long nail, but in both cases the sensor should not be touching any surface and should be free standing, if at all possible.But after dialing in the calibration feature for the display, both sensors are spot on in their readings now. The display, as some have pointed out, is very detailed. Some complain that it is too busy, but I like all the info it displays and I feel that this layout is much better than most of the other weather stations that I have seen. It displays the daily high and low historical readings for temperature and humidity, shows the historical data for barometric pressure, shows indoor and outdoor temperatures, current indoor and outdoor humidity, gives a trend indication on whether the temperature is going up or down, and even a ""weather forecaster"" that gives a guess of weather conditions in the next day or two. And of course, there is the display that visually tells you what comfort zone you are in as it relates to the temperature via different lighted colored backgrounds.I only have my indoor console running on batteries, and the LCD display is crisp and sharp. I don't use the colored back-light much, so I do not need to plug the unit in to use this feature. I can always just tap the ""light"" button and see the colored display for a few seconds.Setting the unit up was pretty straight forward and not very complicated if you take your time. Some may feel there are too many button presses to change the various setting displays, but the setup is pretty logical. And if you forget what does what, the manual is clear on what you need to do to change the parameters.Once you understand that the outdoor sensor placement is critical to accurate readings, you're golden. Customer support for the WS-11 is excellent and they will help you with any problems on the setup or questions you may have.But one thing should be made clear to any wonks or OCD types out there; this weather station is accurate to within certain parameters and does a very good job of it, and shouldn't be expected to perform with the precision of professional meteorological instruments. If you understand this, this unit is great for what it is was intended for. I like it a lot and refer to it for biking weather conditions in order to dress properly for my daily rides.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3BJ2PT6MM2S5T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LY9E3Z4#wasThisHelpful","R3BJ2PT6MM2S5T","A1TUUSQODOPXOE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TUUSQODOPXOE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This unit has a lot going for it. It has great styling, and an assortment of very good features that any fitness tracker should have. But unfortunately, this is where all the good news stops. After charging up the unit, and following the instructions for ""pairing"" or syncing the band with a bluetooth device, the unit failed to link. I tried this on two different Android devices that were supposed to be compatible, according to the minimum requirements, but the device never was able to function as it was supposed to.The Pivotal Tracker is really a nice looking unit, but because it failed to link with my devices, it basically was useless. That's too bad, because it would have been a really great alternative to the other expensive fitness bands out there. Perhaps in version 3.0, the dev team will be able to make this device more compatible with a larger variety of Android devices.

"I've tried other bicycle saddles that were padded with gel, foam, and other substances to make the ride more comfortable, but although they promised a better experience, they never seemed to fulfill expectations. The Vader Road/Offroad MTB bike saddle was, I must admit, selected because of it's fantastic looks, and the very reasonable pricing.This bike saddle is the first skinny seat that I have tried, and honestly, I didn't know how it would feel, nor did I think it would be really that comfortable. But the majority of reviews here were positive so I took a chance and ordered one.First off, the styling of this seat is outstanding as the red and black accents, with the white background are very eye-catching and high-tech. The design matches perfectly with the look of my bicycle's red frame, white highlights, and black graphics.OK, so how does it fit/feel? After about a month of riding on this seat, I'd have to say that it is comfortable, when compared to the others I have tried. This was surprising to me as it is a narrow road bike type of seat, and I didn't think that there would be enough padding to produce a good ride. But the design of the seat helps to distribute the weight nicely, and I can ride on the Vader without being raw or sore.It took a few weeks of tweaking the seat's angle, fore and aft position, and height, but after I dialed this in, the seat performs fine. The reason why it doesn't rank a perfect 5-stars is because while it is comfortable, I can still feel a bit of pressure, and this may become an issue during longer rides--but time will tell. But as an overall replacement seat, I would have to say that the Vader is an excellent value for anyone who wants a better ride.The Vader certainly is more comfortable than even the $40 saddles I have purchased, and that's saying something about getting your money's worth. I think Luke would approve of this seat for his Skycycle.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RR8KVV3SG3G70/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RF6KHUA#wasThisHelpful","RR8KVV3SG3G70","A1TUUSQODOPXOE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TUUSQODOPXOE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have an old Aquaclear 20 that served me well for many years, but the filtering ability of the unit started to go downhill, and the water never was as clear as I wanted it to be. Fine particles seemed to be beyond its ability to filter out. Hence I was on a search for a better filter.The Fluval series can be considered an upgrade to the workhorse Aquaclear series. I purchased the Fluval 20 as a replacement for my old filter. Setting it up was easy and straight forward, however after firing it up, water seemed to be leaking from it. Luckily I stayed around to see how it was operating, or many gallons of water would have ended up on the floor. After closer inspection, I found a substantial crack on the side of the filter, which was the culprit. I immediately sent in for a replacement by Amazon, and to its credit, the new unit arrived in a day. Another testimonial to the excellent customer service provided by Amazon.The second installation went as easy as the first, but with more caution on my part this time. The new unit had no cracks or defects and has been running efficiently for several days now. The water had a haze, due to very small particulates that couldn't be filtered with the old Aquaclear 20, but after 3 days, the water is crystal clear.I like the way this filter is compartmentalized for each filter medium, which means I can just pull out the carbon section, filter section, bio-stars, or bio-screen without disturbing the other three. The Aquaclear 20 had to have all three filter sections pulled out at once to exchange one of the media, and this left a horrible backup of debris being pumped back into the tank. Not a good thing and very unsightly.There seems to be conflicting reports as whether these filters are quiet or noisy. I happen to be in the camp that says it is quiet. When starting up the filter, whether for the first time or when stopping it for feeding or maintenance, the noisiness does happen, but this seems to be the result of air being stuck in the filter. The impeller churns the air trapped in the system and this produces the noise. All that needs to be done is to make sure that the filter is completely filled with water (you can trickle some into the top of the filter as it's starting up) and this allows the air to be purged. You might have to quickly plug and unplug the filter several times to expel the trapped air. I also added a dab of Vaseline, as suggested by others. on the impeller shaft to help keep things lubricated.Maintenance for this filter is a breeze, and the fact that you can rinse out the polyfoam filter (not in tap water, but treated water that has the chlorine neutralized so as not to kill off the beneficial bacterial) will save on costs. As a side note, my old Aquaclear 20 motor seems to be a direct twin of the Fluval 20 one, so I'll keep the old motor/impeller assembly as a back up for the Fluval.The Fluval C2 is working exceptionally well, and the fish, (and the fish hobbyist, me) are having a great time. One star is deleted from this otherwise high rating due to an apparent lack of quality control or substandard packaging of the filter, as the first one I received was defective with a 3-inch crack down the side. Interestingly enough, another review described the same exact crack location and leak as I had on my filter. I wonder if the defective one was somehow recycled and resold? I guess I'll never know.If you're looking for a very good filter that will keep your aquarium water looking crystal clear, assuming that all your other water parameters are decent such as pH, nitrate levels, ammonia levels, and nitrite levels, the Fluval C2 should work well for you.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R25QBH8N5YMT3B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003SJOLEQ#wasThisHelpful","R25QBH8N5YMT3B","A1TUUSQODOPXOE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TUUSQODOPXOE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"We've used all types of air purifiers and filters over the years, from the trendy ion types to regular HEPA filter units. These did a somewhat mediocre job at cleaning and filtering the air, but the Honeywell 20250 outperforms them all with visible results.We set up the unit in a corner of our living room, which is adjacent to the home office. There is no separating wall, but only a couch, so the space this air purifier does double duty and covers both spaces. After only a day of running the Honeywell, our family members stopped sneezing. The visual results were just as impressive. Light that comes into the main hallway through a window in the front door is longer is visible. By this I mean that the sunbeams, which are nothing more than light being bounced off of stray dust, were completely gone. The air was fresh and clean.Family members have commented that the house smells cleaner and fresher and is void of the usual house odors that were lingering in the air. Everybody is very happy with this purchase.The only downsides to this filter, and this has been mentioned by others, is that this powerful filter produces a high amount of sound. I wouldn't call it noise as much as a very noticeable fan exhaust sound. Think of it as a mighty rush of wind that is confined to a small area. On low setting, it is fine, but as you go higher, the wind noise can be loud enough to make television watching impractical.What many people have done is to set the fan power to either medium or high when no one is at home, and then turn down the fan to the lowest setting when everyone is at home, or just turn it off completely when viewing television or listening to music.The other negative is that after a month of using this air filter virtually 24/7, is that our electricity bill has jumped up about $20. Our only conclusion is that the Honeywell uses quite a bit of energy. If you are an especially energy conscious person, this may be a deal killer.The Honeywell 50250 is a powerful unit that will clean, scrub, and filter the air in your house or apartment. Not only will your environment be better, you'll see less dust too.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R20IQO7XKE3WIL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00007E7RY#wasThisHelpful","R20IQO7XKE3WIL","A1TUUSQODOPXOE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TUUSQODOPXOE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Bicycle enthusiasts come in all shapes, sizes, and income levels, but Bicycling Magazine seems to think that the only ones out there are people who have gobs of discretionary income and can purchase bikes that cost $5,000 and upwards. Most of the content in this magazine is very limited and narrow in scope because it reaches only into expensive aspects of bicycling. What about all of us ""regular"" bicycle fans who spend a grand or less on a bike?The editorial staff believes everyone out there is a millionaire, hence all the articles on expensive bikes and gear. One recent article centered on extravagant, very expensive services related to customized bike fitting, while another issue listed the top road bikes--virtually all of them $6,000 and much more.Unfortunately, this magazine has become an elitist publication singing the praises of over-the-top equipment and has failed to reach into the hearts and minds of your average bicycling citizen that likes to ride to and from work, for exercise, and for fun and is looking for good articles related to good moderately priced bikes and accessories. For some reason Bicycling Magazine has some sort of phobia against any product that has an affordable price. 10 times out of 10 they will recommend a $350 bike jacket and not mention similar products that cost just $70, for instance. In this magazine, price (high price) is king.Bicycling Magazine has taken a wrong turn somewhere and has lost its way. Many of us love bicycling, but the editorial staff has decided to exclude a major number of us, and has instead, turned this into a publication that is aimed at the snobbish and elitists.I suppose the proper quote for this sort of behavior comes from Marie Antoinette when her poor citizens where just getting by while she lived in luxury...""Let them eat cake!"" Easy to say when the people didn't even have bread. Bicycling Magazine is the Marie Antoinette of bicycle magazines and has lost touch with the general public.","2.0 out of 5 stars","January 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2CU20G56CPTDI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00005NINB#wasThisHelpful","R2CU20G56CPTDI","A1TUUSQODOPXOE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TUUSQODOPXOE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My original review of HR Block Deluxe was rated by me with 2-stars. However the main reason for this low review was the program's inability to import TurboTax data.

"I used to buy the KAL brand of pure stevia, but it cannot be considered pure any longer as the product now contains maltodextrin, the highest glycemic index for any sugar or sweetener. Not a very good product for those trying to avoid sugar.The Now Foods Organic Stevia was my fallback plan and as of now, I am very pleased with the product's purity, taste, and price. The bottle is bigger than the KAL brand and also lacks the handy scoop found in KAL products, but this is a minor setback and I just used an old scoop from my previous KAL stevia.You do need to use more to get the equivalent sweetness of the KAL product, but since there is more of the product in the bottle, I suppose it all evens out in the long run. I actually prefer the taste of the Now Foods stevia as it tastes very similar to sugar and doesn't have a bad aftertaste. It does linger after you use it, but it's sweet, and not bitter like other brands.As long as Now Foods keeps its price competitive to the KAL brand, I will be a repeat customer.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2G5NL4OVQ860W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005F9XFN0#wasThisHelpful","R2G5NL4OVQ860W","A1TUUSQODOPXOE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TUUSQODOPXOE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Successful businesses always under-promise and over-deliver. However, judging from Intuit's unintuitive actions, they have actually OVER promised and UNDER delivered. A fantastic recipe for failure and anger from formerly loyal customers.It would have been a better idea to just up the price a bit rather than disabling features and passing it on as though it was the same product from previous years. Sure, you can say just read the label, but there was a certain amount of trust that was built up over the years between Intuit and its users...TurboTax Deluxe has always worked the same way, except for this year, that is..Forms C, D and E are no longer available and you must now upgrade to either Premier or Home and Business versions, depending on your needs.Basically, it's no longer a matter of paying more for the functionality that used to be TurboTax Deluxe, it is now a matter of confusing the issue by selling a product under the same name, same price, but with major features disabled. This is neither smart business nor good PR, as can be seen by the many negative comments written here.But it goes further than just people being mad about this ""bait and switch"" tactic, what this means is Intuit has burned its bridges and have presented themselves as untrustworthy. What other changes are coming down the road that will affect customers adversely?Let's put this simply: If Intuit staff were used to going to a favorite restaurant and were used to ordering their favorite entrees year after year, and suddenly found that the dishes they ordered all had less food, and was missing important ingredients and food components, how long do you think it would be before they left and never came back? And on top of this, the owner of the restaurant says, ""But you can get the same ingredients, food components, and quality if you only pay two times more for our new improved dishes!""Buh bye.I am sure Intuit felt that it had a good reason for doing what it did, but it wasn't a good decision as far as I'm concerned. I have been a long time user of TurboTax, but this recent debacle has left me feeling cold and disappointed with a company that I have trusted for years. A quick fix may be in the works to get a free upgrade to a version that works, but the irreparable damage done to this company's reputation has not only angered its users, but has started a wave of bad feelings and distrust that will take years to repair. Remember, one dissatisfied customer tells 10 people, and those 10 people tell more people. Intuit, you cannot afford this kind of bad publicity.Someone dropped the ball on this, and whoever it is, needs to step back and return the full functionality of TurboTax Deluxe for next year's version, or risk losing even more customers. Intuit needs to also whip (or fire) the programmers or lead programer that cannot find a way to make cross-platform versions for TurboTax work smoothly. It's not rocket science guys.At this stage of the game, H&R Block's Premium or Deluxe version may be the way to go for disgruntled TurboTax users such as myself. I was tempted to take the free upgrade offer by calling TurboTax, but thought differently about taking this course of action because of the dirty tactics by Intuit. I may get the freebie this year, but what about next year when I have to pay full price or get more features deleted?I will drop TurboTax this year and will be switching to HR Block Deluxe, which covers all the schedules formerly in TurboTax Deluxe, to see if it works; I have already ordered it. It's worth the risk in order to move away from TurboTax and Intuit's customer angering policies. They have to make a profit, and this is understandable. What isn't understandable is the sneaky and underhanded way they did this. They have lost my trust and it will be hard for them to win it back, if ever again, as I'm sure other former TurboTax users will agree.I will provide an update on HR Block Deluxe here after I receive it. Look for the in-depth review on HR Block Deluxe in the coming weeks.UPDATE ON HR BLOCK DELUXE: 1/12/2014-----------------------------------------I just installed HR BLOCK DELUXE in lieu of my usual TurboTax Deluxe product. HR BLOCK states that this version is compatible for Windows all the way to XP with SP3. After installation, which was very easy, I was presented with the option to import last year's TurboTax income tax data. It was able to search and find this file automatically, but after I hit the ""import"" button, I received an error message that stated:""HRBLOCK has encountered a problem and needs to close. We are sorry for the inconvenience.""Apparently, after doing a search on the Internet, this seems to be a bug in the software when running on XP machines. HR BLOCK has not given an official fix date for this, nor an official statement, although some users said they were promised a fix from the 1/9/2014 update release. However, this did not solve the problem. The next update is scheduled for 1/22/2-14 from HR BLOCK, but no word as to whether or not this will fix the import bug.As I am typing this update, I have been online waiting for a chat representative to explain and offer some sort of fix date for this bug. I am number 10 on the waiting list, and it has been almost an hour and I am still waiting. (I am doing other computer related work while waiting). I also tried calling HR BLOCK's customer service number and was put on hold for over 15 minutes, when I decided to hang up.So far, this experience with HR BLOCK has not been stellar. I do NOT want to return to TurboTax Deluxe, but if HR BLOCK drops the ball on this, it will have lost my confidence, as well as many other former TurboTax users regarding the inability to import TurboTax data as promised. If you are running Windows XP, you may want to hold off buying HR BLOCK DELUXE until a fix for the import function is available, and hopefully, this will be soon.UPDATE 1/12/2014 CHAT Session with HR BLOCK REP----------------------------------------------------Here's a transcription of the chat session I just had after waiting one hour and 20 minutes to chat with an HR Block rep. The results aren't very inspiring for customer support there. The rep's name has been replaced to protect the guilty, other info has been changed to protect the innocent. The dialogue is funny and tragic. Read the part about ""TT.""-----------------------HR REP.: Hello ----, welcome to H&R Block Tax Product Support!

But unfortunately, this hasn't been a very good start with the HR Block product.Is there a fix for this from HR Block, and how long will it be till the update fix is available, if at all?

The fix worked perfectly and I was able to complete my taxes with HR Block Deluxe. The session went smoothly, the e-filing of both my federal and state tax forms went without a hitch. As of now, I am an HR Block convert and have dropped Turbo Tax Deluxe as my go-to tax preparation software.Intuit's incessant agenda of taking advantage of its customers, its highly confusing product line, and the constant juggling of its prices for its products has left me with a large confidence hole in ever doing business again with Intuit and its Turbo Tax products.","1.0 out of 5 stars","January 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1IS9PO06XNWT2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NG7JVSQ#wasThisHelpful","R1IS9PO06XNWT2","A1TUUSQODOPXOE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TUUSQODOPXOE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"We had an abundance of thick branches and shrubbery in our back yard, and considered hiring a professional gardener to take care of this for us. But as most people know, cutting or pruning a tree can cost you an arm and a leg when it comes to hiring professional help, so we decided to take things into our own hands, literally, by purchasing the GreenWorks G-Max 40V pole saw. We had considered purchasing one from one of the store brands at a home improvement center (rhymes with bowls...) but the unit looked heavy and was more expensive than the GreenWorks.We were struggling to make the decision between a battery operated one and one that plugged into an electrical outlet with an extension cord. After using the GreenWorks battery powered model, we feel that this is the only way to go. But if you do select a battery operated pole saw, be sure that it is at least a 40V unit, as the lesser units may not give you enough power or run time.This was our first experience with this type of equipment, and to tell you the truth, we were a bit apprehensive about using such a powerful tool. We read the instructions thoroughly, and assembled the thing in less than  5-minutes. After checking that all the fittings were secure, we went out to the backyard to attack the dead branches and trees. To our surprise, the GreenWorks saw was very easy to use and provided more than enough power to cut three to four diameter branches with ease. We'll be tackling the 6-inch dead tree trunk later this week.When we assembled the pole saw, we attached all the segments ( three of them) together and it was very long and a bit unbalanced because of all the top weight on the pole saw end. But the battery at the other end helps to even out the weight a little.What we didn't know, after reading further in the manual, is that you can shorten the overall length dramatically by just attaching two of the segments instead of all three. The manual writers could have saved everyone some trouble if they had pointed this fact out in the beginning of the instructions before they tell you to assemble the entire thing with the three sections.After about 35 minutes of pruning, cutting, and trimming, the battery power only went down by 25 percent--pretty amazing. The 40v battery also provided more than enough power to drive the pole saw to allow it to cut through the thick branches. The chain stretches a bit when using it for the first time, but adjusting the tension on the chain was extremely easy to do. This was one of our concerns about operating a pole saw, but the process was problem free and any future adjustments should be just as smooth. Adding chain oil to the reservoir was also easy. The little translucent window on the side of the saw lets you know when to add more oil. After the first session of use, we used about 25% of the total amount.One tip that I was made aware of is to have the saw running before you start cutting, and not to start it while it is resting on a branch or tree trunk. Doing the latter can jerk the saw out of your hands as the teeth of the saw pull away from you due to the friction between the teeth and the wood. The saw is powerful, so always maintain a good grip, and wear eye protection when using it.In thirty-five minutes of use, the GreenWorks pole saw literally paid for itself many times over by us not having to hire a professional gardener. It's convenient to use, and we no longer have to depend on someone else to address our more serious backyard/garden needs. We're pretty happy with this pole saw and would recommend it to those with similar needs like ours.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1MCVSFTYNZ4JS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AW72WR0#wasThisHelpful","R1MCVSFTYNZ4JS","A1TUUSQODOPXOE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TUUSQODOPXOE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This case was the perfect solution for protecting a family member's previous generation Kindle Fire. The fit is perfect, the case looks very sharp, and it seemed to do a good job of protecting the device...right up till when it developed a crack at the back of the case for no apparent reason.The case wasn't abused and occasionally received the standard bumps and jostles that every case is expected to encounter. But after less than a year's use, a small crack about 4-inches developed.The case is good, but it can't seem to hold up under normal wear. Since the return time has past, we are stuck with it. Too bad, it could have been a contender.If you're looking for a good case, you may want to be careful about this one and make sure you don't bump it too hard as it seems a bit sensitive to these jars.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RPHLLSEJIZO2W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CPTE9CE#wasThisHelpful","RPHLLSEJIZO2W","A1TUUSQODOPXOE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TUUSQODOPXOE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Needed to upgrade my mountain bike and the first order of business was to replace the plastic pedals. I considered  buying a more colorful set by Fyxation or Odyssey, which are good products, but I was able to score a real deal on the Wellgos at an auction site for only a few dollars more, so the decision was a no-brainer.First off, I'm an urban mountain biker, if there is such a term, lol. I primarily ride on the streets, which are filled with cracks, bumps, potholes, and uneven pavement. The bike does a good job of handling this terrain, and for my purposes, the Wellgos do a great job of keeping my feet planted on the studs.The pedals seem very well made, and I was surprised that they were heavier than I expected. Not a big deal since I don't count ounces on my bike. The paint finish (I bought the silver ones), which I was most concerned about, is holding up well, with no flaking or chipping. If you ride hard, the paint will probably go bye-bye, but for ""regular"" biking, the finish does great.These pedals feel and perform solidly. The bearings are sealed and don't make a sound when pedaling. When you try to spin the pedals by hand, you can feel a bit of resistance from the grease the ball bearings are packed in, which is a good thing.These pedals came with reflectors, which saved me about 8 bucks by not having to buy them separately. There were no replacement studs in the deal, but after tightening them all down before my first ride with them, they shouldn't fall out.Pretty happy with these pedals. They look great and seem to be of good quality. If it weren't for the great deal I got for these, I would have probably opted for the plastic pedals--but I'm glad I didn't.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R195Q1XI1E3UUP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00E7UZ7FM#wasThisHelpful","R195Q1XI1E3UUP","A1TUUSQODOPXOE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TUUSQODOPXOE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I wanted a basic, good bike rack at a reasonable price. The Allen Sports Deluxe 2-Bike Rack seemed to fit the bill. The main gripe I have with this device is that the video demo was somewhat untruthful in its presentation. The supporting struts that attach to the frame are not as easy to attach as it shows in the video. It took quite a lot of force to get the pins lined up with the ports.The strap system was also confusing. The written instructions advice you to wrap and tie the straps a certain way, which doesn't really work. It took a while before I figured out that the standard pull and stretch way was the best way to do this.The rack is sturdy, and for the price it's a pretty good deal.This is advertised as a two-bike rack, but the space separating the mounting areas for bikes is extremely small, and putting two bikes together will be a challenge. It should also be noted that the maximum weight this rack can carry is only 70 pounds. This may be a problem for two department store bikes as these can easily exceed this limit.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2F3TS0DZH9GTT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ASSQYK4#wasThisHelpful","R2F3TS0DZH9GTT","A1TUUSQODOPXOE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TUUSQODOPXOE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Pretty nice lamps. They're smaller than the humongous fluorescent lanterns I used to have, but they produce more light and use less batteries than the old ones did. And they're much lighter as well and can be kept anywhere without taking too much space.The only thing I'm concerned with is the constant flashing LED that helps you to locate the device when the lights are out. This is a nice feature, but I wonder if this slowly depletes the power in my batteries. Too bad it doesn't have an option to turn this light off.Overall, a good lantern at a pretty reasonable price.

"After more than two-weeks of trying this saddle out, and really wanting to like it, the final results are in and my butt says it didn't work at all for comfort, although the advertising states that the saddle would give ""unparalleled comfort for cycling."" This didn't happen for me, unfortunately.The saddle is very well made, and it did provide some very strong ventilation in the nether parts of my anatomy, but after adjusting the fore and aft position of the seat, the angle, and just about everything else I could think of, the rides on this saddle ended up producing soreness at best and pain at the end of the ride at worst.I don't doubt that others have good experiences with this seat, but for me, it didn't meet the stated effects or the comfortable ride the manufacturer promised. But although the price was more expensive than other seats, and should have provided better performance in comfort, it was less comfortable than saddles costing half as much.In the long run, YMMV.","2.0 out of 5 stars","August 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R6ZPUQNENRRN1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009O0CZYG#wasThisHelpful","R6ZPUQNENRRN1","A1TUUSQODOPXOE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TUUSQODOPXOE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Well, what can I tell you? My first review of this item was three stars due to the ""fact"" that it seemed no more comfortable than my stock seat. I tried adjusting the saddle every which way but loose, but the final result was a sore bottom and a ride that couldn't be tolerated for more than 40 minutes before my derriere screamed ""Stop!""This prompted a quick change to another more expensive saddle that promised more comfort and 40% less pressure points. The seat height was also extended a bit to improve my biking position. After two weeks, this alternative saddle was sheer agony no matter the tilt or fore and aft positioning.I switched back to the Planet Bike A.R.S. saddle, and the results were much better. It's almost a year since I purchased this bike seat and it has been an improvement over the original seat that came with my bike. But after a year's worth of riding on it, the comfort it provides is just average. An improvement, no doubt, but not as comfy after a year as I would expect.As with all bicycle saddles, YMMV and one seat that is comfortable for some will be uncomfortable for others. My search continues for a truly comfortable bike seat.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2BUQDHFFI3FGP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000C17L2W#wasThisHelpful","R2BUQDHFFI3FGP","A1TUUSQODOPXOE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TUUSQODOPXOE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Well, simply put,this little tool may save you hundreds of dollars in teeth cleaning bills if your pet doesn't mind you poking around in its mouth.Fortunately, our dog didn't mind, and on the first use, there were gobs of tartar, (gross, I know) that was scraped off. We're pretty  conscientious about brushing his teeth, and was surprised at how much gunk we were able to remove.This tool will save us some trips to the vet, and also keep him from going under anesthesia when he went in for teeth cleaning, which we really didn't like.The only downside is that the price suddenly jumped upward because it was becoming a popular item.

"Not exactly for beginners although the author has made a strong attempt to reach this crowd. The first quarter of the book is dedicated to general information about bicycles, how they work, and different styles of bikes. If you like background info, Todd Downs does a pretty decent job of it.The rest of the book is broken down into the various sections and functions of the bike and goes into more detail on how to service specific items, how to troubleshoot, and some advice on bike maintenance.Overall, it's an OK book, but it's a toss up on whether it will be an effective reference book for you or not. While the mechanically gifted will get the most out of this book, for beginners the book falls short on levels of being a bit too complex, being too wordy when more graphics or photos would be more appropriate, and sometimes leaving out details that may be obvious to seasoned bike repair artists, but can be missed quite easily by new comers.Glad I purchased it used and not new.

"I only gave this product a 3-star review previously, but I have to admit, the reason why it didn't work as well as I expected it to was because of user error. The D-Cells I used to power the unit were fresh, or so I thought. It turns out that they were not, and were almost depleted because they were sitting in a lantern which eventually drained them.When the battery finally wore out, I replaced it with a new battery, and it instantly worked like a charm. I was able to drain a gallon jug of water into my aquarium in a matter of seconds. I now use it for water changes and it does a great job. I don't drain the water out of my tank with it, as the gravel could get sucked into the drive blades, but replacing the water back works a lot better and stresses out the fish less than pouring the water from the gallon containers.This suction device works better than some units I've seen that cost three times as much at the local pet stores.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R25KXS2P7ZCPJ1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00318D7K8#wasThisHelpful","R25KXS2P7ZCPJ1","A1TUUSQODOPXOE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TUUSQODOPXOE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The problem with six-outlet electrical plugs is that you rarely can use all six. Somehow, the electrical engineering wizards who design these things place the outlets way too close to each other, which basically defeats the purpose of using any appliances or electronics devices that have odd shaped adapters.In the case of the Belkin Pivot Wall Surge Protector, the design is spot on with six outlets; each outlet can be independently swiveled. Other swivel outlets only let you swivel a bank of three at a time, which basically presents the same problem as a standard flat six-plug wall mount--you can't fit all your devices because the plugs are too close together.This Belkin provided enough space to use every one of the outlets for my electronic gadgets. The most offending shaped one wasn't even an AC adapter, but a very large, round nightlight that hogged up two spaces. But with the Belkin Pivot, I just simply swiveled the outlet 90 degrees, and voila, problem solved.This product gets one star less not because it doesn't perform well, but it is quite expensive when compared to the other six-plug non-movable  outlets.But on the flip side, it does give you total access to all six plugs, plus it offers some safety advantages by not having some of your AC adapters precariously hanging on by a tread because they don't exactly fit.There's a screw that you can attach to the wall plate to keep the Belkin Pivot nice and secure, which is also a nice touch.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ZGRIPZYEB1JA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000JE7GPY#wasThisHelpful","R2ZGRIPZYEB1JA","A1TUUSQODOPXOE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TUUSQODOPXOE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"For an entry-level tablet, it's an OK selection, but those who want more freedom in configuration should look elsewhere.The tablet performs well for surfing, playing games, and reading books. Wi-Fi connection is always solid, and the heavily modified Android operating system is locked in to the Amazon universe. You won't be able to access any apps from the million or so that are available on the Google Play Store.Out of the box you won't be able to play flash video content either. This means you won't be able to view videos on websites, YouTube content, and other video related stuff. Big omission. You can get around this but it takes a bit of searching the web and finding the answers to do this. If you like reading ePUB books from your library, forget about this too. Again, there is a way around this, but it isn't entirely apparent.After about a year and a half, the Kindle Fire would suddenly shut off for no reason at all. It could never go past 47% without turning itself off. Called tech support at Amazon and all they did was read a pre-printed statement to me about resetting the device, which I already did. The long and short of it was that I solved the problem after searching, again, the Internet for a fix. However, the tablet still turns itself off occasionally due to this glitch.I'm pretty disappointed with the product and the usually great customer service by Amazon. The rep told me, ""I have no record of this sort of problem."" Really. Just read your own forum here and see the hundreds of individuals having this problem.This tablet had great potential but due to the wonky operating system, the amount of work you need to whip it into shape, and the faulty product, I think 2-stars is being pretty generous.This tablet was for a family member, and were it not for all this fussing with it, the thing would not work at all, sad to say.No more Amazon tablets for me, my friends, or my family.

"This is a very nice scale to look at. It has nice, large numerals, and the glass designed is liked by everyone in the family. However, it has a serious design flaw. I keeps the reading of your last measured weight in its memory for at least a minute. What this means is that if you weigh yourself carrying something heavy, the scale will still read out its last measurement.I was wondering why the manufacturer suggested this in the instructions:""We generally recommend that you weigh yourself no more than once a week when you're dieting.""Really? This seemed crazy to me. Now I know why. People will complain, and have complained, about this scales inaccuracy, which is probably due to this memory problem.We've adapted to this defect, and repeated weighings means waiting about a minute and sometimes less, between sessions.We checked this scale against another brand that was more expensive, and without the memory defect, and after about 20 minutes of testing, this scale works fine and gives accurate readings within its limitations.This scale would have easily received a 5-star rating if not for the memory defect. What is totally ironic about all of this is that this scale is approved by Weight Watchers.

"There are lots of models of meat thermometers out there, and this can make your head spin because of all the selections. But I picked this model out of the crowd because I liked the looks of it. I know--not very scientific, but I figured, since Norpro made a lot of kitchen gadgets and accessories, it might be worth a try.The Norpro meat thermometer has a very long sensor that measures 8-inches and is great for keeping your hands away from a hot pan, stove, or bbq grill.The digital display is great and is large and easy to read. I especially like the seven preset modes on it--all you have to do is to select the type of meat you are cooking and the gauge automatically screens up the proper target temperature and the real-time temperature. The reading comes up extremely fast--about two or three seconds. The Norpro also has a ""user"" mode that just reads the temperature without any presets.I tested the accuracy of this unit in a cup full of ice and it read 32 degrees--right on the mark.As an added bonus, the device gives off an audible ""beep"" when the meat reaches the proper degrees. For beef there is a setting that allows you to select the option of medium rare, medium, or well done.This meat thermometer, when compared to others, has a great deal of features not found on devices costing much more.As to the review that claims that this device melts--there is no way that this can happen under normal circumstances. My guess is that the reviewer accidentally melted the device by leaving it in the oven while cooking, or left it over the bbq grill and forget to take it out. ALL devices will melt if you do this.I like the Norpro and am glad I took a chance on it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1VQQZH6V97R3Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008OKC6AA#wasThisHelpful","R1VQQZH6V97R3Z","A1TUUSQODOPXOE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TUUSQODOPXOE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I read the glowing reviews here and also viewed America's Test Kitchen test of this pan and decided to purchase one from Amazon, in spite of some of the reviews saying that the pan was defective and bulged in the middle when heated.As soon as I received the T-Fal fry pan, I carefully seasoned it according to the instructions and attempted my first cooking experience with it by making an omelet. Things worked out very well and the egg slide right off without any problems at all.The next test was to make some fried chicken. This is where the quality control of this pan went south. As soon as the pan registered it was hot enough to cook in, the added oil in the pan quickly went off to the outside perimeter of the pan and pooled at the edges. This pan becomes convex when heated. Not a good thing.I believe that there must be an on going problem with these pans and T-Fal has yet to admit it. I sent an email to customer support and all they said was to return it to them to get the pan evaluated. Of course I would have to pay shipping. No thanks T-Fal, you've just lost a customer for your fry pans.Due to the poor customer support and defective workmanship of this pan, I cannot recommended it even though it received high marks from television review shows. They must have received a different batch then those sold to the general public, as these pans are definitely warped.Too bad, this pan could have been a contender.","2.0 out of 5 stars","January 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3HC65FUYH6QV0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000GWK2X2#wasThisHelpful","R3HC65FUYH6QV0","A1TUUSQODOPXOE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TUUSQODOPXOE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I was torn between the Ozeri BP2M and the nearest competitor, the Omron 7. I was dazzled by Ozeri's multi-colored readout, so I ordered it. As it turned out, it was one of the worst BP units I have ever used.First, it never was able to take a complete reading without an error message or failing to inflate. The instruction were very clear, and I followed them exactly. Usually after five of six tries, I would finally get one reading. This is unacceptable, and one of my family members commented that the Ozeri was probably raising my blood pressure because of its ineffectiveness.I couldn't agree more.The colored LED display is really nice and cool, but if the machine can't even take a reading on the first try, it fails in its purpose. The Ozeri doesn't have an audible or visual signal to tell you when your arm is in the proper position for a reading, so you have to do the best you can from the illustration in the manual (your arm should approximately be at heart level). A table or flat surface is needed use Ozeri, and even so, the unit still failed again and again.I have returned this unit to Amazon, and its great return policy has saved the day again. I realize that this may have been a bad unit, but even so, the inconvenience of not having a position alert, and the necessity of having to have a table to place your arm on is a lot of hassle.I have opted for the Omron 7, and this unit is a wonder. It did everything well the first time I used it, and it is very easy to use and has a position alert, which is invaluable.It's too bad Ozeri failed, I would have liked keep it.

"I know a lot of the reviews on here and on the Internet have basically trashed this game with phasers on kill, but in spite of all the bugs, I enjoyed playing this game. Basically, Star Trek was rushed through to store shelves without enough time to fix all the bugs, some of which, are unintentionally funny:* Spock runs in circles in front of open fire during some battles. (AI bugs)* Screen status displays get stuck and don't go away when playing. (Interface bugs)* You can see inside Kirk's or Spock's head when the camera angle is high and they are against walls. (clipping bugs)* Spock or Kirk can get stuck in corners or objects trying to follow you. (Collision detection bugs)* The Gorn like to run at you in the open while you blow their heads off. (AI bugs)* In a later part of the game, if you don't have the right equipment with you, you'll never finish the level. (Level design bug)There are many more bugs, but this kind of shows you how embarrassing this game must be for the QA testing teams, and the producers of this game. If I were part of this project I would be hesitant to have my name on the credits or have the game listed on my resume.OK, with this out of the way, I still enjoyed this game because the plot continues the storyline after the first movie and is entirely unique. The dialogue between Kirk and Spock are great, Bones, Scotty and Sulu have some great lines too. Uhura, not so much. Kirk and Spock give some very funny lines--too bad the real movies didn't have more of this.I suppose this is more of an interactive movie more than anything else. I know the AI is a little dumb, but it isn't any more different in the movies where the bad guys always lose, right?This is also sort of a puzzle game too. You get your mission objectives, and you really have to think things out to complete them. For those who don't like to figure things out, it won't be a game they like. But if you like games like Tomb Raider or the Fallout series, Star Trek is sort of like these, but more simple.Graphics are a bit embarrassing too. If this game were made 10 years ago, it would have been considered cutting edge, but by today's standards, they look a little dated. They're not awful, by any means, but we've all been spoiled by Gears of War and BioShock graphics.Although this game was rushed, I could still enjoy it for the Star Trek experience it gives. The plot is very good, the music is great, the script is good, and it feels like you're inside a real Star Trek movie.The game is not perfect, but I liked it anyway. This could have been a better game, but with only about a year to get it out, it's amazing that anything works at all in this game. It feels like a very late ""alpha build,"", or an almost completed game with lots of bugs still in it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 2, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2DP24M5W4CYQN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007ZQJN1Y#wasThisHelpful","R2DP24M5W4CYQN","A1TUUSQODOPXOE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TUUSQODOPXOE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you've read some of the reviews about this product, you probably came away a bit confused. I know I was. There were reviews that said it was cheap and didn't work to other comments that said it was a great product. So which ones were true, I thought. Only one way to find out; I purchased one. Here is what I found out.This review is for the 20-inch LED hood and are specific to this hood size.Bright lights--------------As far as adequate lighting, there is more than enough to fill up a 10-gallon tank. I don't know why others have complained about the lack of lighting. I found it quite bright when compared to my old incandescent lights, and the slight falloff of brightness in the corners is just nitpicking, in my opinion. It is barely perceptible.Plants like it---------------As far as being good for plants, the LED lamps are doing a fine job providing enough lighting for them to grow. None of them have died, and if anything, appear to be as healthy or better than with incandescent lighting.Cheap or not?-------------Some reviews said the hood was cheaply made. On this point,this all depends on what you consider cheap. The hood itself is well made, but it isn't of the thickest plastic that I usually expect in aquarium hoods. The fit was just right, but the hood did not fit flush on top of the fish tank. I did a little adjustment with the clips that attached the light to the hood and it straightened out nicely.Filter panels--------------The opening on the back of the hood, for hang on the back filters, measures about 6 and 7/8s inches. There was enough room for my filter plus a little space left over to place my aquarium heater next to it. For filters that are wider, you will need to cut or saw the plastic to make the openings wider for your use.If you've got an air stone at the back of the aquarium like I do, you'll see a significant amount of water splash onto the back of the hood. This didn't look too good for the light switch so all I did was to cut a piece of filter foam to cover the exposed hood area area. Problem solved. You can also cut a piece of stiff clear plastic from a package to do this as well.If you've got a water filter that splashes water upon its reentry into the aquarium, a similar solution will also fix this.LED protection---------------There is a little plastic shield that covers the LED light, and I found that this completely shields the LED lights from any water that splashes onto this area. The light was securely snapped into place, and when the hood is opened, it does not fall out as others have indicated. But it will fall out if the hood is opened at a 90-degree angle.The hood can be propped up with a small spoon or fork if you need to clean or vacuum the tank, and it's really no big deal to lift the hood to feed your fish. It only takes a micro-calorie to do this. There is a little slide out door that you can remove to leave a little opening to feed your fish, but I have left it on to make the hood look more uniform.Clean and healthy design-------------------------The main reason why I purchased this hood was because of two reasons. I suspected that my old incandescent hood was slowly leeching bad metals into the water because the metal parts were rusting from the moisture, and the excessive algae growing underneath the hood was really unsightly. The LED hood is free of metal parts, and it is healthier for my tropical fish. I also like the low profile design of the hood. It makes the tank look sleeker.Easy assembly; read the directions-----------------------------------Setting up the hood on my fish tank took about a half an hour because I wanted to make sure I understood the directions on how to attach the hood clips at the back of the tank. You actually have to angle the clips down at a 45-degree angle and then lift up so the other side of the clip can attach underneath the aquarium frame. There are two sizes of clips so make sure you use the right ones.Once this is done, you have to apply pressure to the joints of the hood, on top of the clips, in order for the two to snap together. No a whole lot of force is needed, but you do have to angle your push so that it is directed exactly downward on the clips. The instructions saved me a lot of hassle, so you may want to read them carefully.One thing that should be noted is that the opening at the back of the hood, for a HOB (hang of back) filter is about 6.5 inches wide. If you place an aquarium heater in this space alongside the filter, you'll just have enough room for both. But if you have a larger HOB filter, you'll need to cut away some of the plastic to accommodate a wider filter. I used a Dremel-like tool to cut away the extra plastic and a Fluval C2 filter now fits nicely in this area. It's too bad the manufacture didn't allow for snap-off sections to make the filter opening larger.LED Performance----------------Switching over to LED from incandescent was a bit of a shock as the light spectrum of LEDs is definitely on the bluer side as opposed to incandescent bulbs which are more yellow. This lighting really makes everything pop in the fish tank, but since it is a bit weak on the red spectrum, reds and yellows don't come out as much. The blue moonlight feature is an extra bonus and I've watched my fish during the night under this lighting. They seem to like it, although I haven't left it on all night yet.After about a week of getting used to the LED lights, I prefer these over my old lights. Family members are envious of how the tank looks in comparison with their regular light bulb setups. They've noticed that the tank now looks very sharp and ""professional,"" whatever that means, lol.You may not like the bluish-green tint of these lights, so take this into consideration if you are thinking about buying this unit.Conclusion-----------This hood is a great bargain, and only time will tell if it is long lasting as well. But for what I paid for it, which is essentially the same price I would have had to pay for a similar incandescent set up with those horrific rusting metal parts, I would say that this LED hood is well worth it for the health of my fish and the overall look of the tank. Plus it uses less energy and puts out virtually no heat--a plus when the weather gets hot.This hood isn't perfect, but for what it does, it definitely is a good aquarium hood. This hood works for me, but YMMV. Just understand that this is a bargain hood, and don't expect $100 features from it. If you've got that down, you should be OK with it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 26, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2X107JNEEZUC6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00474BN1K#wasThisHelpful","R2X107JNEEZUC6","A1TUUSQODOPXOE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TUUSQODOPXOE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It's not very often that a sequel to a game turns out better than the original, but this is exactly what The Bigs 2 has done. The game play is still fun, and there are many more features and things to do in the game.The Be a Legend mode starts you off as a rookie, and you progress in your star rankings by going against the greatest players in baseball--past and present, fulfilling sports challenges, and of course, winning ball games.The narration by Damon Bruce is as hilarious, if not more so, than the previous Bigs game and the way he goes, ""I don't THINK SO..."" gets me every time.You get to go to Japan and play against some of the best teams over there, and the crowd noise makes you feel that you're really there. Want a taste of baseball in Mexico? You'll go down there too, but watch out for that Toro pitcher. You'll know when you see him.The Bigs 2 is probably my all time favorite sports game right now, behind The Bigs.Pitching and hitting mechanics seem to be a bit more tuned in, but maybe that's just me getting used to hitting the ball better.If there was one gripe, it's really a small one. The Turbo bar is now white, and it's not the clearest thing that you can see. A green color would have made more sense.Too bad there isn't a Bigs 3 in development because 2K Sports has the best baseball arcade game in the industry, imho.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 15, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1XD0N1A7PTU2R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001VLFCY6#wasThisHelpful","R1XD0N1A7PTU2R","A1TUUSQODOPXOE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TUUSQODOPXOE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a good basic mini-stereo system for playing your CDs, for listening to FM radio, and listening to your collection of music from your iPhone or iPod. The compactness of the unit fits very comfortably on a table, shelf, or window sill.I know there are more expensive versions of this styled unit from Panasonic, but a family member just wanted something under $50 to listen to her favorite CDs in the kitchen. Previous to this, we were just using an old Sony clock radio, so this new unit is definitely a step above in sound quality.You won't get pulse pounding deep bass or detailed highs, but overall,for general listening the unit produces pretty good sound and even though it is only rated at 10 watts, it easily fills a room with music.The iPod feature is great and the connector will fit any iPhone or iPod with the old 30-pin connector. I have an iPod iTouch and hooking this up to the Panasonic took only a few seconds. Very easy set up. The iTouch was charging in the dock and this means you can play music all day long without running down the battery. Very nice feature.The radio portion of the Panasonic is OK. Not stellar but it will get the job done. There is no manual tuning nob so you'll have to scan through the stations to lock them in. It's automatically done, so no big deal.For more picky ears, you can probably go to more expensive units, but if you're just looking for a good, inexpensive music player that doesn't sound like a cheap boom box, the Panasonic may be what you are looking for.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 15, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3F7RXL7TWNZ67/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0078GCM4Q#wasThisHelpful","R3F7RXL7TWNZ67","A1TUUSQODOPXOE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TUUSQODOPXOE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"You may have noticed the wide range of review ratings on this product from 5-stars to just 1-star. This had me a bit worried before I purchased this unit, but since Amazon backed up their products with its excellent return policy, I took a chance on it.First off, for those who haven't ""programmed"" a universal remote before, the steps and instructions can be a bit scary or involved. You must read carefully regarding the sequence of buttons you must push in order to get this to work with your devices. There are basically three ways to do this and if one doesn't work, you have two other fallback plans.For me, I choose to just input the different codes available for my TV, DVD, VCR, and Xbox 360. The WR7 lists several codes for each device and you input each one until one turns off your device. In some cases, multiple codes work but only one will give you full functionality.For my outdated Realistic VCR from Radio Shack, none of the codes worked, so I did the ""automatic"" scan method where you just tell the WRC WR7 to go through a list of pre-programmed codes. Once your device recognized one, it will turn off. As it turns out, the code it used was for a Panasonic VCR, which means the Radio Shack unit was made by Panasonic.In addition, I used the ""learning mode"" to program the WR7 to take over all of my Roku LT's functions. But according to various websites, because the WR7 only works with IR remotes, later models of the Roku cannot be programmed into the remote. It also should be pointed out that the directions for the learning mode of the WR7 may be in error. After programming, in some cases you will need to hit the component button again before ""saving your work.""Basically, I can understand the frustration some users of the WR7 have experienced because there is a somewhat steep learning curve if they haven't programmed a remote before. Also, after reading many of the 1-star reviews, it seems that a good deal of them have to do with user error, impatience, or just unrealistic expectations.I was able to program the WR7 between breaks watching streaming videos with my Amazon Prime account. Total time actually spent on programming was about 30 minutes--most of which had to do with re-reading instructions and making mistakes and figuring out what I did wrong.I like the layout of the buttons and the back light is pretty bright; the color is red, but it would have been nice if it was a shade of blue or just plain white.A good thing about this remote is that all your commands and programming is stored on a memory chip. If your batteries die, according to the manufacturer, you can come back months later to insert new batteries and the programming will still be in the remote. In real world terms, this means if you run out of batteries or use rechargeables, you have more than enough time to replace the batteries in the unit without losing all your hard earned programming.This remote is quite deep in features, and I may never get to the point where I used all of them, but it's good to know that they're there in case I need them. I did use one of the more ""advanced"" functions by mapping all of my devices to the TV volume controls. Now, no matter if I use the DVD, Roku, or VCR, the volume controls are linked to the TV functions.However, it should be pointed out that programming macros or steps for customized features doesn't always work. I found out that while doing a macro for turning on various components, it was all but impossible because the remote has no way if knowing where the last input setting was on the TV. Some TVs have dedicated buttons for video 1, video 2, etc., but if your TV needs to screen through button presses, you're out of luck with the WR7.It takes some work to program this thing and YMMV as to how quick, easy, and successful you are in getting the expected results. Some devices may not work with this remote, but using the learning mode or scan function takes care of most of these worries. There are probably instances where this remote will not work on some electronics; but for 20 bucks, it seems to handle most situations very well. It should be pointed out that even the most expensive universal remotes have programming issues.Overall this device doesn't get a perfect 5-star because the steps in programming may turn off some people and it isn't as easy as the company leads on. But if you've programmed universal remotes before, don't mind spending a bit of time learning how to program this unit, or are OK with carefully following instructions, for about $20, this remote is really worth it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 7, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1XJHD6SFUAW9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001KC08A4#wasThisHelpful","R1XJHD6SFUAW9","A1TUUSQODOPXOE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TUUSQODOPXOE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"From the reviews it seems that some folks are getting the shiny Mylar material while others are receiving the standard gray (polytaffeta shade) that most people are used to. I received the latter and am pretty happy with the purchase.I have a 2001 Prius with a gigantic windshield and virtually every sunshade that I have tried is too small to cover it completely although these manufacturers claim that their products fit. The Magic Shade Super Jumbo sunshades are huge and are able to fit nicely, without any gaps. One shade almost covers the entire surface area of the windshield and the other one completes the coverage. I can use these vertically or horizontally.Good product and it works great.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 24, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1RGCZQIONVCIQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000G72UOQ#wasThisHelpful","R1RGCZQIONVCIQ","A1TUUSQODOPXOE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TUUSQODOPXOE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I really enjoy reviewing products, but I dislike reviewing things that I don't really like. It seems like a service to people to let them know about great things that they might have overlooked. Less so to warn them that they might not want to buy something.But, here goes.People have been trying to put ""message centers"" on the front of the refrigerator for many years. I guess it just seems like an obvious thing, that should work, but it never really does. Sadly, this is another example.First, this is supposed to magnetically stick to your refrigerator. They show it that way in several pictures. Interestingly, every picture shows it stuck to the front of a stainless steel refrigerator. Which, if it is actually stainless steel, and not a cheaper metal that looks like stainless, is impossible because stainless steel is a non-magnetic surface. So, it won't stick on my fridge without double-sided tape, which isn't going to happen.The looks. It is a good size. Not too small, not excessively large, and has a convenient ""handle"" on the top, which I guess means you could hang it from a hook, though the look might be kind of sloppy, depending on what you are going for in your kitchen. The overall thing reminds me of a transistor radio from the 70s. Or maybe a gray Speak N Spell. The overall impression is that of a child's toy, not a $200 piece of equipment. I guess you could call that retro, but in my opinion it is pretty unattractive.The setup routine was fairly easy, though it felt a little ""beta"" in that there were obvious places to help me where it didn't. Like, it told me it can't connect to 5GHz networks, which was very useful (I usually find that out when something tries to connect and fails), but it also didn't scan for any networks other than the one my iPad was connected to which, you guessed it, is a 5 GHz network. So, I had to manually enter the network name. Not too hard, because I'm the one that set up the network, but I can't remember any other piece of equipment where I've had to manually enter the name instead of selecting it from the available choices. Such an obvious thing, but missing. But, don't get me wrong - setup was not very hard, and I had mine up and running in minutes. It just seems like there are some areas for improvement.The sound is okay. It seems to have two small speakers on the front grill (that I could see with a flashlight). It connects to wifi and plays internet radio stations, which is good. It will also connect to Spotify, if you happen to use that.The little display is e-ink, like a Kindle, so it doesn't use power after it is drawn - a good choice for this application. It is pretty small, though, so you aren't going to be putting much on it other than ""I miss you!"" or ""have a good day!"" Both of which you could also do by scribbling on a pink Post-it Note. And that would actually stick to the stainless steel fridge. Or the inside of their lunchbox. You get the idea. One of the main functions of this device can be easily replaced by a notepad, which is quicker and easier to use, though you won't be leaving any notes remotely.The ""make calls through the app"" thing. Why would I need this? I can already do it with Skype, or the free app that my cable company gives me, or any of a number of different ways. Or, I could just dial their number and make a phone call. This seems like something that people may have wanted ten years ago (maybe), but today?So, the main thing this does that is useful is play Internet music. But, check out the price. You could buy an Echo for less, do the same thing, all by using voice control, and from many more services than Spotify.I buy stuff like this just for fun - I consider it entertainment money. I have at least five media streamers, just because I find it interesting to play around with them and to make comparisons. I bet I have ten bluetooth speakers. But this thing? Like Tom Hanks said in Big, ""What's fun about that?""Not enough.I'd give this one a pass.Sean Logue, 2015","2.0 out of 5 stars","November 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1UFFDN4NZUMIA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013DJSKKQ#wasThisHelpful","R1UFFDN4NZUMIA","A2X61KKXXR6WNP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2X61KKXXR6WNP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There are two stands that look somewhat like this one. The other is by Bello, and instead of an S-curve in the wood, it is more of a curve from top to bottom, and then along the front edge.Amazon sells both, and you may be conflicted as to which one is better, as I was.Well, I bought both of them. I sometimes do that with less expensive items so that I can review them, but this isn't in that category. The reason is that I needed two TV stands, one for my den downstairs, and the other for my bonus room, and as happy as I was with the first one I bought for the den, I really didn't want the exact same thing upstairs.I won't spend a lot of time talking about the Bello version because this is a review for the Lumisource. If I were going to buy only one, I would go with the Bello. However, they are both very good.This was fairly easy to put together, if you follow a few simple guidelines, none of which are in the single sheet pictogram that comes with it. The instructions for this are, on a scale of 1-10, a 2. There are a few picture, with lines and letters, but it basically is horrible. The feet on the back piece aren't even in the picture, so there is a 50/50 chance you will install it upside-down, then realize at the end when you have extra feet, and have to disassemble it. So, instructions? Horrible.The glass pieces are fairly thin, and have a matte-finish side along with a smooth, polished side. Put the polished side up. They do have steel supports under each one, because they need them.The wooden S-Curve sides are preassembled, with chrome bars. I liked that these were pre-assembed, but I noticed that they had fasteners underneath that fit the included allen wrench. Two of them on mine were loose, so I recommend tightening them before placing things on the shelves. The finish on the wood is cherry. On the box, they call it wenge-wood, which may refer to the grain pattern, but understand that the actual color is traditional cherry wood.I recommend scraping each screw against a piece of bar soap for lubrication. And, for each one, keep in mind that your main goal is to not cross-thread it (put it in straight). Instead of doing one side, like the instructions say, do each shelf, starting from the bottom, on both sides. Do not fully tighten the screws - leave them wiggly. When you finish all three shelves, do not tighten the screws (like I did).After the shelves are in, put the back wooden piece in place. The two screw holes on the top should be facing the floor, because those two holes are where feet will be screwed into later.If you did what I said, and left everything wiggly, you will be able to get the back piece on. If not, loosen up the screws and try again. The metal supports are not precision-made, and they flex, so if the screws are loose, and you put each one in straight, at the end you will be able to tighten them all up and the metal supports will bend to accommodate.At the end, tighten everything up, but try not to be a gorilla about it, especially in the spots where screws go into wood.At the end, put the glass pieces into place. Largest one on the bottom, medium one in the middle, and smallest one on top (glossy side up).It is a good looking piece. It isn't as well-designed as the Bello, and the instructions are pretty horrible. The end result, though, is a good one.Recommended, but check out the Bello version before clicking Buy it Now.Sean Logue, 2015","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1KKJ7S4VJ4KC6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003VL31N8#wasThisHelpful","R1KKJ7S4VJ4KC6","A2X61KKXXR6WNP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2X61KKXXR6WNP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It is really difficult to review this kind of item, because without a double-blind clinical study, it is hard to say whether it works. And, if it does appear to work, it could be because of eating different foods, experiencing different amounts of stress, drinking more or less fluids that day - lots of hard to control for factors.So, I'll just say this. Probiotics like this one appear to be helping me. The most effective ones seem to be the ones that have multiple strains, a large number of colonies, and are contained in a pill that is coated so that it can make it through the stomach (where it won't help) to the intestine (where it will). By the time a standard gelatin capsule goes all the way through the stomach, many of the colonies will be destroyed by the acid.This one ticks off all the boxes, which makes it a good choice to try. Because everyone is different, however, you should take it daily for at least a week, preferably two, and then monitor whether it seems to help. If it doesn't, try a different brand with different strains and design of the pill. These things are not inexpensive, so only buy one bottle, and the smallest one they have, so that you can evaluate it before buying more.Hopefully this one will work for you!Sean Logue, 2015","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2X8EQ0NVZNF7O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QFQS19K#wasThisHelpful","R2X8EQ0NVZNF7O","A2X61KKXXR6WNP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2X61KKXXR6WNP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This would be a terrific gift to show up with when attending a dinner party, or picking someone up for a date.

"This is a great pendant!The blue is bright and clear, and the white sapphires along the edge look great, without distracting from the primary stone.Sapphires are extremely hard, and won't scratch, so the stones will retain that clarity over time. The hardness also means they are somewhat brittle, and they can chip on the edges. That's why having the white stones around the entire edge is a good thing - they help protect the primary stone from accidental chips.It is true that these are manufactured stones, which means they were grown in a lab using very expensive equipment that recreates the heat and pressure-filled environment that creates natural stones. The end result is a real sapphire, free of flaws and impurities. Truthfully, the manufactured ones are in some ways better than natural stones because of their clarity.If it sounds like I really like this, I do. It isn't overly gaudy, but will definitely attract attention and positive comments. Even the box it comes in, while simple, is nice and elegant.

"These are very elegant earrings. Not too large to be gaudy, not so small that they can't be seen.The white and yellow gold combination is excellent, sophisticated, and looks great. The posts and backs are gold, which is especially good news for people who have sensitivities to nickel, and other metals.The only real downside I can see is that they came in the cheapest box known to humankind. I mean, this thing was made of very cheap paper with a rectangle of foam thrown in. And, then, in case that wasn't unappealing enough, the earrings themselves were in little ziplock bags inside the box. I mean, it is good that they didn't get lost, but if I were giving these as a gift, I would definitely seek out a better box and move them into it.On the other hand, the actual item looks really good, works very well, and is a great value.

"This is a fantastic, all-purpose wireless keyboard. Backlit, laser-cut keys, integrated touch-pad, and attractive enough to prop up against the side of the sofa for when it is needed.The key feel is very good, and the keys themselves are full-size. The two together mean that it is has a nice feel when typing.The rechargeable battery is supposed to last a very long time before needing to be plugged in, and I haven't seen anything to contradict this claim. If it did run out, you could plug it in while using it, so that wouldn't be a very big deal regardless.The aluminum accents on the top and bottom edges look nice, and probably contribute to the solid feel and general lack of flex.Overall, it works well, looks great, and is a far better alternative to moving a cursor around choosing letters with a remote.Recommended.Sean Logue, 2015","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1LH8A71TNEUTT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZOPVSKW#wasThisHelpful","R1LH8A71TNEUTT","A2X61KKXXR6WNP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2X61KKXXR6WNP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Turtle Beach recently released a new line of gaming headsets. There is this red one, a green one at a higher price point that adds wireless, and a high-end one that has Dolby Headphone features for sound effects. Pretty cool, because all of these headphones are good, and you can choose the one that is right for you based on your needs and how much you want to pay.This one has excellent sound quality, with crisp, clear vocals. The microphone is bendable, so you can position it in the best place for you. It works very well.The headset itself is lightweight, and very comfortable, even when worn for hours.There are plenty of audio controls, so you can adjust the sound level or mute right from the headset.There is one real drawback, however. The wired cord that connects these to the computer audio jack is way too short. You will probably need an audio extension cable for them. Also, because many computers (like my iMac) shut off the external sound when headphones are plugged in, you can't leave them plugged into your computer all the time or you won't be able to hear anything when not wearing them. This is very annoying, but isn't a fault of the headphones.Overall, though, these are a great value if you can live without wireless.

"Years ago, when I was considering which single-serve coffee machine to buy, I asked my friends which one to get. The Kuerig, of course, was the most popular (here in America), but the small coffee pods seemed to make the coffee a little less robust than I was looking for. The Tassimo had a contract with Starbucks, and had the option to use double-sized pods for the stronger brews. One of my friends in Sweden strongly recommended something called a Nespresso, which I had never heard of. I did some research, and discovered that over in Europe, Nespresso is the dominant brand. There are even Nespresso coffee bars, where you can go buy a cup while on the go. It uses little aluminum pods that are small, but the espresso-based drinks it made were also small, so the coffee was very good.Back then, I chose to go with the Tassimo, and I enjoyed it for years afterward, even after they lost their Starbucks license and the pods it used started disappearing from the local supermarkets, their shelf space assimilated by the far more popular, and saleable, Keurig pods.Things change, and now it is time to finally give the odd machine my Swedish friend swears by a shot (pun intended - sorry!).This machine is all about espresso-based drinks. Lattes, macchiatos, ristrettos, lungos, and straight espressos are all available by popping in a pod and pressing the appropriate button. All of these fancy-sounding drinks are basically just different sizes of espresso, with or without foamed milk. My guess is you will quickly settle on one favorite (with or without milk), so it gets less confusing, very quickly. The hardest part of this is remembering what the tiny graphics on the buttons mean. I know why companies do this. It is because graphics don't have to be translated, which means they can sell the same unit in multiple countries without changes for the local language. For me, however, all of the graphics basically look like coffee cups to me, and I have a tough time with it. I'm getting used to it, but good luck if you expect a guest who isn't familiar with the machine to be able to pull it off.The pods are aluminum, color-coded, and very attractive. Color-coding them to the type of coffee was a brilliant move. If you know what color your favorite is in, you can quickly pick it out, even if they are all mixed up in a bowl. The writing on the foil top of each pod that identifies the coffee, however, is nearly impossible to read. It looks nice, but I had to hold them under the light and look at them from different angles to see it. They look nice, but some contrast would really help here.So, how is the coffee? Fantastic. The crema, the rich foam that floats on the top of a well-made cup, is thicker than any other single-cup maker I've seen. I suspect the reason for this is the high pressure this machine uses to extract the coffee. That is probably also why the pods are aluminum instead of plastic - so they can hold up under the pressure and not deform.The pods are available only from Nespresso, through the mail. Yes, there are a very small handful of ""boutiques"" that sell them, but we are talking five of them in the entire United States, which hardly counts as a retail ""presence."" They don't require a monthly subscription, and sell several mixed packages. When you sign up, there is a good deal on a one-time purchase of a welcome pack that contains all of them for around $200. It seems expensive, but this is a heck of a lot of coffee, and worth considering.The unit is small, compact, and seems very well thought out. I enjoy using it, even in the bleary-eyed mornings when I'm trying to get my kid onto the bus on time. I think it is something about those colored pods. They just make me happy.Recommended.Sean Logue, 2015","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3ALBVN57AMKBM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XI44UU6#wasThisHelpful","R3ALBVN57AMKBM","A2X61KKXXR6WNP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2X61KKXXR6WNP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I hooked this up to my TV in about twenty, very leisurely minutes.  The only thing I needed the manual for was when it came time to program the unit to respond to the TV remote (necessary for such things as responding to the Mute button).  Even that wasn't hard, but I did have to read the tiny text a few times to ""get it.""It comes with everything you need, including an optical cable and two sets of white speaker wire for the satellite units.  The subwoofer is wireless, so it just needs an electrical outlet.  However, the subwoofer is very easily localized, which is geek-speak for it needs to be fairly close to the TV in the front of the room.  My first try was putting it behind me and I could hear dialogue clearly coming from behind my chair.  Now it is up front and it isn't a problem.The sound quality is much better than the built-in sound on the TV, and is very transparent to use once hooked up.  It seems to just work, muting when I press Mute, turning on with the TV, and turning off when appropriate.  It isn't going to replace a receiver with a dedicated speaker system, but it won't have wires strung all over the room, either.Overall, a nice addition to a modern TV (with optical out).Recommended.Sean P.

"I love these Griot kits.  They take a few of their products, and package them together for a single purpose.  In this case, it is their interior cleaner, leather cleaner, and some microfiber cloths.My car has an off-white (actually ecru) leather interior.  I also have an eight year old daughter who rides in it and tends to get footprints in seemly impossible places.  Consequently, the passenger seats really needed a through cleaning.Using only the items in the kit, I first sprayed the seats down with the interior cleaner.  The large sprayer head made this easy.  Perhaps a little too easy - the seats were a bit wet!  I then wiped them down with one of the cloths.  Most of the dirt came off at that point, but there were some nooks and crannies that needed some rubbing.  I also cleaned the interior door handles with the cloth, which was now wet enough that I didn't need to spray.  The oil and grease came right off.Then I used the leather spray.  While the interior spray really didn't smell like anything, the leather spray is scented to smell like fine leather.  This was great, because after wiping down the seats my whole car smelled great!  The spray dried to a nice matte finish after wiping with a fresh cloth from the kit.This kit really works, and is easy and quick to use. So easy, in fact, that it would make a great gift to anyone with a car that has a leather interior.  Particularly if it is ecru.Highly recommended.Sean P.

"This unit, which is about the size and shape of a small remote control, processes music to increase the apparent sound stage and separation of musical instruments.  It does work.  I found it works better on already heavily processed pop music than on other types, which is fun in a car because you'll have music seemingly coming from all over.  It works very much like the older SRS systems that now tend to be built into TV audio systems.  It would be nice if this were built into the actual player as well.The disadvantages are pretty obvious.  First, it is a separate unit with cabling that has to be connected between your portable player and your car stereo.  It isn't hard, but it is messy.

"The box I received was left by UPS on the porch in 100 degree heat. Plus who knows how long it was in the hot truck. The carton says to store in a cool, dry place....so I was a bit concerned about consuming these. I stuck them in the fridge overnight.The twist off cap was a little hard to remove. I don't prefer drinking from a pouch so I squeezed it into a glass. It's very thick and very hard to drink from a glass. The color looks natural though.The flavor was a bit off-putting. I think it's the whey in it that I was detecting. But the banana comes through and is the lingering flavor from it. My 5 year old thought it was pretty good but had to use a spoon to get any from the cup.It's really a large portion for a kid, but not enough for an adult. (This is if using it as the only component of a meal.) They would make a good snack though.There is a lot of sugar in it, which concerns me, but in sure most of that has to be from the fruits. The nutritional content is decent though. Calcium, fiber and protein are in a good balance and the vitamins are at a good DRV as well. 100% of vitamin c is great, as is the amount of potassium.Be careful though if you're looking for yogurt with active cultures. The squeeze pouch says the product was pasteurized after culturing. I'm sure that heat is not good for the cultures.These are good for the intended purpose though. They don't require chilling, although they taste better that way, so they're good for keeping in a desk drawer or carrying with you on a trip.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3RJT8VVJ71SGZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VUK59EQ#wasThisHelpful","R3RJT8VVJ71SGZ","A1WP940JZL83T7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1WP940JZL83T7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a thick plastic binder with accordian sides which allow it to expand a bit. The bottom itself does not expand but the sides do. The colors are vibrant. The dividers are all clear with tabs on the top to allow a label to be put into them (like page or binder divider pages). The closure is what looks like a pony tail holder style elastic band. It's very loose when the binder isn't too full and stretches a bit when it is.I think files like this have lots of uses. I'm using it for our yearly tax deduction receipts. I have another that I use for our yearly medical expenses and bills.

"I got this for my husband, who shaves every morning before his shower. He used it for about 5 days before I asked him about the product. This is his opinion about the product: the razor works well, it didn't pull hard on longer hairs, it was a smooth surfaced head on the razor that allowed him to control the razor better over the curves of his neck and jaw. He liked that there is a pop-up trimmer on the back of the razor for getting a clean line along his goatee as well as trimming hairs along the back of his neck and sideburns. Although he did say it was a bit awkward to hold the razor at the right angle to use the trimmer.I grabbed it one day to get hairs around my knee and ankle that I always either miss or cut myself trying to get. I noticed that the hairs were still a little stubbly but I was able to get my knees shaved without bleeding, so that's a win for me.

"My 5 year old has been having trouble learning certain letters and numbers (why are 5, S, and 8 so hard anyway?) so this is a great way to help him learn to control his hand in the proper way for forming the ones which trouble him. The unit was pretty hard to get out of the packaging. You have to locate the locks which are hidden under folded cardboard. Kind of a pain and in no way frustration free packaging. (There are actually instructions in the booklet about how to get the unit out of the package but you can't get to the instructions until you get the unit out. Ha!)The volume does not get too loud, which I like. There are so many different ways to play. When you turn it on it will prompt you to enter your name using the letter buttons on the right. The instructions suggest that you ""activate"" the screen before you play by using the stamps to cover the screen in ""writing"" then clean it off by swiping. We didn't see that instruction before we started playing and it worked just fine. It did work better after doing it as it said. It did look like there were lines on the screen that didn't wipe away when we did it though.There are 6 main activity settings for learning to write and draw. The Guess the Picture one is virtually impossible to figure out. You're supposed to just draw until the picture comes up and match it to the letter button. My kid got frustrated really quickly with that one. But he spent hours working on the stencils, the how to draw, musical drawing and the letter practice.I did notice that the musical drawing didn't really keep playing the music unless you're drawing. There were many times we were drawing though and the music would stop anyway. All in all, I've seen that he has been more willing to practice working on letters on this than he was on paper.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RUXFRNFEH93OB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XUZH4LK#wasThisHelpful","RUXFRNFEH93OB","A1WP940JZL83T7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1WP940JZL83T7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have naturally curly hair, just past my shoulders. I also have bangs that I blow dry and straighten daily. I also live in a fairly humid area.

I've used it three days in a row and my hair is softer and shinier each day. I have been able to dry the curly part of my hair without frizz and its still very well defined and soft.My only concern is that the product is shipped without any sort of hard plastic cover.

"My boys have been fighting over who gets to wear this! It fits both my 5 year old (wears size 6/S) and my 8 year old (wears size 8/M) very comfortably. The mesh back allows them to wear it without getting too hot. The front, with all the pockets, allows them to carry all kinds of things! Looking at the picture, the top right (top left when wearing) has a place for a pen to hook onto the vest. It's an open bottom so pencils without a hook to hold them fall right through. Next to that is a very small pocket which holds a small notebook really well. The other three pockets have a flap which close with velcro. Handy indeed. I'm not sure what all the elastic orange loops would be for.

"This is a nice semi-sweet chocolate with a moderate level of cocoa mass.  It's smooth but not too waxy, and melts nicely on the tongue.  It's a brighter taste than you'll get with chocolate chips from the grocery store, with no burnt flavors lurking in the background, and of course it doesn't have the stabilizers that make it possible for a melted chocolate chip to remain chip-shaped.Compared to similar chocolates, Barry Callebaut's semisweet is more fruity (Peter's Burgundy is more like a red wine than like fresh fruit), Guittard's  has more vanilla flavor, and Valrhona is drier and less distinctive.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 7, 2010","http://www.amazon.com/review/R28JWKBCTBHBFZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001L30LJ0#wasThisHelpful","R28JWKBCTBHBFZ","A13H31LR22T8LK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A13H31LR22T8LK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought a lot of these for my husband a couple of years ago.  Every now and again, I pull out the sewing machine to stitch the latest pile of rejects back together.The fabric is nice enough (lightweight satin), and the elastic is entirely covered (good for people with latex allergy), but the stitching is the cheapest quality of workmanship I've seen in a commercially produced product.  Because of the nature of the fabric, the vertical seams get the most damage -- the satin just shreds right along the stitching.  So if you're handy with a needle and not too picky about clothing, they're fine.  You're getting what you're paying for.  If you're not interested in everyday use, they'll likely hold up for ""special occasion"" status for a long while.But if you're the kind of person who pitches perfectly functional clothes because they're not absolutely perfect, then you should look for boxers that have double-stitched/reinforced seams.

"This is the first, and will be the only, Agatha Raisin book that I have read.  The others are going back today.  The writing itself is fairly good -- better than, say, the first book of the ""Gourmet Girl"" series, which was recently inflicted on my consciousness, although not nearly as good as, say, Dorothy Sayers' classic works, like Busman's Holiday.  The plot in this book is a bit thin and fantastical, but acceptable.  I have read, and will continue to read, more books by this author; I'm just really turned off by this character.Agatha Raisin is a 50-something divorced woman that is irritatingly ""sensitive"", which is to say that she obsessively overanalyzes whether each and every male character's action indicates sexual attraction to her.  If men were to swoon at her feet, or to say romantic things to her, then this would prove that she's desirable and that therefore life is worth living.  However, most of the men around her live their normal lives, which doesn't involve much swooning or delivering romantic  gifts or expounding on her 'deceptively youthful beauty' (why is ""young"" a compliment in our culture?) every few pages, so she tends to think that she's doomed to a life of romantic failure, and -- quite unfortunately -- she hasn't got a Plan B:  either she's an outstanding romantic success, or she's a failure.  She has almost zero self-confidence, few enough moral standards, and is really disgustingly vain.  She tries to buy her way out of emotional disarray with cosmetics, hair styling, exercise classes, cigarettes, and expensive vacations.  I found the nicotine addiction to be intrusive, but the scene in which she can't pay attention to *anything else* because she has discovered a short hair on her upper lip, and ""he"" might be revolted by this tiny and temporary physical imperfection, was the end of any lingering sympathy for her.In this book, Ms Raisin runs away from the problems engendered by her ""hopeless romanticism"" -- twice -- to get advice from a conveniently placed stranger, a Latino ""wise woman"".  This character irritates me for being essentially a classic, and classically racist, ""magical negro"" character, with the only material difference being that she exists to make Ms Raisin look pathetically sensitive and in need of gentle guidance or loving support (character development), instead of simply a deus ex machina to advance the plot.Ms Raisin is also stupid, which is to say that she lets her vanity lead her into amazing foolishness, resulting in a supposedly exciting (read:  predictably life-threatening), but unrealistic, conclusion.  (A realistic conclusion would have involved a search warrant, a couple of police officers, and a debriefing over coffee after the action.)This book really seems to be a romance novel, with enough detecting thrown in that you don't have to face the stigma of buying a plain old romance novel.  Perhaps it appeals to women that are as vain, shallow, insecure, stupid, and/or wholly dependent on men to prop up their flagging self-images as the title character.  If Ms Raisin's life and values seemed realistic to the reader, then perhaps such a reader would find the character more sympathetic.  Perhaps (being average in most of these respects) I'm simply too young and too successful to appreciate a character that is convinced that she's a worthless old failure.  I don't recommend giving this book to anyone as a gift unless you want to say, ""I think you're an aging, oversensitive failure, so perhaps you'd like reading about this other aging, oversensitive failure.""Also, like old cult horror movies, I suspect that the series also appeals to people that can laugh at Ms Raisin's endless ""sensibilities"", instead of being disgusted by her apparently total lack of ""sense"", and who can therefore treat it as a bit of candy for the brain.  Unfortunately, I'm in the ""disgusted by it"" camp, and wish I hadn't read it.","2.0 out of 5 stars","November 30, 2009","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJ0JD2OEQZA73/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=031298586X#wasThisHelpful","RJ0JD2OEQZA73","A13H31LR22T8LK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A13H31LR22T8LK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I just don't relate to any of the reviews.  Did any of you read the same book that I did?  Specifically, did any of you read it any more recently than, say, when Dr Martin Luther King was assassinated?Practically every character is introduced with derogatory racial statements.  The author has painfully outdated attitudes against every single non-English person in the book.  I learned a new slur for southern Europeans while reading the second chapter (page 19, and throughout the book).  All Spanish sailors are sweepingly condemned as talkative, lazy, and incompetent.Of course, Europeans fare better than non-Europeans.  The people in Central America are all swarthy, dirty, and ragged.  Their loyalty and convictions are constantly suspect.  Nearly every person in the villain's service is disparaged as multiracial.  Not described -- disparaged.  The most fearsome and least sympathetic characters, such as the major domo, are those multiracial characters with some African blood.Speaking of Africans, Lady Barbara Wellesley announces within minutes of setting foot on the deck that she will have to lock up her black maid because otherwise the maid will unashamedly have sex with every possible man on the ship:  '""It is not on my account, Captain, that I need a key.  It is Hebe here whom I have to lock in unless she is directly under my eye.  She can no more keep from the men than a moth from the candle.""  The little negress grinned widely at this speech, showing no resentment and a good deal of pride.' (page 110 -111).  Lady Barbara then explains that her method of keeping her maid in line is simply to beat her into submission -- just the kind of sweet lady you want for a story's love interest, right?I've read the entire Aubrey/Maturin series repeatedly.  Jack Aubrey would have had nothing but contempt for Hornblower.  He's a scrub with absolutely zero respect for the men under him.  The lower deck consists solely of men that can't do anything except wring their hands unless an officer tells them what to do.  (Yes, these would be the same men that are supposedly at risk for self-organizing a mutiny in the first pages of the book.)  He flogs twice a week.  He lies to and deliberately manipulates his junior officers.  He deliberately tortures them with unfelt displays of serene chat about playing cards when they would rather be preparing for battle because he thinks it might improve their opinion of his god-like infallibility.His first lieutenant is best characterized as the son who wants his father's approval -- and will never get it, because his father is a stuffed shirt.  Hornblower's hang up about talking to his staff results in withholding critical information.  The men under him are supposed to mindlessly obey his orders like automata, and nevermind that a little bit of fair warning would have saved at least one life.There are certain stupidities in the storyline, like the author's decision that Hornblower would be the sole person aboard that speaks any Spanish.  Nevermind that this is unbelievably unlikely in a collection of nearly 400 sailors that had spent so many years at war in and around the Mediterranean, and that lifelong sailors picked up a few words here and there of all sorts of languages.  The average sailor's speech might not amount to much more than ""Woman"" or ""Beer"", but speaking none at all is 'poetic license' at best.In the initial capture of the Natividad, the timing on the action is completely wrong.  The ship drops sails, closes a significant distance, fires a broadside, and lashes its yardarms to the Natividad -- in the length of time that it takes Hornblower to run from one end of his smallish frigate to the other; nevermind that in the very first pages of the book, just getting up the masts and setting (all) the sails takes 24 minutes, firing three broadsides in five minutes was considered a quite good rate back then, it takes a couple of minutes to lash spars together (especially when your opponent is trying to kill you at the time), more than a few seconds to get dozens of men up and down the masts so that you can do any of these things, and a fifty-yard dash (Hornblower was actually running less than that distance) is usually measured in mere seconds--as in, less than ten of them.  But somehow, the author thinks that Hornblower's running from the quarterdeck to the bow takes just as long as all of the above, which is absurd.There are things in this book that are well done -- they do exist, and for that, see all the other reviews -- but overall I cannot recommend it, and I hope that future readers will go into it with more awareness of its contents than I did.","2.0 out of 5 stars","March 4, 2009","http://www.amazon.com/review/R282KBP1OA7E7P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0316289329#wasThisHelpful","R282KBP1OA7E7P","A13H31LR22T8LK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A13H31LR22T8LK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I discovered Dreamfields when Trader Joe's discontinued their not-quite-as-good low-carb product about two years ago.

The calorie count is almost identical to regular pasta.  If you're trying to lose weight, then you need to control your portion size, not just your carbohydrate intake.  However, I find that controlling the portion size is somehow easier with this pasta.* It seems to want a bit more water for boiling than regular pasta.  If you've perfected the art of boiling your pasta in the smallest possible pan, then this probably isn't going to work as well.

"As a cookbook:This cookbook was originally produced around 1990 as a marketing/advertising opportunity.  I believe that you sent in proof of purchase from two Hershey's products and about $4 for shipping and handling to get it.  Because of this focus on promoting their products, the recipes don't call for ""chocolate chips""; they specify ""Hershey's brand semi-sweet chocolate morsels"" or whatever the marketing-speak is for their particular brand's version of some normal ingredient.  My favorite is the one that specifies that you have to use mini chocolate chips -- even though you're going to melt them.  The book included a couple of coupons in the back for getting more copies of the cookbook as well as buying some of the ingredients.These are family-friendly, average-skill recipes.  There are a wide variety of desserts:  cakes, pies, cookies, candies, cheesecakes, and sauces, including some reduced-calorie desserts (but nothing using sugar substitutes like Equal or Splenda).  There are no exotic ingredients:  everything you need will be available at any grocery store.  Only a couple contain any alcoholic flavorings.  Any typical teenager could easily master all of the cooking techniques in the book.  It's a hardcover book but spiral-bound, which I think is the ideal arrangement for a cookbook, because it stands up nicely on the shelf with the other cookbooks, but lays perfectly flat when you're using it.  The cover wipes clean with a damp cloth, which is also a nice touch.As a book:Sometimes this cookbook lives on my kitchen shelf with the other cookbooks, and sometimes it's in the living room with the kids' books.  This cookbook and one very similar to it, on Eagle brand's sweetened condensed milk, have been very popular with younger kids as a book.  There's a photo for each recipe, and they love flipping through the cookbooks and talking about the pictures as much as they love looking at Dr Seuss books.  The kids look at the pictures of a given dessert and talk about what they think the ingredients are (It's pink, so could that be strawberry?  cherry?  raspberry?) and sometimes how they think it might taste or how it's made.  It's kind of a ""coffee table book"" for the preschool crowd -- something to look at in a quiet moment, or to use as a conversation starter.Some readers may be surprised to hear that talking about these recipes has never resulted in demands for sweets, but this has been my experience.  I have ""read"" this book dozens of times with at least five different preschool girls, and while we have talked about ""maybe someday we'll make that and find out"" or even made some of the treats, I have never encountered a demand for sweets as a result, or had a child claim to be hungry as a result.  Our track record is zero temper tantrums -- zero anything even close to ""I WANT THIS NOW"" demands.  That may be due to the kids' deep and abiding conviction that being rude to me has never, and will never, achieve their goals, but I think it actually has more to do with our interest in seeing what's on the next page.  Kids are interested in food, and there's a lot to discover in this little book if you're willing to sit down and look at each page in turn and ask a kid-sized question like, ""Do you think this one is crunchy or creamy?"" or ""Does that look frozen to you?  Do you think it's supposed to be cold?""  Unless looking at pictures of desserts makes you desperate for something sweet, then I recommend it as a non-cookbook ""just plain book"" for the kids' bookshelf.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 4, 2008","http://www.amazon.com/review/R318GU8RYY6WPQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000BGRWHC#wasThisHelpful","R318GU8RYY6WPQ","A13H31LR22T8LK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A13H31LR22T8LK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Is it something I would buY again at this price?This toaster oven wins on all fronts.  It has simple analog controls which should last a long time.  I don't think of computerized controls when I think of a toaster oven.  The heating elements are quartz which also should hold up nicely.  There is an element on top and on on the bottom with a heat spreader over each of them for more even heating.  They also heat up pretty fast although I haven't done any timing measurements.The rack has a drip pan that slides onto the bottom for broiling although I am just leaving it in place all the time.  It could also be used as a baking tray.  The top element is only used for broiling and toasting and both are used for baking.The oven is 8 inches deep and 10 inches wide with about 3 1/2 inches over the rack when it is in the lower position.  The center over the oven bows out one inch to the back so that a 9 inch pizza will fit.  A TV dinner will ift nicely or several baked potatoes,or a casserole, or a small pan of biscuits.  About four slices of toast will fit as well.  Perfect if you are looking for a small toaster oven.  The thermostat is marked up to 450 degrees F but it will go higher if it is turned all the way up.I actually will not be doing much cooking in it.  I got it for my workshop and plan to use it for jobs like heat treating rocks for flint-knapping, or for tempering homemade steel knives and other tools after heat treating them.  I can temper to a hardness above 60 Rockwell.  I also make Kydex holsters and it will be perfect for heat molding them.

Instead the three dials are for day of the week, date, and 24hour indicator.  They are rather small and hard to read, so their usefulness is somewhat limited for my old eyes!  They do make a nice decorative touch though.  The dial hands, though, are very easy to read, so it is very well suited to its primary function.A very beautiful watch at a good price!

"I really like this little recorder for voice recording!  I used to use one of the similar sized recorders that recorded on the little magnetic tape cassettes and found it hard to keep up with the cassettes plus the voice quality was not all that good.  This recorder is completely different.  Good voice quality and plenty of storage time.There are lots of available setting options that could get confusing.  There is a simplified mode that would be helpful to avoid all these options.There are tow microphones to give you true stereo sound and noise reduction.  Recording a lecture or sermon and then playing it back using headphones sounds like you are back in the room!  Very nice audio!  Recording live music isn't as good.  The high and low frequencies seem to be clipped so it is best for voice recording.It accepts up to a 32 gig SD card for more storage capacity than you will ever need!  There are folders for different categories of recordings, but I could only find five preset folders.  It would be nice to have a way to add more folders.  This might be possible but I couldn't find it.The User Manual is not very good.  It gices the minimum amount of information needed, so most of the features and ways to use it have to be discovered by trial and error.  Fortunately, using it as a basic voice recorder is fairly straightforward.  At least it isn't one of those manuals that assumes nobody can read and that only uses pictures.I dropped off one star for the absence of user instructions.  Otherwise,it is a pretty good voice recorder!","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3L5VLWXMYOZQN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014658DHQ#wasThisHelpful","R3L5VLWXMYOZQN","APDJAP3RELMS5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/APDJAP3RELMS5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have never used artificial tanners before, so have no way to compare this product to others.  I have tanned in the sun in the past and have used tanning beds. This product gives a pretty good tan.  I have had a skin cancern taken of my nose so I now avoid the sun as much as possible which means this is about my only choice for getting a tan.Applying it with the tanning mitt (separate purchase) was pretty easy. I just had to make sure I had good coverage.  Doesn't take much and I went over each area two or three times to make sure I didn't miss any spots.  My wife applied it to my back.  The color in the gel goes away pretty quickly so you can't use that to judge how well you have applied it.  I just had to concentrate and be careful.I lift it on two hours and got a reasonable tan.  Not too dark and not too light.  Seemed to be a fairly natural color.Seems a bit expensive to me.  Of course, not as expensive as having a skin cancer removed.  I normally wear a t-shirt and shorts so I will probably use it in the future on just those sking areas that are exposed. I rarely swim any more, so don't really need it for that.All in all a good experience.  Just a bot on the expensive side.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R11CA9AYPMSG9V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00R1CL2HK#wasThisHelpful","R11CA9AYPMSG9V","APDJAP3RELMS5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/APDJAP3RELMS5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Anyone interested in our nation's beginnings and the man who was essential to its successful start will thoroughly enjoy this book.  It reads like a well written history book which I greatly appreciated.  I was concerned that it might be more aponna historical novel, with doses of imaginatively ""filling in the blank"".  The author's sources are all carefully documented and are put together in a very enjoyable way.  The book not only presents an interesting story, it would make an excellent reference itself for further research.Martha and George were a good match for each other.  Martha's strength and charm were a perfect complement to George's talents and were perfect during and after the Revolutionary War.  One fact that the book points out is that Martha gave George a great deal of his stability and confidence.  She visited him frequently in the fueld during the war and he always cheered up when she was around.  Thus was not only a oerfect political partnership, it was also evident that they deeply loved each other.This book give a fascinating insight into George and Martha and their influence on the beginnings of our nation.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RYQ4G8PMEZ01M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0307272788#wasThisHelpful","RYQ4G8PMEZ01M","APDJAP3RELMS5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/APDJAP3RELMS5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Like many customers, I have been trying to figure out how to lower my Comcast Xfinity costs.  They just keep in going up!I had already replaced my rented cable modem, using it with a separate wireless router.  So that saved $10 a month, but I kept feeling I coukd do better.  Then Amazon offered this combination modem/wireless router.  It does what I hoped it would do.  Simplified my setup and improved my performance.When I installed my previous cable modem, it was a pain trying to get it done through Comcast.  This one self installed easily using their online instructions.  Whatever provider you use, I would suggest going to their web site to search for cable modem installation instructions.  All I had to do was to plug the AC1750 into power and the czble connector.  I then used an ethernet cable to connect a laptop computer to the modem/router, opened a browser and went to the setup page on Comcast's website.  It installed easily.Connecting my other devices to the router was also easy.  I just followed the ac1750 instructions.For performance, Imwant to do more testing at different times of the day, but so far it looks like I have speeded up my overall performance.  One problem I have with testing is that most of my neighbors akso use Comcast, and when they all jump on and start streaming, overall performance goes down because there isnonly one pipeline into the neighborhood.  So, I need to separate the Comcast speed from the modem/router speed.My signal strength is about the same through the house as my old setup.All things considered, I am pleased with this combo device.  Getting rid on one device plus not having to pay Comcast rest is well worth it!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2WNI4S97IJQGR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012I96J3W#wasThisHelpful","R2WNI4S97IJQGR","APDJAP3RELMS5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/APDJAP3RELMS5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Update:  well, i was wrong.  We've been trying to use this feeder and have given up.  Both sections of this feeder are leaking and i can't figure out what to do to stop it.  I reduced my rating from five stars to two stars.  It could be used where the leaks don't matter but we can't use it.This is a very creating feeder design.  Very attractive.The feeder sections come apart easily for cleaning and filling.  The two sections are totally separate and can be snapped apart to make two feeders or left together for a double feeder.  Refilling the two sections is easy and the two clear containers just unscrew for cleaning and filling.The white flowers with a yellow bee guard in the center are very attractive.  The perch is the stem of the flower.  Ours arrived with one of the perches broken off, but the hummingbirds just hover at that station, so it isn't hurting anything.Make your own nectar.  It's much less expensive.  On cup sugar to four cups of water, bold for two minutes, cool and refrigerate.  The hummingbirds LOVE cold nectar.Refill every two to three days, and keep the feeder scrupulously clean to attract and keep your hummingbirds.We get about 200 hummingbirds a day at our feeders in late August and September, so we expect all eight feeding stations to be well used!  During that season, we hand as many feeders as we can.  This one will be right outside our window so we can watch the hummingbirds fight over it!","2.0 out of 5 stars","May 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2R3BZJX61Y1EK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JN9NIHG#wasThisHelpful","R2R3BZJX61Y1EK","APDJAP3RELMS5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/APDJAP3RELMS5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Very good hummingbird feeder.  A hanging hook is included.  Easy to fill.  Large 30 ounce capacity.The bottom tray comes apart easily for thorough cleaning which is VERY important for attracting and keeping hummingbirds coming to the feeder.  The bee guards work pretty well, but you will still get a few bees.  I don't think it's possible to completely stop them from trying to get the the nectar.The only negative I see is that the built in ant guard isn't deep enough to work well.  Water will evaporate pretty fast, so we will use a separate ant guard.  An ant guard is a necessary addition to a hummingbird feeder.When you use this, make your own nectar.  The red stuff sold in the stores and online is expensive and many people have concerns about the red dye in it possibly harming the hummingbirds.  Easy to make.  One part sugar to four parts water.  Boil the mix for 2 minutes and let it thoroughly cool.  Keep it in the refrigerator.  In addition to it keeping longer without spoiling and a side benefit is that the hummingbirds LOVE cold nectar!  Change the nectar in the feeder every 2 or 3 days and keep the feeder very clean.In late August and September is the hummingbird migration to Central and South America.  During that season, we will have over 200 hummingbirds a day at our feeders.  So we put out as many feeders as we can and go through LOTS of sugar.  We have friends who come to our yard just to watch the hummingbird swarms.  This is our go-to feeder design.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RP6QZCTUMZ6D7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JN9NHRM#wasThisHelpful","RP6QZCTUMZ6D7","APDJAP3RELMS5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/APDJAP3RELMS5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I agee with the other very good reviews on this hammer.  It is quite a good mid-range hammer. The magnet for starting nails is a nice feature, and the fiberglass handle is tough and lightweight.  Of course, if it is abused, any handle wil eventually break.The weight of the hammer is mostly in the head which gives you a nice, powerful blow.  Because the weight is in the head, it feels decidedly ""head-heavy"" which can be considered either good or bad.  A prolonged session of hammering will tire your wrist out faster than a more balanced hammer will.  On the other hand, it drives a bit faster, and if you use it enough, it will strengthen your wrist.  Not necessarily a bad thing, but at my age (almost 69), it feels a bit heavy for me.  Many carpenters and framers prefer a head-heavy hammer, and a lot of them use a 20 ounce hammer with no problem.  So, just keep this point in mind.I've never used a magnetic nail set and was a bit skeptical that I could position the nail accurately enough.  However, with a bit of practice, I could position the nail and then get it started pretty accurately.  If you have to hold your board in position with your other hand, this allows for one handed hammering.  As someone else mentioned, you can also use the magnet to pick up nails, so that can be handy.  I'll probably continue to position the nail with my left hand and drive it with my right most of the time.The fiberglass handle plus the rubber coating does seem to reduce shock and vibrations as opposed to a wood handled hammer.  The rubber coating also provides a secure grip, especially when you start sweating!  Also prevents blisters, or at least reduces them.All in all, a very good mid-range hammer.  Many pros will like it!  The only hammer brand that I consider to be better is the Estwing line, but they are also more expensive.  A 16 ounce Estwing claw hammer is about 50% more expensive, but is more rugged and better balanced for me.  However, I'll probably use the TEKTON for hard nailing and the Estwing for the rest.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RCGOWTSCXLBBF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MWVAV40#wasThisHelpful","RCGOWTSCXLBBF","APDJAP3RELMS5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/APDJAP3RELMS5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As soon as I received this, I took it to try shop to try it out.  Works great!  It make a very portable vacuum for small jobs in the shop or for tasks like vacuuming out the car.  The suction is about the same as an upright home vacuum cleaner, so it seems strong enough.The head had a couple of tabbed clips on each side for snapping it onto a 5 gallon bucket.  A very nice feature of these clips is that they have notches for the bucket handle.  I just snapped the head onto the bucket and pulled the handle up and it snapped into place.  Since the entire assembly is so lightweight, it is very easy to carry around the house.As is usually the case with shop vacuums, it has a vacuum port and an outlet port that the hose can plug into for blowing sawdust and sauce off of a work surface.  Also has a wet and a dry vacuuming capability.  The filter bag is removed for wet vacuuming and it has a float valve that blocks of the vacuum port if the bucket fills with liquid.  This protects the motor.No wheels, but they are not needed since the assembly is so light.  One other reviewer didn't like the 6 foot cord, preferring a longer one, but I like the length as it is.  If I need a longer cord, I have plenty of extension cords.The only complaint I have about it is that there are no attachments.  At this selling price listed, I would like to see some attachments.  However, I did find that since the hose is the same diameter as on an old upright vacuum (1 1/4 inch OD), the attachments from the upright will fit.  An attachment I would really like to have, though, is a long extension tube so that I can reach the floor while I am carrying the vacuum around.  I'll have to find something that will work for that.  Maybe some thin wall pvc.My planned use for this as as a dedicated vacuum for my band saws.  I plan to mount it under the base of my bandsaws and will set it up to come on whenever I start my bandsaws.  Should be perfect for that.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1H8OLW6B4IVJH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00W9M3K4A#wasThisHelpful","R1H8OLW6B4IVJH","APDJAP3RELMS5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/APDJAP3RELMS5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This seems to be a well made smoker cover, but is a bit tight on my Weber Smokey Mountain smoker.  So far, it seems to provide good protection but I would prefer something that is easier to get on and off.I like the vents in it to help keep condensation from building up.  I don't use the elastic bands over the legs because I don't think it will blow off.The only remaining question is how log will it last in the Georgia sun.  My other covers have only lasted about two or three years and then the sun begins to crack the material.  This material looks similar, so I suspect it will be the same.

"This cookbook is written specifically for Weber Smoky Mountain smoker owners, but it also has excellent recipes for use in other smokers.  So anyone with a decent smoker can benefit from having it.What is unique about this book is that it gives specific instructions for using the WSM as a smoker, an oven, a grill, at high temperatures and at low temperatures.  It describes the Minoin method for making a long lasting smoking fire.  I have used this method for a 14 hour smoke without having to add any more charcoal and the WSM held a very steady temperature.  The WSM and this cookbook are the perfect combination for outstanding smoke cooking!The book starts out with recipes for making competition worthy BBQ and then goes on to include a wonderful variety of recipes for side dishes, and even desserts.I am a dedicated Weber user with A WSM, a Genesis gas grill, and a Weber Kettle grill.  This cookbook is now one of my favorites!I have also used quite a few other smokers and grills including the Big Green Egg and have made my own custom smokers and modified others.  This cookbook could be used with all of them with good results as long as you have a good working knowledge of how to use your particular cooker.  This cookbook gives instructions specific to the WSM, but they can easily be adapted to any of the others.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RKWNK62IUGHM0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1624140998#wasThisHelpful","RKWNK62IUGHM0","APDJAP3RELMS5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/APDJAP3RELMS5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought two pairs of these glasses.  One is the smoke color with mirrored lenses and the other is the amber color.  Both are great!  Exactly what I needed.The Amber glasses were bought to help with night driving.  My eyes have always been light sensitive and over the last couple of years, the headlights from oncoming cars made it impossible for me to drive at night.  The lights were painful, especially those new bright blue/white headlights!  The Amber glasses cut out most of the blue wavelengths and make driving into headlights tolerable!  Those blue/white extra brights are cut down even more tan regular light because a high proportion of the wavelengths of those lights are apparently in the bluish region.The smoke glasses are for daytime use and work great.  Driving in the bright sun is no longer painful!These glasses are wrap around so you can pick up motion to the sides and they also block off light from overhead.  They look stylish...not St all like the old, clunky, fit over glasses look.

"When I saw that this has no MSG I had to give it a try!  MSG give me a roaring headache, frequently before the end of the meal!As other reviewers have noted, it isn't quite as good as homemade, but awfully close!  And it saves a lot of time.  Here are a couple of ways to use it that are delicious!Chicken and rice or any other *** and rice dish.  We use mostly white rice mixing the appropriate amount of water and rice and cooked chicken (usually a rotisserie chicken from the grocery store), taking it to a boil, add the correct amount of Chicken Base, stir it quickly and cover and simmer for about 25 minutes.Flour gravy (roux, chicken gravy, white gravy, sauge gravy, etc). Any gravy that calls for oil, flour and water.  You just brown the flour in the oil (fat, drippings, grease, etc) and then add the appropriate amount of chicken stock made from this base.For soups,me like to mix at least two meats.  Our preference is ham and turkey and you can add a roasted chicken flavor by using this base in the soup water and just add your meats and veggies.As I say, nothing beats making a stock from scratch, but this is a close second.One other point...this base is pretty salty if you use too much.  If you try to increase the chicken flavor by adding more, it will likely end up being too salty.  Better to add cooked chicken and stick to the recommended amount!","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RRK52CFGTPOBK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MQ6EG7Y#wasThisHelpful","RRK52CFGTPOBK","APDJAP3RELMS5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/APDJAP3RELMS5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The initial bitter taste that others have mentioned is too much for me.  It does go away pretty quickly, especially when I eat something afterward, but I can't handle it!

I also am an ""adventurous"" eater and will try just about anything and enjoy almost everything.occasionally, though I run into something I can't handle.

"This little device works so well, I have now bought two of them for different locations.  This is now my go-to range extender!The first one I bought was for my art association (Paulding Fine Arts Association in Dallas, Georgia). Our gallery and studios is in a 100 year old courthouse building and we were unable to get a decent wifi signal over the entire area.  I had installed a very good wireless router, but still didn't have a strong enough signal, so I decided to try a range extender.  This one was a perfect solution!Because the courthouse was built a century before the Internet and wi-fi, there was no way to install a wired repeater.  I neded something that received the wifi signal and simply rebroadcast it.Installation was very intuitive using the built in touch screen.  There is even a built in stylus for typing in passwords! I simply plugged in power, and selected the range extender option and made my selections as they came up.  It was as easy as logging into a new wireless network on an iPad.The re-broadcast network name is simply the original network name with ""- Almond"" added to it.  Of course, you can change the network name and either use the same or a different ""password"".This installation was so successful, I decide to out one in my home to boost the wifi signal there.  I had first tried installing a Linksys router with an external antenna array thinking that better antennas would give me more range.  Didn't boost the signal as much as I needed, so I got one of these Almond devices.  Installation this time took about a minute!Needless to say, I am very pleased with these devices, and will recommend it with no reservations.  I have only used it as a range extender, but it also can be used as a wireless router.  I'll try one as a router next!","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2CMM54J5VS04B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0087NZ31S#wasThisHelpful","R2CMM54J5VS04B","APDJAP3RELMS5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/APDJAP3RELMS5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I struggled with deciding how to rate this product.  I finally decided to rate it based on overall quality and on how well it does what it claims to do.Essentially, it is a combined extension handle and battery pack  for the GoPro.  The only drawback I can see is a GoPro problem, not a fault of this extension pole.  This drawback is the fact that the GoPro camera has no way to plug in a charger without compromising its weather resistance.  Polar Pro makes it VERY clear in their description that this is the case.  GoPro has an open back for thieir case that alllows a charger to be plugged in, which is exactly what Polar Pro recommends.The handle is very high quality and rugged.  Well built and has seals for protection from light rain or snow.  Five stars for handle qualiity and ruggedness.The battery has a capacity equivalent to 4.5 GoPro batteries, so if the battery in the GoPro is fully charged, total capacity is 5.5 times the normal battery life.  It is easy to turn the battery pack on and off and the charging port for the battery pack is convenient and has a sealed cover.  Ther are also three blue LEDs that indicate how much charge is left.  For powering the GoPro, there are two full sized USB ports just below the camera mount and the Power Pro comes with two USB cables, one short and one longer.  This allows the battery pack to recharge any two devices that charge from a USB port.  So, for design, packaging, control and use of the battery pack, I give five stars.The camera mount is designed for the GoPro, but there are numerous mounting accessories available that will work with it, so it will work with any mounts or devices that are GoPro compatible.  I can think of numerous attachments that would be useful and that would extend the usefulness of this handle/battery pack, so most likely they are available.So, I see no reason to lower my rating for problems that center around the GoPro system and are not part of this products design.A good, well mde and designed product that delivers on exactly what it promises.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1MCHLL9L0EQ2Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OIK31NG#wasThisHelpful","R1MCHLL9L0EQ2Z","APDJAP3RELMS5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/APDJAP3RELMS5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have several camping hammocks and also several that I bought in Mexico and South America.  One of these in a Hennesey Hammock which was rather expensive.In my opinion, the Eagle's Nest Outfitters hammock system is the best out there for strength, durability, and comfort.  What I like the most is that I was able to buy the components of a camping shelter system one at a time.  I now have a single nest, a double nest, a rain tarp, a mosquito net and hanging straps.  Everything I need!This review is on the double nest.  The reason I got it is because the extra width enables me to lie on a diagonal so that I am lying flat.  Very comfortable!This system is an excellent compromise between weight and load capacity.  I am 6' 4"" and weigh 250#, so the ultralight stuff is not strong enough for me.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RKQOGCIRQTZU2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00K30KD7M#wasThisHelpful","RKQOGCIRQTZU2","APDJAP3RELMS5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/APDJAP3RELMS5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"What a fun book!  I thoroughly enjoyed this book and the idea behind it and recommend it highly for anyone who enjoys travel.When I was in high school, I read John Steinbeck's book ""Travels with Charlie"".  This was an account of Steinbeck's travels around the United States in a pickup camper with his dog, Charlie.  I loved that book, and wide Open World is the same sort of story and just as enjoyable.Wide Open World is the true story of the adventures of a family that travels literally around the world on the adventure of a lifetime.  Most of us would love to do the same if it weren't for the time and expense required.  The idea that the Marshall's had that made the trip possible is ""volunteerism"".  They still had to take the time off, but were able to eliminate most of the cost of food and hotels by finding several organizations that exchanged room and board for their help with the organizations, or at least provided them very inexpensively.  The Marshall's still had to cover their airfare, but they saved a fortune in hotel and restaurant expenses.  And had some marvelous adventures at the same time.Of course, all of their adventures weren't good. Monkey bites, a wildlife ""sanctuary"" the turned out to not be as advertised were a couple of less than stellar experiences, but that comes with world travel.The worst thing that happened to them was that the tenant who rented their house while they were gone ended up trashing it.  Based on personal experience, I would recommend that anyone considering a trip like this should  use a property management company to rent their house.  It's worth it!Not only does the idea of this sort of travel appeal to me, the idea of ""volunteerism"" also is very appealing.  As more and more of us retire so that our living expenses are covered, there are many organizations that could use volunteer help. For those who want to travel, there are mission trips that need volunteers, and there are cultural exchange programs that offer great opportunities.In short, this book fed my love of travel and my interest in providing volunteer help with some great stories along the way.  The Marshall's travelled with their teenage children, but as more and more of us retire while we are still vigorous, this would be an interesting way to travel.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RM9Z188C1EFVE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0345549643#wasThisHelpful","RM9Z188C1EFVE","APDJAP3RELMS5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/APDJAP3RELMS5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"To my taste, this espresso coffee is quite bitter.  I like an intense, strong coffee flavor, but don't like the burnt flavor of Starbuck's espresso or the bitter taste of the Aldecoa Intense.  To be very clear, though, I like my espresso neat with no sugar or cream or other flavorings.  I think that the bitterness of this coffee like the Starbuck's burnt taster would probably go well in a latte or cappuccino where the sweetness and crime would balance out the bitterness.The other thing I don't like is that in each box, all 10 capsules are sealed together in one aluminum coated bag.  So, once it is opened, the coffee will start losing flavor, although I think that the fact that each capsule is plastic will at least slow that down some.  We'll see.The coffee produced a fairly nice crema, although I don't think it was quite as thick a layer as the Nespresso brand.  Not enough difference to be important, though.  It is still enough to be desirable.The cost of 63 cents per capsule makes it a little less that the Nespresso capsules, but not by much.  I just looked on the Nespresso web site and most of their flavors are 70 cents.  All but one of the Intenso blends are 70 cents and only one is 75 cents.  These would be the ones that are in the same intensity range as the Aldecoa.  I only saw one special blend that was 80 cents.To me, the flavors of the Nespresso blends are more complex and satisfying and well worth an additional 7 cents per cup.  I have tried most of the Nespresso blends and prefer all of them to the Aldecoa.In the interest of full disclosure, I have been a fan of Nespresso since before it was possible to buy their machines in the USA.  I use to get it whenever I traveled to Europe on business.  I have also visited the Nestle offices in Switzerland and have also visited several of their coffee bean suppliers in Central and South America where I sold them laboratory equipment that Nestle required them to use for their quality assurance testing.  So I know first hand how demanding they are with their suppliers.  Interestingly, the coffee suppliers provide coffee to many different bends and each brand has their own roasting and other processing requirements.  Nestle's were among the most rigorous.Even so, I would have been pleased to find another coffee brand that I could use in my Nespresso Essenza machine, but this one is not quite to my taste.","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQ91SIVXUY7ZY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OLDPQUG#wasThisHelpful","RQ91SIVXUY7ZY","APDJAP3RELMS5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/APDJAP3RELMS5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I like this tea a lot.  Good blend of black tea and spices.  I notice that some reviewers prefer to add spice to their taste, but I like this as is.  I tend to drink tea with no sugar or cream, and that is how I like this one.It is a loose tea rather than tea bags.  The tea leaves are cut more coarsely that the tea in bags which I like.  I lost my tea ball somewhere, so until I get around to buying another, I am just using a square of paper towel with the corners twisted and tied.

"This book has a useful premise that could be explained in far fewer words.  It feel like the author was struggling to expand this into book length.  One statements he makes over and over, but doesn't substantiate is that ""cheap experiments are worth more than ideas"".  To me, without having an idea, your have nothing to experiment with!In summary, what the author seems to be saying is that any business idea should be validated via a small scale, inexpensive experiment.  An example he gives is the Amazon.com recommendations based on purchases.  One of the software engineers put together the code and they ran a limited test to see how it would be received.  The point is, they didn't just roll it out to everyone, they did a small ""experiment"" first.This would seem to be an obvious concept, but many managers seem to come up with an business idea that sounds good and then just implement it fully and hope it works.  So, Schrage has a valid point.... Do an inexpensive test before doing a full scale implementation.The useful portions of the book are the examples he gives of small scale experiments that companies ran to test out an ""idea"".  If you are not sure how to frame an experiment, these chapters are helpful.So, the premise of the book is a good one and the examples of some typical experiments are helpful.  Instead of a book, this information could be presented in an extended article.  The difficulty is that wading through so many words to pick out a few good points will cause most readers to give up on the book.","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2KD2YQNVW5ZKF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0262028360#wasThisHelpful","R2KD2YQNVW5ZKF","APDJAP3RELMS5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/APDJAP3RELMS5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Very impressive sound quality!  I am actually using this system to replace a set of Bose speakers in a component home entertainment system, and the sound is more clear and natural than the sound I was getting with the Bose system.  I also replaced the receiver/amplifier that I had since the Klipsch has its own built in amplifier.  So, I simplified my setup and got better sound.I am using this with a Vizio 47 inch flat screen TV, and since it has several selectable sources, I can run my other components through the TV instead of the receiver/amplifier I had in my setup.  I am using the optical audio output form the TV and have not tried the RCA analog inputs to the speakers.The sound is well balanced across the frequency range, but since the subwoofer has a volume control, the low end can be adjusted to your preference.  I see no need for a treble or bass adjustment.Setup was dead simple.  Plug in power to the soundbar and the subwoofer and connect the optical fiber cable between the TV and the soundbar.  None of the rats nest of audio cables that I had with my old Bose setup!  I now have a simpler, cleaner, better sounding sound system.This is my first experience with Klipsch and I am very impressed!  I never expected to prefer the Klipsch system over my Bose system.Update:  Just tried to connect via Bluetooth from my iPad.  Worked great!  I found instructions in the Manual or doing this. (actually pictograph instructions... no one seems to actually use words any more!)  I know that the system used Bluetooth between the sound bar and the sub woofer, but did not know that you could connect to the entire system via Bluetooth.So, there are three ways to connect... via optical cable, via RCA analog, and via Bluetooth.Note to Amazon:  The description on this product's page just calls it a ""Soundbar""  Doesn't mention the Sub-woofer.  Some customers might be confused by this and not consider this product.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 31, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R31BK6S4HA8MTP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00M0SQM2U#wasThisHelpful","R31BK6S4HA8MTP","APDJAP3RELMS5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/APDJAP3RELMS5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This humidifier is very quiet and compact.  It is easy to fill and as the description says, it takes about a day to run out of water.There is a control knob to set how fast it generates the water vapor.  We keep it set at about 60% or 70%.  We haven't measured the capacity, but it appears to be a little under one gallon.  As the description says, it is ideal for a small room.  Or, if you have a sore throat or allergies, you can set it to direct the vapor to your face.It is very quiet and we have not had any problems with noise or defective fans.  Seems to be working quiet well.This is the first filter less humidifier we have had.  Our others are larger and have a filter element in them and are a bit of a hassle to keep clean.  In addition to providing humidity, we use the older ones to generate white noise to help us sleep.

"This is a book that everyone in  the USA and Europe needs to read and understand.  Our media provides very little information on the extreme persecution of Christians thAt is going on in many parts of the world! and this persecution seems to be on the increase.  Christians in the USA in particular think that we are being ""persecuted"", but what we are seeing her is merely disrespect and discrimination.  Real persecution is going on around the world at an alarming rate.Rupert Shortt's definition of Christianity is quite broad and includes all faiths that identify themselves as ""Christian""..  So Catholocism, the Eastwrn Orthodox Church, and the various Protestants are all included.  Essentially, anyone who has the faith and courage to stand up an be counted as Christian.While much of the persecution of Christians is initiated by Muslims, Shortt points out that there are other sources, including governmental persecution.  According to Shortt, more Christians are currently living under threat the. Any other religion.The book is organized with separate chapters on each country that he is examining.  Included countries are Egypt, Iraq, Iran, Pakistan,Turkey, Nigeria, Indonesia, India, Burma, China, Vietnam and North Korea, The Holy Land, and a chapter on the six countries Cuba, Venezuela, Belarus, Sri Lanka, Laos,, and Sudan.The reason this book is so important, is that, as the author points out, ""...freedom of belief is the canary in the coal mine for freedom in general.""  As the disrespect and discrimination toward Christians in the West increases, everyone will experience a corresponding decline in general freedom.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1759YAKW5922J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0802869858#wasThisHelpful","R1759YAKW5922J","APDJAP3RELMS5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/APDJAP3RELMS5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am an artist and woodworker who is recently retired.  This means that I have time to paint more, but also means that I have to come up with a lot more frames.  The price of custom frams is outrageous and even buying ready made frames gets expensive.So... I have been looking for ideas on making my own frame moulding and using it to frame my paintings.  This book is exactly what I needed!It has information on making all types of frames for all types of paintings and photographs.  Making mats, cutting glass, cutting and assembling the frames using either pre-made moldings, or your own home-made mouldings.  On the pre-made mouldings, it even has suggestions for construction moulding profiles that can be used, so you don't need to buy expensive picture fram mouldings.  It even has instruction on finishing techniques.Most of this information is available in other books.  What I was have a hard time finding was a book with ideas for making your own moulding shapes using various router bits.  This books has LOTS of profiles for you to make.Some of the reviews say that the information in the book is ""dated"".  I totally disagree.  Also, the black and white photos have been criticized, but I see no loss of information due to the lack of color.  The only dated information is that a radial arm saw is shown, and these have been replaced by chop saws.  Also the photo of a chop saw in the book is of an old design.  Other than that, I see nothing that i would  classify as ""dated"".In my opinion, the chapter on making your own mouldings is worth the price of the book.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2180T9A0SZVIB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0806975423#wasThisHelpful","R2180T9A0SZVIB","APDJAP3RELMS5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/APDJAP3RELMS5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""The Road to Recovery"" is a call for debate among economists and policy makers into the current state of the world economy and the causes of the problems we are seeing.  The author, Andrew Smithers, presents a very thoughtful and detailed analysis, backed up by extensive data, into the economy and it's problems.  The data is presented in the form of numerous charts (126 charts) with many of them in color.  The reader who is so inclined can, with some effort, verify the author's conclusions based on data and not simply conjecture.The author points out that while the causes of the current sluggishness of the world economy may be simply stared, correcting them will be quite difficult due to the fact that ""the political understanding is generally lacking"".  There must be a ""willingness to debate the issues  and consider the evidence"" in order to implement effective solutions.One concern that I have is that too much attention will be focused on the author's assertion that the current ""bonus culture"" of executive compensation as the primary cause of our economic problems and as a result, not enough attention will be placed on the deficiencies of current economic theory and fiscal policy, which are equally in need of fundamental change.  The problems are deeply pervasive, and solutions will require fundamental economic changes.  In addition, there are different causes in different economies that will have to be taken into consideration.Regarding the ""bonus culture"", the author's contention is that because bonuses now can far exceed salaries, corporate executives are now making decisions designed to maximize their bonuses, leading to a focus on short term results.  This is resulting in decisions that are negatively impacting the overall economy.  This assertion is impressively supported by data.Other important conclusions presented include the current excessive corporate and governmental debt levels, poor economic theory, the lack of recognition that current problems are structural rather than cyclical, and the general lack of political understanding to properly address the issues.The author states that he fears that unless effective change is implemented, we will either continue to have sluggish growth, or we will suffer another, deeper economic crisis.  My experience is that the more fundamental the required change is, the stronger the motivation to change has to be.  Perhaps the needed changes will come without a major crisis, but I am doubtful.For the reader who needs to gain an overview of the book before digging into its contents more deeply, I would suggest first reading chapter 2 - Why the Recovery Has been So Weak, chapter 5 - Cyclical,or Structural: The Key Issue for Policy, chapter 14 - Tackling the Bonus Culture, chapter 15- The Need for Change in Economic Theory and the Resistance to It, and chapter 16 - Summary and Conclusion.While this book is not for the ""casual"" reader, it is quite accessible, and deserves a very wide audience.  The information and conclusions are very important, but at the same time, they will upset the ""status quo"" so that there will be resistance to making the required change.  A wide audience pressing for change will hopefully keep the message of this book from being ignored.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R35TKAT07S8EUJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1118515668#wasThisHelpful","R35TKAT07S8EUJ","APDJAP3RELMS5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/APDJAP3RELMS5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Two flavors I love are sardines in olive oil and anything spicy hot!  These sardines combine the two very nicely.  I do not like most of the other flavors, such as mustard, etc.  sardines in olive oil are the best to me.My preference is to eat sardines with saltine crackers., so that is how I tested these.The tin has a pull tab opening and the King Oscar tab worked perfectly.  I have had the abs on some of the cheap brands to break off.  These work as they are supposed to.When I opened the tin, there were four of five slices of jalapeño on top of the sardines.  The heat from the sardines had infused through the oil.  The peppers are softened through the packing process and there is no vinegar taste leading me to believe that the peppers are placed fresh.I am not a good one to judge heat valves for others since I am pretty much a ""pepper head"".  To me, the heat level is just below medium, which would be about right for most  people who like spicy hot.  A little hotter than the typical salsa in a Mexican restaurant.Since capsaicin dissolves in oil, the olive oil seems to serve as a carrier of the heat as well as a soother of the heat.  This means that the heat is not too long lasting.  So, if it is a bit too hot for you, it won't last long.I will definitely be buying these if I can find them!  I love this combination!","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R26GZQYYJ36DSU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FDM5IE8#wasThisHelpful","R26GZQYYJ36DSU","APDJAP3RELMS5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/APDJAP3RELMS5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm very pleased with this ring binder.  It would be better if it were cloth covered, but for a vinyl covered notebook, it has some great features. There are four overlapping pockets on the front and back cover.  I'm not sure this this is more useful than just one on each cover, but maybe...The covers also have pockets on the outside and spine, which can be used for a title sheet to know what the subject of the notebook is.  Haven't tried it yet, but ink from copiers or printers will probably stick to the inside of the pockets.  At lease it does on all the other vinyl notebooks I have used.  However this is a fairly minor issue.The best feature on this notebook is the rings.  They are ""D"" rings so you can fill it and open it without the sheets separating.  They stay nice and neatly stacked.  The rings are also mounted on the back cover instead of the spine.  This also helps when you open the notebook.  This is the best ring arrangement, in my opinion.The rings are also listed as ""never gap"", so they are not supposed to gap partially open over time.  Can't tell yet how well this works, but on receipt, they are all closed perfectly.The nicest feature is the single lever for opening and closing the rings.  It is located at the bottom and works very smoothly.  Very convenient to open and close.  Very nice when combined with the D rings.  With standard notebook rings, I usually end up opening and closing the notebook using the middle ring, so the sing lever is very convenient.The cover claims that the notebook will last ten times longer.  Ordinary notebooks hold up pretty well, so it will take a long time to evaluate this claim!All in all a very nice notebook.

"I am very impressed with the book!  I have a number of book on archery and how to improve your performance, but this is the best I've read.  My other book are accurate and correct in what they teach, but this one is much more comprehensive.I am a ""primitive"" bow maker and archer, making my own straight-limbed, longbows from either boards or bow staves split from trees.  I have not made any recurves yet, but will try them soon!  One word of warning to other ""primitive"" archers is that the authors are prejudiced toward ""modern"" bows and materials, and do not think very highly of traditional wooden bows and arrows, which I VERY strongly prefer!  That should not dissuade the primitive archer at all, though, because if the instruction in this book is followed carefully, it will most definitely improve your performance!The sub-title of the book is ""Steps to Success"" and that describes the approach of the book very well.  It covers the details of archery in a very step by step manner from selecting your equipment to setting it up properly, and how to shoot with proper form.Details on shooting straight limb, re-curve, and compound bow is covered equally well, even though the emphasis is on target shooting, which is most often done with re-curve bows.  No matter what type of bow you select, this book will help tremendously to improve our shooting.  There is a chapter that discusses the differences between target shooting and hunting very well, so every type of archery is well covered.  Of course, if you are hunting, it doesn't cover how to find your quarry, just how to hit it when you DO find it!The method I would recommend for studying this book is to go through Chapters 1(fitting equipment), 3 (Shooting with good form), 5 (aiming and sighting), and 6 (Anchoring and releasing) first to make sure you have fitted your equipment well, and that you you are shooting with proper form and technique.  It would be good to have an experienced archer check you out early on and then periodically during your progression to make sure you are not developing bad habits.  Once you have proper form and technique down, then use the instruction in chapter 4 and 7 to refine your technique.  Also, you will need to periodically review all the material, because as you progress, you will learn things that you missed before.  (Oh, THAT'S what that meant!!)This book is what the beginning to intermediate archer needs to become quite proficient, although having an experienced archer check you periodically is also going to be important.  To go beyond this book, you will need a good coach!The only negative to me is the authors' prejudice toward ""primitive"" bows and arrows.  A good, straight-limbed, wooden longbow can outshoot most recurves and even many compound bows.  The only advantage to the compounds is that a higher draw weight can be handled with less arm strength and the fact that it is easier to mass produce bows using the modern materials.  Primitive archery is experiencing a massive revival worldwide and it would be great if the authors could be exposed to some of the advances that are taking place.  In spite of that, this is still an excellent teaching manual!","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3F5IX67J1G7E5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1450444687#wasThisHelpful","R3F5IX67J1G7E5","APDJAP3RELMS5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/APDJAP3RELMS5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am convinced that one one has the capability of understanding a child like that child's mother.  This book drives that home and shows that often a Mother's instincts are more valuable than the opinions of ""experts"".In addition to being a very engaging story, there are lessons to be learned here for any Mother.  It is not likely that many mothers will have a child who is a ganius or autistic, but the lessons of this book will still apply.  There is nothing like a Mother's love!The key point to be learned from this book, in addition to the value of a Mother's love, is the instinctive insight that Kristine had to focus on her child's strengths and main interests.  Our education system today is geared around forcing every child into the same mold.  The problem is that this tends to focus on building up perceived weaknesses and also has the tendency to play down any exceptional qualities.  The genius of Kristine's insight was to focus on Jacob's strengths and interests and to work on developing those.This hit home with me because for most of my life and career, I followed the advice of the self help books and worked on strengthening those areas that someone else had decided were weaknesses.  How many job reviews have you had that identified some weakness or the other and encouraged you to strengthen it?  Finally, I found a book that helped me identify my strongest areas and interests and that encouraged me to focus on developing them more than on my weaknesses.  It made all the difference when I started working within my strengths and on those things that I was most interested in.The lesson in this book for all parents is to find those areas that your children are strongest in and help them to develop those areas.  If your child is most interested in mechanical things, don't try to force him to become a doctor.  He will be mush more successful and happy if he is working within his strengths.Wonderful book and a marvelous story!","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2X4ZWK5PPGLBW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0812993373#wasThisHelpful","R2X4ZWK5PPGLBW","APDJAP3RELMS5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/APDJAP3RELMS5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I had always understood that the Old Testament pointed to the New Testament and to Jesus and that there are many prophecies in the Old Testament regarding Jesus and His life.  This book brought that home to me in a very fresh and meaningful way.There are many books written on the life of Jesus that take different approaches.  There may even be other books that take the approach followed by this book, but this is the first I have read.What this book does is to look not only at the life of Jesus in His earthly incarnation, but also to look at Him and His existence throughout eternity and through the entire Bible.  The theology of scripture and the life of the historical Jesus are merged in a way that is very helpful.  This book is not just a biography or a book on the theology of the Bible, it is a Theography.This book helped me to a grander and more sweeping view of who Jesus is.  My view of Jesus has been too small in the past!","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2PHL4D57HY84K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0849947022#wasThisHelpful","R2PHL4D57HY84K","APDJAP3RELMS5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/APDJAP3RELMS5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a very good book for those of us with older parents.  I found it to be accurate and it gave me some critical information that I needed as my parents became less and less able to take care of themselves.  They have both passed on now so I guess that next I will be using it for my wife and I to help ease the difficulty that our children have taking care of us.This book seems to cover all of the landmines and pitfalls that you will run into as your or your loved ones age.  And there are MANY!!  It seems that everything is getting more and more complicated and at times, it seems that everyone it out to take as much of your assets as they can.What I did, was to use this book to educate myself on what needed to be done and then I found a good ElderCare attorney to help me implement all the documents I needed and to help with the government applications then I needed to fill out on my parents.  I needed this book to help me evaluate the advice that my attorney was giving me.  This book and my attorney were both indispensable to me and helped me to avoid some expensive mistakes!Be sure to read through the table of contents available to the Amazon page.  This will give you a good idea of what this book covers.  One of the most valuable features on Amazon!With this book and my attorney, I was able to keep both of my parents secure and well cared for during their last days.  I will always be grateful for the time I had with them and for the fact that their last days were as comfortable as possible.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3D1DINS6AOQ57/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0133091929#wasThisHelpful","R3D1DINS6AOQ57","APDJAP3RELMS5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/APDJAP3RELMS5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"In a busy world, it is not always easy to find that one minute to dedicate to ourselves. This is why I am happy to find quick, crisp and to the point books such as this one about how to revert the focus form a hectic life to myself. Focused on self-improvement and proposing a simple approach, not at all time consuming, I find the meditation invitation available in this book appealing. It's an easy to try method that I believe can bring benefits only by the simple fact that it dedicates one whole minute to the individual.

"It is not hard at all to become a fan of Gregory Wolk's work, mainly due to the originality and quality of each of his writings. ""The New Dark Ages"" did not disappoint me either, even more it exceeded my expectations when it comes to dystopian novels. The power of will, the courage and true feelings for loved ones are beautifully portrayed in Danielle's quest to save her father in a futuristic world where electricity becomes a luxury. A heroine of the future. Danielle is a pure expression of dedication and ambition, making this novel more a character novel than a dystopian one.

"I recently saw this product in my local grocery store in a small bag.  What you get here is an attractive tin, suitable for giving as a gift or for a keepsake / storage.The tin contains both milk and dark chocolate squares filled with caramel.  There are about 70 pieces in the tin which is 2.5 pounds.The chocolate isn't similar to regular Hershey's milk chocolate bars.  It is more similar to Hershey's Pot of Gold if you've had those.The caramel isn't a flowing kind of caramel but a chewy and thick kind.They are very delicious - the chocolate is a perfect match for the dense caramel filling.I was fortunate to be home when these were delivered.  Being chocolate, there is a risk of melting in warmer states.I think this would make a wonderful gift.

The Plenty rolls have 52 two-ply sheets and the Brawny has 46 two ply sheets.As for look and feel, the Plenty feel strong and soft though not cloth-like.They are absorbant and don't quickly break apart into little pieces like some brands.One thing I like about Plenty is they use tree-saving technology which uses less trees to make more great quality paper.You get 4 six packs of Plenty paper towels which is a good quantity.  We use a lot of paper towels and probably go through 8 big rolls in 2 weeks.On the downside, these are full sheets, not ""pick a size"".  I like the 11 x 6 sheets because I seldom need a full sheet unless I am cleaning a mess.  But for drying hands and small tasks, a small sized sheet works best for me and saves towels.I consider this a convenient way to purchase towels and this pack will last a while depending on the size and voracity of your family.I would recommend them when put up against the big brands.  They are strong and powerful enough for cleaning tasks and they get the job done.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RTGI4UBRAR4T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012HE3U2G#wasThisHelpful","RTGI4UBRAR4T","A1BK60GZ4QME6I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1BK60GZ4QME6I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The premise behind this product is pretty simple.  You spritz the surface of the toilet water 3-5 times which creates a barrier on the water's surface.A moderate yet fresh scent is emitted.  In my case, I had the original scent which is lemongrass-citrus scent.Does it work?  Surprisingly it does.  The odors stay trapped beneath the protective barrier and the bathroom has a moderate scent which lingers for several minutes.I guess if there was something to complain about it would be that the angle needed to spray sometimes chokes up the sprayer and makes it hard to spray.Not much else can be said about this product.  I keep a bottle in my guest bathroom to prevent embarrassment.I would recommend this product.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1RR0KJKQEQLUS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0108XRHJU#wasThisHelpful","R1RR0KJKQEQLUS","A1BK60GZ4QME6I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1BK60GZ4QME6I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Dreamworks Eye Found It! Game is a large, six-foot game board.  The game board features characters from your favorite DreamWorks films.  Think Donkey from Shrek, the Penguins of Madagascar, Po from Kung Fu Panda, etc.  The board is divided into eight lands which are themed after each DreamWorks film character.You get 1 Six-Foot Game Board in three sections, 6 Movers, 6 Mover Bases,1 Spinner, 12 Shrek Ear Markers, 30 Search Cards, 1 Sand Timer, Instructions.This game is for kids 4+ and accommodates 1-6 players.  Game play does not drone on forever like some games.  Perhaps half an hour or a little more.Players scan the universes of Shrek, How to Train Your Dragon, Madagascar, Kung Fu Panda and more to find favorite characters and hidden items on the board. The game builds upon the success of the Wonder Forge Eye Found It! Game line.One of the things that occurred to me is a savvy kid can find things ahead of time and memorize their locations.  Even so, consider it a good memory exercise and appreciate the ability to spend time with family.I think this is a fun and non-competitive game for family game night or even solo-play.  I would recommend adding it to your collection of games.Update:  There are some major annoyances with the game.  The sand timer runs down too fast and doesn't give ample time to locate all of the items indicated by the card.  There are not enough markers if you have 6 players.  You also need a ton of real estate to set up this game board and with six players it is elbow to elbow.None of us who have played it really like the objective.  You basically have a low chance of spinning a card or landing on a search space.  If you end up landing on the movie snacks then all of them could be depleted quickly, effectively ending the game. We would also prefer more competition.  This is more collaborative play.Unless you have a kid's eyesight, locating the items from the card require sharp eyes.  My parents had trouble playing for this reason and got frustrated when the timer ran out.I think this could be a fun game if the objectives made more sense.  We actually collaborated on coming up with our own set of rules to make it more fun.  Put it this way:  when we have family game night, the consensus is that we very rarely play this game.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RPBUI14EYVLFX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00U5P24UE#wasThisHelpful","RPBUI14EYVLFX","A1BK60GZ4QME6I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1BK60GZ4QME6I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There is a lot of advertising now for eliminating WiFi dead zones.  My cable company offers this feature for a monthly fee in which several repeaters are placed in low-signal areas of your home.If you are asking ""what is a repeater?"" then I will offer an explanation.  A repeater boosts an existing WiFi signal and can extend wireless networking to hard-to-reach spots or low coverage in your home or office.  You might use something like this for notebooks, tablets, smartphones, game consoles and smart TVs.I put this one in my garage.  That's because I have a WiFi enabled treadmill which tracks my workouts and it was barely getting a signal.  With this installed I get a full signal where I only got a 20% signal before.I use mine with a Belkin router as the base wireless router.  This repeater hs a small footprint at 7.5 x 3.2 x 5.4 inches.I was able to get this set up in 15 minutes or so.  I connected mine to a PC via an Ethernet cable and accessed the web-based configuration menu directly.  You could also set this up by pressing the button or wirelessly from a tablet or smartphone.  Like my other Belkin extender, you get a SSID similar to your primary one with _rpt at the end and this is editable.  This model offers a 300 Megabit per second transfer speed.One of the benefits I see is this tolerates my router going offline really well and seamlessly reconnects when the router is back online.I don't find this item aesthetically pleasing.  However, you can adjust its external MIMO antennas for the best signal and tuck it away behind something.  The Smart LED signal indicator helps you find the best location for optimum Wi-Fi.  It is green for an excellent signal and red for a weak signal.This product also features a media bridge mode and access point.  An access point might be useful if you are in a hotel, for example.  You can create a personal Wi-Fi hotspot, allowing the internet connection to be accessed from laptops, phones or other Wi-Fi devices and have only one internet fee.  As a media bridge, it can be connected to any Ethernet-compatible device — such as a smart TV, multimedia player, game console or PC — to give it Wi-Fi capability.There is also a nice feature called roaming assist.  In a nutshell, as you move around the house your device will attach to the strongest signal instead of being tied to one (possibly the weaker) signal.I am pleased with the size of this device as well as its performance.  I would recommend it to helo eliminate dead zones around the house.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3N9IRA7Z01SQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013LKLK2M#wasThisHelpful","R3N9IRA7Z01SQ","A1BK60GZ4QME6I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1BK60GZ4QME6I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a really substantial mat at more than 8 pounds and 53 x 41 inches.  It is 10mm thick or about half an inch thick.It arrived rolled, wrapped in plastic and inside an outer box.  You will need to unroll it and give it a chance to flatten.  I had to put some books on the corners to achieve this.  It also has a plastic type smell when first opened.The mat is double sided - side one is a city scene and side two is a zoo scene.The zoo scene is appealing but upon closer inspection the two sides of the zoo have the same critters.  The city scene is similar - lots of reused graphics.The graphics in general are colorful but probably beyond what a baby can understand, making this suitable for toddlers.  It would be good for playing with toy cars or action figures during imaginative play.I am not sure this would be good to lug around.  I just leave mine in place.In summary, this is a pricey mat and is thick and comfy.

"My initial reaction when I opened the box was ""this is Cuisinart?"".Upon unboxing and examining the ladel, I was surprised at how uncharacteristically low quality this was for a Cuisinart product.The area where the handle meets the cup looks like it had stretch marks - rough annealing lines or stree marks in the metal.  There are even some rust colored splotches which wiped off with a good scrubbing.  It is supposed to be stainless steel (100%) so I guess these are factory marks.The handle is sort of thin and doesn't exude the feel of quality.  The edges are not polished and smooth.If this wasn't embossed with Cuisinart I would have thought it came from the bargain bin.As for functionality, this is where Cuisinart saves itself.  The cup is the right size (4 oz.)for pizza sauce for soreading sauce on a pizza crust.  The product picture shows a grill but I use mine inside when making pizza on my pizza stone.  The bottom of the cup is flat which is another feature that aides in dispensing sauce.  The length is good and it has a curved end for hanging.  A hole would have been OK too.I am reducing by two stars due to the rough area where the ladel meets the cup and the relatively thin/sharp and non-ergonomic design of the handle.I wouldn't call this a must-have item but it is handy to have when you are making pizzas.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1OERV295Q49M0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00T06WFIA#wasThisHelpful","R1OERV295Q49M0","A1BK60GZ4QME6I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1BK60GZ4QME6I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I got this for my grandson as a birthday gift.He is a big Thomas fan and has even been to a Thomas theme park.In summary, this is a wooden railway train track set.  It includes Thomas the train engine and a cargo car.The train tracks are interlocking pieces of wood.  The engine and car lock together magnetically and they are also wooden.  Thre are 18 pieces of track included in this set.This set has a lot of fun features.  Rolling down the hill engages a xylophone effect where some chimes are struck to the melody of the Thomas theme song.  As Thomas continues down the tracks, he rounds the bend and passes through the overpass right past the water mill, just like in the Thomas & Friends opening credits.  Spinning the water mill loads the train with cargo.  The hill itself is 'painted' with a Thomas scene.It is worthy to note that this set fits on Thomas & Friends Wooden Railway Play Table.  In terms of coordinating items there is a Dino Fossil discovery 2-pack of train cars that would interlock with this.  You can also get Samson and some extra ascending track and risers.Adult assembly is required but no tools are needed to complete the assembly.This set is built to last.  It utilizes imaginative play and is not powered.

"I am not shy about trying supplements, even if they don't sound too appetizing.  My wife raised her eyebrow as I told her I was trying SoTru's fermented mushroom powder mixed into a glass of water.I was expecting an earthy and musty flavor but was surprised to get a sweet citrus type of flavor.  It mixed in with water quite well and was palatable.  I am happy that it is very low calorie.One of the things I noticed was that only approximately half of the plastic jar this comes in had product.  I believe the size of the container is a bit large for the net weight of the supplement.  However, the jar has a pleasing brown color with earthy colored lettering.  The color scheme immediately makes you think ""forest"" and for me was a selling point.So let's discuss the contents.  I current take a daily vitamin complex which contains Cordyceps, Agaricus blazei, Maitake and Shiitake in a Cordyvant Polysaccharide Complex.  I am aware of the immunity boosting power of these mushrooms/fungi.  The blend in this supplement has Cordyceps, Reishi, Agaricus blazei, Shiitake, Maitake and Turkey Tails all fermented on organic oats.  There is also some Acerola Cherry Extract for vitamin C, green tea leaf and ginger root.One scoop also contains 5025mg of Organic Gum Acacia.  The acacia gum alone has demuculent and bacteria inhibiting properties.  Cordyceps has along list of posible benefits and you can Google that information for more.  It basically works by stimulating the immune system.  Reishi has similar benefits. From WebMD, Araricus ""contains chemicals that might improve the body's use of insulin and decrease insulin resistance in people with type 2 diabetes. Some developing research also suggests it might be able to strengthen the immune system, fight tumor development, and work as an antioxidant.""  Shiitake has chemicals that could lower cholesterol as well as other benefits.  Maitake stimulates the immune system and is a cancer fighter.  (Note: many of these mushroom components have cancer / tumor fighting elements) Turkey Tails was a new one for me but I did some armchair research and found it is called Coriolus and a host of other names.  It is primarily an immune system stimulant that contains polysaccharide peptide (PSP) and polysaccharide-K (PSK, krestin).With all the potential benefits, I see this as a very valuable supplement in terms of immunity boosting and prevention.In today's environment we need all the assistance we can get.After drinking this several times, I didn't notice anything in particular.  The work it is doing is likely at the cellular level and not easily measurable.  I am happy to add this to my daily supplement regimen and I would recommend it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ZRHAYS340KX9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WW8ZHZ6#wasThisHelpful","R1ZRHAYS340KX9","A1BK60GZ4QME6I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1BK60GZ4QME6I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Kinitic spinners are perennial favorites in Florida gardens.This large spinner features colorful hibiscus flowers being courted by ruby-throated hummingbirds.The wheels are stainless-steel and spin in opposing directions when properly assembled.The box contained the spinning blades, pre-assembled.  There was a lower post in a separate box and a stake assembly.  Assembly was very easy, taking less than 5 minutes.  The only gotcha is to remove the thumb screw completely before inserting the lower post, then tighten.Once assembled, there is some post assembly work.  You must bend the blades at a 30 degree angle.  This is harder to explain than it is to do.If the left and right wheels are bent in the same direction then the wheel will spin in the same direction.  So you bend them counter to each other.Make no mistake - this is a substantial spinner.  Be sure to plant it in firm soil.  I had a chance to see this thing weather a recent thunderstorm.  It was spinning really fast but kept it's posture and looked nice.  Hopefully it won't be attractive to lightning.The spinner comes with a 2-year warranty.  I doubt you will need it though - this thing is solidly built.I would recommend it to spruce up any garden setting.UPDATE 10/25/15:  I might need that warranty after all.  Mine fell apart.  Both spinners disconnected and were found on the ground after several weeks of light use, no storms or gusts.  It was in an isolated garden section but I cannot rule out wildlife as a suspect since we have lots of possums and raccoons in the vicinity.  Regardless, it fell apart and I would have to purchase hardware to fix it myself or spend a fortune on shipping to send it in for warranty repair.

"A couple of things appealed to me about this item looking at its product page.It doesn't require the practice and training of a traditional drone.  That's a big plus for me.It also has auto take off, auto hover and auto landing.  No more hard landings or botched takeoff attempts!The first thing I thought when I got this was ""I thought it would be larger.""  I had seen the video and even read the specs but was still surprised by how small this thing was.The controller uses a 2.4 GHz frequency and has a range of roughly 250 feet.  It takes 4-AAA batteries.There are flip buttons and auto stunt buttons.  The drone features proximity sensors to prevent crashes and provide a soft landing.Crashes are still inevitable but this model seems to resist damage.I tried mine in my office, after hours.  It could be flown outdoors but the minuscule size might make it susceptible to wind.Battery life of drone itself is poor.  The sensors worked pretty good but there are some things in a relatively mundane office environment that trip it up.Overall it is very fun to play with but would require a good investment of time to master.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1AOTSSUO5KERF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00X9CEVII#wasThisHelpful","R1AOTSSUO5KERF","A1BK60GZ4QME6I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1BK60GZ4QME6I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I got this surge protector because of its cable protection feature.  I have some AV equipment on my bedroom TV and this was an ideal strip for protecting those devices plus the incoming cable feed.You get 1000 joules of protection and EMI/RFI noise filtration.  There are six outlets and none of them are spaced for transformer blocks.  The outlets have sliding safety/dust covers.The plug is a right angle flat plug so you can fit this into an outlet behind furniture.  There is an on/off switch which turns on/off all outlets.As with most surge supressors, this one doesn't last forever.  That has more to do with the particular technology used to avert the surges.  I replace all my strips every 3 years just to be sure they are still protecting my equipment.In the end, I feel better knowing my electronic stuff is plugged into one of these strips.  Having recently lost a cable modem from a coax-based surge, I very much recommend coax protection.  This strip is no-frills.  It is inexpensive and not aesthetically pleasing.  But it is better then plugging something straight into the wall outlet.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R16RL7XRAFFAQ5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005CHMR4S#wasThisHelpful","R16RL7XRAFFAQ5","A1BK60GZ4QME6I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1BK60GZ4QME6I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Ellen Byron has put together a whodunit set in Cajun Country.  Having been to New Orleans and surrounding areas, I felt the portrayal of the Pelican, Louisiana setting was accurate and well constructed though quick to stereotype.Told from the point of view of a historic plantation B&B owner, the mystery unravels slowly and keeps you guessing until the last set of chapters.  In between the mystery there is a shallow romance with strategically placed characters interwoven with the plot.  The characters had some depth but as a reader I never felt particularly emotional about any of them.This book ended up being a Cajun murder mystery, moving at the speed of the bayou  I never felt compelled to turn pages but I was interested enough to want to know how it ended.Overall, this was a satisfying read without twists and just suspenseful enough to keep you reading.  Some of the subplots tried to take over the story and I could feel the writer trying to tame them.  But overall I thought it was a good read.  By the way, there are some good recipes at the end of the book which you'll probably want to try after reading about all the delicious food and pastries.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3PH571HDNMHL7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1629532509#wasThisHelpful","R3PH571HDNMHL7","A1BK60GZ4QME6I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1BK60GZ4QME6I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This review is for the Woods 041708 8-Outlet Electronics Energy-Saving Surge Protector.Surge protectors are an absolute necessity in areas prone to thunderstorms and pretty much anywhere else.The idea is to balance affordability with features and protection.  The Woods surge supressor has some good features which make it worthy of consideration.I live in Central Florida and we recently had a lightning strike about 8 feet from our kitchen on a palm tree.  The nearby cable company wiring block was fried, even though it was not directly hit.  (By the way: nearly nothing electronic survives a direct lightning hit and no surge supressor can handle 5 billion joules.)  One of my surge supressors in the house was taken out, thankfully sparing the attached electronic equipment.  You never know what surges, spikes and electrical noise might be doing to your sensitive items.  Why take a chance?This supressor is rated for 4200 Joules so it provides basic to intermediate levels of surge protection.  It has 8 grounded outlets and 2 of them are offset to accept transformers.  LEDs indicate ground and protection status.  There is a resettable 15A circuit breaker.  The plug is flat so you can plug this in behind furniture without losing the ability to push the furniture flush with the wall.  Another feature is that it filters EMI/RFI noise.One of the big features of this supressor is that it automatically turns off up to 3 devices, eliminating phantom power loss.  Consider this scenario:  You plug your TV into the Master Outlet.  When the TV is turned off, this device will detect that and shut off power to the peripheral devices (DVD player, speaker system, etc.) provided they are plugged into the controlled outlets.  The non-controlled outlets remain on all the time.  Both are clearly marked to prevent confusion.The outlets have rotating dust covers when not in use.  If I have a situation in which things don't fit, I use those little extension cables such as ASIN B003I7FEHQ.There are other models which have either phone or coax protection.  You should always protect coax since a surge can travel over coax just as easily as it can over electrical wiring.Overall this is a good general purpose surge protector in cases where you would need the controlled outlet feature.  If you don't then just get a normal strip that protects against surges.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RT29NSQF0UV55/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IZY07UG#wasThisHelpful","RT29NSQF0UV55","A1BK60GZ4QME6I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1BK60GZ4QME6I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a three-story interactive toy house featuring the Miss Norah MagicPoint character.  Norah is interoperable with other Go! Go! Smart Friends doll accessories and toddler playsets.  There is also a puppy character included.This house is really feature packed.  I will try to summarize.First there is an elevator that goes up and down by pressing the yellow button on the character.  This is part of the MagicPoint feature.  This set has 7 MagicPoint locations which interact with the character(s).  There is also an interactive MagicChat location that lets two friends chat and sing with each other.  So you basically place Miss Norah on a MagicPoint location to experience her personality, lights and more.The front of the house has 6 windows, a treed area with swing and an entrance with a slide.In terms of learning, this set teaches letters, cause & effect and motor skills.  There is also an element of imaginative play which most toys share.  It's kind of like a modern doll house.You will need 2 AAA batteries to replace the ""demo"" batteries that are included.  Ideally you will need other ""Smart Friends"" to interact with Norah.I think this is a good doll house type of toy and turns out to be a lot of fun.

"Simply put, the VTech Kidizoom Smartwatch DX is a fun smart watch for kids.At a high level, the watch features 3 fun activities, 5 games, 3 action challenges and a pedometer + motion sensor.The watch features a camera and video capability.The 256MB memory stores about 1600 photos at the camera's resolution.The video clips are limited to 60 seconds each and are 320x240 or 160x120 pixel @ 15fps.The photo resolution is 640x480 which makes this a 0.3MP camera.There are creative photo effects, frames and filters that can be applied to photos.This watch is packed with features.There are four learning games:  Jumping Egg, Tic-Tac-Toe, Super Snowboard and Finger Dance.There are four action games:  Sound Shaker, Crazy Dance, Racing Run and Funky Jump.Additional games can be downloaded from the Learning Lodge, a dowloadable app for PC or Mac.Kids can share videos and photos via social media using #smartwatchdx.There is also an alarm, timer and stopwatch, plus a calendar feature and a calculator.The watch face can be customized with either digital or analog display themes.The watch arrives in an attractive acrylic case.  The bottom portion of the box contains a micro-USB cable for uploading photos / videos and an instruction booklet.  Appropriate ages would be 4-9 years old.The battery is a lithium ion battery which has a duration dependant on frequency of usage: 1 day for heavy usage, 2-3 days for typical usage and 2 weeks for low usage. The watch is ""splashproof"" meaning it is not waterproof but would resist casual moisture.I found transferring files from watch to computer to be a bit dated and cumbersome.You plug in the watch via the micro USB.  A drive appears called VTech 1557. You navigate to the DCIM folder and locate the files which are drag and dropped to a location on your computer.  I would have expected a driver capable of automatically importing files upon connection to a PC/Mac.One thing that should also be noted - there is no language setting on this watch.  It is English only.  I was considering recommending this to a Spanish speaking family I know but it does not support Spanish.With all the features and downloadable games, I think this would make a wonderful gift for a 6 year old.  Kids these days are practically raised on electronics.  This would be a starter for an introduction to a smart watch possessing greater capabilities at a later age.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1KRDD4IHLSJYK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZCZV0I4#wasThisHelpful","R1KRDD4IHLSJYK","A1BK60GZ4QME6I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1BK60GZ4QME6I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Whether you are camping in the back yard or elsewhere, a solidly constructed and comfortable sleeping bag is a necessity.This sleeping bag is touted as a Women's sleeping bag, rectangular design.  Dimensions are 80"" x 34"".  It fits up to a 6' human.  The packed size is 10"" x 18"" and the carry weight is 4 pounds, 14 ounces.  The shell/liner is made of Polyester Taffeta.  (Synthetic insulation)This bag is rated for 20F though I don't live or camp in a state where temps would typically reach that low.  My wife recently tried it in a backyard setting in the mountains of NC where it got to the mid-40's at night.  The bag felt comfortably warm in that setting.What makes a sleeping bag a women's specific model? Women often have colder extremities than men.  Women's bags are sometimes cut to be a bit wider in the hips and narrower in the shoulder though I can't see any difference with this bag.  It's rectangular.  I do not know if there is any extra insulation at the feet.  The men's version of this bag has the same carry weight and temperature rating.  Surely this company didn't just call it a women's bag because of the color?At any rate, the bag is functional and comfortable.  Two bags can be zipped together and it comes with a stuff sack for compacting.  I would recommend this for male or female use.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RKO43VUTI5RN9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AA4I40Y#wasThisHelpful","RKO43VUTI5RN9","A1BK60GZ4QME6I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1BK60GZ4QME6I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This food features cubes of poultry and bits of swelled rice in a gravy.The can has a pull ring for convenience.I have used Nutro brand dry food products for my dog and the outside stray cat who is trying to adopt us.One thing I can say about this food is my large dog loves it.  He loved the tender bites and the gravy.The cat also smelled this food and started eating it...so it is liked by both feline and canine which says a lot about the flavor.One of the problems with large dog breeds is joint issues.  This food features glucosamine and chondroitin for healthy joints.  It also has a balanced protein to fat ratio plus omega-6's and zinc.  Oddly, this product contains gluten which a lot of high end pet food manufacturers shy away from these days.I think the verdict is in.  My dog loves this stuff and I like the ingredient list, for the most part.  I would order it again.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3PUA65TQM2H5I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TZSEO0U#wasThisHelpful","R3PUA65TQM2H5I","A1BK60GZ4QME6I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1BK60GZ4QME6I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I own and have owned several Epson printers.  I also interact with Epson printers at work.The models I have owned or utilized are as follows:Epson XP-520 (home)Epson XP-800 (work)Epson WorkForce WF-2540 (work)Epson Artisan-800 (home)Epson WP-4020 (home)Epson XP-630 (recently replaced the WP-4020 and XP-520)I am going to reuse a bit of review material from my other Epson reviews because this information is still relevant.My first all-in-one from Epson was the Artisan-800 - a fabulous machine until it started consuming a whole ink cartridge every week with only a few printed pages. I also had big issues with the WiFi on this machine, eventually switching to wired Ethernet. Next was the WF-2540 - a wireless all-in-one copier, scanner, fax machine and color printer. This served as my mail printer at work for a period of time until it simply quit printing. The WF-2540 started the same ink consumption cycle as the Artisan - I would replace a cartridge, print a few pages and watch the ink levels reduce by half. Then it stopped printing and finally got to the point where it would constantly tell me my cartridges need replacing (and wouldn't let me print). I have also used an Epson WP-4020 in my home office which I use for more voluminous printing chores. It hasn't had a single issue except the occasional duplexer jam and the inks last a long time.  I eventually gave this one to my daughter for frequent printing of homework based stuff and it is still going strong.One of point of irritation for Epson's. When they run out of ink (ANY color), you can't print. Period. And when the printer *thinks* it has run out of ink (even if a fresh cartridge is installed)...you're done.  Having extra ink cartridges on stand by is a must for Epson owners.You might be wondering if I am doing something wrong to have these ink issues. I always use genuine Epson cartridges when replacing inks. Per the instruction manual, I periodically clean the print head using the built in function for this. I also periodically use the ""clean Nozzle"" function per the manual to keep the printer maintained. I also apply firmware updates when prompted and use the latest driver set. My printer is kept in a dust-free area and is not crowded where it would overheat. I also use high quality paper.With all of that history stated, let's move on.  These days I am using an Epson XP-520 at home and it does use ink quickly but has not had a single issue.  I opt to use the high capacity cartridges with it which are genuine Epson parts.Amazon has now offered me the XP-830 in exchange for an honest review.Installation of the XP-830 was easy and took 45-50 minutes from unbox to print.  I followed the included quick start guide. The printer itself prompted me at each step on what to do after it was powered on. The printer found my WiFi router and more or less configured itself. All I had to do was enter my passkey. The driver worked well, connecting to the Internet to get its own updates.I would like to note this model also includes Ethernet for a wired connection.The XP-830 has a 5-ink technology.  The colors are Black, Cyan, Magenta, Yellow and Photo Black.  The Black is used for everyday text printing and the Proto Black is used when printing photos.  Step up to the XP-860 if you need six-color printing.The XP-830 processes large print jobs very quickly and prints at ISO 14 for black and ISO 11 in color.  One thing I like about the XP-830 is the automatic 2-sided printing which my XP-520 lacked.I don't normally use these but there is a card slot and USB port for printing directly without the need to go through a computer.  I usually like to process my photos and text prior to printing so these features don't get used as much.Let's discuss paper handling.  I use a lot of Avery labels to print things and this printer handles them all well.  There is a DVD tray for printing CD/DVD labels and a photo tray for standard photo paper sizes.  The trays are all adjustable and the printer accommodates many sizes, just not mega sized stuff like tabloid.I tried printing a borderless photo on premium paper and the result was very good, exceeding that of my XP-520.  The ink can smudge when wet so it has to dry a bit.  I find that a drop of water on a normal printed color document can cause inks to run as well.I already have an Epson Connect and Google Cloud Print account set up and I was able to add this printer to Epson Connect quite easily.Doing this allows me to print from my iPhone and Android device, an HP Slate and my Dell laptop via wireless.  I printed from all my devices with no issues.  I even printed some docs from my work PC to my home printer via cloud print.As I have stated before, inkjet output in terms of text documents just isn't as crisp looking as laser.Copying does feature a 30-page ADF with auto two-sided printing, copying, scanning, faxing.  This is a big deal for me as I really use the two-sided copy and fax feature a lot.  So you can basically fax or email up to 30 2-sided pages without having to fuss with turning over paper.The software accompanying the printer includes a scanner driver which works well to capture scanned content to a PC running Windows 10.I scanned both a text document and a photo and the results were excellent.  The scan to cloud or email feature is useful if you are sharing something with friends or family.The LCD is a larger than the XP-630; 4.3"" versus 2.7"". Navigation is better thought out on the XP-830 versus the XP-630.My experience with ink failures on earlier models seems to have been rectified on these later generation models.The XP-830 does a good job of keeping the user informed about remaining ink levels.  Do opt for the extended capacity cartridges when you go to replace these starter cartridges.With the addition of a duplexing ADF and fax plus slightly faster print speeds and a better LCD, I would definitely think that the XP-830 is a better value than the XP-630 if you are comparison shopping.  You won't be disappointed with this printer - it is feature packed and well designed.I would recommend this brand having worked with Epson products for several years.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ZRUHHUSSZDEM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010UU5XSS#wasThisHelpful","R1ZRUHHUSSZDEM","A1BK60GZ4QME6I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1BK60GZ4QME6I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The scan to cloud feature is useful if you are sharing something with friends or family.The LCD is a little larger than my XP-520.  I find this useful.

Do opt for the extended capacity cartridges when you go to replace these starter cartridges.One of the things that persists with Epson models is the annoying clunking sounds they make at random when idling.  Not sure why they do this - maybe they are keeping the inks primed or something.Overall I consider this a gradual evolution of the Expression Premium line of printers by Epson.Definite pros are ease of installation, good color prints and paper handling.Some cons are ink consumption and cost and occasional responsiveness issues.I would recommend this brand having worked with Epson products for several years.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1HNV20Q2DXDGE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010UU62T2#wasThisHelpful","R1HNV20Q2DXDGE","A1BK60GZ4QME6I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1BK60GZ4QME6I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have a lot of LED powered candles around the house during the holidays (and otherwise) and my family and I go through lots of AA batteries which have become ubiquitous in kid's toys and automatic scent dispensers, weather stations, etc.Being a 48-pack and offered as part of Vine in exchange for a review, I decided to give it a shot.First, and to get it out of the way, the recycling program requires you to enter into a points system.  I simply won't do that and I fully expect the spent batteries to end up in a landfill.  I'm just being honest.I see a US flag on the packaging but these are made in China.  I find that somewhat deceptive.I actually did do a drain down test on these compared to Energizer and Duracell, equivalent alkaline consumer grade batteries.These finished last with the copper top lasting longest.  It was not a scientific test but used the same exact item which was left in the on position while a countdown was conducted.  Even if no one else is convinced, I am.These don't have a mAh rating but I think they are probably better suited in low drain applications such as remotes, led candles, etc.  I put two in a pen flashlight and they worked pretty well.I like the price and the convenience of having a ton of them standing by in case of a need.I still prefer name brands to these.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R30RDTBM902ORS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IWP0C94#wasThisHelpful","R30RDTBM902ORS","A1BK60GZ4QME6I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1BK60GZ4QME6I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It seems like every day a new hair care product comes out featuring some new kind of botanical or oil.This one introduces babassu and marula oil, two I had not heard of prior to this review.Babassu oil comes from the seeds of the babassu palm.  Think S.America / Amazon area.It is used in similar contexts as coconut oil.Marula oil is extracted from the kernels of the Marula tree.  Think Africa / Madagascar.Together, these oils plus elastin protein restore dull hair and add luminosity.I think the fragrance smells typical of most Nexxus products - a very ""salon"" type of scent, if that makes sense.It is definitely an aggressive scent but I think it is pleasant.My wife smelled it and thought it smelled ""like conditioner"".As for results, we both tried it.  My hair is dry and hers tends to be dry / drizzy.  We both noticed an improvement in how our hair felt and reacted to styling after using this a couple of times.  Hair was also noticeably more healthy and shiny looking, sort of like Ojon or other high end brands.I have been a long time user of Nexxus products and this one is my favorite of the lineup.I would recommend it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3U5XNDORG1MS8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SI4UC1C#wasThisHelpful","R3U5XNDORG1MS8","A1BK60GZ4QME6I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1BK60GZ4QME6I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a set of bathroom essentials including a small rug, a shower curtain and shower hooks.Starting with the hooks, they are 12 button style hooks in a coordinating blue color.The rug is a foam rug, thick and plush but small in overall size.  It has a standard rubberized backing which tends to slough off when dried repeatedly.  It does hold its shape when on the floor and does not curl up on the sides.The curtain is a basic polyester curtain.  You'll need a vinyl liner, available almost anywhere.The best thing about this set is the coordinated colors.  It is not a set that is going to last a long time so consider this a part of a rotation of different themes for your bathroom.  We use ours in the upstairs (kids) bathroom.I would call this a very basic starter set, appropriate for a kid's bathroom where it will be changed out frequently or an apartment bathroom for those on a shoestring budget.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R14ZF2VX4G2ILY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QGVAHSM#wasThisHelpful","R14ZF2VX4G2ILY","A1BK60GZ4QME6I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1BK60GZ4QME6I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Touted as cookware designed to serve the unique needs of Mexican cooking, this 10 inch fry pan is part of the Rick Bayless line of celebrity chef cookinng products.I have a cast iron Bayless tortilla press (made by Gorham) and it is of pretty good quality.The question is what sets this particular fry pan apart from all the others on the market.  It's an aluminum pan and dishwasher safe.  It features a plastic handle to prevent handle burns.  Other than that, it is about standard gauge for weight.  I would not consider it for use in the oven.  It does have a standard nonstick surface.  It can be used on most cooktops though I did not try it on induction and can't comment on that.I tried this pan with several things.  I used it to fry some bacon and make scrambled eggs and to make some sauteed chicken breasts.  It performed as well as can be expected.But the question still lingers as to what truly sets this pan apart and why Bayless would include it in his Mexican cooking line.  Is there a signature recipe requiring this pan?  I will never know.I have noticed that someone likes to downvote all the negative comments on this product and would like to comment that you have to weigh both pros and cons when evaluating a product.  I read the downvoted reviews and see nothing particularly wrong with them.  Instead of downvoting I would suggest writing a comment to the review and letting the review author address those comments if something is ommitted, in error or otherwise.Overall I consider this a standard fry pan offering.

"This three piece baking set features 3 different sizes of baking sheet.One is a standard cookie sheet size.  One is smaller and fits perfectly inside my Breville toaster oven.  The other is a medium sized sheet, possibly useful if you only want to bake a half-recipe of cookies.The sheets are fairly thin and what I would call entry level for home bakers just starting out.You might want to consider thicker sheets for more frequent baking.I tried a batch of store-bought cookies on the larger sheet and (when used with parchment paper) they came out nicely browned and evenly baked.  The thinness may cause these too cook faster then an insulated sheet.Overall - this is a decent basic set of three different sizes for your baking needs.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1JMD12BROC6BW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XBC3T6Q#wasThisHelpful","R1JMD12BROC6BW","A1BK60GZ4QME6I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1BK60GZ4QME6I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book is a very gritty tale about Jack's mission to clean up after some pirates.The pirates steal sapphires and discover another item of interest during their heist.  Through greed and folly, they all end up dead.Enter Jack.  He is summoned by the enigmatic Angela and he ends up in Macau, tirelessly pursued by a typical superhuman antagonist, Laurence.Laurence is after a bunch of uncut sapphires and a giant block of supernotes that miraculously survived many impossible situations.Most of the time I felt like I was being held against my will in a classroom taught by a knowitall on the subject of crime.  The protagonist is one of those irritating sorts that never stops telling you everything he knows.  Half of the stuff the protagonist endlessly spewed felt contrived.Then there is Angela - Jack's mentor - another ghost who left him high and dry on some other job in another book that I will never read.  She basks in 5-star hotels with stupid names and spend money like it is going out of style.I wasn't sure if Jack was in love with Angela, saw her in a maternal sense or just thought she was a sage mentor.Regardless, the two are pursued by this heartless thug who is just that much better than the two of these experts and leads us to a showdown ending.I wasn't impressed by this book's author or the plot.I would not recommend this story.","2.0 out of 5 stars","September 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ZB567Z9PBAPI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385352646#wasThisHelpful","R1ZB567Z9PBAPI","A1BK60GZ4QME6I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1BK60GZ4QME6I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The LeapFrog Scout's Build and Discover Tool Set is a dog house that can be taken apart and rebuilt.I think this is a really novel idea to teach higher level concepts of construction, counting and color matching tools to the job.  You get five tools: a hammer, ruler, saw, screwdriver and wrench.This is not an erector set where you literally have to find pieces and fit them together using the appropriate tools to fasten them.The walls just fold down (and handle separates) and the youngster is encouraged to use puppy pal Scout to guide them through counting and measuring.Nothing is literally being hammered or screwed into place.  Yet in imaginative play, there is a feeling of accomplishment when the thing comes back together.One thing I am sort of surprised with (since this is a LeapFrog product) is a general lack of interactivity.We have other LeapFrog products that use various mechanisms to respond to being pressed in certain spots or under certain conditions.  I don't see those features with this item.  This one is obviously intended for a younger age range. I think this would be good for a 2,3 or 4 year old.Overall - this was well-received by my grandson.  He seemed kind of in awe with it and (since he is on the younger side of that range), was excited when guided through ""building"" the dog house.  I find the tools everywhere as he must be reasoning that if he can build a doghouse he can build other things.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R26G9QINGU0V5C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WJ1O6P8#wasThisHelpful","R26G9QINGU0V5C","A1BK60GZ4QME6I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1BK60GZ4QME6I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Avery White Round Candy Labels are definitely a speciality label.Every year, during the holidays, I like to bake confections for gifts to neighbors and loved-ones.This year I am going to use these to make custom little labels.What you get is a small pack of 120 labels.  The labels are intended for indirect food contact, not adhering directly to food items.As with all Avery label products, you can go to their website and enter the label ID (41568) to use a specialized template for printing.There are 20 labels per sheet and the sheets are small, requiring a laser or inkjet capable of handling different sized inputs.I use mine with an Epson XP-520 with no issues.Using these (from printing to affixing them) requires time and patience but the end result is worth it.I have received a lot of praise from recipients of items utilizing these labels.I would recommend them.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2JYFIVYWH6VQQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00W7VED76#wasThisHelpful","R2JYFIVYWH6VQQ","A1BK60GZ4QME6I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1BK60GZ4QME6I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I got this for my granddaughter since it is her birthstone.The necklace arrived in an attractive giftable box and was shipped inside a larger outside box.The stones in this necklace are blue topaz, 3mm.  I was surprised at the clarity of the gemstones.  There are six stones on my necklace.The necklace is very thin - rhodium plated sterling silver and it is 18"".My granddaughter was happy to get this and excited to wear it to school.It would be a good gift for religious ceremonies or just to celebrate your faith.Again, I am pleased with how bright and visible the stones are and how attractive the necklace appears when worn.I would definitely recommend this product.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R30PN1V0NEAIGH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TBBV7K6#wasThisHelpful","R30PN1V0NEAIGH","A1BK60GZ4QME6I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1BK60GZ4QME6I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This curtain rod is a wraparound design intended for blackout curtains.The rods provide complete coverage of  window opening, ensuring no side light entry.When installed, the rod protrudes 2"" from the wall.The rod length is adjustable from 66"" to 120"", offering coverage from standard to large window openings.  The rod itself is 5/8"" in diameter.If you need to sleep during the day or otherwise need a way to block out light, this is a great rod for those kind of curtains.Installation is easy and includes the needed hardware.  I had mine up in about 35 minutes.  Instructions are included.Overall - I am pleased with this curtain rod and am planning to order another one since I have two windows in the room where this one is installed.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Z6K3JVP89N3Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Y2KSGCS#wasThisHelpful","R1Z6K3JVP89N3Y","A1BK60GZ4QME6I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1BK60GZ4QME6I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The 14k Italian Tri Color Twist Hoop Earrings arrived in a very nice presentation box.They arrived inside an outer shipping box.The earrings are attractive yet subdued and not overly large.White gold bands are twisted in with yellow gold.To the observer it looks like yellow gold earrings with silver.I do not readily see that they are tri-color - mostly yellow gold with some white gold.Upon close inspection, you can see that one of the bands in the twist has a bit of rose gold coloration.I think these are attractive when worn yet don't come across as equivalent to their cost.I think they have a bit more of a fashion jewelry look than that of fine jewelry though they do look refined and sophisticated when worn.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3VDUTE9CBGMVX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JR5PGJO#wasThisHelpful","R3VDUTE9CBGMVX","A1BK60GZ4QME6I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1BK60GZ4QME6I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I didn't get this Five Star Locker Magnetic Dry-Erase Board + Locker Push Pin Board for a locker.  I opted to use mine in my cubicle at work.The top of the board is a white-board with magnetic marker.  The bottom portion is perforated to serve as a push-pin board.The magnet (on the board) is strong and will resist locker usage if that's what this will be used for.The size of the board is 6"" x 8"", so it is not a huge board.  The marker and some push pins are included.My marker has a very weak magnet and will not stay on the board.  The board came with four magnets which were stuck on so hard that they left behind damage marks on the board surface when removed.I think that in a tight environment such as a locker, cubicle wall, fridge door, etc. it is functional.I use it to leave myself notes.I am disappointed with the white board portion.  The provided marker writes clearly but it is removing the marks that is an issue.  The eraser on the marker leaves a black residue behind and is generally difficult to erase.  You could use water but would that really be convenient in a school setting such as a locker area?Overall I think this is a useful concept and fair implementation.  This would surely be useful in an organized locker but might make more sense on a fridge.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3NSJQ533A8FFA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00X7NQJY8#wasThisHelpful","R3NSJQ533A8FFA","A1BK60GZ4QME6I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1BK60GZ4QME6I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This review is for the Avery Easy Align Self-Laminating ID Labels.  They are 7.5"" x 5"" and the package contains 5.The laminated labels are UV resistant (prevents fading), water resistant and feature a permanent adhesive.The labels are easy to print. Simply go to the Avery website and enter the product ID: 00750.You then design your own label and prepare to print.Before printing, (with any label product, really) be sure to print a plain paper test page before doing the final print.After printing, you have to fold the plastic over the label to ""self-laminate"" it.This can be tricky but I was able to do it without much hassle.It's not as hard as putting on a screen protector on your cell phone.In terms of cost, you are getting five long-lasting labels which are laminated, so I think the cost is justified, provided you don't mess one or more labels up while printing which is possible.I printed mine on an Epson inkjet and the result looks really professional.In summary, these have a variety of uses.  I printed one sign about authorized personnel and keeping the door closed to the lab where I work.  I printed another which reminds those exiting to make sure the door closes behind them to prevent the security monitoring from detecting an open door.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3V6I0AL6JDZLN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XOJ9S70#wasThisHelpful","R3V6I0AL6JDZLN","A1BK60GZ4QME6I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1BK60GZ4QME6I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This review is for the Avery Kraft Brown Labels, 1.5"" x 1.5"" square.  The pack comes with 60 labels.Brown Kraft labels provide a natural or earthy look and they are made from 100% recycled material.These labels are compatible with both inkjet and laser printers.  I use mine with an inkjet.Templates are available at avery.com/print (you might need to create a free account there).I always use the Avery stock templates versus trying to make my own designs.You can print 6 labels per page and the page size is smaller, 4"" x 6"" which for me required some tinkering with the inkjet paper guides.The rustic look makes these labels perfect in a variety of settings.I use the 2"" round for giving away / selling baked goods like bread, cakes or cookies.I do the same with these.I am very happy Avery has so much variety available for labels.

"Rick Bayless, celebrity chef and cookbook author renown for his Mexican cuisine has partnered with Gorham to produce his signature cast iron tortilla press.This press is a 12"" model which has been pre-seasoned.it is dishwasher safe but I always prefer to hand-wash cast iron.A cast iron press has an advantage over an aluminum model - it stays put when pressing because of its weight and offers additional leverage.Tortilla presses are generally used to make corn tortillas.  Flour tortillas can be rolled with a rolling pin.The concept is simple -- put a ball of masa in the center of the press and...press.  The pressure flattens the dough into a tortilla.Oddly, this press did not come with a recipe.  I would have expected one from a cookbook author.  However, I was able to easily find one on his website.Using one of Mr. Bayless' recipes, I made some tortillas using the press.The press is easy to use and flattens the masa into a perfectly round tortilla of appropriate thickness.I used parchment on both the top and bottom plate which makes release easier.  You could also use plastic.I cooked the tortillas on a dry cast iron griddle on medium to medium-high heat.The resulting tortillas have a fresh taste which is much better than the supermarket variety.  You can also try blue corn tortillas for added variety.If you really like tortillas and prefer to make them at home, this is the press for you.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RRRCQA1R3FDLB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NAAR2NK#wasThisHelpful","RRRCQA1R3FDLB","A1BK60GZ4QME6I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1BK60GZ4QME6I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"With back-to-school season in full swing, it's a good time to add some pizazz to a locker.This board  measures 4.5"" x 4.5"" and 7/8 inch thick (which is pretty thick).The side of the board has LED lights and requires three AAA batteries.One of the biggest downsides I saw right away is that it takes the removal of 4 screws to change/add the batteries.That means you would need to take it home to replace the batteries once they go out.We determined right away that this would be of less use in a locker than in a bedroom or bedroom closet.The magnetic design makes it ideal for a fridge or metal door too.In the end it ended up in my office which is a cubicle environment.  I put it on the cube wall and use it for short reminders to myself.The concept is great though - this could be useful in a locker.  However, the LEDs are not diffused light - they are spots  that are sort of backlit.  I operate it without the LEDs as they don't add much to the product.  Any kid is going to turn on the LED and forget to turn it off, leading to a drained set of batteries.The whiteboard component seems to clean easily for now.  When using the provided marker, it leaves dark residue behind when erasing.  You can use water or a white board cleaner to remove the marker.Overall - this is a useful board but the battery / LED part is a downside.  I think it is useful for more than just lockers.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RC0L8N0O4TNVW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00X7NQQZA#wasThisHelpful","RC0L8N0O4TNVW","A1BK60GZ4QME6I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1BK60GZ4QME6I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This 15.5 ounce container of Campbell’s Slow Kettle Style Sweet Tomato Bisque (Tomato & Sweet Basil Mix)is scrumptious and cooks pretty quickly. Additionally, this soup has the right amount of sweetness with a robust tomato flavor. I’m grateful that the place of my overnight job carries this because nights like tonight I do not feel like cooking and would much prefer having something that can be ready in less than 10 minutes when having more time to myself to relax before leaving for work. This Campbell’s Slow Kettle Style Sweet Tomato Bisque fits the bill because it is ready around 2 minutes via a microwave.  I’m guessing that this Campbell’s Slow Kettle Style Sweet Tomato Bisque can be a standalone meal with pairing it with just bread and better. However, for me I admit to having this soup with Bar S Classic Corn Dogs dipped in honey batter (which my husband was able to have some corndogs ready for me within just 3 minutes) which paired perfectly with this  Campbell’s Slow Kettle Style Sweet Tomato Bisque (Tomato & Sweet Basil mix)tomato soup.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R5UYSQOWVMARY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MGK1IJ4#wasThisHelpful","R5UYSQOWVMARY","A2H3JURQZOHVMB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2H3JURQZOHVMB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These patches are really terrible. If you remove the backing from it all at once the patch folds over and sticks to itself. It's extremely difficult to pull it apart.Do not put this on the delicate skin of your torso. It's way too hot and difficult to pull off. I couldn't take more than 10 minutes and when I pulled the patch off my body was red and burned for at least an hour afterwards. The patch will not stick again, so if you don't use it on one part of your body, forget about using it somewhere else.Don't put any lotions or creams on your body first. Even if you wait a while before applying, the patch will not stick.When I pulled it off, it stuck to my skin and I was afraid it would actually rip my skin.There's nothing that I like about these patches. Unfortunately, I purchased 10 of them. The medication is too strong and the adhesive is like glue.I prefer the Tiger Balm patches over these because the patches are comfortable, can be reapplied and come off very easily. Plus, they don't burn.

"In the box is a small credit card size card with a web address and ID number.  You downloaded this from the website.After downloading it onto my tablet I was sent an email with a download button to download it to my phone and computer. They really make it simple. All you need to do is register and enter your user name and password to download to your other devices. It does not say how many devices you can put this on. You'll download their app to your devices to run the security and protection.As far as total protection goes, I already have most of the protection from Samsung for my tablet and smart phone, such as locking the devices and using either a PIN or finger print to open, and the ability to lock or swipe your information in case of theft or loss. What I was hoping this would do for me is to stop those stupid pop-ups I get on my tablet. My internet security protection stops pop-ups on my computer, but this does not stop them on my tablet. I still get the same pop-ups I got before installing this.If you somehow have a tablet or smartphone that does not come with protection features, then this will give you what you lack.  It also allows you to backup your information, but I also get that from Samsung, so it isn't necessary to backup with McAfee too.What annoys me is that the app has number flags that show up to indicate that you haven't accepted all of their security protection offered. But, I don't need all of it. So, I wish there was a way to decline something so their flags would go away.I may not keep this on my tablet or phone, but I haven't decided yet.

"I have the audible version of this and have listened to it twice now. Caroline Myss doesn't pander to the idea that people need a lot of hand holding and babying. She says what I've always thought and that is people need to move on from their past and just stop allowing it to affect their future. No-one ever got healthy by constantly moaning about what happened to them as a child. I have issues from childhood, but I know I'm in control of my life now, not my mother. Nothing in my life will change unless I'm willing to work on it and make those changes myself. My mother is dead. Why should I spend my life whining about what a horrible mother she was? Where will that get me? These are some of my takeaways from Caroline's message.At first I wasn't sure I liked this audible book and not because I think she's harsh, because really she isn't, but because I thought it would delve more into how to heal yourself. What this audible book is all about is what the Chakras are, how they affect our body and our relationships with others. If you're looking for more information on Chakras than you've gotten in other books, then this is going to be right up your alley. By the time I finished listening the first time around I realized that although it isn't what I thought it was, it was exactly what I needed. I'm sold on Caroline Myss. I've purchased another audio book of hers because I like the way she delivers her message. She's a strong woman who pulls no punches. Don't get the audio version if you think she's all woo woo sweet and mystical. That's not who she is. That's not who she needs to be because her message is a good one and she teaches it well.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1I4P4P9QUA5U9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00005497P#wasThisHelpful","R1I4P4P9QUA5U9","A2FRAS05LEI6JJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FRAS05LEI6JJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

It's not about Nora, it's about women.Women have become too complacent and need to know what things were like before they came into rights of their own. This is extremely timely.

"These earbuds are oddly shaped. The buds are on a long stem that sticks out from your ears, and the stem is angled. I'm not really sure why they are shaped this way, but they feel weird and keep falling out of my ears. They do come with over the ear hooks, but those don't fit well and bug me.There's a plastic piece in the back that you wind the wire around so you can let out what you need. That's pretty handy, although because of the way the earbuds are shaped having the wire go behind the head causes the buds to pull out of the ears whenever I turn my head. Keeping it in front is easier, but then if you exercise with these you'll have that piece bouncing against your throat.The earbuds come in a plastic drinking bottle. As in actually inside of one. It was sort of difficult pulling them out as they're encased in plastic that is a rather tight fit in the bottle.The sound is ok, but not the best quality from earbuds. You would get these earbuds more for the style than the sound. So, you can exercise without them falling out.

"True to its name, this book starts out fast, and never lets up. I was captivated by the first sentence and found it hard to put down. But, things like sleep and work got in the way.Jenna Cooper is caught up in a tornado while at a swap meet with her young daughter and 5 month old son, Caleb. Jenna and her daughter survive, but Caleb disappears. Everyone is looking for this baby. From Kate, the reporter who wants to write a job winning article, to the Russian mob, to a wealthy heiress in Denver, people want this baby. At the center of the baby’s disappearance is a couple of low-life drug addicts, who keep everyone on the chase to find Caleb. It may sound convoluted, but it works and made me want to find out what was going to happen next.This is the first novel by Rick Mofina I’ve read, but now he’s on my favorite author list. He managed to write a strong female protagonist in Kate, without making her helpless and dependent on men as many male authors do. I appreciated the fact that Kate could hold her own career-wise and still be grounded in family.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1T8ZYJ5VLXN8A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0778316092#wasThisHelpful","R1T8ZYJ5VLXN8A","A2FRAS05LEI6JJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FRAS05LEI6JJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a simple little speaker that you need to wear close to your ear in order to hear. Turn the volume up on your device before controlling it with the speaker because you won’t be able to turn it up on the speaker unless it’s up all the way on your device first.There’s a thin piece of metal in the opening of the speaker that grasps onto your clothing and holds the speaker in place. It’s a tight fight, so tight that I had a lot of trouble removing it from my top. No matter how I tugged or pulled, it just wouldn’t come lose. I eventually pulled hard enough that the metal clip came out. I used a file from my pocket knife to put it back in place. It is probably best clipped to something hard like a cap, rather than cloth.It also comes with a fastener that you use to fasten it to a car visor. It’s easy to put on and take off of the speaker.The sound is really good. I was surprised that I was able to hear stereo sound coming from such a small speaker, but I watched a movie using it and could pick up the background sound effects. This will come in handy when I don’t want to wear ear phones, but still want to keep the sound to myself, or listen to music on my smart phone in the car.It operates with just one button to turn it on or off, or switch to pick up a call. I haven’t used it to make or take phone calls, and I think it might be a bit confusing just how many times to click the button to get your call or reject it, so you should keep the instructions handy for the first few calls.I give the speaker a solid four stars, taking off one star because of the metal clip that would render it useless if it came out and was lost or damaged. You won’t be able to clip it to anything without that piece of thin metal.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2FEZSJ2KI4992/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WBS31GY#wasThisHelpful","R2FEZSJ2KI4992","A2FRAS05LEI6JJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FRAS05LEI6JJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"To use this you must have a smartphone or tablet with bluetooth. The thermometer does not have a read out on it.After downloading the app to your electronic device, pair the thermometer with it via bluetooth. The directions that come with it leave something out and it was a bit complicated trying to figure it out. I've paired many things with my devices and never had an issue. After I stopped following the directions and just followed my phone, it was easy.You can set up profiles for everyone in your family, even adding pictures. Then select the person you are taking the temperature of, select how you'll do it, oral, under the arm, anal, then take the temperature. The temperature will almost immediately come up on your phone. It really was fast.How accurate is it? Well, I wasn't sick when I tested it out and my temperature came out to be 98.1. Since I usually run between 97.8 to 98.3, I think it was fairly accurate.It doesn't come with thermometer sleeves, so I suggest you invest in some inexpensive ones, especially if you're going to be using this on more than one person.I can only give this four stars because the thermometer doesn't give a reading directly on it. So, if someone is sick, you need to grab your phone along with thermometer to take the temperature.

It's very easy to bend.

"I've never had equipment to work out my lower arms and hands before, but that's exactly what this does.  It's a solid rubber bar that bends when you use it.

However, the captions on a couple of them are wrong.

"This is the first book I've read in a long time where I wanted to immediately read the next in the series. It has everything, plot, action, smart, strong, take no prisoners women. It's good. I'm drawn to books with strong female leads, and this has two. The books are narrated by the husband, but he takes back seat to his wife and daughter, he doesn't over shadow them. While there's violence, there's not too much of it. And, the author tends toward non-violence in some instances when he could very well have gone the other way.Well thought out and told.

"These gloves are really big. Since I have large hands, I got the X-large because there are no size guidelines online. Well, there are no size guidelines on the box either. I can only say that the X-large will probably be for men with really big hands. The fingers were about 1.5"" too long. And the gloves were so large they were wrinkly on my hand. But, that's not the glove's fault. It would be nice if they gave guidelines so we'd know which size to get. But, just based on how the X-Large fit me, I would probably be a medium. So, expect them to run big.The gloves are thick blue gloves that snap like a balloon. But, unlike the latex on a balloon, they don't make me break out in a rash. I used them to apply ointment to my joints for arthritis. That way, I don't have to worry about getting the ointment on my hands and not being able to wash it off well enough.I also use disposable gloves for art work. These will be great for painting, staining and charcoal.

"This blood pressure monitor is typical of those made for the wrist in that they tend to read low. What sets this wrist blood pressure monitor apart is that you can download an app onto your smart phone and transfer your blood pressure readings to the app. The app shows you a grid of your blood pressure readings against what normal readings are. The monitor also tells you if your heart is beating abnormally. For instance if it beats twice fast then one normal beat.You must first set the date and time on the monitor before taking readings otherwise the app will not download any of the readings as it stores them by date and time.

"You need less of this than some other shampoos because it really lathers up. It's a silky shampoo that feels soft while washing your hair. I'm often skeptical of claims made by beauty products, but believe it or not, this actually lives up to its claim to add youthful body and shine. I have thick, dry hair that's seen earlier days. After washing I usually add a de-frizing gel before or after drying, which gives my hair some shine. I left out the gel after using this shampoo and my hair had a nice shine to it. It also lifts the hair, adding volume, which I don't necessarily need, but if you do, then I'm telling you it works.The best part for me is that there is no scent to it.

It's much thicker than milk. It has the consistency of a watered down yogurt. Instead of being sweet, which is the expected taste of strawberry milk, it's tart.

"I’ve been intrigued with westward travel by the covered wagon since I learned about the Donnor Party in grade school. In the 1960s and 1970s, America was obsessed with the wild west as there were western TV shows on all the channels. However, I never really learned much about the pioneers and their travels across the planes to the Northwest coast. This book is about a personal goal to drive the first covered wagon across the Oregon Trial in more than a century, amidst a history lesson about the first pioneers.The author, Rinker Buck, takes the reader along on his covered wagon expedition on the Oregon Trail with his brother, Nick, in 2011. The two couldn’t be more different and this leads to some of the funniest passages in the book. Interspersed between the chapters of their odyssey, we learn all about what the early pioneers went through on their travels in the 1840s and 1850s. There’s a chapter on the mule, one on the cover wagon, and even a chapter on the first woman to travel the trail. We learn about the piles of waste left by travelers, storms, and deaths along the route. We also learn about the businesses that popped up just to service the thousands of people making the trip. But, mostly what we learn by reading this entertaining account of the Buck brother’s trip is how much affection Americans still have for the trail, the original pioneers and the present day travelers. It’s quite touching how ranchers all along the trail offered shelter, food, showers and knowledge to help the Bucks and their family of mules complete their mission.Honestly, I can’t recommend this book enough. I was sorry when it ended. There’s so much research that went into this novel, but it’s not dry and school-bookish. Rinker’s self-effacing humor had me laughing in bed late at night. I have a renewed appreciation for what thousands of people went through to get to the west coast.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3HAIIIABDWKU2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1451659164#wasThisHelpful","R3HAIIIABDWKU2","A2FRAS05LEI6JJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FRAS05LEI6JJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have the Sennhaiser RS 170 so I’m pretty much going to compare them to the new RS 185 version. Well, not really, because they just don’t compare. The RS 185 is a classic example of getting what you pay for. At the current cost of $400 bucks, they may seem pricey, but they are totally worth that price.The clarity of sound knocked me off my feet. I connected them to my HDTV using the analog RCA plugs,  instead of the optical plug because my HDTV doesn’t have an optical outlet. The news was on when I first turned on the headset and all I can say is “Wow!” You talk about clear, resonate sound. And, listening to music is even better. I’m no expert, but when I compare the RS 185 to the RS 170, the quality of sound is so far greater that it’s hard to believe they were made by the same company.The headphone is very easy to set-up and comes with an electrical plug that includes attachments for various countries. Plus, there is an optical plug and an analog RCA plug for whichever you can use with your equipment. You can also plug these into a sound system, so TV is not the only way to use them. It comes with a quick start guide and a manual on CD, but I preferred to look manuals up on-line using my tablet, so I haven’t used the CD. The directions on the quick start guide are all you need to get yourself up and running. You won’t need to purchase anything additional – everything is included. In fact, you’ll end up with spare parts.The ear pieces are a bit larger than the RS 170, which helps to keep your ears from being squashed into your head. Also, they are covered with fabric. When I purchased the RS 170, I did so because they came with vinyl ear covers. I wanted something easy to clean. However, they make my head sweat so much I was taking them off during the commercials just to air out. They are also very tight. The RS 185 headset is so much more comfortable that I can keep them on for hours.The best update on the RS 185 are the volume buttons. They are large buttons with engraved symbols for – or + that you can feel with your fingers. The buttons are in a circle along with separate buttons for the left and right ear and one to reset the volume at an equal level between the two. It’s so easy to turn it up or down while wearing them. I had to take the RS 170 off just to adjust the volume.Each earpiece holds one AAA rechargeable battery, included. Just twist the inside of the earpiece off and drop in the battery. When you are done wearing them, place them on top of the transmitter to recharge.Another nice change from the earlier model is that you do not have to turn the transmitter on to use the headset. There’s a button on the headset to turn it off or on. Hold for 2 seconds until the light goes on or off and you’re set. This is nice because I used to get all settled in my chair before I realized I forgot to push the button on the transmitter then I would have to get up again. It seems like they listened to their customers and made some nice revisions to this model.If you’re trying to decide whether to spend the money on this more expensive model, ask yourself if you like great sound. If so, they are worth it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3F8PQDNX7F1TX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TOT9G1W#wasThisHelpful","R3F8PQDNX7F1TX","A2FRAS05LEI6JJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FRAS05LEI6JJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It’s not over refers to how the LGBT civil rights movement still has a long road ahead despite recent laws making it illegal to ban same-sex marriage in most states. Although many people are slowing changing their minds in a positive way toward LGBT people, and agree to live and let live, there are many who are just as stubbornly homophobic.The book goes into depth regarding national incidents of homophobia which have taken place in the past few years. It outlines that in many states there are no laws that make it illegal to discriminate against people because of their sexual orientation. It also discusses how right-wing politicians are trying to implement new laws to discriminate against the LGBT community.None of this should come as news to anyone who knows the history of America. Although the black civil rights movement managed to make segregation illegal, blacks still suffer discrimination because they’re black, especially in specific parts of the country.  Although women made some major inroads in the 1960s and 1970s with birth control and the right to abortion, they are still discriminated where salaries are concerned. Today, those same right-wing Christian Republicans, who are trying to continue to ban acceptance of LGBT people, are also trying to make it illegal for women to get birth control and abortions. Regardless of who you are, it’s never a good time to let down your guard.There has been a positive shift in the nation’s attitude toward acceptance of the LGBT community; however, there's still work to be done. Change takes time. Don't assume it’s over because it may never be.This book would be a great book to use while writing your college papers. I wish I had this available about 10 years ago. It's hard to find books chock full of factional information about current events in law and national attitude towards the LGBT community.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ZZ5XTR325UEC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0544381009#wasThisHelpful","R1ZZ5XTR325UEC","A2FRAS05LEI6JJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FRAS05LEI6JJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

However, I just couldn't get used to the taste of this Tom's of Maine peppermint paste.The peppermint is very slight. Too slight because I mostly tasted plain paste.

"This fictional story is the first person account of rape and its aftermath. I'm not spoiling by saying a rape happens because it happens early on and is the basis for the rest of the novel. Initially, I was turned off by it and thought I'd struggle getting through the book. However, that was not the case. I found the story engrossing and had trouble putting it down.Bailey Carpenter is a private eye. Thanks to her deceased father, she's also extremely well off financially, which is important because it gives her the opportunity to hide away and not work after her attack. A subplot is that her father, who was married twice before her mother and had 5 children in those marriages, left his fortune to Bailey and her brother. So, they're being sued by their half-siblings for a piece of their father's estate. I's only after her attack that one of Bailey's half-sisters becomes her caregiver and confidant.Nothing is as it appears as Bailey seems to see her attacker in every man she comes in contact with. She becomes obsessed with a man whose apartment she can see directly across from hers. She spies on him with her binoculars and is sure that he was the one who raped her. She calls the cops every time she believes that each man definitely had something to do with her rape. Not only does she offend all the men she comes in contact with, but the cops are beginning to dismiss her accusations as she becomes even more unstable.Due to her extreme wealth, it was too easy for Bailey to cocoon herself after the rape. I kept wondering how this story would have played out if she was of moderate means and had to get up and get dressed and go to work each day. The outcome of the subplot was no surprise.

"This is a very pretty costume set for teenagers. I would hesitate to give it to a tween because the necklace chain is delicate and might break if one isn't careful. The chain isn't very long, which is why I suggest it for teens and not adults. That, and the fact that it's obviously costume.The ring is a size 7, which will significantly reduce the number of girls you'll be able to wear it. Size 7 would probably be too large for most girls who have not finished growing. And, some girls have very slender fingers, too small for this size; others have fingers that are larger than size 7 The fact that you can only get this set with one size ring reduces my star rating.The earring posts have clear backs. They are my favorite of the entire set and will probably get the most use.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1R478XK44Z2A9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SH3ZVY2#wasThisHelpful","R1R478XK44Z2A9","A2FRAS05LEI6JJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FRAS05LEI6JJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I really love these novellas that bring us back to my favorite pair, Dragos and Pia. They always seem to get themselves in such a mess, and this time around is no exception. They really ""stepped"" in it this time, and I was thoroughly entertained watching their latest fiasco unravel. There's so much going on in this novella despite it's short length, and I found myself wishing for just a bit more by the end. Everything continued at a frenetic pace to the point where I wanted this to be a full length book and slow down to expand on things. Who am I kidding though... I'd find any reason to ask for a full length featuring Dragos and Pia. There's just something electric about the pair that keeps me wanting more. And I'm thankful for any tastes we get to see of the pair. So all in all, I highly recommend PIA DOES HOLLYWOOD to fans of the series. There's some pretty interesting and important reveals as well as a great deal of fun that you won't want to miss!","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R12FES0XEYBOBC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0990666174#wasThisHelpful","R12FES0XEYBOBC","A1826E02TONM9I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1826E02TONM9I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Wow, just wow. This book is one heck of a ride.TEN THOUSAND SKIES ABOVE YOU digs further into dimensional travel and all the complications and risks. There's so many ethical issues and risks they are taking, and this book really explores further into the implications of all that. I really enjoyed this deeper look and it kept me on the edge of my seat from the start until the very end. Not only are there big risks, but there's also emotional and personal aspects that get explore. The big question is whether we really all the same person a the core across the dimensions, or do our experiences shape us instead, making each version of us truly different? The ramifications of this question are really profound in this book, and it made for an incredible read.I have to admit prior to starting I was just a bit hesitant. I wasn't quite sure what I was going to get as trilogies are tricky things. It seems you almost always either have the sophomoric slump in the second book or if the book manages to escape that normal trend then there's a doozy of a cliffhanger. And that latter is the case here. There's not even a hint of a slump here, as TEN THOUSAND SKIES ABOVE YOU is every bit as good as its predecessor, but the cliffhanger ending is insane. Not only are there massive game changing revelations in this book that would have made me desperate to get my hands on the next one, but the very ending events are nearly cruel when it comes to cliffhanger terms. I kept trying to get to the next page as I just couldn't believe it ended there. I'll be counting down the days until the next book releases.TEN THOUSAND SKIES ABOVE YOU isn't just a must read, it's a drop everything you're doing, and run to the nearest bookstore to get your hands on it immediately read.

"I feel utterly torn about REAP THE WIND. On one hand I was utterly and completely hooked into the story. It was intense and the characters really shined. You could really feel the stakes involved. It's quite a long book, but I read it in one setting into the wee hours of the morning. All good things right? You might be asking what's the problem. I have one word for you... Cliffhanger. Another cliffhanger, after the past several books having killer cliffhangers, I had expected a resolution at least on that matter. But no, the past three books have left a certain character's fate in the balance, and unfortunately this one does as well. I had a strong urge to throw my kindle across the room when I realized this. As much as I love this series, the frustration factor is starting to weigh on me. It's just amazing how in such a long book, so much could happen, but in the end nothing that happened really matters as the main issue is still massively looming. I feel like I've been teased one too many times. Will I read the next book, absolutely, but if there's yet another cliffhanger on this same issue it might just be a towel throwing offense.Getting back to the good. Cassie really shines in REAP THE WIND. She's tested over and over, but this time around her reactions are a little bit more thought out rather than so reactive. Sure she's still in constant jams but less are due to her own scrambled reactions. She's maturing and learning more about her role and becoming more confident, and I cheered her every step of the way. Now if everyone else could just start respecting her... Speaking of respect, the whole Mircea thing is still a funny situation. The romance there leaves me scratching my head more often than not. I hope there's some sort of resolution planned there as well in the near future as again, it's been dragged out for a very long time it seems.Despite my frustrations due the overall arc of the series and lack of real momentum, Reap the Wind is a very good book in its own right. Take out the series issues and it's darn right fantastic, so with that caveat in mind, REAP THE WIND is an enjoyable and engrossing read.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2NF11KU7JB9EZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JGI91YS#wasThisHelpful","R2NF11KU7JB9EZ","A1826E02TONM9I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1826E02TONM9I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It amazes me how fresh and interesting each of these books are considering how long this series has been running. Typically by this point, the twelfth book, I almost expect a bit of staleness, and yet with each new book, Eileen Wilks brings a whole new challenge and ball game. It's incredibly impressive and one of the reasons I really enjoy this series. Between knowing I'll get a fantastic plot and all the many previous books allowing for such rich and lengthy amount of character growth, and I don't even need to read the description. I'll read the next book sight unseen.This time around the plot centers around Lily and Rule again, my favorite pair so I knew I was in for a treat. And the book delivered. Between all the crazy politics, Dragon happenings, a new and troublesome ability for Lily, seriously tricky situations for Rule, and a very interesting new character, MIND MAGIC had me hooked from the start. It's a lengthy book but I read it almost straight through into the wee hours of the morning just to find out what happened next. I know I'll be counting down the days until the next installment releases.Seamlessly weaving fast paced action and strong characters in a fantastic blend of entertainment, MIND MAGIC is not to be missed.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2EKEAQL7M0M3L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SI02AR0#wasThisHelpful","R2EKEAQL7M0M3L","A1826E02TONM9I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1826E02TONM9I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm a huge fan of the Half-Moon hollows series. There's just something so comforting about them. In fact this series is one of my favorites to listen to on audio for rereads. And with each new book, I always know I'll get a solid block of entertainment and hilarity that will have me laughing out loud. Fangs for the Memories is no exception. This one is a bit different from the rest of the series as it goes back a bit in time to the beginning of Dick and Andrea's relationship. I've always wanted to see more about how this rough, roguish, and slightly sheevy vampire could win over the polished Andrea's heart. Of course knowing everything we do now so much further in the series, Dick's no where as bad as he seemed. But this story takes place before all that and I really enjoyed the further insight. It only made me love Andrea and Dick even more. So, all in all this is a fun little treat for fans of the series that's not too be missed.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RXI2C12GUYM4E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UDCI656#wasThisHelpful","RXI2C12GUYM4E","A1826E02TONM9I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1826E02TONM9I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I really enjoy Lila's character. She's grown and accomplished so much already and we're only the 2nd book in. It makes me even more eager to see what she can become in future books. She's no longer the skittish thief we met in the first book, but a loyal and dare I say trusting member of the family. Previously I felt like she had one foot out the door at all times but in DARK HEART OF MAGIC she seems much more settled. And considering everything that happens in this book and what's brewing next, this settled-ness happened just in time.I really enjoy the mix of urban fantasy and mobster families in this series. And the rivalry and machinations between the families seemed to only get thicker if that's possible. It's one of those situations where you just immerse yourself and watch the sparks fly. And boy did they fly in this book! I figured out the mystery pretty early on, but that didn't detract from my enjoyment at all. It was fun to see each new revelation make me think more and more I was correct in my guess at the culprit. And then the final showdown, whew! What a doozy.If you're looking for a fun and action packed read with great characters, an interesting world, and plenty of machinations, look no further than DARK HEART OF MAGIC. It's guaranteed to please.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1F0KIDTJPHBSB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TE7O9AC#wasThisHelpful","R1F0KIDTJPHBSB","A1826E02TONM9I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1826E02TONM9I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"While the premise and the characters of AUTUMN THORNS intrigued me, the immense world building kept me from enjoying this book as much as I would like. I'm all for a complex and unique world, but in this case I felt things were a bit too on the ""craft"" side. I'm a big fan of the author, and follow her various networks, so I know that she is very immersed in the magical world, and beliefs, and that knowledge showed in this book. Unfortunately it showed so much that it made it incredibly hard to keep up for lamens like myself. There were so many different magical aspects, deities, and ritualistic methods portrayed in this book that my head was spinning. That being said, as I started to get a grasp on the rules of the world by the end, I do have high hopes for the rest of the series.World building woes aside, I greatly enjoyed the characters in AUTUMN THORNS. Kerris is a no non-sense, kick butt heroine that you couldn't help loving from the start. She's thrust back into a town and duty she never wanted to return to, and yet she accepts it all with grace. Even better yet, when other powers that be, be they good or evil, attempt to bully her, she stands firm despite having no real idea what's she's doing. I really admired her for that. Add in a yummy hero who may have sparked a bit more of instalove than my tastes prefer at times, but seems to be everything Kerris needs, and I was sold.All in all while the world building bogged the book down a bit for me, I see a great amount of potential for this series, and I'm eager to see where things lead. If you're a fan of urban fantasy with a spicy romance, then this one is definitely worth a look or two.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R58NY91I87MTA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SI02BHO#wasThisHelpful","R58NY91I87MTA","A1826E02TONM9I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1826E02TONM9I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I really enjoyed the previous installment, but ICE LIKE FIRE just didn't have the same spark for me. I just didn't feel like the book was moving anywhere to be honest and considering it's a 500 page book that didn't work so well for me. There was just a bit too much meandering rather than anything real happening. After the big build up and everything that happened previously I was expecting a bit more action this time around as well. Unfortunately while there was a quest, it was unrealistically easy, and the rest of the focus was more internal with both Meira, Mather, and even Theron's ruminations that were more wallowing than anything it seemed. Between that and all of the politics I found myself skimming at times as it just wasn't holding my attention. It really is a shame because there's so much potential here.I will say however that the ending events are what brought some excitement and action back into the book, and what made me decide to bump my rating up to a three instead of two. It's almost frenetic and a serious game changer yet again. I only wish it had of been spread out a bit more, and not left things so abruptly.In the end I can only hope that ICE LIKE FIRE suffered from a middle book syndrome and that the finale will return to the splendor of the first installment.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1T6PYMNUP6WVY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062286951#wasThisHelpful","R1T6PYMNUP6WVY","A1826E02TONM9I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1826E02TONM9I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm a huge fan of the Elder Races series, and I have to admit while I love all the characters, Dragos, Pia, and Liam are by far my favorites. So these small outtake novellas are the perfect ""fix"" for me. I'm also always impressed at how much emotion and actual events Thea always manages to pack in these considering how short they are and this novella was no exception. It kept me hooked from the very first page, and even brought a tear felt moment by the end.

"What a completely unique and very interesting read! I have to admit I wasn't quite sure what I was going to get when I read the blurb as it sounded nothing like what the author had done before, or really my normal genre reading preferences. But I'm so glad I took the chance as once I started reading MENAGERIE, I simply couldn't put it down. It was dark and gritty and oh so horrifying. I'm having a hard time putting my thoughts about this book into words, rather than just feelings like horror, outrage, etc,  but imaginative would probably be the best description. This book made me feel so much it truly was impressive, from the creepy, to the terrible, to the heart-warming AND heart-breaking moments, I was an utter wreck by the time I finished.That being said, as much as I enjoyed MENAGERIE, there were a few things that kept me from giving it a full five stars. At times the violence was too much. It's not that I mind violence in books, quite the contrary, but I do prefer a bit more positive or hope to balance things out. Aside from Delilah's stellar strength, for most of the book I didn't feel any hope or goodness, and it was just a bit oppressive. I also wish the ending and the interesting side of a certain character that I won't mention to avoid spoilers, would have been developed a bit more. Both the ending and that character's ""story"" and the repercussions felt incredibly rushed, and I just wish those parts had been expanded more.All in all, this book is a must read for any Urban Fantasy, Fantasy, Thriller, and/or Suspense lover. From the moment you start this book you'll be on the edge of your seat biting your nails in anticipation for what's going to happen next.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R23AABVHBD1NVJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=077831605X#wasThisHelpful","R23AABVHBD1NVJ","A1826E02TONM9I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1826E02TONM9I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Oh my goodness did I love this book. I have to admit that I've been anticipating Ashwini and Janvier's story for a long time now, ever since reading their short story, and then all of the little hints and by plays in the rest of the series. The tension between the two was so palatable and oh so yummy. I just knew their story would be fireworks once we finally got there, and I was right. Ash and Janvier have this connection that just sucks you right in, but it's the banter that really seals the deal. There's no gushy love here, but that constant enemies to lovers tension that I absolutely love. Not that they are enemies, or ever really were, it's just that the tension and by play between them has that feeling, making for exactly my kind of romance. I realize I'm probably sounding like a bit of a fan girl here, but the book was simply that perfect for me.Onto other things aside from my love for Ash & Janvier. The plotline of this one was really intense, and kept me hooked from the start. I also liked the large focus on Elena and Raphael as well, always a plus. But what really stole the show for me was learning more about Nassir. He's always been a bit of a creepy mystery that I wanted to know about, and that wish was granted in this book. I cracked up so many times at what would come out of his mouth or how he would act. He's a bit out there and anything but civilized, unless he's wearing it as a disguise. I loved seeing him shed that and get a glimpse into who he really is. Now I think it's a toss up on whose book I want to see more next, Illium or Nassir.Let me just say, ARCHANGEL'S SHADOW was worth every bit of the wait. I devoured this book in one setting, staying up until the wee hours of the morning as I just couldn't get enough.

"I have to admit that anthologies aren't typically my favorite thing as the short stories never seem long enough for my tastes. The exception to that rule is when the anthology is set in one of my favorite series, where the world is already known to me. I enjoy getting to see extras from my favorite main characters, as well as the bonus of featuring some of the side characters as well. It's an opportunity to expand the world, and even while Kelley's world already was very very expanded for me due to the narrator rotation, this anthology only enhanced things for me. Now onto the individual stories:Demonology - This one's about Adam's mother and how she learned about his demonic half. It was enjoyable, but it left me wanting more in the end. It just felt like it ended too abruptly. Even so, it was a good look into her character and the determination to help her son.Stalked - I had read this one before, but it was just as much fun the second time around. Clay and Elena are anything but a normal couple, so seeing them try to go through the full ritual of a honeymoon was amusing, especially as both were determined to follow procedure. A cute and fun story.Hidden - I've read this one as well, and own the really nice hardcover collector's edition. This one is perfect for fans of the werewolves as the whole gang is there for the most part, including the twins. A great additional story to satisfy fans.Twilight - This one was interesting because it showed Cassandra, and explained some more details on vamps at the end of their lives. It could have been a bit longer, but I was glad to have those questions answered.Chivalrous - This one utterly and completely broke my heart. I knew Reese's back story wasn't a happy one, but this one felt like a sucker punch to the gut. But, after reading this one, I feel I understand him better, and my heart goes out to him even more.Lucifer's Daughter - This was a fun and crazy story to match Karl and Hope's lives. Enjoyable.From Russia with Love - This is another I had read before, and again it was just as enjoyable the second time around. I always enjoy the werewolf centered stories the most. This one is set right after the end of the series.Vanishing Act - This was the new novella for this anthology, and while I enjoyed it, it really did spotlight Savannah's immaturity. Frankly I kind of had enough of that back in the main series, so it irked me a bit, but none the less I enjoyed the story, and I think the immaturity might be finally on its way out, so it will be interesting to see if there will be any more Savannah stories coming up in the future.So as you can see, this is a great set of stories for fans of the series. I can't wait to see what novellas will be in the next as Kelley has two more anthologies planned.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2GD0SUUFARDNN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00INIXTZO#wasThisHelpful","R2GD0SUUFARDNN","A1826E02TONM9I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1826E02TONM9I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I absolutely love Ilona Andrew's books, so when I saw she was writing a new series, I have to admit there might have been a bit of fan girl excitement. Of course, a part of me was wondering if lightning would strike twice and this series could be as good as the Kate Daniels series. Well let me just say that BURN FOR ME was every bit as good as any Kate book, and dare I say... possibly even better. You can really tell that this author duo is only getting better at their craft, and it showed in BURN FOR ME.It's a toss up at to whether the world, characters, or the romance enthralled me the most, so I'll briefly talk about each without spoiling. The world behind the story was fascinating, and unlike anything I've read before. It felt like a mix between a dystopian and a normal urban fantasy, which I loved as it was anything but predictable. Now onto the characters. I absolutely loved Nevada. She's so fierce and devoted, but don't worry, she's definitely not Kate 2.0. She generally tries to avoid danger, and thinks before she leaps, and I enjoyed seeing the sensible aspects about her. The rest of the characters are every bit as well fleshed out, making for a really interesting cast.  Lastly onto the romance. While things were more of a set up rather than an actual romance, lordy can I tell that things will explosive. Oh my goodness is the attraction between Mad Rogan and Nevada incredible. I can't wait to see how this plays out!BURN FOR ME is an utter treat. From the amazing world, to the incredible cast of characters, and enthralling plot, this book should be at the very top of any urban fantasy fan's TBR pile. I simply cannot praise this new series enough and will be counting down the months impatiently until the next release.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3A52PO4FXBR2W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00I7V11WU#wasThisHelpful","R3A52PO4FXBR2W","A1826E02TONM9I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1826E02TONM9I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"BEWARE THE WILD suffered from a case of ""almosts"" for me. The world was almost there, and I was almost attached to the romance, but unfortunately those ""almosts"" kept me from really connecting to this story. The world behind the story was supposed to be creepy, especially the swamp, but it just didn't quite feel like enough to really suck me in. As the blurb says, there's atmosphere, but it just wasn't fleshed out enough to really give the air I think this was trying to achieve. It's a shame, because this could have been one heck of an enthralling and chill inducing read, but it ultimately fell flat.Another bit of disappointment for me was the characters and the romance. I had a hard time connecting with Sterling. I didn't get her behavior towards her brother, and the eating disorder to punish him for growing up. Yes, I realize he was her protector, but frankly the way she stood up and was determined to get him back once the swamp took him, seemed at odds with her previous actions that led to the whole situation in the first place. It just seemed out of character and too strong willed for the type of person she seemed to be at the beginning. That being said, I did enjoy seeing her grow and gain confidence, which kept me interested in the story. However, one thing I didn't enjoy too much was the romance between her and Heath. I just didn't quite get it as it was another one of those cases where something just seemed to be missing. I just didn't feel the chemistry nor the connection, which made it not work for me.While BEWARE THE WILD kept me interested, it wasn't the enthralling read I was hoping for, but overall mediocre in the end. It's a shame because this one could have been great. That being said, I definitely see potential for this author and will be checking out her future books.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R310IB3ZXC3Q0Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00I2PD8UE#wasThisHelpful","R310IB3ZXC3Q0Y","A1826E02TONM9I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1826E02TONM9I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The plot behind UNBINDING was a bit different, and didn't have quite the same feel to it as the rest of the books in the series, at least to me. But that could easily be explained away by my preference for the werewolf focused books. Sure, a lot of this takes place with wolves playing a large part in things, but they weren't the full focus. Even so, once I got over missing the wolf focus, I enjoyed the plot of this one. The chaos god sure made things interesting, and the intensity of everything kept me sucked in. At one point in the book where something major happens that's a game changer, well let's just say by that point I couldn't have put the book down even if I had wanted to. I just had to know how things were going to work out, and to me, that's a sign of a really great read.I enjoyed seeing Kai grow in Unbinding. At the start she was stubborn, petulant, and more than a bit biased against the Elves. Frankly she did get on my nerves a bit at the start as she was just blindly negative against the Elves, and in turn the things they offered her. I guess I just found it a bit hypocritical as her lover, while not an Elf, was sworn to them, and hypocrisy is one of my pet peeves. Luckily that didn't hold me up too much as it didn't talk up too much of the page time, and she did grow over the course of the book, as her perceptions started to change. Another aspect she made large growth in was her self confidence. She started out the book not feeling like she was important nor was her magic really powerful or useful, but then as time went on, she started to see and understand her value. I just really enjoy seeing a character progress and grow as it makes it very easy to attach to them, which in turn makes for an even better read.So many times long running series like this one start to go stale after a while, but I'm finding myself enjoying each book as much as the last. Fans of the series should be more than pleased with this latest installment, and here's to hopefully many more to come.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1QD3VAB25ISRW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0425263371#wasThisHelpful","R1QD3VAB25ISRW","A1826E02TONM9I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1826E02TONM9I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I had forgotten just how much I loved the first book in this series until I started reading this one, and then it all came back to me. I just love the mix of elements from the romance, to the greek mythology, and the FBI cases to solve. Then of course add in all the other supernatural types, and I'm one happy reader. I'm a big fan of variety in my books, especially when they are come together so well like in this book. The characters and the world are very vivid, and I had no trouble at all getting sucked right into the story.Onto the romance. I have to admit that at first I was a bit leery as it seemed to be venturing into love triangle territory, but luckily that's not really the case. Sure, there are two ""romantic"" interests, Kallistos and Zach, but the former isn't really about love. Emma's a Siren, and therefore smexiness is just part of who she is, so Kallistos is the perfect fit for a companion to keep her safe from the dangers of acting on her love for Zach. I was really happy that she had him, even if there never would be love there. However, that really didn't make it any easier on my heartstrings when it came to things with her and Zach. They have the kind of connection that you just can't help rooting for, but that path seems to lead to nothing but heartache. Every time I thought they may have a chance, the rug got pulled out from under again. I'm really really hoping Emma finds a way to finally put Demeter in her place and out of messing with her life, but as it's already been thousands of years, it probably won't be any time soon. But hey a girl can hope, right?RECKONING and the Fallen Siren series have earned a place on my must read shelf. I'll be eagerly anticipating the next book, and I highly recommend it to anyone who loves a great Urban Fantasy read with some romance thrown in. Trust me, you'll want to give this one a look.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R12STB8OCXCH3Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0425263304#wasThisHelpful","R12STB8OCXCH3Z","A1826E02TONM9I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1826E02TONM9I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Let's start off with what I loved. Boy was there so much in this one. The world is amazing detailed and unique. The author has created one heck of a world and storyline that is fresh and new. No stale world and creatures here. Sure, Jinni (genies) have been done before, but not like this, or at least I haven't read anything like this. All of the different world rules were intricate, and I loved seeing how everything played out with the wishes and limitations. Speaking of Jinni, I absolutely loved Nalia's character. Sure she's a bit rough around the edges and plays the pity poor me for much of the beginning, but that doesn't take too long for her to start changing and getting stronger. I loved seeing her move out of her guilt and start to work towards taking charge of her life. I see a very long and rough road, but also great things for her future. Speaking of the future, I'm really anxious to see where things lead with Raif. There's a lot of yummy potential there, and this is one of those times where I wish this wasn't written as a YA, but even so, I'm really enjoying how things are playing out in the romance department. There's plenty more little things that I loved about EXQUISITE CAPTIVE but I'll leave it here on the good category.And now onto the not so good things. This book could have easily been a solid five star read for me if it had not of been for two glaring issues I had. First up, the somewhat relationship between Nalia and her master. I have to admit at one point I almost DNF this book due to those almost Stockholm syndrome issues. I realize Nalia was really mixed up and feeling/experiencing affection for the first time, but honestly her reactions to Malek's affections really turned my stomach, making it really hard to continue reading at points. He was utterly and completely abusive and like the typical abuser, extremely apologetic afterwards, ""beating himself up"" over it. And then of course Nalia plays the perfect victim and makes excuses. It just didn't sit well with me and I started massively skimming. Luckily in the overall grand scheme of things, this issue wasn't a large part of the book, and other things eclipsed it, I just had a hard time reading it while it was front and center. And now onto the other not so good thing, the flashes to the villian's perspective. Those sections were utterly horrifying, and I don't think they served any real benefit to the story. I honestly wish they hadn't of been included because they broke up the flow of the series, and were just too much in my opinion. I would have still felt the threat to Nalia without adding in those graphic sections.So all in all, this was a very enjoyable and refreshing read. I highly recommend this to any paranormal/fantasy fans looking for a great story that's a bit different than anything else out there. Trust me, if you are looking for a solid block of entertainment, look no further than EXQUISITE CAPTIVE.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3BR2GVTIXMIFD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HU5KLZC#wasThisHelpful","R3BR2GVTIXMIFD","A1826E02TONM9I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1826E02TONM9I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"SACRIFICE just wasn't what I was expecting. Perhaps I had too high of hopes based on all the build up over the previous books and novellas, but I just don't feel like this book gave the series the proper send off that it deserved. Things just were not settled at all in the end and were left far to open for my tastes. Perhaps that means that this series isn't actually finished, but I'm not really sure who the next book would be about as all of the characters have seen their ""day."" Even so, putting the lack of a finalized ending aside, I still don't feel like this book was as strong as the previous ones. Michael just seems stuck in an overbearing protecting rut, shutting the rest of the world out and refusing any help. Frankly while some of that showed in the previous books, him being wise and the glue that held the family together was what came through more. I loved how everyone could really count on him to be fair and know what to say to reassure them. So I was really excited to see things from his side, but unfortunately felt let down as that element just seemed missing this time around. That being said, he did grow by leaps and bounds by the end of the book, so there's a plus, but again, I would have like to have seen more of the Michael that's we've seen in the previous books rather than how things played out in this one.Another character that came across completely differently than had been previously portrayed was Hannah. I just didn't get her at all. Never would I have guess she would have had such a chip on her shoulder, and so many of her actions came across as childish and immature despite her claiming to be a grown up. It just didn't jive with what had been shown before, and it left the romance stilted and stale. With Michael being so closed off and Hannah being anything but understanding about everything, I was left scratching my head at what was really going on there. I mean they are supposed to be two adults in a relationship, and yet, there just didn't seem to be anything real there. I just didn't get it, and it soured the read for me.The plot behind Sacrifice left me wanting more as well. The villain seemed just a bit over the top as liked to play with his victims which is in complete contrast to anyone the brothers have faced previously. I'm not sure I liked this element. Sure, it ramped up the tension a bit, but I don't think it drew me in emotionally toward their plight, and when you consider just how much craziness occurs in this book, I should have been more emotionally invested. Unfortunately I just wasn't making this a mediocre read overall for me. I wanted so much more from this book and it just wasn't there. I still think fans of the series should read SACRIFICE to see Michael's side of things and hope along with me that the series will be continued.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3I5TWL114HDCA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IA9SQ4K#wasThisHelpful","R3I5TWL114HDCA","A1826E02TONM9I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1826E02TONM9I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I always look forward to Camile's books the most as I love her trio of men so much, but I'm not so sure how I feel about the romance department in this one. I mean Camile has these three awesome husbands and some of my favorite parts of her books has been watching the three men bumbling along trying to work together and balance their time with Camile, etc. However, this time around Camile is separated from two of them leaving that fun dynamic out. There was a pretty emotional beginning as Camile dealt with Trillian having to leave for a time, which was really hard on her. But when Smoky had a problem with Camile needing to leave to go on a very dangerous quest, she basically shut him down completely claiming it was her duty. It just left a bit of a sour taste in my mouth as Smoky seems to frequently get the short end of things. I guess I was just hoping for more of the dynamic between all four of them, and that just didn't happen. That being said, the smexy scenes were still there, perhaps not as hot as they have been in the past, but definitely still steamy.Camile being separated by all but one of her men aside, I was largely enjoying this book. The quest gave things a bit of a different feel and a change of pace that I liked. Add that into the growing world dynamic with the dragons and the reveals that happen surrounding Morgaine and I was utterly hooked. The book was one heck of a journey, and I've always been a fan of quest books. But I will note that while I was really enjoying the storyline, the ending turned a bit sour for me as I felt the resolution was way too easy. Things were portrayed as the biggest bad they've face, which when you consider just how many foes they've come up again, that's saying something. And yet... The resolution was so easy, that I had to go back and re-read those paragraphs to make sure I didn't miss something. Sure there's warnings for consequences on their actions, but to me that's not enough to make up for how easy the final showdown went. It honestly left me scratching my head, but I guess only time will tell as to what those repercussions will hold. Maybe they'll balance the easy go this round next time.So all in all, this is another good read in this long running series that's showing no signs of slowing up. Fans of the series should be pleased with Camile's latest installment, and if they are anything like me, they will finish and will already be looking for the next one. Bring on more books!","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RH4YSJL92KDKK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ISEOKOC#wasThisHelpful","RH4YSJL92KDKK","A1826E02TONM9I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1826E02TONM9I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This series started out so strong for me, but unfortunately has been mostly mediocre since. I just find the lack of progression frustrating, and despite all the almost frenetic action in each book, I just don't feel like we are getting anywhere. Sure, answers were finally revealed that had been pestering from the start, but frankly the answers seemed almost too pat. The addition of a new character contributed to that, and she was completely predictable, to the point that it was incredibly annoying that the characters couldn't see what was right in front of them.Getting back to the frenetic action pacing, while it was exciting and it kept me pretty hooked in the book, it vastly overshadowed character development and interaction. I think it just took more than a bit of the emotion out of things. I've said this several times over the last couple of books, but the romance between Jessica and Roarke is stilted. There's supposed to be so much between them, but there never seems to any real time together to build/show that connection. I guess I just don't feel it, which is a shame.I realize this review is mostly negative, but it's just largely frustrations as I feel like this series has so much potential that it's not quite reaching. That being said, due to the high action pacing of this book, I was pretty hooked into the book while reading it. As I said, I'm just looking for something a bit deeper and hopefully the next book will deliver that.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R325MQAUSFWAAK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HQ2N0GQ#wasThisHelpful","R325MQAUSFWAAK","A1826E02TONM9I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1826E02TONM9I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I had really high hopes for Rebel Nation as I loved Viral Nation, and lucky it lived up to those expectations. In my review of the last book I wrote about how it was dystopian at its finest as the world was obviously broken and massively controlled, yet the people had no idea things were so bad. Of course in Viral Nation, the main cast of characters get their eyes opened and things get a little crazy. REBEL NATION is the fallout of that chaos and the choices Clover and the rest made, and boy was it a ride. Granted, you could tell it was a middle book in the series due to just a bit of stalling rather than huge movements forward, but honestly I was okay with that. It allowed for more character development and plot thickening rather than a continual rushed feeling. And frankly aside from well developed characters and romance, plot pacing is pretty high up on my most important list for books, so this one is a win for me.I fell in love with Clover in Viral Nation, and that was only further cemented in REBEL NATION. Her autism made her so real, for lack of a better word. She's just so raw and well real. There's this lack of falsehood to the point where you know that everything she says or thinks will be brutally honest. Sure that makes it a bit hard for her to interact with others, due to her lack of social niceties and a filter. It also makes me care for her all the more when she continues to try and work with the others despite her social issues. Frankly, in their situation, her lack of filter and unique way of looking at things are invaluable, but I still enjoyed seeing her trying to find her way with Jude in a romantic sense. There's just something so innocent and honest about it that I loved, and it made for a very sweet read.I'm always on the lookout for a new and great dystopian read, and I'm happy to say that this series, and REBEL NATION specifically more than pleases the dystopian fan in me. If you are looking for a great read with plenty of action and great characters, look no further than REBEL NATION.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R251W63CJ8BACW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00G3L6M6Q#wasThisHelpful","R251W63CJ8BACW","A1826E02TONM9I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1826E02TONM9I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Can I just start off by saying I absolutely love Keri Arthur's books. There's just something about them that really works for me. In fact, I've re-read her Riley series several times, they are that good. So, you can imagine just how excited I was to see a brand new series coming from her. And a phoenix to boot? Well, there just wasn't a chance I wouldn't be reading this book. So bear in mind that I'm more than a little biased. So that being said, I had very high hopes for FIREBORN, and I'm happy to say that it more than lived up to my expectations.I absolutely adored Emberly. She's so strong yet incredibly vulnerable at the same time. Her life is incredible and extraordinary in her abilities, but they come at a very steep price. The curse phoenixes are under are harsh and frankly staggering. To be bonded to another with your very existence dependent upon them yet be unable to love them is just utterly heartbreaking. And the fact that they fall in love with someone outside of their fated partner each life cycle, yet cursed for that love to end badly, is just cruel in my opinion. And yet through it all Emberly stays strong and continues to push on. There were several times throughout where it would have been so easy to walk away from the circumstances she had been forced into, but she doesn't and I loved her for it. I also loved the dynamic she had going with her life mate, Rory, and despite the lack of romantic love, they loved each other all the same, and somehow that made all of the other romantic mess easier to bear.Of course after all this gushing, you may be wondering why I didn't rate this a 5 if I loved it so much. That's mostly due to giving the series a bit of room to grow, but also the frustration that comes from starting a new series and having to learn that new world and all the frustration that goes with that. I will say that Keri handled things mostly well in this department, but I think I would have preferred just a bit more world building or explanation as even after finishing this first book, I feel a bit muddy about what's going on. I'm sure it will build over time and after several installments are out, and I have more knowledge, this will be a 5 star re-read, but for the first time through to be fair, I just can't quite give it the highest marks. Putting that slower world building aside, FIREBORN is an excellent star to a fresh new urban fantasy series that will please fans of the genre and Keri's writing alike. This one will definitely be staying on my keeper shelf!","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1OBUE5TLFD47T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HDMLU02#wasThisHelpful","R1OBUE5TLFD47T","A1826E02TONM9I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1826E02TONM9I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Masks was a real treat for me. I loved seeing into Mircea's head back before he became so powerful and had lived as long as the vampire Cassie knows today. To see him powerless and the bottom rung was really different. It's interesting to note that despite his lower power level and much less experience, at the core he was still the same man. He still was a leader and one not satisfied to just let things happen around him without him trying to fix or influence them for the better. Sure, this wasn't apparent to him at the start of this book, but the experiences in this book definitely were the turning point in him finding his confidence as a vampire.Not only was MASKS very focused on Mircea and him finding his way, there also was a fully formed plot interwoven into the story as well. Granted, it's nowhere near the typical frenzy pace of the rest of the two series, but more than enough to fully hold my attention. I loved the mix of political intrigue and the way it kept me on my toes throughout. The little hints and clues added together, and while I had my suspicions on certain things, I still was caught off guard by the big reveal at the end, which I loved.For a novel that was just supposed to be an extra bonus story, MASKS caught me completely off guard. Don't get me wrong, I knew I would enjoy the story as I love Karen's books, but I definitely wasn't expecting such a well crafted and lengthy story. What I had thought was a bonus look into Mircea's past actually wound up being a fully fledged story and one heck of a read. Trust me, this is a must read for any Cassie fan as it gives some much needed look into our favorite (or not so favorite, depending on your preference) master that you won't want to miss.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3QRERU0OUBCV8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00J0H0NQK#wasThisHelpful","R3QRERU0OUBCV8","A1826E02TONM9I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1826E02TONM9I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"One of the most impressive things about this series is how fast paced it is, which I love as it gives a thrilling ride while reading. Yet, even more important, that frenzy pace never once got too out of hand where it would have become too hard to follow. There was just the right amount of downtime and slower moments plus character development mixed in to keep things moving along perfectly. Trust me, this is one of those books that will suck you right in and when you finally emerge, time will have passed without you noticing. And for me, that's the best kind of read.I was really impressed with Miki's growth in PUSH. She's been through so much and obsessively tries to control her life, but if nothing else that's good has come from her being forced into the game, it's that she's learning to let some things go. She's made amazing steps towards learning where to push for that control and when to let things go that only serve to hold her back. Honestly, I'm surprised that she's doing so well. Most people would be in far worse shape, yet shes finding her way and taking charge. There was one scene where she stood up for herself and others despite facing certain death, and I wanted to give her a standing ovation. My kind of gal.Fair warning, PUSH ends in a cliffhanger just like the first book. I'm not a fan of them, so when I finished RUSH, I had to give myself a few days before writing this review to allow my annoyance with the ending to settle in order for it to not color my review. I want a book to grab me enough on it's own merit rather than using a ploy to drag me into reading the next book. They just aren't necessary, and I especially think that's the case here. But, cliffhanger aside, much like the first installment PUSH is a very enjoyable and fast paced read that will appeal to YA fans who are looking for a fresh series that outside the box.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3OJMBFWO03I19/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062192213#wasThisHelpful","R3OJMBFWO03I19","A1826E02TONM9I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1826E02TONM9I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm honestly not sure how to explain how I feel about this book. On one hand it was really, well odd, hard to follow at first, and honestly way out there. But then on the other hand I was sucked in turning the pages as fast as I could read them even though all the while I kept thinking to myself what the.. But that was some of the charm of the book as nothing was as it seems.  Sure, the multiple time threads kept throwing me as I tried to unravel the secrets, and while I came to appreciate the way it all unfurled by the end it was just a bit frustrating while reading it due to my confusion. Also there was one element that was so off the wall that honestly I just had to convince myself to overlook the absurdity. Let me just say that rodents should not have played the role they did, and leave it at that. That being said, there were other twists that really made the read step up a major notch by the end as it made you look back over everything that had happened prior to that point with a new eye, amping up the intrigue in my book.It's funny, not only did the plot line start out one way as far as enjoyment and wind up in a completely different category for me by the end, the main character also followed this pattern for me. At first I was rather annoyed with Skylar's pill popping and lack of care. She was an utter and complete mess, and not really relatable. But again as the story unfurled and you got to see more of her past and she also started stepping up in the future, I saw her in a new eye. Don't get me wrong, she was still incredibly broken and rather a mess, but as I started to see why she was that way, and as she started to work towards turning herself around, I fell for her, and only that much further into the story.(DON'T YOU) FORGET ABOUT ME may require a bit of patience to get used to the way it jumps time frames and the overall strangeness, but it's a very fast paced read whose build up is more than worth it. It's definitely more than a little unique and a breath of fresh air for such a voracious but sometimes bored reader such as myself.

"Noon has grown by leaps and bounds from where we first met her, almost to the point where she's almost unrecognizable in comparison. Gone is the whiny, insecure overall annoying girl, and in her place is this confident woman, not afraid to use her magic and fight for what she wants. It honestly was refreshing to see. There were several times throughout reading this book where I was cheering her on and wanted to give her around of applause. Funny thing was, this quest was by far her most daunting yet, but she never once faltered. So major kudos to you Ms. Archer for writing a heroine with incredible character growth!Now as much as I did enjoy this book, there is a bit of a ""Danger Will Robinson"" warning I have to give. It looks like there's a love triangle well on its way. Since that's typically an annoyance of mine it's ironic that despite it's inclusion, this series has drastically turned around for me. But again, the main character's maturity level is one of the fastest ways to turn me off, so it's good that's resolved. This also helped things work well with the addition of this new love interest. Since Noon is so much more mature, I felt stronger about their potential than I ever had with her and Ari. But of course, things aren't exactly smooth, thus the love triangle statement. I'm not completely sure it's headed that way, but based on the way things ended, I have a good feeling it's all going to get messy. Only time will tell.WHITE HEART OF JUSTICE is the perfect example as to why I try and give series multiple chances before giving up. I had only rated the first two books two stars each, but this one easily earns a four from me. Don't get me wrong, the books weren't terrible, I just had some issues, but I had seen the spark of potential there. Granted in my review of the previous book I was largely frustrated and stated I wouldn't be continuing on, but the blurb for this one intrigued me so I figured one last shot was warranted, and after finishing, I'm glad I did. WHITE HEART OF JUSTICE pulls together all of the best elements from the first two books with none of the bad, making me a very happy reader.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R17VX6EU1GU0M9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EOARZP0#wasThisHelpful","R17VX6EU1GU0M9","A1826E02TONM9I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1826E02TONM9I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"They says be careful what you wish for, and I can't help feeling that saying applies to this book for me. So many times with Dystopian trilogies I've found myself thinking that things should have been condensed down into two books rather than dragging everything out. So when I saw that this was a dystopian standalone, I was admittedly excited to get my fix from this genre all in one setting without cliffhangers to worry about. Unfortunately, I think the book would have largely benefited by being stretched out into two books. Everything was so rushed along in order to keep it all in one book that I felt like only half of a story was being told and there were pieces missing everywhere. Nothing frustrates me more than when things aren't fully developed. So much happens in this book, yet I wasn't ""involved"" with any of it because it's just one thing to the next. There's no real substance behind it, which left me feeling less than satisfied. It's ironic because the short length of the book was what crippled it the most, but in the end was the biggest thing it had going for it, because if it had been any longer and kept up the same way, I doubt I would have continued reading past the first few chapters. But as it was, I knew that the book was short and a stand alone, so I might as well continue on hoping for it to turn around. Unfortunately it never did.So as I said, things are all over the place and the plot is just one thing to the next, and frankly leaves a lot to be desired in the logic area. I mean if you really wanted to exterminate all of these communities why would you give so much notice. It makes no sense to me. Why not just grab out who you want to ""save"" and then get on with your awful plot. Sure, they played it off like they wanted to see how everyone behaved after this news to see if they were worthy, but honestly they've been told they will be brutally murdered by machines, I think a little crazy reaction is more than warranted even in the best of people. So there was a pretty big disconnect from the start there, but I was hoping once we got to the big reveal, it would all of a sudden make sense, but unfortunately that didn't happen and wound up feeling like a cookie cutter ""bad guy"" speech. Speaking of cookie cutter, that's a very apt description for Sia. I quite frankly can't think of one remarkable thing to say about her. Again, a lot of this goes back to the short length of the book which just didn't allow for much development in any area, but not being able to connect with the narrator is probably the biggest book killer for me.As I'm reading back over this review I can't help feeling a bit sad. I wanted to like this book for so many reasons but it just wasn't meant to be I guess. Perhaps this one will appeal more to others, but for me, it's a pass.","2.0 out of 5 stars","June 3, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R4S5JKIUE5QXB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1628735945#wasThisHelpful","R4S5JKIUE5QXB","A1826E02TONM9I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1826E02TONM9I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My first thought when I heard about this book: ""Finally, a new Merry book!"" My last thought when finishing this book: ""I wonder how long we'll have to wait until the next Merry book..."" For some reason I had thought that since there was such a very long stretch between the last installment and this one that A SHIVER OF LIGHT would be the final installment and would wrap everything up in the series. No such luck, and I'm trying really hard not to let that sour my experience with book. I was really hoping for some resolution, but while things definitely moved forward on the personal front, the actual overall plot with faerie and the different factions honestly didn't change all that much. However, all of that being said I don't think any of this would have been a complaint at all if it had not have been for the long wait to get to this book, as the story moved a long well and there was more than enough going on with that personal front with Merry's babies and men and her court, and of course there was plenty of political stuff too, because how couldn't there be in a Merry book. So, now onward with things putting my wants aside...Poor poor Merry. I honestly don't know how she does it. No one respects her except for her men, and yet they are some of the reason she is so looked down up. It doesn't seem to matter who it is, but everyone from fae to humans all sneer at her for one reason or another. While she does have moments where she breaks down and falls to pieces and it takes Frost and Doyle to comfort her through it, she always picks herself back up and continues on. She is amazingly strong and I just love how she doesn't back down from anything she believes in. It's both funny and awesome to watch her go all momma bear when one of the ""elite"" fae make negative comments about the lessor fae, especially one of her men. She truly is one of the most fair, yet ruthless rulers, and frankly incredibly admirable. If all of her opponents just paid even the slightest bit of attention to how much her people love her, well it would be a real eye opener for sure. But no, she's left with fear, elitism, and resentment to deal with and it just breaks my heart for her. But I guess that's the sign of a truly good book where challenges to the characters break the reader's heart right alongside them, and that's definitely the case here.There's so much more I could say about this book, like how great it was to finally ""meet"" the babies, and see the fathers interact. There's also much to be said about the political machinations going on, and the way things ended, but all of that is better left alone for readers to enjoy themselves. So I'll end things by saying that the long awaited A SHIVER OF LIGHT doesn't disappoint and is an absolute must buy for all Merry fans out there.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 3, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3R2I9ICZ2ISDY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0425255662#wasThisHelpful","R3R2I9ICZ2ISDY","A1826E02TONM9I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1826E02TONM9I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The world building behind The Dark World was interesting and somewhat complex. It definitely kept me on my toes as I was trying to figure everything out. While I did guess some things ahead of time,  other caught me off guard, making for the perfect blend of suspense in my book. I especially enjoyed how this book is quite different than most of the paranormal YAs out there. It gave me something new and fresh to read, and I loved it for that alone, nevertheless all the other things that drew me in, like the fabulous cast of characters. I loved how they, just like this world were very unique and fully fleshed out. It certainly made for an enjoyable read.I loved, loved, loved the slower build of the romance between Paige and Logan. Sure, it's still pretty fast, but compared to many similar books in the genre, it moved at almost a turtle's pace. This allowed me to attach more to the two of them together so much more than an instalove would have. So when roadblocks came into play, I felt the pain and angst right along with them. While I won't spoil things, I will say that by the end this better attachment to the characters and their romance became very important. So that when the whopper of an ending came into play and a certain character makes a huge life changing choice, it didn't lead to an eye roll from me. A definite win in my book.I enjoy Cara's Spellbound series, but this one steps it up a notch for me. The characterization, world building and romance have only gotten better, and I love getting to see an author grow like this. I'll definitely be on the look out for the next book in the series after that ending, and frankly anything else Cara writes will more than likely be on my radar as well. So if you are looking for a fresh read and a good book to escape into for an afternoon, look no further than THE DARK WORLD.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RHYLSFUSX46PJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00H5I80XE#wasThisHelpful","RHYLSFUSX46PJ","A1826E02TONM9I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1826E02TONM9I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"One of the best things about this series is both the world behind it and the progression the characters make as they navigate it. I love how every Remy thought she had things figured out, something new would come along or something would change throwing a wrench into things. Not only did this keep things interesting, but it only made me fall for Remy more as she continued to persevere and stand up for what she thought was right no matter the obstacle thrown in her path. And boy let me tell you there were some major obstacles this time around. Everything really came to a head, and I loved seeing it all come together one last time to blow things out of the park.I'm not the biggest fan of love triangles. When they do pop up in books, generally I'm loyal to a core, choosing the first guy and sticking to him throughout. However, that wasn't the case here as I feel head over heels for Asher's brother, Gabe in the previous book. After Asher dies, Remy and Gabe become very close and you can see how much he cares for her, but things never move past just ""closeness"" as Remy's still hurting so much from her loss. I understood that and loved Gabe all the more for not rushing things. But of course at the end the rug got ripped out from under me when it turned up Asher wasn't gone after all. Don't get me wrong, his death was devastating, but the author handled the healing and transition to Gabe so well that I wanted only Gabe for her. Unfortunately IGNITED opens up with the love triangle in full force as Remy and Asher try to reconcile who they were and who they are now, with Gabe mixed in there too, leaving me more than a little frustrated. It was painfully obvious things were more than over between the two of them, as Asher just couldn't cope with her making him human. Gabe on the other hand never once faltered, and I have to admit wanting to yell at Remy more than a few times to wake up and see. But don't get me wrong, I do think the whole situation was handled very very well from a writing stand point as it was very realistic and there wasn't any sudden changing of feelings. A definite win in my book.It's always bittersweet to say goodbye to a series I've loved, but I do enjoy it when that series ends with a good send out. One where you close the book on a sigh of contentment, and that definitely was the case here. Would I have wanted more from this series and world? Sure, as it's really well written and the characters suck you right in. But despite my wish for more, I'm very satisfied with the way things turned out and want to give the author major kudos for doing a great job pleasing this very hard to satisfy with endings reader. Two thumbs up, you won't want to miss this one!","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2IG9L6E5UCWNU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GYLVQ02#wasThisHelpful","R2IG9L6E5UCWNU","A1826E02TONM9I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1826E02TONM9I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Larry P. Arnn’s new book is most readable when the author gives us narratives from his subject’s younger life. Churchill, with his uncommon bravery and taste for adventure, is an exciting character to read about.But most of the book deals with Churchill’s political views and personal philosophies, and how they were often at odds with many—at times, it seems, the majority—of the views held by his contemporaries.Though Arnn shows that Churchill had some early sympathy with somewhat socialistic views, his main point is to show that Churchill was primarily a champion against socialism, seeing before many others the problems it would lead to.Arnn’s book is well researched and well written, contains some good lessons, and has a few interesting stories. Because of its focus on political philosophy, however, it won’t hold the interest of readers looking for a common biography of Churchill.I received a complimentary electronic copy of this book in exchange for an honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RVFPGYC5XTQ3W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1595555307#wasThisHelpful","RVFPGYC5XTQ3W","A2V2F6WI16B9F8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2V2F6WI16B9F8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I’ve read several books about running, but Justin Slater’s Blood, Sweat, and Shame is one of a kind.Slater, for me, is easy to relate to. He says that his entire “list of personal attributes” that qualifies him to complete an ultra marathon is this: “Really, really compulsive tendencies. Usually about food.”The author is always funny and honest—sometimes too honest. And he never has a superior tone. His main goal, it seems, (besides sharing his experience) is to make fun of himself:“At no point during your reading do I expect you to feel a twinge of anything approaching inspiration.”Slater does a fair amount of taking jabs at the running culture in general. As a runner myself, I agree with all his observations and criticisms, even when they apply to me.The author’s main story is how he went from being out of shape and overweight to completing a 50 mile run, and what he learned from it. In the end, he concludes that “running doesn’t matter,” that it can be a selfish pursuit, but that it can also be good therapy. If you like it, do it, but don’t try to justify it or expect others to be impressed by it.Slater seems to go out of his way to make you not like him, but he comes across as very likable—a normal guy who would be fun to hang out with. One of the things I liked most about his book is how much he shows his appreciation for his wife, whom he always describes as supporting and encouraging. During the second half of Slater’s 50 mile run, she shows up on a bike to ride along with him. Slater writes:“I could not have been happier if Jesus himself was riding that bike. She was smiling and happy and the exact opposite of everything I was feeling. She also brought soda and chips…”What more could a guy ask for?My only criticism is that Slater’s language is unnecessarily harsh; I had to keep my kindle out of the reach of my kids while I was reading his book. But other than that, he is a good writer and story-teller. Whether he keeps running or not is up to him, but I do hope that he keeps writing.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2Y02SHRP4UEIH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YNUXNIO#wasThisHelpful","R2Y02SHRP4UEIH","A2V2F6WI16B9F8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2V2F6WI16B9F8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Fawn Weaver says that you can have an argument free marriage, and she uses her own as an example.The author’s tips are basic—things we know but too often don’t follow: don’t go to bed angry, for instance.Weaver believes that argument free marriages are rare. When her husband read her first draft and asked why they were mentioned so much, she replied: “The book is about an argument-free marriage. There’s certainly not much other data available for this concept.” But I don’t agree. There are many argument free marriages—both happy and unhappy ones.Weaver says that she is outspoken, so for her, an argument free marriage may be a difficulty. There are many marriages, though, where one or both parties are not argumentative. Two people who both avoid conflict can have a perfectly argument-free, yet unhappy and silent marriage.But that’s a side issue. If you argue with your spouse, this book along with the exercises may be helpful.Weaver’s blog is called they Happy Wives Club. We should make it our goal to be either a happy wife or a happy husband, whichever case may apply.

"How could Robert Fuss not write a book after traveling to all 50 states and over 70 countries, and knowing four decades worth of presidents and congressmen? He has enough good stories to fill several life times; after reading his book, I think that being “kidnapped by nuns” would be an ordinary day for him.Fuss writes: “If you can’t find a bus that is going where you want to go, then you need to want to go wherever the bus is going.” If any quote could summarize this book, that would be it. Fuss was always willing to get on the bus (or plane, or boat), just to see where it would go.Mr. Fuss spent 40 years in news radio, finishing his long career with CBS. He covered everything from earthquakes to presidential elections. His chapters rotate from his job to his vacations, which were both full of adventure.After reading the book, it seems the two things Mr. Fuss seeks most are adventure and good food. He describes both in detail, chapter after chapter.“I felt I had made the right decision the night before the trip began. At the elegant Victoria Falls Hotel crocodile was on the menu but I chose against it, figuring eating a crocodile would sacrifice the moral high ground if one of them wanted to eat us.”That may have been wise, as he soon ended up in the Zambezi, but I’ll let you read that story.I loved reading this book for several reasons. One is Mr. Fuss’s form of humor: “As a trained observer of men and events, I can report Iguazu is a damn big waterfall.” Another is that he writes about the things that were happening in the world while I was growing up, and just enough to make me want to do a little more research, look at another map, or listen to another old clip of Walter Cronkite.But mostly, the stories are inspiring. Mr. Fuss was born disabled, or, as he might say, “crippled”:“I never quite understood why ‘crippled’ became a dirty word. It is descriptive and accurate.”Yet he did more, and continues to do more, than most of us dream to do. Besides being thoroughly entertaining, Mr. Fuss’s book makes me want to get out and explore, or at least eat a good meal. This is easily one of the best books I’ve read this summer.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2754DN1A24F97/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1508488134#wasThisHelpful","R2754DN1A24F97","A2V2F6WI16B9F8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2V2F6WI16B9F8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

He says that, even though it may seem to go against one’s nature, a person should choose to never become angry. Instead, people should purposely live calm and happy lives.The author’s style is simple and “gentle.” And his chapters are short, making this book easy to read and contemplate at one’s own speed.Sumanasara is a Buddhist monk.

"If you think that reading a book on manners sounds like a bore, give Sandi Toksvig’s The Tricky Art of Co-Existing a try. It is anything but.Ms. Toksvig writes about everything from flushing the toilet to sex. Her suggestions—she says there are no rules—are based on the “top c’s of manners”: consideration, common sense, context, and comfort. But since we are talking about co-existing, consideration is prominent:“Chew with your mouth closed. Again we’re dwelling in the unsavory land of others’ moistness. Mastication, like another similar word, is a private affair.”Okay, maybe that example could fall under any of the four categories—there’s always overlap—but still.The author says that manners evolve, and she gives examples to back this up. Some behavior that seemed good form a few hundred years ago looks absurd today. Conversely, new technology creates new ways to be rude:“Do not tweet about your meal. It’s dull for everyone, including those people who have been foolish enough to ‘follow’ you.”Also:“Putting ‘LOL’ or a smiley face at the end of a nasty tweet doesn’t lessen the damage it might do.”Ms. Toksvig even gives advice on how to be bad:“The nineteenth-century novelist Lady Caroline Lamb once had herself served entirely naked in a soup tureen as a birthday gift….this is not an easy gift to carry off with poise….Nevertheless, if you can do it, good luck to you.”Toksvig reminds us time and again that manners vary across cultures. We should be respectful of other beliefs and customs:“I think…that it is the height of bad manners to presume that what you eat, what you think, and what you believe are the only ways to conduct yourself on this glorious planet.”I wasn’t looking for a book on manners when I bought this book; I was just looking for something fun to read. I found that and a whole lot more. One can only hope I put Ms. Toksvig’s advice to use.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/ROWLYLFKAFI74/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YNTMDUE#wasThisHelpful","ROWLYLFKAFI74","A2V2F6WI16B9F8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2V2F6WI16B9F8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I read the Washington Post when the work day is slow. Someone monitors my computer, so I try to look like I’m keeping up with current events. But, if Someone were to look a little further, they’d see that instead of reading the pressing news, I’ve read the last week’s worth of Alexandra Petri (Pea-Try) columns.Petri’s book, A Field Guide to Awkward Silences, like her column, is not “pressing news.” And I’m glad. I wouldn’t have enjoyed it much if it was.A Field Guide is a composite of stories from Petri’s life in which she manages to comment on and make fun of too many things and people to list. Dogs, for instance. But mostly she makes fun of herself.Petri begins with a chapter on the different ways she has purposely failed, or tried to fail, and what she’s learned from them:“There is an art…to flopping. You can’t just be bad. Half the art is knowing how to go too far.”She not only learned about flopping from the experiences, but she also learned about people:“If there is one thing I’ve learned from this afternoon…it’s that no amount of concerted effort can make you seem weirder than people who are just being themselves.”In keeping with the field guide theme, Petri dishes out acres of wisdom:“Starting a sentence with ‘I’m not a racist, but’ is almost universally a poor choice.”Or:“As a general rule, I advise against trying to pick up men at Star Wars conventions.”Ms. Petri, a former Jeopardy! contestant, is also full of trivia: “The average age of the Rush Limbaugh listener is deceased.”Not everyone will appreciate Ms. Petri’s sense of humor. I know this because my wife said, “I don’t appreciate Ms. Petri’s sense of humor.” But, to this reviewer, Petri’s writing and sense of humor are great.Petri writes about important issues—women’s rights, for instance—in an unconventional way:“Little Red Riding Hood What were you wearing? Red? You should have known better than to go out in red like that. You know what red does to a wolf. You were basically a neon sign. A sign that said, ‘Eat Me and Then Eat My Grandmother.’ He couldn’t help himself. That’s how wolves are.”If you are easily offended and enjoy it, you’ll love this book. There’s something in it to offend anyone who looks for ways to be offended.I found the book thought-provoking and entertaining, I wasn’t offended, and I loved reading every page.

"In the Printer and the Preacher, Randy Petersen examines his subjects—Ben Franklin and George Whitefield, from the beginning. He writes of their parents, their childhoods, and the cities they grew up in. He dwells on the details that he believes shaped them the most (along with a lot of other details), such as Franklin’s apprenticeship at a print shop or Whitefield’s days of studying and practicing theater. And he shows how, though they had many differences, the two benefited each other through their relationship.Petersen writes well, has done his research, and gives readers plenty of detail. Though I’ve generally enjoyed reading history and biography, including biographies of these very subjects, I found it hard to stay interested in this book. Other than the book’s not being able to hold my attention, I have no specific criticism, so maybe I chose the wrong subject.

"“Everyone has a story to tell.” That’s the idea behind Melisa Singh and Kerri Lowe’s site, StoryShelter.com, where normal people from all walks of life get to share their stories.We learn a lot from the stories of others. When we read someone else’s story, we get a perspective that we can’t often get from our own life. What’s the benefit? Understanding, compassion, and acceptance. That’s why I love reading memoirs, and why I enjoyed reading I Am Here.I Am Here is a collection of “everyone’s” stories. There are stories of obstacles, abuse, tragedy, and shame:“I duck my head slightly as I swipe my food stamp card. I would have driven to a store a little further away, less chance of seeing someone we know, but I couldn’t spare the gas.”But these are met with determination and resolve, and each inspires us to live better, to be better. The most common themes are perseverance, compassion, grace, and gratitude:“Gratitude would soon become the lifelong song of my days. This is how it began. In time, I would come to see even the loss of my daughter as a gift.”There are also more light-hearted stories; what might happen, for instance, when you take a night-time run on the beach, naked, and can’t remember which of the many identical houses that you’re staying in. Or:“I remember looking at the half moon-shape indentions in my hand and realizing that the only way you get wounds like that is if the horse literally tries to eat your entire hand. And that’s how I learned why you only feed a horse half a slice of cantaloupe.”This collection is well-written and well-edited. The selections are great; each one has something to offer. While I may not share the views of all the contributors, I appreciate what they all have to say. And that’s the beauty of the book—we have the chance to hear, and learn from, people other than ourselves and those within our circle.The writers give us small glimpses into their lives, remembering things that were most important to them, helping us to realize what’s most important to us. We’re encouraged to “fill our days with everything that’s important – and spend less and less time doing what is not.” And that makes I Am Here a book worth reading.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1V3OSVCJL67L5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00W3RUGMK#wasThisHelpful","R1V3OSVCJL67L5","A2V2F6WI16B9F8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2V2F6WI16B9F8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Brant Hansen says that we have no right to be angry. It’s not our job to “set people straight” or “take a stand:”“God ‘needs’ nothing. Quit trying to parent the whole world. Quit offering advice when exactly zero people asked for it. Quit being shocked when people don’t share your morality....Quit thinking you need to ‘discern’ what others’ motives are….It’s all so exhausting.”There’s no such thing, he writes, as “righteous anger.” Our anger isn’t righteous. To think that our anger is righteous is to assume that our beliefs and motives are always right, and the other person’s are wrong.“If this is, in fact, what we’re supposed to do—experience ‘righteous anger’ whenever we’re made aware of one of God’s commands being broken—we’ll be precisely what the world doesn’t need and largely believes we already are: a bunch of uptight, seething hypocrites.”Hansen is clear that he’s not saying we should ignore injustice. But we should act against injustice, not get angry about it. And we should act out of love, not anger.“What the world needs, I think you’ll agree, is not a group of people patting themselves on the back for being angry. We need people who actually act to set things right.”Here’s the great thing, according to Hansen. Choosing to not be offended will make our life better. Giving up our perceived right to anger will make us happier and healthier. And will probably make people take us more seriously. No one wants to be around an angry, judgmental person.Hansen’s writing style is clear and simple. His book is expertly written. His logic is perfect. He’s funny. He’s not preachy or judgmental, even toward the judgmental. His book is excellent. And, I think, this sums it up:“Love people where they are, and love them boldly. And if you really want to go crazy, like them too.”I received a free copy of this book in exchange for an honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3KG92EOO9D28E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0529123851#wasThisHelpful","R3KG92EOO9D28E","A2V2F6WI16B9F8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2V2F6WI16B9F8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Cas Roberts grew up in rural Kentucky in the 50’s and 60’s. And though it wasn’t that long ago, it was a different world from the one we live in today.In his book, As Country as it Gets: Short stories from Appalachia, Roberts writes of his boyhood work and play—logging with mules, searching for and selling Ginseng, building wooden wagons that he and his brothers raced down hillsides, and, later, making moonshine.These essays are fascinating to me. Though I’ve never lived there, I grew up hearing stories of my ancestors who lived in the mountains of West Virginia. I can imagine my granddad in these stories, which are so much like his own.In lots of ways evident from this book, life in Appalachia is like life a century ago. My dad grew up in the 50’s and 60’s, but he didn’t go to a one-room school house heated by coal, or use an outhouse, or plow with draft horses. Nor did he know how to make whiskey without scorching it. But Mr. Roberts did. Rumors say he could even “get a poodle to tree a raccoon.”There may have been disadvantages to such a life, but there were acres of advantages. By the time Mr. Roberts was a teenager, he could do things most men can’t do today. If he needed something, he made it. If he had a problem, he found a way to fix it, all through experience. A good example is from his boyhood wagon making:“In my younger days I built three or four of these types of wagons. I learned if the front axle was a little shorter than the rear axle it would roll and could be pulled by hand much better. Several other young boys also built this type of wagon.”Besides riding down hills in the wagons, the boys also used them for gathering Ginseng in the woods and hauling the valuable roots to buyers—one of their few ways to earn money.The writing in this book is rough. At times Mr. Roberts is repetitive and gives almost too much detail. Other times, he gives little more than an outline of a topic, leaving the reader with questions. But the stories are always sincere and interesting. Roberts writes in his own style, for his own enjoyment, and so that others can “step into a world of values and lifestyle rarely seen today.” The unpolished style actually contributes to the whole experience:“At nighttime when hunting raccoon he [Smokey the coon dog] was the most amazing dog I may have ever known. Coon hunting, he would be the last dog to leave your side, with him scratching and pissing on everything. Then suddenly, at a great distance from you he just starts barking up a tree….”If you’re like me, nostalgic for the older, simpler way of life, enjoy history, and enjoy sincere writing, then I recommend As Country as it Gets.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3B4K6K9WDWJA7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00R9ZBIA0#wasThisHelpful","R3B4K6K9WDWJA7","A2V2F6WI16B9F8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2V2F6WI16B9F8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In his book, The Matheny Manifesto, Mike Matheny shares his thoughts on coaching baseball. I’ve coached youth softball for a few years, and have a few years to go. From that aspect I found this book outstanding. But, more importantly I think, it is just as good from the perspective of a parent, regardless of whether that parent has ever coached anything.Mr. Matheny’s own parents and coaches believed that character is more important than winning. And he, in turn, wants to pass that on to those he coaches, whether they are on his youth baseball team or in the major leagues:“Our role as coaches is not just to build up the scoreboard but also to build up our players so that they become character-filled leaders who will have an impact on those around them.”Matheny writes a lot about his own baseball career. His book goes back and forth between sports biography and coaching philosophy. To me, his most interesting stories are from his days at home, when he and his brothers played outside until after dark. (His dad put lights up in the yard so they could keep on even after the sun when down.) Least interesting are the stories from the major leagues. But all of the stories get back to the same theme: instilling values through sports.What I most appreciate is the straightforward advice to parents, advice which Matheny reinforces with stories of the kind of dad his own father was:“My dad would put in long hours operating heavy machinery….He’d come home covered with dirt, and you could tell all he wanted to do was get cleaned up and relax. But he would always grab a glove and go play catch with me and my brother or throw batting practice for us. He never turned us down.”Matheny’s number one piece of advice to parents who want their kids to excel is to just go out and throw the ball with them:“To develop skills, the younger player needs repetition. For life in general, he needs time with his parents. It’s a win-win.”It’s not just a win-win for the player. The parent, while spending time with their kids and teaching, has a great excuse to play and have fun, something which most of us need more of.Matheny writes a lot about his Christian faith and how it has influenced him in life and coaching. There’s more gospel in this book than many books that are marketed as Christian books.I’m glad I read The Matheny Manifesto just before our own youth softball and baseball leagues get started for the year. I plan to take Matheny’s advice and make it the most productive season my kids have had yet.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1B5SVVHSS81SQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=055344669X#wasThisHelpful","R1B5SVVHSS81SQ","A2V2F6WI16B9F8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2V2F6WI16B9F8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Donald Miller didn't get married until his forties:""I spent years isolated and alone, working up words to tell people who I was--or more accurately, who I wanted to be.""Scary Close tells of how Mr. Miller has begun to move from trying to impress a lot of people to developing intimacy with a few important people--co workers, friends, family, and particularly his new wife.If this book can be described in one word, it's honesty. Mr. Miller is possibly the most honest author I've read. He reveals himself, messy contradictions and all, until even the reader feels a bit uncomfortable. But, he reminds us time and again, ""Honesty is the key to intimacy...we don't have to be perfect and, moreover, we don't have to pretend to be perfect."" Pretending to be perfect, he says, is the perfect way to not develop a relationship. People can't connect with perfect friends, a perfect spouse, or perfect parents. People need to be ""free to be human and honest and true, no matter how dark the truth is.""Scary Close is labeled as a Christian marriage book, but I'm not sure how well that describes it. It is a story of two Christians who meet, get engaged, and get married in the end. But it is not the typical ""this is what a biblical marriage is supposed to look like"" book. The story ends with Miller's wedding, so he doesn't have much experience to speak from. But he does share the wisdom that his friends passed to him, along with some things he's learned from his own journey, about relationships in general.Miller also makes us think. Several times while reading I'd put the Kindle down and think about how true his words are, in my life anyway. I may not share all of the author's views or beliefs, but he makes me take a deeper look at what I do believe. And while reading the book, I've been thinking about my own relationships, about my own unwillingness to be open and known, and about the changes I need to make.Readers have mixed feelings about Miller, but most agree that he is a great writer. And when a deep thinker turns out great writing, it's worth reading. That's certainly true here. I enjoyed every bit of Scary Close. But more than that, I learned a lot from a man who doesn't pretend to have anything to teach. Instead, he just takes off his mask and tells his story.I received a free copy of this book in exchange for an honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1GGOQMX48ZPT5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=078521318X#wasThisHelpful","R1GGOQMX48ZPT5","A2V2F6WI16B9F8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2V2F6WI16B9F8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The authors of Motivate Your Child say that, rather than prompting your child to do what's right by using external motivation (a belt, for example, or maybe a donut), it's best to help them develop their own God-given internal motivation. Let children develop a real sense of right and wrong, and they are better off in the long run. They become more mature, and make wise decisions independently of their parents.The authors present a refreshing, unselfish, and wise way of parenting. They also promote giving children freedom in making decisions:""Asking teens, `What's your plan?' instead of barging in and demanding instant obedience can be a way of teaching them to be responsible."" After reading this book, I plan to make some immediate changes, and I'm convinced they'll be positive.Though the authors have some great things to say, their approach is often too scientific for me. Here's an example:""Kara was on the right track but needed more information about what the conscience does and how it operates so she could develop a specific strategy for her daughter. Whether your child is a preschooler, in elementary school, or a teenager, a deeper understanding of the conscience can increase his or her internal motivation.""Another difficulty is getting used to the author's terminology: action point, instruction process, heart-based approach, parental cues, conscience development. There's nothing wrong with any of these; I just prefer a simpler style.Overall, Motivate Your Child is a Good Book.I received a free copy of this book in exchange for an honest review.","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3VEHWROIT9VGT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0529100738#wasThisHelpful","R3VEHWROIT9VGT","A2V2F6WI16B9F8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2V2F6WI16B9F8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In Rise: Get Up and Live in God’s Great Story, Trip Lee encourages readers—particularly young readers—to not waste time or wait for a better opportunity to live for Christ:“There’s no in-between phase where we just exist in a youth, college, or young singles ministry. You’re a real human being, a real follower of Christ, a real world-changer right now.”Throughout his chapters, the author gives specific examples of areas where young people should grow up, exercise more caution, and become more responsible. All the while, he avoids self-righteousness, being quick to admit his own weaknesses. Though I wish I had read Rise when I was 20, there’s still plenty for me at (almost) 40.Lee’s theme reminds me of John Piper’s Don’t Waste Your Life. Piper, by the way, wrote the forward to this book, which would be a compliment for any writer and adds credibility to any book.I especially appreciate Lee’s writing style. It’s simple and smooth. He doesn’t use hard-to-understand theological terms or over-used Christian phrases (Lee calls it “churchy language….It’s kind of like pig Latin, but more sanctified”). He’s also witty: “I knew it! As soon as I saw him, I pinned him as the type of guy who judges others as soon as he sees them.”  Nor does Lee go quote-crazy, like many young Christian authors. We hear the author’s own voice, telling his own story, in his own way, and that’s refreshing. Here’s a sample:“You’ll never forget when Jordan switched hands in midair or when Ray Allen hit that three at the buzzer. Those are the guys you want to be. They’re in the action at those key moments, not just spectating. But for some reason we do the opposite when it comes to life. Everybody wants to be a benchwarmer.”Lee’s message: don’t be a benchwarmer. Live now. Don’t sleep in, but Rise.Disclosure: I received a free copy of this book in exchange for an honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3U6820T8JY0O9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0529120992#wasThisHelpful","R3U6820T8JY0O9","A2V2F6WI16B9F8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2V2F6WI16B9F8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A couple of years back I had the chance to visit Zambia for two weeks. When I came home, I found it difficult to describe the people, the land, and the culture. In her new book, Leaving Before the Rains Come, Alexandra Fuller describes the country--with its beauty and tragedy--perfectly.Fuller writes about growing up in Zimbabwe and Zambia with her sister, her eccentric mother, and her ""colorful"" father:""'Malaria,' Dad said when his bank manager asked him what contingencies he had made for his senior years. `A bloody good, permanently fatal dose of malaria.'""Fuller's childhood in an unstable country with unconventional parents was far from what Westerners consider normal. She often uses the words ""chaos"" or ""disorder"" to describe it:""So we came to dinner at eight, dressed as if for the captain's table, although I knew, without knowing why I knew I knew it, that ours was really a lifeboat flung out onto the high sea of disorder....[Dad] put his revolver next to his side-plate. Mum put her Uzi on an empty chair beside her. `Safety on?' Dad always asked.""A desire for order, stability, and safety attracted the author to the man she ended up marrying, having children with, and later divorcing. The divorce itself, along with the events and emotions surrounding it, is the main story in Leaving Before the Rains Come. But the divorce isn't the whole story any more than one event in a life defines the whole life.The author dwells on details that seem insignificant--her father's family members whom she had never met, for instance, or the history of a woman she and her husband leased a cabin from near Victoria Falls. But she writes in such a way that we don't mind the detour, if we are on one at all. The book is, at its deepest level, about humanity, and all of the minor characters play a role: ""All beings in a community are connected...the madness of one is the madness of everyone...there is no separation between minds and bodies between people.""In all of her writing, whether about her childhood or marriage, Fuller is honest. She reveals her shortcomings, and her family's brokenness, without glossing anything over, yet without judgment or bitterness. She tells her story and accepts it for what it is. This makes her easy to relate to; most of us can find something of our own story in hers.But regardless of whether or not we can relate to the author, or whether or not we share her beliefs, there's one thing indisputable to this reviewer: Leaving Before the Rains Come is memoir writing at its best.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3987RORUKKF2W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KWG65S8#wasThisHelpful","R3987RORUKKF2W","A2V2F6WI16B9F8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2V2F6WI16B9F8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

His goal isn't to get rich by selling books that repeat the same old themes--that's obvious, considering the Amazon price for this particular eBook (it was $0.00 when I ""bought"" it).In this case, the saying, ""You get what you pay for,"" doesn't hold true. While this short book is repetitive at points, and not all of the tips will work for everyone, Reed has some good, practical advice, and he presents it in a way that's fun to read.Reed sums up his theme in this sentence: ""Don't think that you can wait for retirement to enjoy your life, it may never come.""He tells how he had a series of jobs that ranged from unfulfilling to dreadful, and how he now works for himself doing what he enjoys. He then tells how anyone else can do the same through ""small, incremental steps"" which can ""build up into something wonderful.""Reed's not promoting an easy way to a selfish life of leisure. He's saying that if we can find a way to make a living from what we love, we will be better people all around:""I am sure that, as I find passion in what I do in my life, I become an even better father, husband, and son.""","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R526E4XZZ5IH3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00S6XEIW4#wasThisHelpful","R526E4XZZ5IH3","A2V2F6WI16B9F8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2V2F6WI16B9F8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Runners know Brooks as the company that makes high quality running shoes. Most of us didn't know that the company started out making ballet slippers and bathing shoes in Philadelphia in 1914. From then through the last 100 years, Brooks has had some good times, and a lot of bad times. Certainly, as Running Through the First 100 Years shows, they've been through a lot of change.Brooks made the first ice skates that came with blades already attached. They also had the first roller skates with rubber toe stops. In 1924, the company produced 17,500 pairs of baseball shoes. They made basketball shoes, football shoes, bowling shoes and  tennis shoes. They even made military shoes: ""At one point, the company converted 60 percent of its Hanover production line to combat boots and dress oxfords for the military.""Brooks has had their share of controversy, with Nike usually being involved. One time, a professional football player who had a contract with Nike admitted in court to wearing ""swoosh-doctored Brooks shoes because Nikes made his feet hurt..."" Another time, Nike accused Brooks and Runner's World Magazine of conspiring to manipulate the magazine's shoe rankings. (According to the book, by the way, they hadn't.)If you like history, and are interested in business, particularly running related business, then you'll enjoy this history of an innovative company that not only makes a great running shoe, but seems to care more about running and runners than profit.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R37DAF5PSINIG8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00S2DR0NW#wasThisHelpful","R37DAF5PSINIG8","A2V2F6WI16B9F8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2V2F6WI16B9F8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"According to Brian William in his book, Confidence Hacks: “Confidence is the ability to cope up with the setbacks and deal with it.”What? That’s not clear to you? Okay, try this.  “To define confidence in simple language would be: confidence is a viewpoint that can bring understanding of who you are and what you are capable of.”William says that we are all in need of confidence, and that the steps in his book can get us there: “You may actually be doing some changes in your attitude and that’s wonderful. But, if you really want to give your confidence a boost, you need to work more.”This reviewer asks, if I am “doing” some changes, how does the author know that I still “need to work more.” Perhaps I, and other readers do, but this book does not help. There are some things that may help those who know nothing at all about building confidence. That is, if you can understand the writing in this book, which is, at best, awkward.The following will provide a perfect example of the author’s writing style and the quality of his “hacks”:“There are situations that can make you pretend you know, when you actually have no idea at all. All it needs is confidence to bring it off. If you were able to get away with it, imagine the confidence high that you got from that experience!”I believe that this book is the author’s exercise in the above. He is pretending he knows, when he actually has “no idea at all.” Though he may get a “confidence high” from all of the fake five star reviews he receives—which, by the way, resulted in my wasting $2.99 on this book—he doesn’t actually “bring it off.”","1.0 out of 5 stars","January 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1KA29HAJK0CNT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RPVJWI8#wasThisHelpful","R1KA29HAJK0CNT","A2V2F6WI16B9F8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2V2F6WI16B9F8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"It’s not often that we get something good for free. But I like free. That’s one of the reasons running is my favorite sport; I can go where and when I want, without paying a fee.That’s also one of the reasons I chose to read Chris Bore’s book. I periodically scan the new releases on Amazon, especially looking for anything to do with running. Since the Kindle edition of this book was offered for $0.00, I thought it was worth a try.I’ve downloaded several free books that turned out to not be worth the time to download, but this was not one of them. Mr. Bore’s book is well written, enjoyable to read, and full of good advice.Mr. Bore says that running should be fun. I agree, although I admit that I am guilty of making it not fun. I have gone “too far, too fast, too soon,” and I have paid for it. My Boston Marathon qualifying wife has also gone “too far, too fast, too soon.” She is currently in a cast, recovering from ankle surgery, and missing the fall and winter running season.Mr. Bore coaches new runners. His goal isn’t to make them faster, but to help them enjoy years of injury free running, just as he plans to do himself:“I am 58 years old. I have been running as an adult, on and off, for coming up to 40 years. I would like to run a 10 k when I am 80, and enjoy it.”Just as Mr. Bore doesn’t believe in wasting steps, he doesn’t waste words. Every page of this very short book is good. My favorite paragraph of his sums up the whole idea:“If you are a runner, being there – being out there, actually running – is what it is about. If you make the running unpleasant, or you injure yourself, then you won’t be there, and you won’t be a runner. So make it nice; and take it slow.”","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1M8GTB6N5KPWH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RN52Y6S#wasThisHelpful","R1M8GTB6N5KPWH","A2V2F6WI16B9F8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2V2F6WI16B9F8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'll begin with a confession: I've never watched an episode of Dancing with the Stars, and, until I found this book, I'd not heard of Amy Purdy. But I always look for stories of inspiring people, people who overcome obstacles to accomplish great things. I bought this book knowing nothing more about it than the description on Amazon, and I'm glad I did.Amy Purdy writes:""We don't always get to decide which course we go down or know which mountains we'll face. Yet we always have the most important choice there is: whether to resist, or to give ourselves over to the twists and turns of the terrain.""The wisdom in that quote is more poignant considering the mountains Ms. Purdy has faced, certainly not ones she would have chosen. But she turned her losses and her trials into opportunities to become a great athlete and person, and to inspire people all over the world.*Spoiler alert*The author writes of her nearly fatal meningitis, of her loss of both feet, of her kidney transplant, and of her many other `mountains,' as opportunities. She doesn't want any sympathy; she proves that she doesn't need it. From re-learning to walk, to winning an Olympic bronze medal in snowboarding, she is always strong and determined.Ms. Purdy is not the only hero in the story. Throughout, she gives credit to the people who loved and helped her. Her parents and sister, for instance, who never left her bedside during the weeks she spent in the hospital. Amy's mother and father, and their unconditional love, devotion, and willingness to sacrifice for their children, are examples of the kind of parent we all should want and hope to be.Ms. Purdy uses her accomplishments to help and inspire others, whether it's by traveling to South Africa to give shoes to village children, creating opportunities for other athletes, or writing this book:""I didn't write this book because I want you to say, `Wow, look at what that girl overcame....' I'm sharing my story because I want you to see what's possible in your own life. Right here. Right now.""I'm grateful to have read On My Own Two Feet at the start of this new year.

"In her forward to June Eding's book, Norah Lawlor writes: ""Manners that Matter Most is an important contribution as it takes an old subject and presents it in a fresh and accessible way."" After reading the book, I agree.The author says that good manners have more to do with being kind and considerate than following rules or social customs. Manners are not merely for making good first impressions, but are always essential, including at home and at work.After generalities on what good manners are and why they are important, the author gives us ""25 essentials to good manners."" This list includes the classics--say thank you, offer help, don't gossip, and others that are sadly out of fashion.For example, the author believes, as does this reviewer, that it's still important to be on time. ""When you're on time, you communicate that you respect the other person and their time..."" Also, ""If you say you're going to do something, do it.""There are also more original, but no less important, bits of advice, such as, ""Don't assume `honesty is the best policy'....In truth, there is no reason why the full range of your opinions or feelings should be shared with everyone.""And, ""If you are hanging out with friends or loved ones, take a break from your phone.""Eding's book is a concise and well-written reminder of the classic wisdom: ""Treat others as you yourself would want to be treated.""","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2Z48HS27NLI0W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KPBBTZY#wasThisHelpful","R2Z48HS27NLI0W","A2V2F6WI16B9F8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2V2F6WI16B9F8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Richard F. Selcer, a native of Fort Worth, Texas, loves and is proud of his home town which he writes warmly about in his history, Fort Worth, a Texas Original. Selcer covers Fort Worth’s progression “from military outpost to county seat to trail town, rail hub, regional gateway, oil capital, and ultimately world-class city.”I read each page with interest, while keeping an open map of Fort Worth handy so that I could see where “hell’s half acre” once was, or find Pioneer Cemetery, or see how it was possible that the Trinity River once swallowed the entire first floor of the old Montgomery Ward building (now Montgomery Plaza).Selcer captures the spirit of the city and those who live there. If Texans are proud of their heritage, those from Fort Worth are more so. And the author does a great job of covering such a rich history in so concise a volume.While the importance of Fort Worth’s being the center of the cattle drives, railroads, highways and interstates, and air travel can’t be overstated, Selcer comes close. Like a good teacher, he repeats this theme again and again until we are sure to not forget. And there are a few things he neglects to mention. A survey of the index will not turn up “rodeo” or “Cowtown Coliseum,” both of which have been and still are important parts of Fort Worth’s image and culture. There is also almost no mention of the Fort Worth Stock Show, which brings people from all over the country for nearly a month each year.Amazon lists this book as a new release because it has just been made available as an eBook; however, readers should know that the print version was published in 2004. A lot has happened in Fort Worth during the last decade.Still, I greatly enjoyed reading this little book, learned from it, and certainly recommend it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RXO3KIK15D25Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00I5BDE04#wasThisHelpful","RXO3KIK15D25Z","A2V2F6WI16B9F8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2V2F6WI16B9F8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Scott Welle has put together a good collection of tips for runners, whether they are beginners or advanced. Though I’ve read lots about running, I still found some new and useful information. And it always helps to get someone else’s perspective.Welle takes a balanced look at fitness, nutrition, strength, form, mentality, and other factors that affect performance, recognizing that none of these areas can be ignored if one wants to be a competitive runner.The strength of this book is that it is short and (mostly) straight forward.

"It's been almost two years ago that I mentioned in a review that one of the most popular subjects to write on is biblical manhood. But there's apparently a need for it. Maybe we men are slow learners or need annual reminders--the books keep coming out, and I keep reading them. This is the second book I've read on the subject within the last month.Darren Patrick's ""The Dude's Guide to Manhood"" is a good overall look at what real manliness entails. The author describes the ideal as someone who is balanced:""True manhood takes both the strength to stand up against injustice and the softness to hold our children when they're scared.""Chapters deal with qualities that men should work to develop. Examples are, ""Become a Determined Man,"" "" Become a Coachable Man,"" ""Become a Disciplined Man,"" ""Become a Content Man,"" and ""Become a Devoted Man.""Patrick's emphasis on the importance of fathers being involved with their children is great. Also, I appreciated his chapter on the importance of developing and maintaining friendships, which, he says, men don't take the time to do. I know that he's right, at least in one case.There's good information in this book, but little that hasn't already been said lately. Some has been said so much that it sounds cliché. This book's strength is not in the message, but in the presentation. Patrick writes with a clear, accessible, and interesting style. He is not condescending or preachy, and he doesn't try to sound intellectual. That's what puts this book above many of the others on the same subject.I received a free copy of this book in exchange for an honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2IXZP04FDGIYO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1400205476#wasThisHelpful","R2IXZP04FDGIYO","A2V2F6WI16B9F8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2V2F6WI16B9F8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Mark Matthews says, “To feel higher experiences is why we live. Running, I have found, is the most effective, natural way to find spiritual, emotional, and mental bliss.”Mr. Matthews has plenty experience in seeking “higher experiences.” He writes honestly and humbly about his past alcohol and drug addictions, and how running helped him recover and stay clean for the last 20 years.The author is a successful runner. His times, from a 4:26 mile to a 3:17 marathon, are impressive. But he humbly gives any advice in this book, usually saying something like, “this is what worked for me, but it may not for you.”While there is a lot of practical (and helpful) advice here, the tone is mostly philosophical. Distance running seems to produce philosopher-athletes like Matthews (George Sheehan, for instance, whom Matthews quotes.)Matthews deals with many serious topics, but his style is usually light and funny:“I am a salty sweater, and there are dried white streaks down my cheeks after a long summer run. It’s bizarre to see. At times, deer come out of the woods to lick my face.”I enjoyed reading this book. And, like other good books on running, it made me want to lace up and hit the trail.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2IEBUJUAFL4A4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00E8RDFOE#wasThisHelpful","R2IEBUJUAFL4A4","A2V2F6WI16B9F8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2V2F6WI16B9F8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Gamer is one of the few science fiction books that I've read, so I wasn't sure how interested I would be. I was pleasantly surprised.Two investigative reporters, Louie Huey and Chloe Robertson, investigate claims of the development of a time machine by an unruly University of Wisconsin professor. When Huey is offered a free trip to the past, he takes it. Others are also sent on trips, sometimes against their will.Smith bases this story on true science, so not only is it fascinating, but it also sounds possible. The author makes important points about our world and how our perceptions--even what we believe as fact--are subject to change. Though this is an entertaining book, it is thought provoking and, sometimes, disturbing. Even when I wasn't reading, I couldn't quit thinking about it.Smith's story also explores the moral, ethical, and political consequences of the use of technology (such as time travel). One amusing example is the arrest of the professor who developed the ""time-travel video game"". Though the story takes place in 2035, the professor is arrested by agents from 2075 for breaking a law passed in 2063. Work that one out.Though I really enjoyed this book as is, it could benefit from some minor editing. Also, the dialogue, especially among friends and family members, sounds too formal, despite their use of profanity. But the problems are few, and they didn't take away from my enjoyment of the book.Gamer is the third in a series of science fiction books, following Plagiarized and Possessed. After reading this one, I want to go back and read the first two, and then maybe go forward to read the books that Smith hasn't yet written. If you want something entertaining and thought provoking, I definitely recommend Gamer.About the Author: ""Kim Smith wrote Gamer in 2013, after numerous trips to the future and the past to conduct research for this book.""Disclaimer: I received a free Kindle version of this book from the author with no agreement that I would review it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RAAIP8EGU0998/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EUST5SG#wasThisHelpful","RAAIP8EGU0998","A2V2F6WI16B9F8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2V2F6WI16B9F8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've now read two books written by Mr. Ernst. I've also scanned his website and his other available titles. And despite the title of one of his books, ""Discover the Secrets to Gaining Weight and Building Muscle from a Pro,"" I find no reason to take his advice seriously other than that he has been lifting weights for ten years. Those are his only credentials.In Stop Running, Mr. Ernst does make some important points regarding running and fitness. They can be summed up easily: exercise in moderation, cross-train, eat right, and focus on intensity.But from the beginning, Mr. Ernst writes as though running is dangerous and should be avoided:""In recent times a lot of focus has been placed on excessive running, as a few marathoners have actually collapsed and died.""This has happened. People have also died while sleeping. What do they have in common? Often, an undetected heart condition. But, according to Ernst, it's the running itself that's to be avoided. Running, he says, ""has been having disastrous effects on [runner's] bodies.""""Research and the recent deaths mentioned before, indicate that the spectators of a marathon, may actually be healthier in the long run, than the participants.""The ""extensive"" and ""interesting"" research mentioned by Mr. Ernst is not cited, and some of it sounds suspicious: ""In another interesting and extensive study, researchers kept track of nearly 52000 individuals over a thirty year period.""I'm no expert on research, but it would take a lot of unusually dedicated graduate assistants to track 52,000 people for 30 years.Women runners, says Ernst, should beware, especially if they have a ""weakened pelvic floor,"" which can be caused by ""chronic constipation."" Women who run are in danger of prolapse and other terrifying things which I would be embarrassed to quote. But take it from the author, women should not run long distances.Regarding weight loss, Ernst says that it's a myth that one should eat breakfast in order to be healthy. ""In fact, if you drink water or coffee instead of taking on a full on meal you will not only feel better but you will also lose weight."" If the author is drinking coffee for breakfast, no wonder he has had to write extensively on how difficult it is for a skinny guy to gain weight (see ""5 Commandments for Maximal Muscle for Skinny Guys""). But there's no argument that substituting coffee for meals will cause you to drop the pounds.The reader wonders if Mr. Ernst has ever actually participated in running as opposed to jogging, especially when we read, ""Another issue with running is that it is low intensity cardio."" Some types of running are low intensity compared to other types, but this statement is ridiculous to anyone who has ever competed in a race.""In depth studies of both sprinters and long distance runners legs via the use of ultrasound have shown that sprinters have thicker calves as well as quads."" (This, by the way, is accompanied by a picture of a Carl Lewis type sprinter next to one of the sickest looking marathoners I've seen.) Does it really take ultrasound to make such a determination?I don't recommend this book. It's poorly written and full of bad information.","2.0 out of 5 stars","January 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2HAQ0AZMBY0N2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HG2GTAK#wasThisHelpful","R2HAQ0AZMBY0N2","A2V2F6WI16B9F8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2V2F6WI16B9F8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"""Keeping company with Job, as friend or interpreter, is a worthy activity,"" says Mark Larrimore. In his Book of Job: a Biography, Larrimore traces the history of thought surrounding Job from ancient to modern times. Larrimore's intention is to show why and how we should learn ""to listen to every part of the text, and perhaps also to every serious past attempt to enter the argument"" of this ""unfinalizable"" book.Why does Larrimore call Job ""unfinalizable?"" Because, as even scholars admit, it is difficult, having ""more puzzles than any other book of the Bible.""Larrimore shows that the dialogue and narrative recorded in Job, if taken out of context, can be used to support any theology or idea: ""Job legitimated critics of religion as well as its defenders."" But, when taken as a whole, interpreters have more difficulty. ""The book of Job would never allow itself to be fit into a larger interpretive claim for long; eventually some part of it always pushed against the proffered reading.""That we should approach the text with humility is what I take from this book. ""We would do well to assume that all interpreters of Job come to the story as Job's friends do. We are not Job, and we do not know the mind of God or what goes on in his court."" And we should approach the application of the text with equal humility.  John Calvin believed that the friends of Job were right in what they said about God, but their ""mechanical application of general biblical truth to the case of Job is misguided."" Even though their doctrine was true, their use of it was evil in that they drove their friend closer to despair. We should learn from them how not to help our friends.Larrimore is thorough in his research and, at least to the lay reader, in his arguments and examples. But he does not exhaust the reader; every example or quote serves a purpose. And while the book has plenty to interest scholars and philosophers, it can be read and enjoyed by anyone with an interest in the subjects of interpretation, God, providence, and the ""problem of evil.""Though the book of Job is understood in countless ways depending upon one's theology, context, and culture, it reaches through ages and cultures and ""speaks to and for the broken...it speaks of hope even in the depths of despair...it offers a shared project for sufferers and witnesses, and an outline of a community of care....It is a call to self-vigilance and attention to the experiences of others, even when they call our fondest beliefs into question.""","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 24, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2XHFBNJ359ZU7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EZMGCEM#wasThisHelpful","R2XHFBNJ359ZU7","A2V2F6WI16B9F8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2V2F6WI16B9F8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In Intentional Walk: An Inside Look at the Faith that Drives the St. Louis Cardinals, Rob Rains interviews several members of one of the most successful baseball teams of all time. From team manager to equipment manager, the men highlighted in this book have one thing in common--their Christian faith.In most of the interviews, the theme is how the faith of these men gives them purpose and helps them handle the highs and lows of life. Refreshingly, there are no suggestions that the team wins games because of its Christian players. Instead, the focus is on trusting God and honoring Him in all that we do, regardless of whether we succeed or fail:""I know God cares more about people's souls...."" says Lance Berkman. ""Who wins and loses a baseball game is irrelevant, I think, in terms of the grand scheme.""Rains is a St. Louis Cardinals expert, and he is also a good writer. His book is easy to read, even for people with little knowledge of baseball. And it is usually interesting, but details and repetitiveness slow it down at times.Though major league baseball players are often idolized, in this book the men come through as men--men who struggle with the same life issues that I struggle with.

"After graduating with my bachelor's degree, the reality of four years of student loan debt set in. I didn't enjoy my job, was making little money, and wondered if the time spent at the University was worth it. I remember saying that if I could sell my diploma to pay off my student loans, I would.William J. Bennett and David Wilezol's new book, Is College Worth it? is full of stories like mine (and much worse.) While I finished college with a relatively low amount of debt, it's not uncommon for graduates to owe $100,000 or more. ""Total student-loan debt in the United States has surpassed $1 trillion.""To make it worse, college no longer guarantees a good job--or any job: ""The number of PhDs on food stamps tripled between 2007 and 2010."" And while the cost of college soars, the quality of education declines.So what do the authors say--is it worth it? ""It depends."" Some should definitely go; some, definitely not. ""The most fundamental reform that should be made is abandoning the idea that a four-year college education is the appropriate or even necessary choice for everyone.""Bennett and Wilezol say that whether one should go to college or not depends upon a variety of considerations: the student's ability, their financial situation, their interests, and their goals. If you've worked to earn good grades in high school, you're interested in engineering, and your parents can afford it, then go. If you don't know what you want to do other than meet girls, you should probably consider something else, at least until you mature. If you would rather start a business and you have the ability, why delay?Though the authors point out the flaws with today's higher education system--outrageous costs, low academic standards, political indoctrination by professors--they are not anti-college. Bennett has a PhD from Harvard and was formerly a professor, and Wilezol is a graduate student at Catholic University in Washington D.C. Their message is this: a four-year degree isn't the only pathway to success (just ask Bill Gates). We always need skilled workers and, right now, there's a shortage of them. Remember how much you paid that electrician? Community colleges and the military are also great choices.The authors say that before someone enrolls in an expensive university, they need to consider all of their options. College is a big investment. Like any other purchase, one should first ask, ""Is it worth it?""Disclaimer: I received a complimentary copy of this book in exchange for an honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 4, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1YF949GIBTZNL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1595552790#wasThisHelpful","R1YF949GIBTZNL","A2V2F6WI16B9F8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2V2F6WI16B9F8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The latest in Reformation Trust's Long Line of Godly Men profiles is The Heroic Boldness of Martin Luther by Dr. Steven Lawson.Though Luther was the ""father of the reformation,"" a theologian, a university professor, a writer, a counselor, and many other things, Dr. Lawson says that he was, first and foremost, a preacher. And such is the focus of Dr. Lawson's book: ""Luther's bold biblical preaching.""For readers who want a biography of this ""most significant European figure of the second millennium,"" Dr. Lawson hits the main points in one chapter. But the remaining five chapters deal with Luther's conviction that the Bible is the inspired and infallible word of God, and the effects of that conviction on his ministry--particularly on his preaching.Luther believed that ""a good preacher invests everything in the Word."" And so he did, spending hours reading scriptures in the original languages, wrestling with difficult passages, and even writing a German translation of the New Testament.In preaching, Luther did not part from the teaching of Scripture--it was the introduction, body, and conclusion of each of his thousands of sermons. And because he was convinced that it was truth received directly from God, he was courageous and bold in proclaiming it, even in the face of death.Dr. Lawson's writing is strong and clear, much like his preaching. And his message is clear, especially in his last chapter, ""We Want Again Luthers."" Today, as much as any day, we need preachers who ""have a high view of Scripture, a high view of God, and a high view of the pulpit."" This book is a call to preachers to return to Luther-type preaching.The Heroic Boldness of Luther will be of most interest to preachers, as it deals primarily with preaching and sermons. But it will also encourage the rest of us to turn to our Bibles, dig more deeply into them, and have more courage in proclaiming what we believe.Disclaimer: I received a complimentary copy of this book in exchange for an honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 25, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R131IY2G1G4Q64/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1567693210#wasThisHelpful","R131IY2G1G4Q64","A2V2F6WI16B9F8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2V2F6WI16B9F8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My favorite book of 2010 was Eric Metaxas's Bonhoeffer, so I was eager to read his newest collection of mini-biographies, 7 Men and the Secret of Their Greatness.In his introduction, Metaxas says that boys today have a shortage of good role models. But, good or bad, they will look up to someone. Therefore, we need to introduce them to worthy men who are good and strong examples: ""If we can't point to anyone in history or in our culture whom they [young men] should emulate, then they will emulate whomever.""The seven men Metaxas examines in this book are George Washington, William Wilberforce, Eric Liddell, Dietrich Bonhoeffer, Jackie Robinson, Pope John Paul II, and Charles W. Colson. In each of these short biographies, Metaxas gives an overview of the subject's life with emphasis on those traits that made them great. These are not, however, the same traits that you would find in most books for men aspiring to greatness. Here we find self-control, self-sacrifice, humility, and reliance on God the things to be imitated.Most of these men have been written on extensively, while some not as much. I particularly enjoyed reading about Jackie Robinson and the strength that it took for him to endure both physical and verbal abuse while breaking baseball's ""color barrier."" It was that, rather than his athletic ability, that made him a great man worthy of imitation.In considering Metaxas's selections, I had to wonder about the inclusion of Wilberforce and Bonhoeffer. Fans of the author have already read his extensive biographies of these two men. Perhaps Metaxas hopes that these introductions will lead new readers to the more complete biographies, and I join him in that, as these two subjects are definitely worth knowing and imitating.Metaxas is a biographer who can link the struggles of the past to contemporary issues. He is a Christian who promotes self-sacrifice and love rather than self-righteousness and hypocrisy. And he is a writer who can make his subjects come alive in an inspiring way. For these reasons, 7 Men is a book worth reading.Disclaimer: I received a complimentary copy of this book in exchange for an honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 17, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R4WK75TDKFWWV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1595554696#wasThisHelpful","R4WK75TDKFWWV","A2V2F6WI16B9F8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2V2F6WI16B9F8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"On October 31, 2010, a Syrian Catholic church in Baghdad was attacked by Al-Qaeda. 58 worshippers were killed, including three-year old Adam Udai, who begged the terrorists to stop before he was murdered.According to ""Persecuted, the Global Assault on Christians"" by Paul Marshall, Lela Gilbert, and Nina Shea, ""Christians are the single most widely persecuted religious group in the world today."" And in their book, ""persecuted"" doesn't include being shunned by friends for taking a stand on a moral issue or not being allowed to evangelize your co-workers on office time. ""What we mean by the word persecution in this book is that there are Christians in the counties of focus who are tortured, raped, imprisoned, or killed for their faith.""The authors tell us that ""perhaps four-fifths of the worlds active Christians"" live outside the West. In fact, the majority of Christians live in countries were persecution is very real. ""The average Christian on the planet, if there could be such a one, would likely be a Brazilian or Nigerian woman or a Chinese youth.""""Persecuted"" looks at the conditions for Christians living in Communist countries (such as China), post communist countries (Russia), the Muslim world, and others, giving numerous examples of what fellow believers around the world endure. Those relatively few of us who live free from persecution shouldn't ignore this uncomfortable subject. As Eric Metaxes says in the introduction, ""We in the West desperately need to know about our fellow believers who suffer for their faith.""  If we don't know, then we can't be a voice for those who can't speak for themselves. And besides, our day of persecution may be coming.For readers who are truly concerned for the church at large and desire to have a more global (and therefore more accurate) perspective of Christianity, ""Persecuted"" is a great place to start.I received a free copy of this book in exchange for an honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 3, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R38171KZF2ZCSU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1400204410#wasThisHelpful","R38171KZF2ZCSU","A2V2F6WI16B9F8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2V2F6WI16B9F8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Johnnie Moore, vice president of Liberty University, says that the premise of his new book is that ""God's relationship with people is primarily defined as a relationship of grace, and grace should make us better people and make the world a better place.""In ""Dirty God: Jesus in the Trenches,"" Moore presents Jesus as the revolutionary friend of sinners who makes the religious establishment furious. Moore, like other writers who are targeting the high school and college ages, even makes Jesus out to be cool and rebellious. And Jesus isn't the only one who turns cool: even Elijah is ""talking smack"" before his ""cage match"" with the Baal worshipers. This style might appeal to teens, but older readers could find phrases such as ""Dr. Jesus"" irreverent.Moore, like Bonhoeffer whom he quotes, works to distinguish ""cheap grace"" from true grace. He reminds readers that God's plans are higher than ours, and that He isn't just a kind old man waiting to hand out gifts. Moore's words on the subject are good, but his cheap grace/costly grace contrast is not on the same level as others who wrote extensively on it (Bonhoeffer and John MacArthur, for instance). The others present it as the ultimate question--the difference between false assurance and true salvation. Moore's purpose, however, isn't to question anyone's salvation, but to encourage all professing Christians to live a life of faith and service.Moore says that those who get grace should give grace. Christians should show the world that they are different not by being strange, or staging protests, or withdrawing from society, but by showing love through giving and serving. There's a world full of starving children who need fed, villages that need water, and sick who need care. Those who claim to follow Jesus can't ignore these people; Jesus didn't.Moore's book is like a shortened version of Rich Stearns's ""The Hole in Our Gospel,"" or a softened version of David Platt's ""Radical."" But that doesn't make the book unnecessary.

"In the world of triathlons, Brian Goodyear isn't anyone special. Actually, he says, he is quite mediocre. But that didn't stop him from writing a book that any endurance athlete will find helpful and enjoyable.In The Relentless Pursuit of Mediocrity, Goodyear says that most athletes should accept their lack of greatness, even celebrate it. And with a lot of hard work and dedication, one might, at times, transcend it. Goodyear calls these times ""black swan"" events.Transcending mediocrity doesn't mean an Olympic gold medal; it doesn't necessarily mean an age group medal. Goodyear's ""black swan"" was qualifying for and completing the Iron Man World Championship in Kona, Hawaii. For others, it may be finishing a 5K. Regardless, ""If you know that you have indeed given it your best shot, then you have, without a doubt, done something extraordinary.""Goodyear divides his book into three parts: a discussion of mediocrity, his own story, and advice on training for a triathlon. The memoir is by far the longest section. Reading Goodyear's own progression from an AARP sprint triathlon to the full Iron Man serves as an interesting and fairly complete ""how-to"" by itself. Readers get a first-hand account of what it takes to train for such an event, along with the setbacks one might encounter in training. One of the author's, for instance, was a bike wreck that resulted in ""a broken clavicle, ribs broken in five places, and a punctured left lung.""Most of us can relate to Goodyear's mediocrity. There are some areas, at least for this reviewer, where it is hard to relate. While Goodyear trains year-round in the clear water and beautiful mountains of Hawaii, others of us train in muddy, half-dry lakes and on littered interstate access roads. To his credit, Goodyear expresses appreciation for his privileges more than once, and it's nice for the rest of us to at least imagine training while watching sea turtles swim through the coral reefs below.Goodyear's story is generally quick moving, but can get repetitive; reading the specifics of training for one event after another becomes an exercise in endurance itself. But that endurance pays off.The Relentless Pursuit is inspiring; the author has an obvious passion for encouraging others. One of his goals in writing this book was to give us the thought, ""If this guy can do it, I can do it too."" And he accomplishes that. We are left believing that if we ""train with passion"" in our relentless pursuit of mediocrity, we might, on occasion, achieve the extraordinary.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 23, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2UEIOK84L8Y92/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0615599761#wasThisHelpful","R2UEIOK84L8Y92","A2V2F6WI16B9F8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2V2F6WI16B9F8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The point of Beautiful Soccer is that teaching basic skills to young players is more important than winning games. It's a good idea, and one that most would agree with, but one that many coaches and parents forget.The authors, Ryan Marquez and Doug Werner, advocate mastering basic skills through repetition and hard work in a safe atmosphere where neither coaches nor parents yell. Young players should be encouraged to try new things, to be creative on the field, ""artists on the ball.""The message of this book is important; we are, after all, dealing with children. And the authors give us some great things to think about and keep in mind. But the book is sometimes hard to follow. The text comes from a series of presumably spoken interviews which sound awkward and rambling when printed. There's also a lot of technical talk that's hard for some of us to understand:""My forwards look for a pattern that goes high, they drop it low and then they switch the point of attack to the outside forward, making a run in. So it's very tuck-tuck-boom, but it's very controlled and not ugly soccer.""As a beginning coach, I hoped for specifics on what to teach, but this book is more about a philosophy of soccer. Still, it does have hundreds of pictures of good drills, and I do feel more prepared and excited for the soccer season to begin now that I've read it.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 3, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2GYVD902D94EN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=193593743X#wasThisHelpful","R2GYVD902D94EN","A2V2F6WI16B9F8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2V2F6WI16B9F8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"In Run Simple, A Minimalist Approach to Fitness and Well Being, Duncan Larkin says that American runners needlessly complicate running, which should be the simplest of sports. Instead of being content with the essentials--a road, shorts, shirt, and (for some) shoes, we think we need to buy hundreds of dollars worth of gadgets, specialty clothes, and food cooked in a lab.Larkin says that this extra stuff doesn't help, but distracts, even hurts, and can take the joy out of running. And it sure doesn't make us faster:""If you want to run faster, you have to realize that you only need a few things: your legs, lungs, heart, and a positive attitude.""Besides telling readers why and how to simplify running and save money, Larkin gives lots of other helpful information: training plans, racing strategies, mental tips, and even a Kenyan recipe for a dish to fuel runners. Larkin is someone to listen to; he has lots of marathons behind him, including a 2:32. But he also quotes and interviews several elite runners to strengthen his arguments.Run Simple is helpful, enjoyable, and, best of all, makes me want to strip off the gadgets and hit the trails.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 1, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R48ECD8FEZQNM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1594161623#wasThisHelpful","R48ECD8FEZQNM","A2V2F6WI16B9F8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2V2F6WI16B9F8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Dr. William J. Bennett's Book of Virtues is a favorite in our house. At dinner time, bath time, or bed time, the children ask me to read a story or poem from ""the big book,"" as they call it. And I'm always willing to; Bennett's Book of Virtues has as much to offer the parents as it does the children. I expected the Book of Man to be like the Book of Virtues, only for little boys. But the readings are more for older boys or men. Still, the subtitle, ""Readings on the Path to Manhood,"" is appropriate. After all, what man doesn't continue on the path to manhood? Bennett asks: ""What does it mean to be a man today?...While the plot, actors, and scenes are constantly changing, the virtues, characteristics, and challenges of manhood remain the same today as thousands of years ago."" On how to be a man, Bennett says, ""More can and should be said. That is what I offer here. There are examples worthy of emulation, stories worth knowing, lives worth studying and remembering, and counsel worth hearing..."" Bennett's quotes span the time from Pericles to Colin Powell, while the characters range from Robert Murray M'Cheyne to Jimmy Carter. Stories about men like Theodore Roosevelt or Martin Luther King Jr. are always inspiring, and Bennett gives us plenty. But equally inspiring are the stories of men like Terry Toussaint, Fort Valley, Georgia's ""proud sanitation worker."" Toussaint was inspired by Martin Luther King's speech to a crowd of street sweepers in Memphis, TN: ""If it falls your lot to be a street sweeper, sweep streets like Michelangelo painted pictures....sweep streets so well that all the host of heaven and earth will have to pause and say, `Here lived a great street sweeper...'"" ""For Toussaint, it's all part of the day's job. At fifty years old, he starts every day at 4:45 A.M. and never misses a day of work."" ""I'll always be the best that I can be at [whatever job I have],"" says Toussaint. Bennett examines manhood in every arena: Man in War; Man at Work; Man in Play, Sports, and Leisure; Man in the Polis (community); Man with Woman and Children (this section alone is worth the price of the book); and Man in Prayer and Reflection. Not all of the selections are inspiring, nor do they all represent the best in man: ""Marines are a different breed; we're made to go after people. If you're not killing someone or being killed, you're not happy."" But, as Bennett says, there is something to be learned from each of them. While my little boy isn't ready for this book, I look forward to our reading it together when he's older. I hope these selections will benefit, encourage, and inspire him as they do me. In the meantime, I'll continue to use this excellent book to help me down my own path to manhood.

"No mortal can exhaust the truths in the Bible. Or even, it seems, in one verse of the Bible. But that didn't stop D. Martyn Lloyd-Jones from trying. It shouldn't surprise anyone that the man whose sermons on Ephesians fill eight volumes, whose sermons on Romans fill fourteen volumes, and who could preach for an hour on the text, ""But God,"" (Ephesians 2:4) preached thirty-two sermons almost exclusively from 3 verses.Lloyd-Jones began preaching from John's Gospel in October of 1962. Even though this series was only ""to occupy him at intervals,"" it is still remarkable that he was but in the ""early chapters"" when he retired from Westminster Chapel, London, in 1968.This newest volume of Lloyd-Jones' sermons, titled Born of God, consists of ten sermons from John 1:17, eighteen sermons from John 1:12-13, and four others from neighboring verses.In this series, unlike in many of his others, Lloyd-Jones did not set out to go verse by verse through a book, or portion, of the Bible:""I propose, God willing, not to give a detailed, consecutive exposition of John's Gospel, but rather to pick out the application of the teaching to the state and condition of the Christian in this world.""He primarily applies the texts in two ways: by warning presumptuous professors to examine themselves, while encouraging true Christians to grow in assurance.Lloyd-Jones says that it is every Christian's duty to be joyful: ""Without the joy there will not be much strength and without strength we shall fail in our representation of our Lord and Master and all that he stands for."" But, for this joy to be full, a Christian has to understand what Christ has done for them. And for that, they have to understand their plight without him. This, Lloyd-Jones says, is the right use of the law:""Those who dismiss the law will never know much about grace....If I have preached the law in such a way as to make somebody say, `I'm completely and entirely hopeless and unless I can be saved by someone outside myself, I'm done for,' then I have preached it properly.""Yet he balances this by warning against falling back under the law. The doctrines of grace are essential to keeping believers from legalism, while the law is needed to prevent antinomianism. An understanding of both is needed in order to have true assurance and joy.So that those with false assurance might be warned, while true Christians would grow in assurance, Lloyd-Jones gives numerous tests for people to examine themselves by. These tests fall under several divisions, including one's relationship to the Son, to the Father, to the Holy Spirit, to the Church, and even to the devil. Most of these have to do with sanctification because, as Lloyd-Jones says, those born of God will be changed:""When we are born, `not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God,' something happens to us. We have a new nature; we are given a new life. That must show itself....""For example, Lloyd Jones says that the Holy Spirit works in believers by giving them a desire for holiness:""He causes us to examine ourselves and he creates within us breathings and longings and a hungering and thirsting after righteousness...a very good test is this: If you are more concerned about being holy than you are about being happy, then you are a Christian beyond any doubt....But if you are more concerned about being happy than being holy, there is doubt.""Reading this book is thought provoking and edifying. The sermons are easy to follow, yet deep enough to satisfy a theologian. And Lloyd-Jones deals out both conviction and comfort, just as he meant to:""My dear friends, have I strengthened you? Have I given you assurance that you are a child of God? God grant that I have! But if I have not, if I have disturbed you, if I have made you feel that you are not a Christian--then do something about it. Go to Him, acknowledge and confess it.""I received a complimentary copy of this book from Banner of Truth Trust.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 27, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3N01ZYIKD6WJC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1848711255#wasThisHelpful","R3N01ZYIKD6WJC","A2V2F6WI16B9F8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2V2F6WI16B9F8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In A Guide to Biblical Manhood, Randy Stinson and Dan Dumas say that men need to act like men. ""We need men who aren't pre-occupied with their amusements or appearance, but instead are willing and able to take on manly challenges."" These manly challenges primarily have to do with leadership, provision, and protection.The authors apply biblical examples to men's roles within the workplace, home, and church. While I have some small disagreements, the overall message is sound, and the advice is helpful. I particularly enjoyed the sections titled, ""Twenty Five Things a Dad Should Teach a Boy"" and ""Eleven Connecting Points between Baseball, Biblical Masculinity and Godly Character.""The overall theme of this book is that true manhood is about humility and self-sacrifice; we can't be reminded of that enough. But it has been said a lot lately. Biblical manhood and womanhood top the popularity charts among reformed writers. Anything that can be said has been, many times and many ways. This book offers nothing new, nothing that isn't already said in many other books like Richard Phillips' The Masculine Mandate.

"An unsolicited package from Thomas Nelson lay on my desk. Since I had decided to take a break from reading and reviewing new books, and this was the second to arrive within a week, I considered sending it back unopened. I'm glad that I didn't.Carolyn Weber tells how she arrived at Oxford on a scholarship that she worked excessively hard for. She was there to pursue a graduate degree and education. She left with those and infinitely more.Weber's honesty is refreshing. She was certainly not seeking Jesus, or even God. As a young, independent, intelligent academic, she didn't want ""Christian"" on her resume, and she fought against the gospel, slinging her arguments ""like arrows of outrageous fortune."" But her arguments turned to thoughtful questions, and her defenses began to fall as she realized that there was something great missing from her life. ""Caro,"" a friend of hers said, ""I can see the conversion happening on your face....I can hear it in your multilevel homesickness.""Weber's conversion was no half-hearted decision. For months she privately read the Bible, and for months she asked tough questions. These questions take her, and the reader, into deep theological territory. Yet it's always with a fresh and personal perspective; accessible and enjoyable. And the gospel pours from the pages of this book. Weber makes us hungry to dig into the New Testament with the zeal of a new believer.Weber's writing is free from pious jargon; she undercuts her own praise of clichés by rarely using them.  The author avoids both the superficiality and the pseudo-intellectualism that Christian writers are often guilty of. Hers is exactly the kind of writing that I want to read. And her story is exactly the kind I needed to hear. Alister McGrath describes it perfectly: ""A hugely readable journey of cultural and spiritual discovery, sparkling with wit and wisdom.""

"I should start with an apology for this review. It seems as though reviewers of Christian books feel obligated to give a positive review unless the book contains heresy, or a lack of what the reviewer considers a sufficient dose of the gospel. To that I can't submit. Those are important. But it is also the reviewer's job to tell the reader if the book will be worth their time. Is it readable? Does it tell us anything? Does it inspire? If not, it's not worth the money.Peter Barnes says nothing heretical--nothing, even, that I disagree with. I had hoped, expected, to love this book, considering the subject, and to sing its praise. To that end, I can say three things. Barnes has done his research, and his book makes us want to read Calvin. Also, for someone who knows nothing about John Calvin's view of Scripture, this may be a fair introduction. But the book sounds like a seminary research paper, and is as dry.Barnes has nothing new to say. In fact, Barnes himself says very little. He takes the reformed writer's obsession with quotes to a new extreme. Regarding how Calvin structured his sermons, for instance, Barnes throws out 6 quotes, and then picks the one he thinks best. Here's the contents of a typical page:""Dawn DeVries writes....Andrew Blackwood suggests....Not for nothing does William Bouwsma describe....Herman Selderhuis perhaps exaggerates....T.H.L. Parker waxes eloquent....Randall Zachman begs to differ....,"" (pages 48-49).Barnes strives to point out flaws in Calvin's preaching or writing, as if we should be astonished that the man from Geneva was human. Calvin's sermon breaks, for instance, were sometimes ""unnatural,"" or even ""somewhat disconcerting."" Barnes spends a few pages describing the abruptness of Calvin's sermon endings. In one sermon, Barnes tells us, Calvin ""breaks off quite suddenly...He then launched into the prayer after the sermon!""""Nor was his exegesis always entirely convincing.""The reader may fairly ask: Whose exegesis is ""always entirely convincing?""Barnes amazes us with such insights into Calvin as his belief that ""The preacher is called upon to be faithful to God before he is sensitive to the seeker,"" or, ""Calvin held to what today would be called `intelligent design.'""""Calvin almost never told anecdotes in the pulpit,"" nor does Barnes in his book. It is almost entirely free of narrative or warmth.Barnes mentions Calvin's polished writing and speaking. Unfortunately, the simplicity and brevity of Calvin's style has not rubbed off:""One ought not be beguiled into thinking that the Lord's supper with its celebration of the once for all perfect sacrifice of Christ is anything like the Mass where, supposedly, Christ is repeatedly sacrificed,"" (page 70).This style, along with the content, makes Mr. Barnes' John Calvin unsuitable for the lay person. The shortness of the book and lack of anything new makes it useless to the scholar.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 25, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/RXVZWV4YHXZPQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1848711212#wasThisHelpful","RXVZWV4YHXZPQ","A2V2F6WI16B9F8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2V2F6WI16B9F8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""Servant of the Word and Flock"" is an apt subtitle for Iain Murray's new biography of John MacArthur. The book leaves us convinced that no ministry is as important to MacArthur as serving his church by teaching and preaching God's word. Murray points out that the one stipulation Dr. MacArthur made when accepting the call to Grace Community Church ""was that he be allowed thirty hours a week for study.""""Surely one of the greatest strengths of MacArthur's preaching ministry is his complete confidence in the text,"" Murray writes. MacArthur would take this as a compliment. ""When I started ministry,"" he says, ""I committed myself to expository preaching, just explaining the Bible, because I know that there was nothing I could say that was anywhere near as important as what God had to say.""Though MacArthur has served Grace Community Church for over forty years, and attendance is in the thousands, if all that he did was preach, most of us wouldn't know his name. But that's not the case; MacArthur writes more books than most Christians read. Murray gives ample attention to these as well as the controversy that sometimes follows (as in the case of The Gospel According to Jesus, which sparked the so-called Lordship Controversy). Because these books, including MacArthur's Study Bible and New Testament Commentaries, are translated in dozens of languages and shipped over the world, often at no cost to the recipient, MacArthur ministers to millions whom he has never met. That doesn't count those who listen to his sermons, free of charge, compliments of Grace to You.Murray's book concentrates more on MacArthur's work than on the man himself. Still, we read about MacArthur's past, his childhood, and how he was shaped by his father and grandfather. We read of his humility--when the only rental car available was a Cadillac, he chose to walk the last several blocks to his appointment so as not to send the wrong message. We read about his love for others, especially his family: ""The family is the one environment where your devotion, faithfulness, and consistency matter most,"" wrote MacArthur. Murray even dedicates an entire chapter to MacArthur's wife, Patricia, of whom MacArthur wrote: ""For every grief I ever caused her, she has given me a thousand blessings in return."" Murray shows that, as one of MacArthur's friends said, ""His greatest sermon is his life.""While Murray's appreciation for his subject is obvious, the book is by no means an exercise in hero worship. Murray addresses MacArthur's failures and sometimes disagrees with his beliefs. One preacher from Brazil speaks for many when he wonders how MacArthur can be ""soteriologically reformed and dispensational at the same time."" Though Murray doesn't dwell long on his disagreement with MacArthur's views regarding the end times, he does state them, and he observes that a literal interpretation of Old Testament prophecy is inconsistent with the way the New Testament writers often interpreted Scripture.Murray tells us twice that these 240 pages are ""little more than a sketch; this is not the time, nor I the writer, to give a full portrait."" While it may not end up being the most complete biography, it is hard to imagine that there will be one as well-written and interesting. We do, however, have reason to agree that ""this is not the time."" Though MacArthur turns 72 on the nineteenth day of this month (June 2011), he has no plans to retire:""As the Lord permits, I hope to continue teaching God's word and shepherding His flock until the day I go to be with Him.""I received a complimentary copy of this book from Banner of Truth in exchange for an honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 10, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2379BN5K0L5T9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1848711123#wasThisHelpful","R2379BN5K0L5T9","A2V2F6WI16B9F8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2V2F6WI16B9F8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In the forward to Give Them Grace by Elyse M. Fitzpatrick and Jessica Thompson, Tullian Tchividjian says it's ""the best parenting book [he's] ever read, because it takes the radical, untamable, outrageous nature of the gospel seriously and applies it to parenting."" And the authors do take the gospel seriously. The difference between their book and other Christian parenting books, they say, is that theirs emphasizes grace rather than law:""Most of us are painfully aware that we're not perfect parents. We're also deeply grieved that we don't have perfect kids. But the remedy to our mutual imperfection isn't more law, even if it seems to produce tidy or polite children.""These two experienced mothers don't pretend that they are perfect, that their children are perfect, or that they have the secret key to perfection. They don't give readers a formula for parenting; there are no ""three steps,"" or even specified rod dimensions (though they do say that an open hand is okay, regardless of what other parenting books have said). Instead, they remind us that it is God, and not parents, who determines a child's destiny in this life and the next, and that we need His grace as much as our children do. They also give lots of encouragement to weary, imperfect parents:""[God] doesn't treat his dear children as `disappointments' whose disobedience and failures take him by surprise or shock him. He does not suspend his love until they get their acts back together. He already knows the worst about you (in yourself) and loves and approves you nonetheless (in Christ).""If applying the gospel can be overdone, these authors do it proudly: ""We've encouraged you to dazzle [your children] with the message of Christ's love and welcome, and then when you think that surely they must be tiring of it, go back and drench them with it again.""The only problem with this is that when we apply the gospel to every event in life, and especially when we use it to correct, children will tire of it.  Not every moment needs to be a ""teachable moment."" Do we need to bring up Jesus' agony on the cross every time our child acts like a child?The authors give an example of how we might apply the gospel to a child who pouts after losing a baseball game: ""Yes, losing is difficult....Jesus Christ understands losing because he lost relationship with his father on the cross....He's using this suffering in your life to make us both look up and see his love.""Besides the superficial view of suffering in the above quote, this loose way of applying the gospel, especially when often repeated, takes the power out of the message and can weary the children. Something sadder than a child growing up never hearing the good news is a child who grows up hoping to never hear it again.Besides overdoing the application of the gospel, the authors are also guilty, like the authors of many of our Christian books and blogs, of overwriting. Some of their words have become so popular (peruse, enjoin, facets, eventuate), that I expect to see them in half the Christian books I read, though I've never heard them in real conversation. Add a few phrases like, ""radical message of grace,"" ""soul-satisfying repast of grace,"" and ""construct a methodology,"" with extra doses of drama and intellectualisms, and an over-all good message becomes unpalatable to readers who prefer a simpler style.Still, the most important things to be said about this book are that it leaves room for failure, emphasizes the superiority of the gospel over the law, and is primarily about imperfect parents glorifying a perfect God (rather than themselves or their children). These things put Give Them Grace above many other Christian parenting books.I received a complimentary copy of this book from Crossway in exchange for an honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 27, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/RV5GQE8B1V7PJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1433520095#wasThisHelpful","RV5GQE8B1V7PJ","A2V2F6WI16B9F8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2V2F6WI16B9F8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In an address given in Edinburgh in 1960, Martyn Lloyd-Jones said that ""perhaps the greatest of all the lessons of the Protestant Reformation is that the way of recovery is always to go back, back to the primitive pattern, to the origin, to the norm and standard which are to be found alone in the New Testament."" That the speaker was guided by faithfulness to ""the norm and standard"" found in the New Testament is evident in his writings, which is why I love reading him and am delighted that his work is still published years after his death.Lloyd-Jones's biographer, Iain H. Murray, is another advocate of looking back, and is another whose writings I can't resist.  With the Banner of Truth's recent release of John Knox and the Reformation, I had the privilege to read both men in one book.This short but valuable title consists of three chapters. ""Remembering the Reformation"" and ""John Knox: the Founder of Puritanism"" were addresses that Lloyd-Jones gave in 1960 to commemorate the 400th anniversary of the Reformation in Scotland. The third chapter is Iain Murray's ""John Knox and `The Battle',"" which is a biographical sketch of Knox that concentrates on his efforts to reform the church in Scotland.John Knox and the Reformation is published for the 500th anniversary of the birth of Knox (2014), but not out of a ""purely antiquarian or historical motive."" As Lloyd-Jones says, ""the times in which we are living are too urgent and too desperate for us to indulge a mere antiquarian spirit."" Rather, ""we look at these men in order that we may learn from them, and imitate and emulate their example."" He supports his view with Hebrews 13:7: ""Remember your leaders, those who spoke to you the word of God. Consider the outcome of their way of life, and imitate their faith.""Though Knox was, and still is, an object of controversy, there's no denying that God used him greatly. Murray writes: ""The only true explanation of Knox's preaching is in words he applied to others of his fellow countrymen, `God gave his Holy Spirit to simple men in great abundance.'"" Of a sermon that Knox preached to discouraged Protestant forces after beaten by the French, one man said that, ""The voice of one man is able in one hour to put more life in us than five hundred trumpets continually blustering in our ears.""But again, the aim of this book isn't to teach us about Knox, but to help us to learn from Knox. Lloyd-Jones and Murray each spell out the lessons that we can glean and apply to our day, and we would be wise to take heed.When I asked what I should read for spiritual growth, a pastor and mentor told me that other than the Bible, he benefitted most from the biographies of great Christians. I've found this to be true for myself, and especially true of Iain Murray's works. John Knox and the Reformation is no exception.I received a complimentary copy of this book from The Banner of Truth Trust in exchange for an honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 13, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2SNEO869T13B8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=184871114X#wasThisHelpful","R2SNEO869T13B8","A2V2F6WI16B9F8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2V2F6WI16B9F8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Students of Charles Spurgeon know that he loved the Puritans. He poured over volumes of their books until their words poured out of him. One of his favorite Puritan authors was the 17th century Independent pastor Thomas Brooks. ""Had Brooks been a worldly man,"" writes Spurgeon, ""his writings would have been most valuable; but since he was an eminent Christian, they are doubly so.""Smooth Stones is Spurgeon's collection of ""sentences, illustrations, and quaint sayings"" gleaned from Brooks' six volume Works. It was first published in 1855, but is now Banner of Truth Trust's latest in the Puritan Paperbacks series.Like the author of the book of Proverbs, Brooks repeats the same themes in a variety of ways, and always with a different twist. ""He saw similes, metaphors, and allegories everywhere; but they were all consecrated to his Master's service:""""Were riches ever true to them that trusted them? As the bird hops from twig to twig, so do riches hop from man to man.""Readers will find plenty in Brooks' writings to convict, humble, and warn them: ""But as for such as cannot spare time to seek God in secret, they sufficiently manifest that they have little friendship or fellowship with Him to whom they so seldom come."" Or, ""Open profaneness is the broad road that leads to hell, but closet duties rested in, is a sure though cleaner path.""But Brooks doesn't just shoot his arrows and leave readers in despair; there is something comforting or encouraging on every page. And whether convicting or comforting, Christ is always foremost: ""Christ is the sun, and all the watches of our lives should be set by the dial of his motion.""This excellent edition could be improved with more careful editing. We are told that, ""The wick of a candle is little worth, and yet less where it smokes, yielding neither light nor heat, but father offends with an ill smell, which man cannot bear,"" (page 36). And we don't know whether to despair or rejoice when we read that the Lord says, ""I will never have thee nor forsake thee,"" (page 14). Such are the fruits of relying on technology. These errors don't abound, but they do detract from the overall quality.There is a disadvantage to reading quotes that are removed from the larger context. Readers may, in places, see the appearance of contraction, at least on the surface. But Smooth Stones is excellent for devotional reading, and is also a good introduction to the vast writings of Thomas Brooks. Over the last several mornings it has moved me to pray, increased my appetite for the Scriptures, and given me something to think about throughout the day.I received a complimentary copy of this book from Banner of Truth Trust in exchange for an honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 20, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2D23RUO9D0OZ8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1848711131#wasThisHelpful","R2D23RUO9D0OZ8","A2V2F6WI16B9F8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2V2F6WI16B9F8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"While Padraig the dragon searches for his favorite treat, ""crunchy, squishy, nutty bugs,"" he finds a ""grumpy-faced"" Roger the turtle instead. Why so grumpy? Because Roger is lost. Lucky for him, Padraig has wings. Although Padraig is hungry and would rather spend his day snacking, he cheerfully spends it helping Roger find home.This story is well-written and fun, though it begins to drag after so many failed attempts to find Roger's house. But this gives Padraig (and readers) an opportunity to exercise patience. The book teaches several other good lessons which are summarized at the end. An extra bonus is a recipe for Chocolate Chip Snappers--Roger's favorite cookies. As for Padraig's favorite snacks, they can be found under a rock in the back yard. The detailed and enjoyable illustrations by Vincent Nguyen certainly add to the book.Between the good lessons, the great illustrations, and the Chocolate Chip Snappers, both parents and children will be pleased with The Dragon and the Turtle.I received this book for free from WaterBrook Multnomah Publishing Group for this review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 17, 2010","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQIZXYSTE3IMC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0307446441#wasThisHelpful","RQIZXYSTE3IMC","A2V2F6WI16B9F8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2V2F6WI16B9F8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There are still a few pastors and Bible teachers who give the Word of God its proper place; a few who believe that, through the Word, we can know truth about God, Jesus, and salvation; and a few who are willing to fearlessly defend the Word and the truth that it conveys. Of these few, there are perhaps none more fearless or faithful in the teaching and defending of the Gospel than John MacArthur.The release of John MacArthur's new book, Slave: the Hidden Truth about Your Identity in Christ, interested me for several reasons. First, whether we agree with him or not on every point of doctrine, anything that MacArthur writes is worth consideration. Second, his writings on the Lordship of Christ, specifically The Gospel According to the Apostles, have had a big influence on me. And last, I've heard him speak on the word ""slave,"" which is the proper translation of the Greek word duolos. Unfortunately, he says, most of our English translations use the words ""servant"" or ""bond-servant"" instead. While servant is a good word, it doesn't carry the full meaning of the word ""slave."" MacArthur's comments interested me, so I was eager to read more on the subject.MacArthur says that duolos is used in the Greek New Testament 124 times, usually in describing the believer's relationship to Christ: ""Paul, a bond-servant [duolos] of Christ Jesus, called as an apostle, set apart for the gospel of God..."" (Romans 1:1, NASB). At the same time, the Greek word kyrios, translated as ""master,"" is often used for Christ. In first century Rome, where the slave/master relationship was well known, there was no avoiding what these terms signified.Not only do most of the New Testament writers describe themselves and other believers as slaves of Christ, but Jesus, through his choice of words and his parables, uses slavery to illustrate a believer's relationship to Himself and God. MacArthur fully explores how believers are slaves to Christ. His arguments, as usual, are strictly based upon Scripture, which this book is full of:""Do you not know...that you are not your own? For you have been bought with a price: therefore glorify God in your body"" (1 Cor. 6:19-20).What does this mean in the life of a believer? MacArthur says that, ""As those who confess the Lordship of Christ, believers are duty bound to obey Him in everything."" But, since believers have a good and perfect master, it also means that they will have all of their needs met. It is comforting to be the slave of such a great master. It is also an honor:""...If it was considered an honor to be the slave of one of the Caesars, it is infinitely more so to be the slave of Christ--the King of kings and Lord of lords! Is it any wonder that the New Testament writers eagerly attributed the title `slave of Christ' to themselves and others? It was not only an affirmation of their complete submission to the Master; it was also a declaration of the privileged position every Christian enjoys by being associated with the Lord. No affiliation could be greater than that.""MacArthur reminds believers that they are slaves to Christ because they have been redeemed from their old master sin, that ""cruel tyrant."" All are born in bondage to sin, but God redeems His own people, those who were ""purchased with [Christ's] own blood"" (Acts 10:28).MacArthur goes on to say that, ""we are not just the slaves of God. We are also His citizens, friends, and family members."" From that point he explores the theme of adoption and all that it means to be a member of God's family.Subjects like the bondage of sin, redemption, and adoption lead MacArthur to dwell long on the doctrines of grace (total depravity, election, particular redemption, irresistible grace, and the perseverance of the saints.) His discussion of these difficult and controversial doctrines is thorough, balanced, and convincing, ties in perfectly with the overall theme of the book, and makes a great introduction for those who aren't familiar with reformation theology. And, since Thomas Nelson is the publisher, I'm confident that this book will reach many who aren't familiar with these doctrines, or at least who aren't convinced.In this new book, MacArthur, the untiring foe of ""easy believism,"" presents a very un-watered down version of the Gospel. Believers should remember that they are not just saved by grace, but ""slaved by grace"": ""Freedom in Christ...is not freedom to sin but freedom from sin--freedom to live as God intends, in truth and holiness."" In these times of what Bonhoeffer called ""cheap grace,"" times when few live as though Jesus is truly their Lord, we need men like John MacArthur who, like Spurgeon in a previous century, will preach the truth even if all of earth and hell stand against him. I hope that this book is widely read. It deserves and needs to be.I received a complimentary review copy of this book from Thomas Nelson.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 12, 2010","http://www.amazon.com/review/R24K9YX9PFIEK0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1400202078#wasThisHelpful","R24K9YX9PFIEK0","A2V2F6WI16B9F8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2V2F6WI16B9F8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In his philosophical new book, The Gospel and the Mind, Bradley G. Green argues two theses: ""The Christian vision of God, man, and the world provides the necessary precondition for the recovery of any meaningful intellectual life,"" and, ""The Christian vision of God, man, and the world offers a particular, unique understanding of what the intellectual life might look like."" Green says that our thinking, without Christ and the cross, is clouded by sin. Without a telos, or goal (Christian eschatology, for instance), there is no meaning to knowledge or education. ""True education requires an animating and inspiring vision, which is the very thing the gospel provides, and which is the very thing missing in most construals of education today."" Without a belief in creation, or a Sovereign Creator, there is no proper understanding of history or life. Even language becomes meaningless without belief in a created order and ultimate Truth. When our minds are separated from the gospel, we are intellectuals and philosophers with our heads in the clouds, not knowing where we're going or where we've been: ""Knowledge is difficult, if not impossible, for the person whose will is misdirected, or for the person who is not led by Christ, who is the truth...Indeed it is the gospel that is at the heart of a genuine understanding and the true intellectual life, which has its own ultimate end in seeing God face-to-face.""  Green calls his book an apologia. Therefore he writes to, and works to convince, both believers and non. Christians will find his arguments strong, and his quotes compelling. But will non-Christians? Green realizes that quotes from Christian thinkers, whether church fathers or not, or great minds or not, don't often persuade the unbelieving audience. So he quotes Nietzsche and Einstein along with Augustine and Aquinas: ""The belief in an external world independent of the perceiving subject is the basis of all natural science,"" (Albert Einstein). Green writes with great clarity. I enjoyed his book and am challenged and encouraged by it. But I have one complaint which, though minor, and a matter of opinion, I will dwell on for a moment. Green stacks quotes one upon another with a vengeance. Pages pass without us hearing much more from him than, ""He goes on further to say,"" or, ""Consider, as well, what Augustine said."" And, as is often the case with prolific quoters, the author's own voice is usually more clear and convincing than those he quotes. Certainly he has enough credibility to tell us that the ""memory is a precious resource,"" without quoting A.G. Sertillanges. After all, we did choose to read his book. The Gospel and the Mind challenges readers to think deeply about important issues. Green's message--that true knowledge is possible because the universe was created by an orderly God, and that knowledge is meaningful because it leads to and culminates in a loving God, is both encouraging and liberating. Like sin, the modern belief that there is no true knowledge or meaning outside of one's self promises liberty but leads to despair. Green reminds us that true knowledge is possible, and so we are liberated, even morally obligated, to seek it.I received a complimentary review copy of this book from Crossway.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 8, 2010","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3G6JMULZHPRI6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1433514427#wasThisHelpful","R3G6JMULZHPRI6","A2V2F6WI16B9F8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2V2F6WI16B9F8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"God Gave us so Much combines three books in one: God Gave us the World, God Gave us Love, and God Gave us Heaven. In each, Little Cub learns about God as she asks questions of Mama, Grandpa, and Papa.Of the good that can be said about this book, Laura Bryant's artwork is at the top. Her illustrations are full of color and detail, holding even the youngest child's attention. Who can resist polar bears fishing off the snowy banks of a mountain stream while otters turn flips into the water? I asked my six-year-old, an expert in children's literature, if she liked the pictures. ""I love the pictures,"" she answered.Lisa Tawn Bergren teaches important lessons throughout the book. God wants us to show everyone his love--even the irritating otters, for instance. But the text doesn't live up to the illustrations. There may be no rule that children's books need a plot; many of Dr. Seuss's books do not. But a plot would help here. Instead of a story, children are faced with continuous dialogue, a dialogue in which, if it isn't for Little Cub's use of junior high grammar, it is often hard to know who said what:""Will we be angels?""""No. Only angels are angels. God made us polar bears for a reason.""""Shoot. I wanted to fly.""As cute as she is, even the most loving of readers tire of Little Cub before the end of the book. Besides her use of ""shoot,"" ""whoa"" (or ""whoa, whoa, whoa""), ""`em,"" ""ole,"" and ""`cept,"" she asks too many questions--twenty-one in the last book alone. We want our children to ask questions, and of course they do. But our children climbed out of my lap long before Little Cub was finished asking hers.""So,"" I again asked my expert, ""Did you like the words?"" ""Not so much,"" she answered. ""There's too much talk and no story.""Despite the criticism, this book would make a nice gift, and it certainly opens the way for early discussions about God.

"I found Frederick Buechner's Now & Then: A Memoir of Vocation at the local museum book sale. It was stowed under a table, in a cardboard box, underneath Bonhoeffer's Discipleship, which I eagerly snatched. Buechner sounded familiar; other than that, I'm not sure why I took his book, but I'm glad I did.William Zinsser said that he could read anyone's story if it was written with ""warmth and humanity."" Now & Then certainly is. Buechner writes simply, yet beautifully. I had intended, one morning, to just look around in it and see what it was about, but then I couldn't stop.Buechner briefly remembers three phases of his life, concentrating on the ""key moments."" There's nothing earth shattering: no scandal, no tragic death, no winning of an Olympic gold medal. There's no need; Buechner has a knack for seeing the extraordinary in the ordinary. Something, he says, that we should all do: ""If we really had our eyes open, we would see that all moments are key moments.""Though the subtitle of the book mentions vocation, it is mostly about life and people. Whether writing about his seminary professors--Reinhold Niebuhr, Paul Tillich, James Muilenburg--or a homeless man whom he crossed paths with, Buechner writes with such warmth that we love his characters, just as he does.Buechner calls his books ""Too religious for secular readers...and too secular for religious ones."" This is probably true of Now & Then. Those who are fussy about any deviation from orthodoxy will find, I'm sure, some points to fuss about. Buechner doesn't have all the answers, and he doesn't pretend to. But there are some things he is sure about, that he would ""bet his life on."" Among those, ""That Jesus is the Word made flesh who dwells among us full of grace and truth.""We may not read Buechner for his theology, but, like C.S. Lewis, there are plenty of other reasons to read him. If I find more of his books, I will snatch them as eagerly as I did Bonhoeffer's.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 17, 2010","http://www.amazon.com/review/R18GIJP26K37WP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0060611820#wasThisHelpful","R18GIJP26K37WP","A2V2F6WI16B9F8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2V2F6WI16B9F8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"While his teenage peers worried about little more than Friday's exam over Romeo and Juliet, Brian Hedges was contemplating a call to preach. He answered that call at the age of eighteen. Since then, between serving in a para-church ministry and preaching in his local church, Hedges has gained eighteen years of ministry experience. That's not bad for a 36 year old.Hedges' preaching is characterized by clear, well-organized, well-illustrated, expository sermons that are full of practical application. And in his first book, Christ Formed in You, he proves that he can deliver as powerful and practical a message in writing as he can in preaching.In the foreword, Donald Whitney captures the essence of Christ Formed in You:""Brian Hedges understands that the pursuit of ""the holiness without which no one will see the Lord"" (Hebrews 12:14) requires a clear understanding of the Gospel. For it is in the Gospel that we see Christ in His glory most clearly. And the better we understand and feast our souls on the Gospel of Christ, the more intimate with and like Jesus we become.""The twelve chapters in Christ Formed in You are divided under three headings:Part 1: The Foundations of Personal ChangePart 2: The Path of Personal ChangePart 3: The Means of Personal ChangeIn Part 1, Hedges gives an in-depth explanation of the gospel and its various aspects.  These chapters are foundational to the book, just as a correct understanding of the gospel is foundational to any progress in holiness. Change ""happens only as we understand and apply the gospel to our lives."" And central to the gospel is Jesus Christ, our example of perfect holiness. Hedges writes:""Jesus is the true Imago Dei, the true image of God. But he also remakes human beings in his image through his work. His life on this earth was the perfect embodiment of all that is righteous, good, beautiful, and true....In him we see what God intended all human beings to be in their relationships to God, to one another, and to creation....The question this book aims to answer is how do we become like Jesus?""Part 2 explores the beauty of holiness, the killing of sin, growing in grace, and the motivation for true holiness (joy).  In Part 3, Hedges discusses the means through which God works to make believers more like Christ (primarily meditation on Scripture, prayer, suffering, and community).Though written clearly and at an understandable level, Christ Formed in You isn't light reading. Hedges believes that good theology is essential (""we need to frame our concerns about personal change in the larger story of God's saving work, the story of creation, fall, redemption, and restoration...""), and readers can be assured that they will get a dose of good theology. But the book is also very personal. Through the author's use of illustrations from his life, including taking readers through his own spiritual journey, we see qualities important in a pastor: humility, patience, love, and a genuine concern for others. These characteristics reinforce another common theme that runs throughout his book--the importance of relationships and community:""The goal of redemption is to make you a ""little Christ."" God wants to renew his image within you. But spiritual renewal doesn't happen and cannot happen in isolation from others. It happens in relationships.""Hedges rarely makes a claim that isn't backed up by carefully applied Scripture. And he seems to have an inexhaustible supply of the classic hymns, from Wesley, Newton, and the other great writers, stored in his memory, always ready to illustrate a truth. He mentions the influence that the Puritan writings have had on him, and their influence is evident. Not only does he quote them often, but his use of outlines and lists reminds one of their works. I found these lists, lists such as, ""Ten Ways to Kill Sin,"" ""Five Essential Elements Which Make up Spiritual Transformation,"" ""Six Ways God Utilizes Suffering in Our Lives,"" very helpful, as I did the entire book.Readers from all backgrounds and at all stages of life--believer or skeptic, young or old--will benefit from reading Christ Formed in You. I hope, and expect, to see many more books written by the same author.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 8, 2010","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2FN9BNMOAF3AZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=098243877X#wasThisHelpful","R2FN9BNMOAF3AZ","A2V2F6WI16B9F8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2V2F6WI16B9F8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""Like his eighteenth-century and early twentieth century predecessors, Barack Obama is a man of ideas."" But neither his sensibility, nor his drawing from historical politics, has received due attention. So argues James T. Kloppenberg in his new book, Reading Obama: Dreams, Hope, and the American Political Tradition. The author, using Obama's own writings as his main guide, traces the influences of the President in order to clarify and defend the President's beliefs and show that they are not as un-American as sometimes portrayed.Obama's ""ideals"" stem from a wide range of thinkers: Whitman and Thoreau, Jefferson and Lincoln, even Augustine and Niebuhr. But the greatest influences on the President were the pragmatists, William James and John Dewey, who ""argued that a culture of inquiry should supplant a culture of fixed truths."" This ""denial of universal principles"" is a major aspect of the book, and, according to Kloppenberg, of Obama's thinking. The President's view of the constitution, for instance, is not that it is a rigid, unchanging document based upon the shared convictions of the founders, but that it was ""cobbled together"" as the ""result of power and passion,"" and was meant to serve as a framework in which democracy can operate; its interpretation should change with time and context. In the political sphere, there is ""no absolute truth."" The belief that ""the founders... discovered unchanging Truth and distilled it into the Constitution"" is, according to the author, ""a comforting fable."" The founders, after all, were fallible, and their worldviews and policies are not perfectly compatible with ours, as evidenced by their support of slavery.What are the President's ideals? Kloppenberg says that ""Obama embraces community, liberty, equality, and historicism....A commitment to the dual importance of individual rights and equality, the view that securing effective rather than merely abstract or formal rights requires minimizing as much as possible the gulf between rich and poor,"" or, as another put it, ""the inadequacy of the idea that atomistic individuals bear unqualified absolute rights.""The author argues that, while conservatives see Obama's views as extreme, they are nothing new. Even John Adams and Thomas Jefferson, though ""the great champions of independence....never wavered from their conviction that the American experiment with self government would succeed only if the nation's citizens remained roughly equal in their economic standing.""""Challenging inequality, far from manifesting a `socialist' or otherwise un-American propensity, instead descends in a direct line from the deepest and richest traditions of American culture....The impulse to insure that wealth is shared fairly is a fundamental American value....It is also, as [John] Winthrop did not hesitate to point out, the central message of the Christian Scriptures.""While we can't agree that sharing wealth is THE central issue of Christian Scriptures, there's no denying that it is a repeated theme. Whether or not it is a part of American tradition, however, is not so clear.Kloppenberg endeavors to show that the President is a moderate, at least by some standards. The most convincing evidence is that many on the left are unsatisfied with the President's reforms and think that he hasn't done enough. Regarding Obama's ""commitment to economic democracy,"" Kloppenberg writes:""[There] may be reason for concern....If Obama envisions a strategy for moving in the direction of Roosevelt's vision of a second bill of rights...or of directly addressing the problems of poverty that he describes so vividly in his account of Chicago's far south side in Dreams from My Father, he has not yet revealed it.""One thing is sure. Kloppenberg has given us an in-depth and (mostly) interesting look at our President and the foundation of his convictions. He shows that President Obama, whether we agree with his policies or not, isn't an ""extreme socialist,"" but is committed to democracy, wants the best for the country, and is worthy of our respect.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 7, 2010","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1D7268KZJ4F48/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0691147469#wasThisHelpful","R1D7268KZJ4F48","A2V2F6WI16B9F8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2V2F6WI16B9F8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In his preface to The Theology of B.B. Warfield, Fred Zaspel says that his purpose ""is not to critique or evaluate but to clarify the views Warfield actually held."" Does he do that?  I say that he does, and it will take a really big book to show otherwise. We might repeat the charge that Warfield's only interest was to defend inerrancy, or that his theology was disjointed, or that he was a convinced Darwinian before we read Zaspel's work, but we would have to be sloppy--or stubborn--readers  to say so after.At nineteen, Benjamin Warfield graduated first in his class, not from high school, but from Princeton University. After further education, he spent time preaching in Presbyterian churches and teaching at Western Theological Seminary before he began his career at Princeton, where he taught from 1887 to 1921. Warfield is known as one of the last of the great Princeton Theologians, ""a towering figure in the counterattack against liberalism."" Even those who disagree with his theology say that he ""had the finest mind ever to teach at Princeton Theological Seminary.""J. Gresham Machen, one of Warfield's colleagues, said that Warfield ""has done about as much work as ten ordinary men."" That's hard to deny when we consider that Warfield wrote ""more than 40 books and booklets, nearly seven hundred periodical articles, more than a thousand book reviews,"" and so on. That's too much for most of us to survey, but no need to worry, Fred Zaspel has done the work for us. Besides the above, Zaspel gleaned from Warfield's unpublished manuscripts, sermon notes, lecture notes, and even Warfield's student's class notes. There's a heap of research packed into these 600 pages, and there are thirteen pages of bibliography and innumerable footnotes to prove it.Warfield was an apologist. In his day, nearly every historic Christian doctrine was under attack. This he could not ignore: ""To be indifferent to doctrine is thus but another way of saying we are indifferent to Christianity."" Most of his work, therefore, is a response to what he saw as a challenge to the gospel, which is why he is distinguished as ""the polemic theologian."" Warfield is best known for his defense of the inspiration and inerrancy of Scripture. These doctrines, Zaspel writes, ""were the issues of Warfield's day."" Warfield saw, rightly, that ""Apart from inspiration there is no reference point and therefore no well-grounded reason for the Christian hope or life. Without an inspired Bible the ground for any of Christianity's teachings is lost."" Since Warfield published over 1,500 pages on the subject, it is only right that Zaspel spends a considerable amount of time on it, too.  But the doctrine of Scripture wasn't Warfield's only interest. According to Zaspel, it wasn't even his primary interest:""The person of Christ and his work clearly topped the list of Warfield's many interests as measured by his literary output and preaching....For Warfield, to maintain vigorously and carefully the doctrine of Christ set forth in Scripture is to preserve Christianity itself....Without question, in the person and work of Christ ...we have reached the heart of Benjamin Warfield.""The scope of Warfield's work is vast. ""The theological labors of B.B. Warfield touch virtually every department of biblical and theological studies."" We can say the same for Zaspel's book.Zaspel writes for the serious student, so we can't fault him for using scholarly language. Most readers will benefit from a dictionary; I did, and I was happy to learn that ""piacular"" means ""expiatory."" But an English dictionary will only get you so far. Some of the questions that Zaspel works through revolve around the meaning and use of Greek words. These sections of the book, though few, give the non-Greek speaking audience trouble.  Zaspel is also repetitive, which adds to the bulk of this already not so slim volume, but that will only be apparent to those who read straight through. When viewed as a reference, the repetition is probably necessary. Overall, Zaspel's book is accessible to anyone with a serious interest in Warfield or theology. It is well written, well edited, and well worth both the money and effort. It's hard to imagine anyone ever writing a more definitive work on this great theologian.I received a complimentary review copy of this book from Crossway.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 23, 2010","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3KAGW5S55JQ5X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1433513951#wasThisHelpful","R3KAGW5S55JQ5X","A2V2F6WI16B9F8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2V2F6WI16B9F8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Our chief role in life is to love and worship God. But we can't love or worship Him if we don't know Him. How do we know Him? He reveals Himself through His word and His world. But, in order for us to see and know what He wants us to see and know, we have to think. That's the point of John Piper's book, Think: ""That thinking is essential in knowing God.""""We cannot love God without knowing God; and the way we know God is by the Spirit-enabled use of our minds. So to 'love God with all you mind' means engaging all your powers of thought to know God as fully as possible in order to treasure him for all that he is worth.""What does Piper mean when he says, ""think""? What are we to think about? Is Piper calling us to unguided thinking about whatever pops into our mind? No. His appeal is for thinking that is guided by reading good books, particularly the Bible: ""That is mainly what I have in mind by thinking--working hard with our minds to figure out meaning from texts.""This doesn't necessarily mean we ought to read more. Lots of people read lots of books, including the Bible, without growing in understanding. And there are many reasons why, but the main culprit is a lack of thinking: ""If we don't choose to think harder, we will settle for an adolescent level of understanding the rest of our lives.""Piper defends rigorous, biblical thinking from the most common foes. There are two chapters on relativism, or the belief that ""No standard is valid for everyone."" Piper shows that this thinking is so common that it is often unrecognized, describes ""seven harmful and immoral things about it,"" and tells how to face it. The other main enemy of thought that he deals with comes from within the church: anti-intellectualism, which he divides further into pragmatism and subjectivism. Piper explains these attitudes, shows what's wrong them, and shows how the biblical texts used to support them are used wrongly.So, what of all this thinking, learning, and scholarship? Doesn't it produce pride and quench the Spirit? Is Piper encouraging believers to build their minds but neglect their hearts? If we know anything about John Piper, we know that can't be the case. Throughout the book, he pleads for a balance of light and heat:""[This book] is a plea to reject either-or thinking when it comes to head and heart, thinking and feeling, reason and faith, theology and doxology, mental labor and the ministry of love...All branches of learning exist ultimately for the purpose of knowing God, loving God, and loving man through Jesus...True knowing and true thinking produce not pride but love for God and love for people.""We need this book. One doesn't have to be in the Church long to see that. And no one better to write it than John Piper, a New Testament scholar and thinker with a burning passion for God's glory. Think is clear, convincing, helpful, and biblical. If you already think, this book will encourage you to keep thinking, help you think more clearly, and help to keep you from cold intellectualism and pride. If you are not a thinker, here's a great place to start.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 10, 2010","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3RRACN01KDLC2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1433520710#wasThisHelpful","R3RRACN01KDLC2","A2V2F6WI16B9F8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2V2F6WI16B9F8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"To most of us, execution by stoning belongs to a past, ancient age. But in some parts of the world, it is still a reality.The Stoning of Soraya M. is based on true events that happened in a rural Iranian village in 1986. Soraya is a faithful wife, a loving mother, and a kind and helpful neighbor. But she makes one fatal mistake. When her husband of 20 years wants a divorce so that he can marry his 14 year old girlfriend, she refuses. So the husband, with the help of the local religious leader, finds another way out. He falsely accuses Soraya of adultery and, through intimidation, manages to get a witness. The unwanted wife is convicted and sentenced to death by stoning. When she finally dies after a long, drawn out execution by a celebrating crowd that includes her father, husband, and two sons, the gleeful husband runs off to ""lawfully"" claim the object of his lust.This is the most powerful, and most disturbing, film that I have watched in years. It is hard to imagine the brutality and cruelty of the stoning scene without seeing it. The viewer truly gets a glimpse of man at his lowest depths of depravity.This film is well done. The acting is good, and the scenes are rich in imagery and emotion. It's not appropriate for children of any age, and it may not be for certain adults. But I highly recommend it. We need to be aware of the injustice in our world. I can think of few examples of injustice that equal this oppression, abuse, and murder of women that takes place under the pretense of religion. If you want to be aware of the evil that pervades our world, watch this movie.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 5, 2010","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1MGUP188GX456/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0031DDGA4#wasThisHelpful","R1MGUP188GX456","A2V2F6WI16B9F8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2V2F6WI16B9F8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Christian conversation on homosexuality is often marked by a lack of humility, compassion, and understanding. In his new book, Homosexuality and the Christian: A Guide for Parents, Pastors, and Friends, Mark A. Yarhouse (Professor of Psychology at Regent University) reminds the church that ""real, hurting people--Christians and non believers alike--are...struggling with the issue."" And he introduces a new way to look at the topic. In fact, he says that his goal is ""to do nothing less than change the entire conversation.""When talking about homosexuality, Yarhouse uses a three-tier distinction: attraction, orientation, and identity.  One may experience an isolated or occasional attraction to the same sex without having a same-sex orientation. One may have a same-sex orientation, yet choose not to accept a gay identity. Yarhouse argues that neither of these first two tiers is the result of choice. The last tier is where choice comes in. How does one respond to sexual desire? And what, or who, should a Christian place at the center of their identity?The ""gay script"" tells sexual minorities that ""same-sex attractions are at the core of who [they] are as a person."" Therefore, those with same-sex attractions should form their identity around their homosexuality. This includes engaging in same-sex behavior. But there's an alternative for the Christian. Instead of basing an identity upon sexual desire, a Christian's identity is ""in Christ."" Same-sex attraction doesn't define a person.  Rather, it is one part of human experience. Part of the human experience that, because of the fall, is ""not the way it's supposed to be.""In part one of his book, Yarhouse addresses the obvious questions: what does God think about homosexuality, and what causes homosexuality? In answering the first question, Yarhouse looks at what the Bible says about sexuality as a whole instead of addressing the few passages that deal specifically with homosexual behavior. In considering the second question, what causes homosexuality, Yarhouse reviews the most common suspects: biology, childhood experiences, environmental influences, and adult experiences. After weighing each one, he concludes: ""We don't know what causes homosexuality.""Part two deals directly with those who are, or who have family members who are, attracted to the same sex. There are chapters for parents as well as spouses of those who ""announce a gay identity."" Part three addresses a broader audience--the Christian community. Yarhouse says that the message most sexual minorities hear from the churches today is ""God hates you. You need to change.""""But there is another way. Without compromising its position on the issue of same-sex behavior, the church can recognize that Christians who are sexual minorities are our people, and we can speak to them....We need to do less preaching against homosexuality and more equipping of all believers to grow in a curriculum of Christlikeness.""Yarhouse succeeds in presenting a new perspective on the issue of homosexuality and the church. He is able to be faithful to orthodox Chrisitian beliefs and values while also being open-minded and sensitive. Though he doesn't continuously quote Scripture (he even warns against proof-texting), his arguments are centered on a Biblical understanding and worldview. That combined with his scientific research and years of experience as a Christian counselor makes for a compelling book.We would all benefit from a better understanding of the struggles that many of our brothers and sisters deal with. If they don't find love and support from fellow believers, where do they turn? It's time that the church reaches out to this marginalized group rather than pushing them away. This book is a step in the right direction.I received a complimentary copy of this book from Bethany House.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 2, 2010","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1E8WLEKB9OA2D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0764207318#wasThisHelpful","R1E8WLEKB9OA2D","A2V2F6WI16B9F8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2V2F6WI16B9F8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The habit of spending time with the Lord on a daily basis cannot be formed too early. For children who need a good place to start, Tama Fortner's adaptation of Sarah Young's Jesus Calling may be the perfect book.Jesus Calling is a 365 day devotional for kids. Each devotion begins with a verse followed by commentary written in first person, as if Jesus were speaking directly to the child:""Talk to Me about your struggles, about the times when you feel that you just aren't good enough. Little by little, I will take those struggles and turn them to strengths.""Each devotion also includes suggested Scripture passages for further reading.Young's writings are comforting, full of practical help, and promote worship. Jesus is often presented as a friend--""I am your best Friend--pour out your heart to Me,""--but He is also presented as the Sovereign King. This adaptation by Tama Fortner strikes the perfect balance for children.Jesus Calling is probably most suitable for children between the ages of 6 and 12. Older children will also benefit from it, but it may be too advanced for younger children. We have started using it during our family devotional time. It makes a great addition.I received a complimentary copy of this book through the Thomas Nelson Booksneeze program.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 30, 2010","http://www.amazon.com/review/RV1CBPPIKDADB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1400316340#wasThisHelpful","RV1CBPPIKDADB","A2V2F6WI16B9F8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2V2F6WI16B9F8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"One might expect a parenting book from fifty years ago to be outdated. And many are, especially if they promoted the latest fads or pop psychology. But the Word of God is timeless, and when one has the gift of correctly interpreting and applying the Word, his works will be timeless too. At this stage in my life, there's no subject more important to me than parenting. And there's no one that I'd rather read on the New Testament than Martyn Lloyd-Jones. So, when I saw that his sermons on Ephesians 6:1-4 had been republished under the title Raising Children God's Way, I had to read it and knew that it would be great. What I didn't expect is that this book is more balanced and realistic than much of what is being written on the same subject today.Raising Children God's Way consists of five sermons that Lloyd-Jones preached at Westminster Chapel, London during his series on Ephesians. The entire series was originally printed in an eight volume set by Banner of Truth. The book under consideration is only 85 pages long--perfect for a Sunday afternoon. The chapter titles are:1. Submissive Children2. Unbelieving Parents3. Discipline and the Modern Mind4. Balanced Discipline5. Godly UpbringingIn the first two chapters, Lloyd-Jones unpacks the meaning behind Paul's admonition to children, ""Obey your parents in the Lord: for this is right. Honour thy father and mother; which is the first commandment with promise."" The third chapter tells how and why the modern view of man is flawed, which leads to flawed ideas regarding discipline. The last two chapters of the book deal more directly with the practical aspects of raising children: ""Balanced Discipline"" discusses how to discipline without exasperating, humiliating, or driving children away, while ""Godly Upbringing"" deals with the teaching and nurturing of children.There is a lot to like about this book. First, since these sermons were originally preached to a mixed audience, they are applicable to everyone, parent or not. Second, as is always the case with Lloyd-Jones, his writing is clear and to the point. The pages are not filled with fluff--no sentimental stories about little Johnny. And the author doesn't put on intellectual airs. He writes like a normal man speaking to normal people. Third, Lloyd-Jones's approach to discipline is balanced and intelligent:""Discipline is essential and must be enforced; but the Apostle exhorts us to be very careful as to how we exercise it, because we can do more harm than good if we do not do it in the right way....[Discipline] must always be intelligent; there must always be a reason for it, and that reason should always be made plain and clear.""Forth, the author stresses the importance of treating children with love and respect:""You must not think of yourself primarily, but of the child. The child's good is to be your controlling motive....The child is as much an entity as you are yourself, given, sent by God into this world even as you....If in punishing or administering discipline or correction, we are ever guilty of humiliating the child, it is clear that we ourselves need to be disciplined.""And fifth: instead of fussing over the smaller details of raising children, Lloyd-Jones focuses on the essence of good parenting:""I say to Christian people, and all who are in any way responsible for the discipline of children and of young people, `Let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus.'""In one way or another, I've been disappointed with most contemporary Christian parenting books that I've read. Not this one. I would gladly trade the others for this one, short volume.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 21, 2010","http://www.amazon.com/review/R187O0KSB4CQAM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=085151958X#wasThisHelpful","R187O0KSB4CQAM","A2V2F6WI16B9F8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2V2F6WI16B9F8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"What is an evangelical? To many on the outside, it is ""a white, middle class male Republican from the southern part of the United States."" The terms ""evangelical"" and ""religious right"" are often used synonymously (to the embarrassment of many evangelicals). But according to Christopher Catherwood, ""this description presents a highly misleading picture:""...""It confuses evangelicalism as a whole, which is a worldwide, global movement, with just a tiny segment of it, and gives it a political coloring that is utterly atypical of evangelicals in most countries today. For it is now widely said that the average evangelical is an economically poor black Nigerian woman with numerous family members suffering from HIV/AIDS.""Catherwood (PhD, University of East Anglia) corrects the false assumptions in his new book, The Evangelicals. He makes clear that what evangelicals share has nothing to do with natural citizenship, family, political views, income, or even denominational affiliation. Instead, they are united by their theological beliefs, which he outlines and describes in his first chapter. He also discusses those beliefs on which evangelicals can disagree while still landing within what is considered evangelical, though they may be the very issues that divide along denominational lines.""Denominations are part of the lives of most evangelicals, but their ultimate loyalty does, or certainly should, cross denominational boundaries, since what unites us as evangelicals is far more important than what divides us as Episcopalians, Presbyterians, Methodists, Baptists, Pentecostals, or whatever manmade divisions may exist.""This inclusive spirit is refreshing. But lest one get the idea that Catherwood considers every church an evangelical church, or even a Christian church, he gives many examples of those that are not: ""A church, whatever its television profile or however gigantic its congregation, that packs people in by making them feel good about themselves, is by biblical definition not Christian at all.""The subsequent chapters are:2. A Typical Evangelical Church's Statement3. Who Are Evangelicals?4. Evangelicals Past and Present5. Trials and Tribulations [A look at the different views of the end times held within evangelicalism, and how these views can affect one's politics.]6. The Minefield: A Survey of Evangelical PoliticsThis book has several strengths, but the greatest is its uniqueness. Each chapter offers something new. If not new information, at least a fresh view on what we already know. But I found chapter 3, ""Who Are Evangelicals,"" to be the most exciting. Here are some highlights:""There are more Presbyterians in Korea, a nation that might soon be majority Christian, than there are in the United States....There are more church-attending Christians in Brazil alone than in the whole of the United States and Western Europe combined.... The Church of Nigeria...has more people in church every Sunday than all the Southern Baptist congregations in the United States....There are, whatever way you look at it, millions more Christians in China than members of the Communist Party....the country with the world's greatest number of evangelicals in the twenty-first century could indeed be the People's Republic of China!""Are these just interesting statistics? They are more than that. These are facts that should inform a Christian's world view and politics. How can Christians ignore the two-thirds world knowing that the majority of God's adopted children live there? How can they be unconcerned with AIDS, knowing that it plagues many of their brothers and sisters in Christ? How can one blindly support war, whether it benefits their country or not, knowing that it will kill believers on both sides? Where is a Christian's allegiance? Christ's Kingdom, or the Western kingdom? These are questions that deserve some thought. And they are questions that the majority of worldwide evangelicals take seriously.I'm grateful to Catherwood for this courageous book. He's made me more aware of the make-up of Christ's church, though this shouldn't be the case--the description of the church he gives matches the description we already have in the New Testament. And I'm reminded again that my relationship to my brothers and sisters in Christ transcends any other relationship.

"Church should be a refuge from the stress and anxiety of the world. Unfortunately for many, services are, from start to finish, a cause of anxiety. As my wife and I visited churches in the past in search of a place to worship, we came to dread certain things: the endless, almost suspicious questions from total strangers, the forced smiles and empty words during the ever hated ""meet and greet,"" the music leader's insistence on clapping, raising hands, closing eyes, (or whatever that particular person considers to be a display of true worship), etc... While some see these things as signs of liberated, spiritual worship, others see them as shallow, frivolous torture.If you've ever intentionally walked into church late in order to miss meet and greet, or left early to avoid ""fellowship,"" or been accused of not loving the church because you skipped the church super bowl party, then you'll be thankful for Adam McHugh's Introverts in the Church.Not quite sure about the difference between introverts and extroverts? McHugh does a great job of explaining the two personalities, while correcting many of the misunderstandings. An introvert, he says, is not someone who is shy, anti-social, snobby, cold, or backward. Rather, an introvert is one who gains energy and strength from solitude and contemplation. Extroverts gain energy through social interaction, while social interaction drains the energy of introverts. Therefore, introverts need alone time to ""recharge."" They also prefer to spend more time thinking than speaking (that's not such a bad thing!), and they need more time to process thoughts. Most introverts can identify with McHugh's own preferences: ""If I could, I would spend hours every day in my study--thinking, reading, and writing.""That's not to say that relationships are not important. Relationships and leadership are really what this book is about.Many leadership ""experts"" claim that an extroverted personality is essential to being an effective leader, but McHugh challenges that. Though lots of extroverts are great leaders, both in and out of the church, there is certainly a place for the introverts. Pastors, after all, need to feed themselves before they can feed the flock. We could benefit from more thoughtful, studious, and contemplative leadership:""In an increasingly fragmented, fast-paced, chatter-filled world, I consider the greatest gift introverts bring to the world and the church to be a longing for depth. Spiritually mature introverts offer an alternative to our contemporary lifestyle, one that is thoughtful, imaginative, and slower,"" pg 69.""People who think before they act and listen before they talk can be very effective leaders. The reflective, thoughtful person may be able to learn, and encourage learning, in ways that people who can't stop talking are not able to,"" pg. 124.And although McHugh jokes that introverts ""write with a flourish, but speak with a thud,"" he shows that many are great preachers. ""One of the most unexpected findings of my research was that introverted pastors felt very comfortable preaching, irrespective of congregation size. Many of them actually considered it their biggest strength and favorite part of the job.""I've often thought that because of my personality, I wouldn't do well in church leadership, and that still may be true. But McHugh's book has helped me see more clearly how aspects of my personality are strengths rather than weaknesses. His book also encourages me to build relationships, serve in the church, and engage in evangelism, even if the ways in which I do those things are different from how my brothers and sisters do them. Extroverts, especially pastors and other leaders, will also benefit from reading McHugh's book. It may help them think of ways to include the introverts in their church, or at least ways to keep from driving them away.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 31, 2010","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZ2N0PCW5M80E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0830837027#wasThisHelpful","RZ2N0PCW5M80E","A2V2F6WI16B9F8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2V2F6WI16B9F8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Both the subject matter and the author made me jump on the chance to request a review copy of this book. Dr. Donald A. Carson, research professor of New Testament at Trinity Evangelical Divinity School, is a delight to read or listen to. And I always enjoy studying the doctrine of Scripture (not to be confused with Scriptural doctrine). The title reminded me of Sproul's Knowing Scripture, and I thought that perhaps this would be similar, but I was wrong.Though the book under consideration is the subject of this review, it may help to know something about the reviewer. I am a layperson. Though I have taken a few courses related to the contents of this book, I have very limited knowledge or experience in the fields of textual criticism and the like. This book is not necessarily popular level reading, and it delves deeper into the doctrine of Scripture than some laypersons may want to go. I mention this, not as a criticism of Dr. Carson's excellent book, but as a qualification to my review. What I offer is a layperson's perspective, which, I hope, will be of value to other laypeople.These previously published writings (compiled by Andrew David Naselli) fall into two main parts. Part 1, simply entitled ""Essays,"" consists of five articles dealing with issues regarding the nature and interpretation of Scripture: ""Approaching the Bible"", ""Recent Developments in the Doctrine of Scripture"", ""Unity and Diversity in the New Testament: The Possibility of Systematic Theology"", ""Redaction Criticism: On the Legitimacy and Illegitimacy of a  Literary Tool"", and ""Is the Doctrine of Claritas Scripturae Still Relevant Today?"" Dr. Carson's approach to the Bible is conservative. One quote serves to show the major difference between him and some of the biblical scholars he interacts with:""[A] genuinely Christian understanding of the Bible presupposes the God of the Bible, a God who makes himself known in a wide diversity of ways so that human beings may know the purpose for which they were made-to know and love and worship God...""Carson's presupposition of the God of the Bible, and his presupposition that Scripture is the inspired Word of God, are the controlling factors to his doctrine of Scripture, and are especially emphasized in the first essay. In ""Approaching the Bible,"" Carson begins with a discussion of what Scripture is before moving into a summary of the basics of hermeneutics (interpretation). He discusses essentials such as good reading, paying attention to the context and genre, the analogy of faith, the value of historical and archaeological background information, and more. He concludes his advice appropriately:""Because the Bible is God's Word, it is vitally important to cultivate humility as we read, to foster a meditative prayerfulness as we reflect and study, to seek the help of the Holy Spirit as we try to understand and obey, to confess sin and pursue purity of heart and motive and relationships as we grow in understanding. Failure in these areas may produce scholars, but not mature Christians.""In the next essays, Carson discusses innovations, methods, and debates regarding the study and interpretation of Scripture such as revisionist historiography, ""qualifications of inerrancy,"" redaction criticism, etc. Though the author describes these essays as being scholarly yet ""pretty accessible"", I find them more in line with his description of a book he reviews in part two: an ""intellectual challenge."" But, whether or not one is tempted to use redaction criticism during one's personal quiet time, it is helpful to be familiar with these methods and the arguments for their usefulness and dangers. Carson explores the issues fairly, charitably, and thoroughly.Part two is entirely made up of in-depth, mostly critical reviews of books from a wide and diverse perspective. These reviews, or debates, are also of a technical nature, and deal with books that I have not read (again, no fault of the author). Though the interaction would no doubt be more interesting for one familiar with the writings discussed, it is certainly valuable to read over the shoulder of Dr. Carson while he interacts with others of equal ability.In working through this book, I often felt that it was too deep for me. But when I slowed down, paid closer attention, and retrieved my Pocket Dictionary of Theological Terms, I was able to paddle around fairly well. Though I had some difficulty, it is not because Carson's writing isn't clear. It's always beneficial and edifying to read anything written by Dr. Carson. And it is always good to read books that stretch us.Disclosure: I received a review copy of this book from Crossway.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 18, 2010","http://www.amazon.com/review/RDKRO0AUATIUB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1433514419#wasThisHelpful","RDKRO0AUATIUB","A2V2F6WI16B9F8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2V2F6WI16B9F8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I tend to look at titles such as Our Great God and Saviour and wonder what more could be said. Who can number the books that deal with the nature and character of God? And there are new ones published every year. Truly, ""Of making many books [of this type] there is no end."" It seems that after decades of ministry, Eric J. Alexander would write something more original. But these thoughts only reveal that ridiculous combination of ignorance and arrogance that so often plagues me.

We are always going to be like little kindergarten children in the honors class of a university.""Alexander's book is a collection of studies that he originally prepared for the Philadelphia Conference on Reformed Theology. These messages, Sinclair Ferguson informs us in the foreword, ""come from a lifetime of faithful, consistent, biblical exposition expressed in a rare and remarkable gospel-empowered eloquence."" The book is organized into three main parts: The Character of God, The Salvation of God, and The Church of God. In part one the author explores five of God's attributes. Alexander presses upon readers the greatness of God as He is revealed in the Scriptures, which ""for our understanding of God, we are absolutely dependent upon.""The six chapters that comprise part two take readers through the order of salvation, from regeneration to glorification. Alexander shows, through his rich, sermonic expositions, that the whole of salvation, from beginning to end, is entirely the work of God: ""Do we contribute anything? Oh yes, we do! The one thing that you and I contribute to our salvation is the sin which makes it necessary.""Portions of part three, ""The Church of God,"" are particularly applied to ministers (and ministers will find them particularly encouraging), but the chapters are ultimately addressed to all believers. Alexander's view of the church and of ministry within the church is high: ""The church,"" he writes, ""is at the centre of God's purpose in the world...Fellowship with God is the foundation of our fellowship with one another, and true fellowship with one another leads always to a deepening of fellowship with the Father and the Son.""I've read many books of this type--some good, and some not so good. Many of them sound the same: the same illustrations, the same arguments, and even the same quotations. Not so with this book. It is a refreshingly original explanation of timeless, Scriptural truths. Though he occasionally quotes other theologians and authors, Alexander's book is based upon his own years of prayer and labor in the ministry. Though his book is full of great truth, reading it is not laborious. His style is simple and to the point. I didn't know what to expect when I received the book, but it's an understatement to say that I'm pleased. I would eagerly buy and read anything else written by the same author, and I would enthusiastically recommend this book to anyone who realizes that there is always more--much more-- to be learned about Our Great God and Saviour.I received a review copy of this book from Banner of Truth.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 11, 2010","http://www.amazon.com/review/RXGKE5SYJW3GX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1848710844#wasThisHelpful","RXGKE5SYJW3GX","A2V2F6WI16B9F8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2V2F6WI16B9F8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In The Soul of C.S. Lewis, three authors- Wayne Martindale, Jerry Root, and Linda Washington--offer reflections on quotes from 26 of C.S. Lewis's well known works. Each chapter contains a short introduction followed by ten quotes, reflections on each quote, and a Scripture to reinforce the point of the quote.  According to the introduction, the purpose of the book is ""to encourage reflection and thought,"" and the short passages are ""designed for the reader's personal growth."" The topics within the chapters are varied, but are organized into four general themes common to Lewis's writings: Pilgrimage, Temptation and Triumph, Going Deeper, and Words of Grace. Both the layout and the subject matter of the book make it more suitable as a devotional than a book to be read straight through.Lewis was one of the greatest thinkers of the 20th century. From his vast collection of works (written in over a dozen different genres!), there is much wisdom to be gleaned by the careful reader. The three authors of this present work do an excellent job of drawing out that wisdom and challenging readers to think in order to ""gain a wider grasp of the world and life experiences."" I find this book both thought-provoking and edifying, and I plan to continue to use it and benefit from it.

"""E is for eggs, elephants, and Jonathan Edwards."" How did I miss that when I learned the alphabet? Alas, public education. But now, thanks to the Church History ABC's, a new book by Stephen J. Nichols and Ned Bustard, the breakdown has been corrected.From Augustine to Zwingli, Nichols and Bustard give children a new way to learn the alphabet, while teaching church history along the way. Each page features a different historical character. The sketches are written in first person, giving the book a more personal tone, and include the most important (or most interesting) details of the subject's life in a fun way: ""Hi. Let's get one thing straight, my name is Hippolytus, not hippopotamus.""Though the book is intended to be a church history primer, it also teaches a few life lessons for the more pragmatic. For instance, after Martin Luther mentions his hammering ""a piece of paper to the church door at Wittenburg,"" he gives the following advice: ""Now don't try that at your church. People don't like that.""Ned Bustard's artwork, a collage of illustrations and photos, will hold the children's interest while making mom and dad laugh. John Wesley, for instance, wears a button that says, ""Almost Perfect,"" and Charles Spurgeon stands on a cigar box to deliver his sermon. Lest we miss the significance of the details, there is additional information about each character for parents in the back of the book. We are told there that the Wesley brothers ""both believed in perfectionism, or as they put it, `love perfected,'"" and so the button makes sense.The book is intended for children ages 3 to 6. I happen to have a three year old and a six year old. Other than being interested in the pictures, the younger lost interest, as the information is still too advanced for her. The older, however, seemed very interested and asked a lot of questions, which, of course, is the goal. I suspect that children much older than six would enjoy and benefit from this book; I know that I did. We will use this book often, as it is full of important information that is presented in an enjoyable way, and I am happy to recommend it. Thanks to the authors for applying their knowledge and talent to the important task of teaching children.I received a review copy of this book from Crossway.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 14, 2010","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2XBA17R64UJT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1433514729#wasThisHelpful","R2XBA17R64UJT","A2V2F6WI16B9F8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2V2F6WI16B9F8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"We have been making banana bread twice a week consistently for the last couple of months now.  When this loaf pan arrived, that was the first thing that I wanted to test it on.  I have been using an old metal commercial style stainless steel pan that tends to stick a bit and a pyrex glass loaf pan.  The pyrex glass pan tends to stick and brown a bit more than the stainless steel.Upon opening the packaging, I was very surprised to feel the actual heft that this pan provided.  If you are an individual with dexterity issues, then the weight after it's baked while wearing oven safe gloves may be an issue.  As you can see in the pictures provided, the pan has these perfect little folded creases.  I have never come across that before with other styles and brands.  It is very neat to see how the metal was manipulated and shaped into this neat rectangular box.Since this product was requested for the sole purpose of baking banana bread, I did just that.  I did not spray the bottoms or sides as my usual routine because I wanted to see how truly non-stick the pan was.  Surprisingly enough, the bread slid right out after it has been sitting for 10 minutes.  This was actually a first, as I have gotten used to the breads either breaking or just sticking and having to be scraped off the bottom.  I even attempted my banana bread recipe with coconut extract and flakes.  This recipe tends to make a sugary crust on the bottom.  The pan passed with flying colors!This KitchenAid Professional bake pan should be in everyone's kitchen.  This is a high quality product that is fairly priced.  Once you feel and bake in the pan, you will understand why it costs a bit more than your average baking pan.  My one gripe and it isn't a major one is that the product's literature states to HAND WASH the pan.  I am lazy... but take the two minutes to wash by hand because it delivers a well cooked, evenly baked banana bread.Highly recommend if you are starting to look for bakeware or need to expand your collection with quality professional/commercial style pieces.  I am really surprised by it's performance and happy to have this little guy in my kitchen.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RIXLZCTKSPTY4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GGDRHZ6#wasThisHelpful","RIXLZCTKSPTY4","A30Z0GG96D11EO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30Z0GG96D11EO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We currently have three cats in our home with one mail that has been having stomach issues the last week.  The Fresh and Light has stood up to the watery bowel movements when they arebin the manual litter box but not as greatly so in the automatic box.  I am assuming this is because the automatic raking timer isn't giving adequate 'drying' time.This product is truly unscented and dust free.  I have tried many different types of brands and this is right up there with our household personal favorite, Arm and Hammer Clump and Seal.  If you want a truly unscented litter, then this Cat's Pride fits the bill.  Usually when we pour out the litter we are left with a cloud and we can actually taste.  Those litter types wreak havoc on our daughter's asthmatic lung.  You know once new litter has been poured because the child has the tell-tale cough and at times, wheeze.Another benefit is one that I previously discussed, unscented!  If you despise scents or just get disgusted of scents that are supposed to mask your kitty's bathroom habits, then this lightweight litter will be the one that you should be purchasing.Highly recommend for it's lightweight portability, non scent and lack of dust.  Overpriced here compared to your supermarket chain.  I removed one star because the Arm and Hammer litter that I compared to does keep odor under control for 10 days.  This brand falls just a tad short at about eight days if you keep up with daily cleaning.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R241UUIDXHKWHZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00S6EXLEO#wasThisHelpful","R241UUIDXHKWHZ","A30Z0GG96D11EO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30Z0GG96D11EO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Great quality yoga pants that fits wonderfully and stretches with you.  My only qualm is that the backside is a bit see-through when you are wearing bright or light colored underwear.  If you are on the shorter end then you will either need to have these altered or constantly cuff them.  Yoga pants are meant to be longer though so this is not a defect.  I purchased for my two daughters with the eldest being 5 ft 4 in;  they wrap undernear when she is barefoot by 2 inches.  My youngest daughter is 4ft 10 inches and the adult small wrapped under her foot by 5 inches or so.Highly recommend these quality yoga pants.

"I fell in love with these glasses when they became available.  Unfortunately that love ended once I pried them from their bubble wrap place of rest.  The glasses arrive in an extremely unassuming box with just the glasses, carton holders and bubble wrap.  Not one insert or instructions on care or 'their story' of how they came to be.  At this price, I was disappointed.These are huge glasses!  I have long fingers for a female, while my husband has shorter fingers that are thick.  Even I feel that it is just a tad too wide in comparison to its height.  I love the handmade quality that is so apparent in all the bubbling throughout the glass.  Even the four different colors on the rim are whimsical.  These are not glasses for special company unless it is a very casual evening.  They are clunky and will hold A LOT of your favorite cold beverage with a lot of ice.  They do sweat severely which can be an issue for some or rather their tables.Now this is the complaint:  My set that arrived has scratches on each and every glass.  These scratches appear as if the glass is etched.  In some areas there are back and forth scratches, while on other cups in is long lines.  This truly destroys the aesthetic because the glass is clear and marred by these ugly scratches that can be felt with your fingertip.  The other issue is that the dark blue rim is painful when pressed to your lips because it is jagged to the point where it feels as if it is chipped.Bottom line is that these are too expensive not because they are handmade but rather because they are scratched.  I cannot fathom why they have these markings and have attempted to photograph the imperfections as a warning to other consumers.  If it weren't for the scratches then I would recommend them but at a lower price.  These are going into our everyday cabinet that will be abused and run in the dishwasher daily because they are not of the quality that I believed.  If you like heavy glasses that are different or have that handmade quality, then I recommend this setBormioli Rocco Murano 14-7/8-Ounce Cobalt Blue Beverage Glass, Set of 4.  These are not handmade but rather machine but their quality is pretty incredible.

"We have purchased a different variety of mounts throughout the decade of plasma, lcd and led television ownership.  This mount was purchased for LG Electronics 50LB6300 50-Inch 1080p 120Hz Smart LED TV (2014 Model).  Our television is 50 inches and 50 pounds, which falls in between the parameters of 80 pounds and 60 inches.The directions included were straightforward and after everything was said and done it took a total of twenty minutes.  The bulk of that time was spent finding the stud with the stud finder.  When installing make sure to find the center of the stud for security.  We were in extreme disbelief while installing that this mount would be secure enough.  After screwing the rod onto the back of the television, you then place the tv onto the mount and once you hear the CLICK, you know that everything is secure.The television and mount are about to hit their one year anniversary hanging and there has not been once issue yet.  I would hope there wouldn't be any issues because then that would equate to the mount dropping the actual television.  We rent an apartment and our walls are made of sheetrock (horrible walls).  This mount does not have any movement at all.  It is a low profile at only 1.3 inches, but be aware that this is for the actual mount added without the width of your television.  Overall I would say that our LG is about 3 inches away at the furthest point.  That is very slim and we walk right past this screen that is mounted at normal height when you are standing.  Our kids run right past it and have even hit it and there wasn't any shake.Highly recommend this mount for its simple design and high value functionality that can blend seamlessly.  It is priced appropriately and comes with a 5 year warranty.  Great materials, thin, innovative and easy to install.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R193WBV651EASO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BUER7EC#wasThisHelpful","R193WBV651EASO","A30Z0GG96D11EO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30Z0GG96D11EO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We purchased this television closing in on one year in a few weeks for our 15 by 10 ft bedroom.  This was our first LG TELEVISION purchase, as we have purchased Panasonic, Samsung and Toshiba.  Panasonic will always be the best in our opinion followed by Toshiba for replacement warranty with ease.  The Panasonic is a very old first generation plasma from 2004 or 2005 that is still fully functional but is a commercial unit that does not come with attached speakers nor HDMI ports.  That is the only reason that we replaced that Panasonic for this LG.  We didn't feel like wiring a home entertainment system for our bedroom.  The Samsung that replaced the older Panasonic a few years ago in the living room has totally been dropped by Samsung when it comes to app service and compatibility.  This is the very expensive purchase that also has BRIGHTNESS POPS to this day.  Never again, Samsung!This LG 50 inch model with web browser runs at the very least 8 continuous hours a day or much more.  I tend to fall asleep with the television on and turn off very early in the morning.  The volume is adequate enough for our room as are the viewing angles.  This model was wonderfully light and easy enough to install to the wall with the OmniMount OMH TV Mount for 32-Inch to 60-Inch TVs - Silver.  The reason that we purchased this particular model was because at the time (2014) it offered the biggest bang for your buck, so to speak!  The interface is easy to navigate via the Magic remote that is included as are the most widely used apps and most importantly the WEB BROWSER.  We didn't want to reconnect our ROKU so this was very important for us at that time.  Right there once you click on your Magic remote you will quickly have access to Amazon Instant Video, Hulu plus, Netflix, Skype, WEB OS, notifications, Apps and LG store.  The most important for us was the Browser, Amazon Instant Video and Netflix.  We use the browser to search free movies on Movietube and sites such as these.  As always you will be inundated with windows opening that will direct you to download this or upload that.  DO NOT... it is just trackers and comes with the territory for searching these sort of sites.The browser is pretty quick and easily navigated with the remote.  The remote has a pretty cute interface, as well.  Bottom line, this is a purchase that I would make again without a doubt.  If you need what we do and want a 1080p picture from a lightweight television then consider the 2015 model that is currently available and a good price at the seven hundred dollar mark LG Electronics 49LF6300 49-inch 1080p Smart LED TV (2015 Model).  I cannot speak of warranty coverage because we have not had an issue to date and are about to be out of our warranty soon.  I also cannot advise any consumer to purchase this television and believe that it will be futureproof when it comes to the available apps.  To date these apps are no longer available via my notifications tab:  Target Ticket, Picasa, Twitter and Facebook.  The television has all of these options:Screen share: Turn on Miracast on your phone and tablet and you will be able to wireless mirror your device screen and sound on the television.  For a PC device your use WIndows 8.1 or Intel WiDi App.Smart Share: It accesses available devices such as PCs, cellphones, tablets, USB sticks or cameras or its own LG TV internal camera and memory photo editor.  You can access the same content from original device to television.Device Connector: Hardwire directly to the television to access content on your pc, phone etc.Skype, You tube, Amazon Instant Video, WEB OS, Hulu Plus, Netflix, VUDU, Photo editor, Camera ( must purchase LG Electronics AN-VC500 1080p Skype Video Call Camera, 2 MP, Stereo Microphone accessory).Highly recommend this 2014 model if it can be purchased for a nice discount, if not then go for the 2015 model.  You will not be disappointed with the interface, the sound or movement considering it is only 120Hz.  One major drawback is that the included space is only 1GB or 973 mb available space.  You will need to add additional space for more apps.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3TFFTTHSGRPG2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IQ581GG#wasThisHelpful","R3TFFTTHSGRPG2","A30Z0GG96D11EO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30Z0GG96D11EO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Back in 2011, we purchased the Char-Broil TRU Infrared Urban Gas Grill for our small balcony.  At that time there was not a cover that was readily available so we decided to purchase the Classic Accessories 73912 Veranda Barbecue Grill Cover, Medium, 59 Inch.  The cover has sadly run its course.  This is where this cover picks up.Material-wise and even coloring you would think that these two are from the same brand.  The fit is a bit large on our grill because we keep the folded arms on either side down so that the grill will fit perfectly into its little nook.  Even then, it is fine for our purpose because we may want to keep the arms extended and not have to purchase a different cover at another time.  It has been raining on and off here in New York the last few weeks.  The cover has done what it needs to do, which is  to protect the stainless steel grill from the elements.  I cannot speak of snow yet, but if it is anything like the Classic Accessories line, then it should 'weather' the elements well enough.Durability seems good at first glance but since the product feels so much like the previous one, I suspect that this one will tear as well in time.  Unfortunately, we barely used our grill the last two years and we came to find that the cover has small little tears at all the points where the grill ends jut out.  I did not review this grill cover harshly because it does feel like a quality product.  Only time will truly tell how it will perform.  I did find that lack of one vent in comparison to the Classic Accessories cover to be a shame as well as the placement of the handles.  They are just too low on the cover to be truly useful.  Finally, we are also missing the small pocket.  My husband used to stash his small gauge in there.Recommend as an alternative to the Classic Accessories line, but you will get a bit more features with the former.  If this cover proves to have greater durability long term; over 2.5 years, then I would rate it 5 stars and recommend it wholeheartedly over the other brand.  IF you are in the market for a grill cover for your Stainless Steel CharBroil Infrared grill then I recommend that your purchase a smaller size if you plan to keep the arms folded down.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3FRTU1465CC6X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00S13D3O8#wasThisHelpful","R3FRTU1465CC6X","A30Z0GG96D11EO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30Z0GG96D11EO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This candle is not a tiny candle as it may appear on the website but rather approximately 4 X 4 inches.  At first sight, it was impressive and heavy.  Once I removed the gold imprinted cover, I was enveloped by an imaginary yet very much alive to my senses, floral garden.  The scent is strong and very floral as if you have just freshly picked a bouquet in a meadow and carried them home under your nose.Under the lid there is a label that reads:PEONY BOUQUET PAEONIA SUFFRUCTICOSA  TOP NOTESblackberry, raspberry, sweet orange  MIDDLE NOTESpeonies, iris, bay leaves  BASE NOTEScassis bud, rosewood, white patchouli  ESSENTIAL OILSorangeFragrance inspired by the Peony CollectionThe candle has a sticker that states there is an approximate burn time of 40 hours and that the candle should not burn for more than two hours at a time.  I find that a bit annoying because I like to burn candles in the bathroom when company is over which surely goes over the two hour run time.  The glass is decorated with a card stock quality floral wrapper which also indicated that this is a limited edition.  A percentage of the proceeds from every NYBG brand purchase benefits plant research, habitat conservation, horticulture, and education.  Upon further research at their included website (nybgbrand.org) I found that only a total of 3 percent of the proceeds  (.75 cents) are applied.  I guess that is better than nothing!  I do wish that it was a bit more since the candle is on the expensive side.I love that the included candle comes with two wicks.  In the past, single wick candles have melted and burned themselves into a treacherous ditch of wax.  It has always bothered me at the sheer amount of candle that is lost this way.  This candle's wax burns cleanly and appears to be of a bit thicker consistency than no name brands.  I have not burned through my 40 hours yet but feel that it will probably not make it to that mark.The scent is overwhelming for those that are not particularly fond of strong floral notes.  I am not bothered by it even though I tend to buy Yankee Candle or cheap Michael's knock-offs that are towards vanilla/baking scents.  When using my nose, I do not really get the fruity top notes as much as the floral ones and white patchouli.  Opening your mouth and inhaling will bring the fruity top notes and orange oil alive on your palette.  You can actually taste  the fruit notes just by breathing it into your mouth.  The candle is very oily unlike my usual Yankee candles.  If you gently swipe the wax with your fingertip you will be able to apply the oil as perfume on your wrists.  An hour later and the floral scent is still there!  I am assuming that this is a quality product or it's just too strong.  At this point, I am still a bit undecided.  Do I love it?  Not really.  Do I hate it?  NO.  I have the candle burning next to me on my nightstand as I write this review.  I believe I have a headache.  I am getting that dizzy feeling around my temples.I did not remove any stars because the products seems to be of very high grade quality and the scent is strong; strong enough to fill a large room.  If you do not enjoy floral scents or do not like being trapped in an elevator with an individual that is overly-perfumed then stay away from this particular one.  It is nice to walk into a room and catch a bit of the scent but not to stay with it.Recommend only for individuals that have either tested in a store or received a sample.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RWPV0WREMMD02/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XEDG38I#wasThisHelpful","RWPV0WREMMD02","A30Z0GG96D11EO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30Z0GG96D11EO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Upon arrival it was made very apparent that this DARK GREEN tablecloth would only be perfect for the Christmas season in our household.  If you have a hunter green scheme, then it will also be perfect in that setting.  Straight out of the package the only visible creases were from it's fold pattern.  The 100 percent polyester tablecloth has a delicate sheen with an elegant damask pattern that lays fluidly over the edges of our rectangular shaped marble table.  Water stains fade away and a week's worth of daily dinner stains from three children have easily washed out in a cold wash and rinse.The product's tag insists that you wash the item in a cold wash with like colors.  We prefer to air dry because the material appears that it will fade with repeated drying as most tablecloths of this material do.  After the first wash, the iron was necessary to fully remove the packaging creases as well as making it appear polished.  IF you have cats or little dogs that tend to claw fabrics then this tablecloth is not recommended as it easily snags.  Once it was snagged by one of our monster kittens, the polished-just out for guests look went out of the window.Highly recommend for those that are looking for a easily washable yet elegant table cover for the holidays or if this is your color scheme.

"At the end of the day this is a toilet bowl cleaner that does work.  After placing in the tank, we found that we did not get those pink rings the way that we used to.  Of course you wouldn't though because this product smells as if it is pure bleach.  My major complaint is that the bleach smell is a bit overwhelming.  My daughter has environmental and cold induced asthma that is easily triggered by strong smells/scents.  Every time my daughter uses the bathroom with this product she is triggered.  This bleach tablet is also rather caustic as you can see that the tank is beginning to rust.This product is clear in your toilet bowl and does not have a pleasant smell added; just bleach!  If you need a product strong enough to keep your toilet bowl in check without you needing to brush it every few days then this is it.  It will do the job.  If you are sensitive or reactive to strong odors then I suggest that you look elsewhere.Recommend for those homes that need a tough cleaner because of traffic/constant use like our family of five.  Do not recommend if you have pets that love to drink or step into the toilet bowl as this will poison them.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2PR9JK863IOE5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UNT65FM#wasThisHelpful","R2PR9JK863IOE5","A30Z0GG96D11EO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30Z0GG96D11EO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The Spree SmartCap is a new expensive gadgety tool that registers accurate biometrics using medical grade technology.  The pod while worn either as a black rubber headband or in the included white or black cap (ours was white) uses biosensors to measure your heart rate, movement and body temperature.  The information proves to be very useful while working out because it tells you when to push or pull back during your workouts.  All the information is wirelessly transmitted to your previously synced smartphone in real time.Out of the box the Performance Optimization Device or POD needed to be charged.  Once it was charged I found that both our Samsung devices- a S5 and Note 3 were both compatible.  The app was easily located in the the Google Store and downloaded.  I opted to include my husband's stats for customization when asked for height, weight etc...  The POD was easily synced and placed in the cap.  Having dealt with other devices through my cell phone or the type worn on my wrist has left me wanting something that actually worked!  The other devices have over calculated supposed burnt calories or number of steps taken each and every time.  The POD worn in the cap may have finally solved this issue; it appears to register our steps and calories burnt rather accurately.  I used this device and my cell phone as a comparison on the same walk and the cell phone inflated the results.  It is pretty cool being able to see the path taken via GPS on my device and chart even my core body temp.  This will help when it is very cold and in the heat.As far as comfort:  Wearing the cap is a breeze!  If you normally wear baseball caps during your workouts then this will prove to be a simple transition because now your cap actually works for you with registering your vitals.  I have not used the cap running, just brisk walking with hubby and the dog and it feels great after adjusting to my head size.  My only issue is that the white color quickly becomes dirty while sweating; especially if wearing any makeup on your face.  I have found that rubber headband worn alone seems a bit silly while walking outside and uncomfortable.  I couldn't find a happy medium; the band was either too tight or not tight enough which caused me to constantly have to readjust.  This took time away from my main focus.  Wearing the cap while jumping and stretching was fine as well.Highly recommend for the average and seasoned individual when it comes to their workout routine.  The Spree SmartCap is an awesome workout tool that will allow you to map your highs and lows while helping you achieve your fitness goals.  I do wish that the cap was a bit more affordable because as a couple it is just too much financially to buy a cap for each of us at the same time.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQV8Z526SX5XL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00M56Y562#wasThisHelpful","RQV8Z526SX5XL","A30Z0GG96D11EO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30Z0GG96D11EO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There are countless reviews that will go into detail of the pros and cons regarding this version of Assassin's Creed; I will get to the point.  This game is not for our household!  It has been set aside for over a month to not be touched again because of the issues.  Right out of the box the load times are horrific.  Graphics are nice and we were pretty excited to delve in the French Revolution; unfortunately our smiles ended there.There were constant freeze frame issues, loading and even the climbing of walls was tedious and would cause the machine to crash.  None of this makes sense, but at the same time it all does considering that these franchises just spit out games with major flaws -- speaking to you NBA 2K15!  I have read that there have been updates with Ubisoft and the network which may have solved most of these issues.  We wouldn't know because the game has been retired for the holidays.Apart from these obvious issues the gameplay was once again repetitive.  The missions are formulaic and repeat constantly.  One happy note worth mentioning would be the multiplayer mode but that was marred by the severe load times again.Buy when it is on an extreme fire sale or borrow a copy.  This isn't a game that you will return to after playing it through.  Do not recommend.","2.0 out of 5 stars","January 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RR9EG85GC8I0L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00J48C36S#wasThisHelpful","RR9EG85GC8I0L","A30Z0GG96D11EO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30Z0GG96D11EO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"As of today, it is ok.  That is all... ok!  We have gone through many names and styles of routers the last few years.  We have continuously tested our upload and download from Time Warner provider.  This router performs marginally better than the previous router reviewed.  There is still the issue of lag when going from one side of the apartment to the next, where we have to switch networks.  This has been a constant in the past with slight improvement now.  It automatically disconnects while searching for a closer connection.Recommend if you need a basic well priced router.

"So far so good!  I have owned various types of memory foam products throughout the years, from pillows, slippers and mattress toppers.  I have been using this pillow for about 1.5 weeks thus far and it feels pretty good.Upon arrival you will be severely underwhelmed at the lack of packing material and literature.  There is nothing included in the packaging besides the pillow rolled up in a plastic carrying case.  I was curious to read about the pillows materials and origins but unfortunately there weren't any inserts included.  This was a loss of a star for me.  The product reeks and will emit that horrible memory foam 'odor' for a very long time.  The pillow fully returns to it's natural state after a day of being unrolled.  The odor was very strong so I decided to pull the zippered pillow case off and let it 'air out'.  After five days I gave in and used it, as the odor was still there.I was pleasantly surprised on the comfort level.  We had purchased two very expensive pillows that were designed for my side sleeping and my husband's back sleeping.  After a couple of months I am awoken to severe jaw pain and a numbness at the base of my skull.  This pillow does not do this to me... yet.  As a side sleeper, I need the support but softness at the same time.  Memory foam tends to become rather hard in a colder setting then turns too soft as the night wears on.  We have had a cold spell the past week and the pillow is not hard when I come to bed at night.  It also offers great support when coupled with another pillow for television viewing or reading in bed.One weird thing that I found was when I removed the zippered case, there were pieces of memory foam coming through the cover the way feathers would in a traditional pillow.  Never seen that before!Highly recommed this pillow for it's low price.  As a side sleeper, it has greatly accommodated me when my expensive pillow was causing pain.  I recommend that the company include some literature inserts regarding the materials used.  The average consumer would love to know that the pillow is a great hypo-allergenic alternative that resists dust mites.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3OE20HHK8MR78/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00L4AWEOK#wasThisHelpful","R3OE20HHK8MR78","A30Z0GG96D11EO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30Z0GG96D11EO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you are feeling nostalgic for the original game cube controller with a few updates then this would be the marriage!  The controller feels pretty light and is hard pastic.  The joystick has the rubbery tip that we have become accustomed to.As far as play, it has been great thus far.  We have not experienced any lag but this might just be because it is wired.  You do not need batteries because you are wired but do need spare wii-motes for each of these controllers that you do purchase.  Button layout feels just right.  The kids were used to it within 15 minutes since they had never played with a gamecube (before their time!).  Hubby and I felt right at home even with the addition of two new buttons.My two only gripes are that there isn't any rumble and that is is wired.  That would be the loss of one star for us.  Other than those minor losses this feels like a quality product from a third-party company.  Can't wait to try it out with smash brothers!Highly recommend if you are in the market for a cheaper priced quality build product.  As ling as you understand that it is wired and no rumble pack inclusion then you should enjoy your game cube nostalgia.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RM6AVGEMM20XL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LSBNSJA#wasThisHelpful","RM6AVGEMM20XL","A30Z0GG96D11EO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30Z0GG96D11EO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a near perfect product from Logitech as far as portable and universal mounts go.  Logitech has always been a top rated company that stands behind their products with warranties.I had previously reviewed a universal generic phone cradle that was used in our second older vehicle that did not have navigation.  My husband continues to use that mount.  When the  Logitech mount arrived,  we were initially impressed at the sleek but simple styling.  After reading the included literature, cleaning our car window and applying the metal disc inside our Samsung Note's 3 Otterbox case, we were finally ready to go.  Installation is rather simple when going onto a glass surface.  If you have any manual dexterity issues then you MIGHT need help from another party.  My husband couldn't get his wide fingers at the right angle.  When I attempted to turn the knob, I found that it was just too hard.  After a moment or two, my husband was able to turn it.  Very annoying but it makes us feel as if the actual mount will not be going anywhere.Once the phone is magnetically mounted it does not rattle or jump even when you throw some of the bumpiest NYC streets at it.  If your dash is smooth, you will be able to use the suction cup.  If it isn't, then you will need to use the peel and stick type adhesive.The reason that this mount is great is because of it's portability and ease of use when dismantling.  The small pod can be thrown in your glove compartment or even purse if tou fear leaving the item attached overnight.  Logitech was kind enough to include a second magnetic disc for an extra phone.  This comes in handy when sharing a vehicle.The only and inly gripe which forced me to knock off a star is that you cannot swivel/rotate the phone,  only move ot up or down a bit.  The earlier reviewed and cheaper mount has that ability.  This is what forced us to continue using the other product in our home vehicle.  The Logitech cradle has gone to a work vehicle because ot can be easily attached and detached daily.  So far it has been performing.Highly recommend if you are in the market for an ultra portable UNIVERSAL phone mount that will hold your phone for hands-free operation.  Logitech is a great brand that has yet to disappoint.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R542K7XU91FG0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KNU9L1Q#wasThisHelpful","R542K7XU91FG0","A30Z0GG96D11EO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30Z0GG96D11EO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Growing up in the 80's, I have warm and fuzzy memories regarding all things Transformers.  Over the years I have purchased the newly fangled updated versions of the characters that we used to treasure.  The purchases have been toy quality from the low end to two big expensive versions.  Every single time my husband and I have been disappointed because the materials used are cheap.  I remember buying a Bumble Bee character a few years ago that was in the 70 dollar range; disappointingly his head sbapped off after a few transformations.  That was the last purchase towards this modern day franchise made for our now eight year old son.  When the opportunity arose to review this new product I jumped at the chance.These three transformers are labeled as Protectobots.  I won't go into detail regarding their origin, just our experience with transforming.  The age on the packaging states that it is for 6+.  Our eight year old could not tranform these tiny little guys on his own.  I attempted with the directions help but quickly became frustrated with the tiny, plastic, flimsy ball-joints that repeatedly popped off.  I passed the activity to Dad before I cracked these little guys with a mallet!  Patience is necessary; especially for the two larger of the trio!  My son became annoyed because it wasnt working in his hands so he too passed it along.  Frustrating to watch but after a cool 40 minutes they were put together.Once put together they arwnt as impressive as the models from yesteryear.  You are left with the feeling of a cheap .99 cent store (Made In China) knock-off.  The arms or blades kept on falling off in robot mode and were so very difficult to replace.  Eventually after a day a coupke of pieces snapped from the repeated pressure from gently forcing them back.  Within 4 days they lay in the original Amazon box in what resembled a junkyard scrap heap :(.Do not recommend this toy!  It is comprised of low quality inferior plastic with faded and uneven colors.  Not worth the current price of over thirty dollars;  great stocking stuffer at the 10 dollar mark.  A collector will swiftly return.  Not great for younger children.","2.0 out of 5 stars","November 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJKR3CR7G88Y6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ILA28H4#wasThisHelpful","RJKR3CR7G88Y6","A30Z0GG96D11EO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30Z0GG96D11EO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Throughout the years we have collected various Barbie dolls collector sets from the Around the World series, Holiday ones and even the I Love Lucy collection.  The last Holiday Barbie  that we have is the 2012 version.This year's doll is a beautiful blonde with blue eyes and ruby red lips that shows teeth when she smiled.  Her makeup is very pretty; eyelashes are butterfly winged at the corners with gold sparkly shadow that matches the gold theme running through.  Her dress is a gorgeous bright red with a raised front and gold lace peekaboo.  Nails are also red.My only complaint is that this years doll is very reminiscent of 2012 minus the gold accents.  The only difference would be that 2012 Barbie had more exotic features as 2014 doll would be considered 'typical All American Barbie'.This years styling feels as if she would be more suitable to a Christmas holiday setting because the colors just scream Christmas rather than 'any' special holiday, down to her gold poinsetta inspired necklace.Highly recommend if you are a Barbie collector.  This years dress is once again constructed from quality materials and styled rather impeccably from her long hair with one side pinned to her pretty shoes.  Cant wait to decorate with her this December!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1QIH4BLUANLIP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JDMY58Y#wasThisHelpful","R1QIH4BLUANLIP","A30Z0GG96D11EO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30Z0GG96D11EO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"UPDATE: March 31st, 2015I had my father staying with us which added an extra shower a day to the 2 total daily showers.  We are a family of five and this caddy is srill rust free!  I am amazed and rather excited because we are nearing the six month mark in a few days.  This is when we usually throw the caddy out.  I have not even taken any special precautions or even cleaned.  The material is quality and for that reason I have added that fifth star.At first glance I wasnt greatly impressed with this shower caddy; that is until the moment of installation!Once it was easily hung from the shower pipe, the spacing and design proved to be rather well thought out.  Our shower head is a large oval head rainfall style that rotates 360 degrees.  Other caddies would hinder and obstruct each revolution attempt; especially when attempting to spray the window and side tiled walls.Quality-wise it has a matte finish with a light gold color.  I was originally disappointed that it does not state anywhere on the product if it is rust resistant.  My experience with different types of caddies has proven that by the 4 month mark they are ready to be disposed of.  The fact that there is a great height in between the little shelves is wonderful for our tall bottles.  I would have preferred that the shelves be able to accomodate wider bottles though.  Even with that shortcoming we can still squeeze a family of six in there.Highly recommend if you have an oddly shaped shower head that needs the center column space as ours did.  Disappointed that there wasnt any literature included.  Also very suprised that there isn't a warranty in place.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1H6E3I7YWH90D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LUYMLUW#wasThisHelpful","R1H6E3I7YWH90D","A30Z0GG96D11EO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30Z0GG96D11EO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"To be honest, juicing has never been my 'thing'.  A recent turn of events has us re-evaluating everything that we put into our bodies; this juicer came at the most opportune moment.Assembly seems complicated but that is quickly found to just be a figment after reading the included instruction with great pictures.  I am happy to see that this is a BPA free product and also dishwasher safe.  Clean up after unscrewing the many parts is a breeze when you are able to throw them in the dishwasher.The juicer is constructed from a very thick, sturdy plastic as are all the pieces.  The plastic base suction cups to all of our surfaces with a twist of the middle portion.  We have not had it slip as of yet.  It is recommended to cut your feuits/vegetables into smaller pieces.  You can only fill the chute half way.  It is very simple turning and pushing down.  At first it was funny watching the dried pulp coming out in sausage form.  Curiosity did win out so I decided to taste the pulp that had been extracted.  It was bone dry from the carrot and apple that we had just juiced.  I decided to keep it and mix into my dogs wet food.... he loves the carrot and apple pulp!  I feel just a tad better knowing that it wouldnt be going into the trash.  We have stuck to simple carrots and apples because I still have V8 nightmares from when I was younger.  I have actively avoided any juices mixed with vegetables because of the little V8 cans.  This brings me around and actively making my own without cringing.  The juicer handles the hard thick carrots and regular apple like a champ.  I still feel like it takes an awful lot of greens, fruits and vegetables to actually get a heaping glass.  This is the only reason why I wouldn't juice every day.... affordability is a big issue for us.Highly recommend if you plan to juice once or twice a week max.  It is a bit time consuming to have to manually grind everything opposed to just passing through a machine.  Great option for occasional weekly use towards a healthy start before serious juicing.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3T0ZQ7Z567BAQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LSI1TA8#wasThisHelpful","R3T0ZQ7Z567BAQ","A30Z0GG96D11EO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30Z0GG96D11EO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I really wanted to come on here and write that this product kept my red color treated hair vivid and brighter for longer, but unfortunately,  I can not.I found that the shampoo is the color of red medicine and has a very pleasing scent.  So much so that my husband and eight year old son comment on how great my hair smells.  I felt that my hair was fading at the same rate but felt very silky.  What I did notice regarding the coolor was that it was much more golden this time around.  I do not remember my hair fading to a strawberry blonde that was so silky and bright.  I will disclose that I opted to use my own conditioner instead of the companion product.  On the labeling it does say to use 'daily'... I do not wash my hair daily, which has left me wondering if the result would have been any different if it was used daily as stated.Recommend for bottle red heads if you want great smelling silky hair that fades to a nice golden color.  This is what happened to my hair; your mileage may vary.  I did not find that it extended the true red tone but it also didnt fade and feel like straw.

"In theory, this bluetooth adapter with included earphones is a great idea... in theory.  If this adapter is purchased for a beginner to the technology, then it is a good purchase.  Do not recommend buying this product if you are tech savvy because it will fall short when it comes to options.Right out of the box you are severely underwhelmed by the included instructions that are written in the TINIEST font available.  Your eyes will thank you when you pull out the magnifying glass for these instructions.  Pairing them to any device is a cinch when you decipher the instructions.  You will hold down the center button until it flashes red and blue; what the instructions fail to explain is that once you depress the button it will first flash a solid blue then red and blue.  At this point you will release and make sure that your device is discoverable.  The MT103 quickly discovered my Dell laptop, Galaxy S5 cell phone and Galaxy S4.  I chose to connect the adapter to my S5.  Initially I am surprised by the length of the ear buds cord that connects to the device.  I had an issue clipping the adapter to my t-shirt.  I tried the collar but the cords were bunched up around my chin.  Attempting to attach to my sleeve didn't fare any better because the length was too short and didn't leave me any play to move my head while walking.You are able to answer calls from the device by just pressing the center circle once again.  I could hear the party on the other end perfectly, but they complained of my voice sounding 'muffled'.  I attempted to remedy that situation with different placement around my face.  Closer distorted my voice, attached to my collar produced a muffled sound and holding in my hand at a distance of about 7 inches from my mouth was the best.  This is rather unacceptable when you are outside walking or exercising!  We will not be using the bluetooth to answer our phones unless it is very necessary.  While attempting to stream music from my device and Pandora outside it kept on cutting in and out.  It became very frustrating when the device kept on disconnecting and had to be re-connected 5 different times.The included instructions do not mention the 3 different filters that are included.  The three included filters change from strong bass, medium bass or crisp bass.  I only remembered about them when I read the back of the box.  It is simple enough screwing them into each earbud.  I personally like the filters without any dots because it produced a nice heavy bass.  The filters with one dot sounded very crisp and loud; bass unsatisfying.  The two dotted filters felt very much like the aforementioned.  Silicone ear bud pieces come in three sizes, middle size seems to fit all the best.This is a very light and portable bluetooth adapter but it would do better with a couple of more buttons or even the tiniest screen that could scroll through your albums.  I hate the fact that you are not able to scroll through your albums.  All that you can do is go from song to song in an album that has been manually selected from your device.  With our developed technologies thus far, this really should have been an included function.There are a few pros for this device:Easily pairs with available devices once you understand that you do not stop pressing at the first solid blue rings.Makes any old headphones accessible via bluetooth and your other devices.Slight personalization regarding sound with the included sound filters.Included headphones that are pretty good with a nice thick braid.Beginner learning curve because of only 5 buttons.Operates at a great distance from paired device.  Went the length of our apartment and made it about 25 feet before it started to cut out.Cons for this device:There is NO low battery indicator.  I am not sure if I missed this in the included instructions and their tiny print.  Trial and error has shown me that after the device is charged the center is solid red.  Why not blue??Cuts in and out while listening to albums from Amazon Music and Pandora's streaming.Cannot skip to next album on device only to songs within the same album.Headphone cord just too short.Included charging cable is a USB to headphone jack.  Rather odd and will not be as easily found to replace.BATTERY CANNOT BE REPLACED.  This renders the device useless and left for the trash after it's battery life.Constantly disconnects while outside.  I do not understand why.Annoying hissing sound when it isn't connected to an outside device.Recommend only if you do not have a bluetooth device already and you have a pair of corded headphones that you cannot part with.  This will pretty much make them wireless.  IF you are an early adopter then the MT103 will not cut the mustard.  I couldn't get past the fact that I was not able to jump from album to album and the fact that it would disconnect while I was walking outside.  If you understand it's shortcomings, it will fit you perfectly.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2GV78CZW5NJ0E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HG79PWY#wasThisHelpful","R2GV78CZW5NJ0E","A30Z0GG96D11EO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30Z0GG96D11EO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Great tablecloth for everyday or special occassions.  Right out of the packaging you are plagued with deep creases that need to be ironed.  After a bit of ironing, the tabecloth lays beautifully on our oblong shaped table.  It hangs over the sides and transforms our dining room.  I received the Ivory 'Climbing Vine' herringbone weave pattern.  Be aware that the Ivory is more towards the yellow creams.The tabecloth is microfiber and spillproof.  This does not mean STAINPROOF though.  I tested with a bit of water because I was skeptical.  The water did bead up and allow me to thoroughly wipe away.  I did not want to try with a liquid that stains but I do believe that even a corrosive liquid would bead up if promptly wiped.One thing that I live is the fact that this tablecloth is machine washable.  The instructions state that it should be washed cold during a gentle  with light colors.  Non-chlorine bleach only, tumble dry low and light iron if necessary.Highly recommend if you are in the market for a pretty tablecloth that is versatile and easily washed.  No DRY CLEANING FINALLY!","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R15A4SY10HYOGO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00C6NH71O#wasThisHelpful","R15A4SY10HYOGO","A30Z0GG96D11EO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30Z0GG96D11EO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I became intrigued by this catacombs playset because it looked deliciously creepy.  Even though this play set is aged for my girls, they did not care for it.  They are aged 10 and 11; they felt that it was silly and expensive.Upon receiving signing and hauling the box up the stairs, I wondered how large it was actually going to be.  Unfortunately, I soon discovered that this wasn't a plug and play type of set like the Batman ones that I had purchased for my son in the past.  There are pieces and MANY of them that comprise this catacombs playset.  It should have been an easy build, but after a very long hour I believe that the manufacturer wants you to feel as if you are getting your money's worth because 'more pieces' equals 'more money'.  After dedicating over an hour in meticulously putting everything together, the second shock came.  This 'toy' is over 4 feet tall and 3 feet wide!!  This set needs it's own room.  It would be great for families with large homes and sprawling bedrooms or play rooms but in our NYC apartment this will not do.There are positive points as well.  The fact that the set is so large it allows your little collector to display 15 Monster High dolls throughout the levels.  We were able to fit 17 Barbies in there.  I fell in love with the clock trick door to gain entrance to the secret lab.  There are little cute things throughout the set like this.  The pool can be flipped for a different theme, spin the courtyard to see the spooky eyes, turn the dragon and there is another hidden shelf for a doll and ride the elevator.The bad:  Elevator does not move smoothly.  The plastic feels cheap for the overall set.  As always a few extra pieces are included but just not enough for this price.  My daughter's are aged out already.  They find the set and whole Monster High thing corny.I really wanted for my girls to be excited when they saw the set, but instead I learned that my girls have turned into young ladies. :(  I truly considered keeping the set for Halloween even though it seemed like a cheap plastic toy.  My husband laughed at me and questioned where I could possible place this to be on display.  It really is just too BIG, bulky and cannot be folded for seasonal storage or otherwise.Recommend only if your child is a Monster High fanatic and already owns the doll.  I still believe that this item is just too expensive considering that the consumer has to put it together and then store it.  Why not have the ability to fold when not in use??  It's a display case that will lead to more 'accessories' purchases.  If your child is into imaginative play and you have the space then you should not be disappointed.  My girls didn't care for it at all.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3UY3482225X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IVFCCR0#wasThisHelpful","R3UY3482225X","A30Z0GG96D11EO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30Z0GG96D11EO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"How I wish that this item had originally been available when my little guy started school four years ago.  Our son would alternate between being a lefty to righty but one thing that never changed was the sloppiness.  With the sloppiness and constant pencil points breaking came pencil shavings and black marks on his hands, furniture and shavings spilled all over the home.  That is when I started purchasing mechanical pencils for home use.  The girls did wonderfully since they were older but our son struggled because he pressed too hard.  He also had a rather odd grip on the pencil; he still does!  I tried purchasing the thickest and 'strongest' lead available but that did not work either.At first glance a parent may not want to spend on only ONE mechanical pencil.  I thought before they arrived that it was a bit much, until it was opened.  Once opening the packaging, I was surprised to see a wider barreled but shorter pencils.  There is a little plastic guide to help little ones with placement, a spot to place the included sticker with their 'handwritten' name, a VERY long side eraser in a nice sleeve and a container of VERY thick lead.  I was so surprised to see that lead that resembled a pencils in thickness could be made mechanical.  IT'S GREAT!!The lead writes smoothly, and the pencil grip feels very nice.  My only complaint would be that the guide may get in the way for older kids.  Our son had an issue with getting the hang of the guide and why it was actually there.  It would have been a great learning tool all those years ago; now he accidentally placed his finger over the guide.  Even with that he still loves the thickness of the barrel, the eraser and the lead.  To prove that it doesn't break as easily he chose to stab the Amazon box.  After being scolded for stabbing the box, I did notice that he was right that the point didn't break!  If these pencils had been available all those years ago, then maybe the elementary school teachers wouldn't ban mechanical pencils from our school's classrooms.Highly recommend for first time writers or for children that struggle pressing too hard with the conventional mechanical pencil.  I have not been able to find BIC 1.3mm refills for the lead on Amazon which is rather disappointing.  I am assuming that you can use Papermate's lead instead which is rather inexpensive.  Great size in length and girth for little hands and should be easy enough to load once a child learns the mechanics.  Not sure if the 'guide' on the barrel will be appreciated by all parents.  It would have helped us back then because it would have reminded our son about his finger placement.  I still watch him awkwardly hold a pencil and sloppily write... he may become a Doctor!","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1DTC7GDGJES99/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JFOJ7R4#wasThisHelpful","R1DTC7GDGJES99","A30Z0GG96D11EO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30Z0GG96D11EO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This toy is geared towards children aged 6 to 36 months.  I believe that the age gap is too wide and it would be more suitable for an infant aged 6 months to the point where they are attempting to sit and stand up.  It will not keep the older set thoroughly entertained for long but does wonders for the 'tummy' set of infants.Very durable and colorful toy with a two setting volume and a very pleasing voice that appeals to babies.  The horse rocks and rolls or rather wobbles across the floor and your little 'tummy' floor surfer attempts to reach it so that they can hug and put it in their mouths!  At least that is how our story went.  It is not as annoying as other toys as far as sound and repetition... yet!  At first I thought it was silly that there were commands to touch his nose or play with his ears, but after thinking for a while, it makes sense because the child is learning 'cause and effect' with repetition.  I was delighted to see that the classic William Tell Overture happily plays as well as other music.  I don't believe that this toy will be played with for a long period.  As long as your child is more stationary, then this is a great purchase to hold their interest.Highly recommend for little ones first learning toys.  It would make a very nice inexpensive gift as well because it is a quality build that seems very safe.  I do not see how a little could hurt themselves.  LeapFrog has built another quality product.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3RJUFM7XDLLXR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KNT6DK4#wasThisHelpful","R3RJUFM7XDLLXR","A30Z0GG96D11EO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30Z0GG96D11EO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This hot air popcorn popper has many horrible reviews and is starred very low.  After careful consideration and our limited experience, we have found this product to be good.  Does this item spit out un-popped kernels rather violently?  YES!  I believe it has something to do with it's slanted forward design and low black collar.Right out of the box there are instructions, the popper, plastic slanted funnel and measuring cup/cover.  It is a very easy read; just reading the first page allows you to become quickly acquainted with the machine.  It states to use a bowl with sides that are at least 5-5.5 inches high.  I recommend a very DEEP salad style bowl.  We used a shallow six inch high wide bowl and found the popcorn ricocheting in and out of the bowl onto the floor.  Lesson number 1 learned: USE HIGH WALLED BOWL.One afternoon I was sucked into watching yet another episode of Dr. Oz (*eye roll).  This particular afternoon the audience was schooled on the dangers of microwave popcorn.  We all know that it is dangerous but try to ignore it for the convenience.  Regardless, Dr. Oz scared the junk out of myself and husband enough to have us run out and swap our comfortably easy microwaveable popcorn baggies for a jar of un-popped kernels.  WE learned then how annoying it was to make popcorn on the stove top.  It was much trial and error, many different fats, temps and flavors.  Countless pots until my husband became the designated 'Popper' in the house.  Not an easy feat for a family of five that usually has 3 bags of popcorn while watching a movie.  We seriously considered buying a popcorn popper, but life took over and it went to the wayside.  Here I am now staring at this machine's shortcomings at the bottom of my salad bowl and yet I am still in the honeymoon phase.  It's a popcorn popper and it does pop the kernels.  Does it pop all the kernels?  NO.  Does it spit out MANY MANY kernels each and every time?  YES.  Do I still like it?  YES.We are able to make our plain popcorn without and oils and it is not necessary to add any toppings.  Both regular kernels and today's white hybrid NON-GMO kernels through Jolly Time have gone through the machine the same way.  Kernels that do pop are large and fluffy.  I can see why everyone HATES this machine, when I slowly start to count the amount of kernels that were spit out from the 1/2 cup.  That is the capacity of the measuring cup/cover on the top.  There are just too many wasted... I stopped counting at 35.  That is a lot of money wasted when you take it into consideration for each time.Recommend if you are in the market for a hot air popcorn for natural healthy popcorn.  We have never owned another model so we are not sure if they usually 'spit' out kernels down the chute.  It does it's job and ours does not run so hot that it is dangerous.  We only recommend that you do not attempt to remove the 'spat' out kernels while the machine is operating.  My burnt thumb did not appreciate the burn from the very hot kernel.  I really believe that the black collar should be a bit higher; possible that would remedy the kernels jumping out.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJHU0V9VQ8NLS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KL8SMBU#wasThisHelpful","RJHU0V9VQ8NLS","A30Z0GG96D11EO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30Z0GG96D11EO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have previously reviewed a Simplehuman sensor soap dispenser and instantly fell in love. So much so, that I purchased a second one for our master bathroom and then was able to review the larger stainless steel version of this rechargeable sensor pump.  If you have been keeping count, that is FOUR soap dispensers by this great company.  We have never experienced clogs. This might very well have to do with the fact that we use Simplehuman branded lavender hand soap.  It clearly states to not use any soaps with 'beads'.  We have also never had to clean up any drips because of the nozzle leaking.I will continue to LOVE this product and sing it's praises. The design is very round with a protruding snout with a smaller foot stamp than it's 11oz counterpart.  Shiny white plastic that looks great even when wet. At first I wasn't very excited about the white color, but now I am beginning to really appreciate the clean look overall. The buttons are actually part of the chrome top and seem to be ""touch"". As before, I am concerned about wetting the top and eventually making those functions non-operational.  It has been a little over a year from my original review for the 11 oz version and we have not had one issue.  I should probably let the fear go that the top will become non-operational if water touches it, because my kids soak it everyday.  The literature does tell you not to submerge the pump.  Again we are employing the same +/- system, as well as holding down the - button to shut the device off. Very useful when you know your kitty will be activating and dispensing soap all night long (TRUE STORY).  Included in the packaging will be a 3.5 oz Lavender scent sample and the micro USB cord for charging.At this point you are questioning why should you purchase if it is the same exact product with different aesthetics? The supplied micro USB slot to charge the internal battery. Yes, now you can charge your cell phone and soap dispenser at the same time apparently. Believe me, I tried and my Samsung Galaxy S4 uses the same cord. I was happy to see that when I plugged in the USB, my soap dispenser was fully charged by the green light indication. It has been nearly a month and we have not had to re-charge the device as of yet. I truly hope that it will go for another month.This product is backed by a very generous 2 year warranty.  You can be assured that it isn't a gimmick because I did need to use the warranty for my two original dispensers (not the rechargeable version).  I am happy to report that Simple Human has wonderful customer service that stands behind their products.  Two other soap dispensers (not the rechargable model) that we had owned became non-operational. I had never registered them. I simply called and gave the purchase dates. We once again went through trouble shooting where it was found that they needed to go in for service. They emailed me the UPS return slips and I returned both pumps. Within 3 days I had the return email confirmation. It took 10 days before I received a final email stating that they were replacing both pumps and tracking info. Sounds too good to be true... but I received two BRAND NEW replacement soap dispensers in their individual sale packaging with the lavender soap samples; just like my original purchase.The bad thing is that I received a letter stating that I would no longer have any warranty.  No new 2 year warranty and no remainder from the last.  I was a bit frustrated because it seems from my personal experience that they become faulty at the 1 year mark.  Apparently, this does not hold true for this model.  I will update if the replacements do the same. Great work Simple Human for standing behind your product but you should at the very least offer 6 months on the replacements.Highly recommend this RECHARGEABLE dispenser.  As you may have seen from my other reviews, I have balked at the original price.  It has been a year since I received the other rechargeable pump and we have charged it only ONCE!  The extra cost is worth it considering the amount that we are saving in batteries every month.  Backed with the warranty and long battery life this is a sound purchase that you will not regret.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2T115B4GIPTE4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GHWOVBY#wasThisHelpful","R2T115B4GIPTE4","A30Z0GG96D11EO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30Z0GG96D11EO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have always wanted a breakfast tray but never truly got around to purchasing one.  After knowing I was going to be confined to a bed for a while, I decided to finally purchase one.  Right off the bat, the tray's color was uniform and beautiful.  I was expecting divots of paint missing and dents everywhere; surprisingly NONE!  The color at first looks to be a deep black, but when placed in natural light you will see the mahogany shade laced through-out.  Seems very much like an espresso shade at times.The tray is fully functional and rather big, which we love because our plates are on the largish size.  The legs fold out smoothly and stay in place while eating.  The other thing that I really love is that it can be used as a table tray when the legs are folded underneath.  They are flush to the bottom which gives it a rather seamless appearance.  I do expect that the paint might blister and peel if you do not use coasters though.  It feels like it is a laminated particle board.Highly recommend if you are looking for a breakfast tray that can double as a regular tray in this color scheme.  If it arrives the way mine did condition-wise, then you will not be disappointed.  I do not recommend purchasing this tray for laptop use; the lip is just too high and uncomfortable.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2GQ8M7OXUM066/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0027I3FFA#wasThisHelpful","R2GQ8M7OXUM066","A30Z0GG96D11EO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30Z0GG96D11EO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I found this pepper mill grinder at a local retailers over six months ago and it has been glorious from the moment I filled it.  Ok, ok, I may be over-excited over this pepper mill but there is a reason.  For years I would struggle with the other types with the little knob on top that would either be over-tightened or loosened to the point of the base falling into my cooking pot!  This happened so many times that I began to ban them and use the already filled small McCormick grinders that are not reusable.  I missed not having those special blend of peppercorns to dot my meals with before and after.  McCormick grinders were just not cutting it and rather expensive when having to be replaced every two weeks.This grinder has a great feel: rubbery at the top, plastic in the center and stainless steel at the base.  My favorite feature is the sliding grind selector; from very fine to very coarse.  I am able to handle it with dirty hands while cooking and it is easily cleaned and disinfected at the end of the night.The well that holds the peppercorns is larger than most which is great that you do not need to constantly re-fill.  The mechanism is smooth and it has been performing wonderfully while being used on a daily basis, minimally twice a day.Highly recommend this pepper grinder for it's ease of use, nice style that easily blends and quality materials.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2OX3WYUE2BJQA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001CDP6EE#wasThisHelpful","R2OX3WYUE2BJQA","A30Z0GG96D11EO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30Z0GG96D11EO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Let's start this review off with the fact that even though the grinding mechanism has a lifetime warranty, I still believe that it is overpriced for a single mill.The wood does feel like real wood and would go wonderfully in a stainless steel environment or mahogany wood colored situation.  I am rather disappointed at the acrylic base.This is not my favorite pepper mill out there.  Through the years there has been much trial and error and I have finally found the best pepper mill for my use.  It is OXO branded with a grind selector at the base.  The materials lend themselves perfectly for being used while I am cooking.  This paper mill has a smaller well and there is not a visible selector but rather you loosen or tighten the bolt at the top.  I hate that way because I either over tighten or loosen to the point of it falling off of the base.It grinds easily enough and there is a discernible difference in the pepper grain sizes.Would have rated 3 stars for the price and grinding size selector but opted for 4 because it feels as if it is a quality product.  This pepper mill will also look nicer on your decorated table for company compared to my hearty all business OXO mill that I have shown in my provided image.

"Recently we had two of our vehicles 8 tires slashed while parked in our driveway.  After these events we have become shaken and uncomfortable in our surroundings.  It doesn't help that we did not have any sort of security system in place.After careful research we opted to purchase the Lorex LH03041TC4W model from another big box store.  Amazon did not have it available for purchase at the time.  This model is different only when it comes to the included hard drive space.  The product above is for a 500gb drive and the one that we purchased is 1TB.  The 1TB drive can record up to 263 hours at the highest setting.  The drive is a security-grade 24/7 recording type that overwrites.Installation for this system is a breeze.  We chose this WIRELESS option because we currently rent our apartment and did not feel like wiring the whole building.  Installation of this system is five stars; keep in mind that each camera must be plugged into an outlet.  We had an outdoor outlet on our balcony (the literature states that they need to be plugged into an indoor outlet) but not for the other camera on the other side of the building.  We did have to drill a hole into the building and fed the wire through there.  The cord that plugs into the camera is only 6 foot long and the power cables that attach to that and into the grounded outlet are also 6 feet long.  This allows you about 12 feet of length for a nearby outlet.  If you will not be drilling holes then I do not see how you could possibly install these cameras outdoors, short of leaving a window open (wouldn't recommend that!).  When drilling the hole we recommend that you use a half-inch drill bit.From the moment the system was turned on, the cameras were visible to the system.  The reason this product loses a star is because the cameras are not PTZ.  There is no auto-focus or any focus for that matter.  There is no optical zoom only a digital zoom for zooming in on certain areas while connected to the Stratus DVR.  This makes it rather difficult to discern actual faces and you can forget about license plate numbers.  So far we have not had any connectivity issues via WIFI.  Color saturation is actually nice and in the cool color-tone scheme.  They are supposed to work and turn to black and white color when it is absolutely dark outside.  THIS IS ABSOLUTELY not true! Once evening rolls around (keep in mind this is a summer evening in urban NY)the camera switches to black and white automatically.  This is a big disappointment even if it does render nicely.  The image is clear but is severely lacking any focus.The Lorex Eco Stratus app is easy enough to navigate and operates perfectly on our Android OS phones.  The main issue with the live viewing streaming is the fact that the refresh rate makes it very laggy and jittery.  They claim that it has to do with your internet connection, but we have found that do be a fallacy and an easy excuse thrown out by Lorex.  Our internet connection is strong and viable.  The laggy and jittery issues do not occur when viewing from a dedicated monitor/tv screen.  Even with it's shortcomings it is nice to have access to your camera views online.  We have been able to use the app away from home as long as there was a WIFI or 4G LTE connection.  Another issue with the app is that when accessing the live view at different times you have to connect to the DVR again by pressing the 'save' button in the Device Manager until you see the word CONNECTED.  This is very annoying.  If you are buying this system for the live view from a device then I would suggest that you pass.  It isn't where it should be.  It is a cute little perk that isn't ready for prime time.The loss of one more star is because in the included literature it states that the cameras should be placed in a 'sheltered' location.  It is rather contradictory because they are labeled WEATHERPROOF, yet they want us to shelter them.  Two cameras our currently placed under an open balcony and one is in the open.  I will report back if we have any issues with rain.Recommend if you need an easy to install wireless system with remote viewing access and playback.  The cameras are limited without the focus or zoom functions.  Keep in mind that remote viewing can only be accessed by three devices at one time. After speaking with Lorex customer service (half hour hold time) we were told that these were not PTZ cameras which have the functionality of auto focus and zoom through the Stratus DVR.  Entry level wireless system for home use but not recommended for a business.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1H7IAKB4HOHWA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LS3ROZW#wasThisHelpful","R1H7IAKB4HOHWA","A30Z0GG96D11EO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30Z0GG96D11EO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Personally it think these are just okay. They sound good enough when you’re sitting still and/or when they are securely sitting in your ear canals, but I immediately took them on a 7-mile run the first day and was not impressed at how they held up. They fell out of my ears often. I did try to switch up the sizes, but no combination of the three sizes kept them securely in my ear canals on long runs.I did like the fact the ear phones themselves sat securely on my ears with the help of the clips, but as they slipped out, the sound got tinnier and tinnier. There was very little bass sustained on my runs, and that makes them better than the average dollar-store ear buds, but not a long-term solution.The iPhone features worked fine, and the microphone worked fine for calls, but they fact they kept slipping out on long runs was just too annoying to make them useful.One of my biggest irritations about the headphones that I received, seems to be an anomaly. The description clearly says “3 pairs of soft ear pads included (S/M/L)” but what I got with mine, right out of the box, was a set of medium plugs, and then one each of a large and a small ear pads. The description makes more sense, but I can’t be sure what ships with other headphones.So I suppose as long as you think of these as a cheap solution, you won’t be disappointed.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3BZ3WDHY1ZW6I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004MMEI32#wasThisHelpful","R3BZ3WDHY1ZW6I","A2SPV96SGOEO2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2SPV96SGOEO2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I used to make cold brew by brewing the coffee in one container and then filtering it into another. It's definitely the cheaper way to go, but this is SO convenient! The filter really filters out all the little particles of coffee and the concentrate is very tasty. I have even tried some of the recipes that came with the Toddy.I particularly like that this comes with a glass carafe. There's really nothing I would change. It's a simple thing, making cold brew, but the Toddy just makes it easier.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZYYS2DQ7LVFP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0006H0JVW#wasThisHelpful","RZYYS2DQ7LVFP","A2SPV96SGOEO2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2SPV96SGOEO2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I grew up in an old house with no central heating and we always used electric blankets. I have since moved to a place with no central heating and we only get a little cold in the winter time, but this is so nice and brings back childhood memories. My old electric blankets were not soft; we always had to have a sheet between us and the blanket, but the technology is pretty much the same.This is SO soft and fantastic for lounging on the couch watching TV, or even in bed on a chilly night. It feels like a heating pad for your entire upper body (or you could use it on your legs, but I just curl up in a ball watching TV and wrap it around me. The cord is plenty long enough to plug in and sit on the couch. The only complaint I have is that the controller could be a little closer to the actual wrap because while the cord is long enough, I have to set the control and then put it on the ground because our couch is not that close to the outlet.Overall, I'd buy more of these.

"Overall, this is a very nice setup. The built-in scratching posts have been the most-used part of this whole thing, and the way that the cat is attracted to the posts, I have to wonder if they didn’t dip them in catnip.Aside from the posts, the cat seems indifferent to it in a lot of ways. She’s curious about the hanging bits, but does little more than play with the strings. Our cat is 16 pounds, and clearly too large to comfortably hang out in the little floating loft.All and all – my cat seems to spend more time sitting next to this large thing than sitting on it. It’s also larger than I would have anticipated, which is fine for a much larger room (or in our case, the spare bedroom), but if you’re thinking you can tuck it in the back of the living room, it’s not going to work very well.The set up was a bit interesting. They must have saved a ton on packing, because all the parts came flat in the box (which was nearly 60 pounds). The instructions were lacking, but thanks to another reviewer, I found that building it from the top down was the easiest way to assemble. It took less than 30 minutes total for setup, and my wife and I took our time assembling it.After putting it together, I realize that it can break down pretty easy when we ship it with our household goods. That happens a lot, and this looks like it will break down easily – which is a big plus.So the only cons are that it’s really meant for smaller cats and it’s a bit large. Our cat doesn’t seem to love the four tier concept and still chooses to climb up our entertainment center instead.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RDELQGRP5FJJE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XY250YC#wasThisHelpful","RDELQGRP5FJJE","A2SPV96SGOEO2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2SPV96SGOEO2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I tend to be a bit critical of little docks like this, but this dock pleasantly surprised me.It's constructed well. It feels very heavy duty, and does not tip over when using an iPhone 6 plus, or even, surprisingly, an iPad mini. I also found it surprisingly easy to make speaker calls when using my iPhone 6. The phone still sat comfortably on the base when I was pressing buttons on the phone.The iPad mini was even a bigger surprise because it plugged right into the charger and still had the folding case attached. It charged and synced up no problem.The only down side that I've seen is when using the iPhone 6 plus, for some reason, when I plug it in, the computer chimes twice, as if plugged it in twice. It syncs shortly thereafter and there are no further issues, but that does not happen with an iPhone 5 or the iPad mini.So this has a very sturdy feel, it’s stylish enough to have sitting out on my battle station, and it’s been consistent with charging and syncing. I like it a lot and it's getting a lot of use.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RH8EM1E7O87O5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SW06D5G#wasThisHelpful","RH8EM1E7O87O5","A2SPV96SGOEO2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2SPV96SGOEO2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This seems pretty flimsy. I would not believe that it will last long if you are constantly moving it on and off the door jamb. It just doesn’t feel like a long-term solution.However, we use it as a way to separate the dog and cat, and it works fine. The cat hops over it and the dog gets frustrated.. .the perfect solution. The rest of us adults step over it coming and going so we don’t have to take it off. This is great for our set up, but if you have to traverse it regularly, or the large step is a problem, I don’t think this is the ideal solution and you should probably find something a little more heavy-duty.But if you need something simple – It’s fine, but don’t expect a long life span.

"My wife actually bought this a while ago and used it for various kitchen measurements.At some point in the last 6 months, when I started counting calories, I politely took control of this and started using it many times a day.It’s easy to use – easy to set a tare weight, and gives what I can only assume are correct measurements (they are definitely consistent).  It’s easy to get the measurement for anything from liquids, to meat and anything in between. The size is just about perfect as I can put an entire plate on the surface if I need to.No issues – works great for someone counting every gram of quinoa salad or weight of cooked meat.

"First to address the best part: These speakers sound really good! The sound that comes out is crisp, clear, and it works really well using either Bluetooth or the aux cord, but the aux cord produces more volume. There’s no clipping that I noticed and no distortion running an iPhone to play audio.  The Bluetooth setup was about as smooth as it gets, albeit a tiny bit time consuming.I tried it with different audio sources and had the same results. The spare computer, the laptop and the iPod all sound very good coming out of these speakers. I dragged other people over to listen, and everyone agrees that it’s a full sound, and most were impressed by the bass that comes out of these little speakers. As a simple set of powerful, but compact speakers, this is a great product.Then there were the less-than-ideal parts of this: It’s listed in Amazon as a portable audio product, and the description says that it comes with a portable carrying case; however, I would not describe this as portable. It comes with a very nice case and a TON of plug adapters, so in theory you could definitely take it with you, but then you will still have the power card to the wall, and the interconnecting power cord between the two speakers. So as long as you don’t mind a ton of wires, I guess that’s okay.Side note: Being someone who goes overseas a lot I actually appreciate the included adapters, but I don’t see myself packing up a set of computer speakers, with the necessary cables, to use on short overseas trips – Not when there are one-speaker, battery-powered options available for the same price or less.  The way the wires are connecting the units, this is really better suited for a fixed-solution like in the bedroom or next to a home computer.I do have to admit, when I opened it up I was disappointed at how simple/flimsy they looked. After listening to them, I think that they prove that they are a decent set of little speakers. Not enough to fill a concert hall of course, but I could see using these in a living room or a den to fill the room with sound. Not so much outside because you can’t get a lot of separation between the two speakers, but in a room – these are actually pretty decent.I will admit that the biggest deterrent is the price – They just don’t feel like they should be $145 speakers.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RTWOGQQL7DCZE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YCAVUM6#wasThisHelpful","RTWOGQQL7DCZE","A2SPV96SGOEO2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2SPV96SGOEO2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have a Fitbit Flex (and I've had Fitbits for about 5 years), so I thought it would be good to compare the two.Pros:It's like a Flex - you wear it on your wrist. You can wear it in the shower, but I never do, however it's nice to know that you don't have to worry about small amounts of water (rain, washing dishes).It's cute. I like purple, but it comes in other colors too. It looks like a bracelet, moreso than a Flex.I really like the option of the inactivity alarm. It vibrates and I hop up and walk around for about 5 minutes when it reminds me.Easy to set up.Long battery life.Doesn't seem to not count steps if you are not moving your arms. The Flex sometimes doesn't count activity if I'm on an elliptical trainer because my arms aren't moving too.Cons:The step count difference between my Flex and the Jawbone UP2 is about 2,500 for a 10,000 step day. I routinely walk 10,000+ steps with my Flex, but I have a hard time reaching 10,000 with the UP2. I don't know which one is more accurate but the UP2 didn't give me the option of setting up my step length, which the Fitbit does.The silent alarm, while it worked really well, woke me up nearly an hour before my normal alarm. Then the app would tell me that my sleep was inconsistent. Well, stop waking me up nearly an hour before I asked you to! I turned the silent alarm off after 2 days of it waking me at around 5am (and yes, I did check to make sure that all time settings were correct and that I hadn't made a mistake).It fell off one day while I was crossing the street. Luckily it shot across to the other side of the street and I was able to retrieve it, but if it had just fallen off in the middle of the street, it may have been lost forever. I never had the problem before or since, so it may not have been latched properly.I don't really like that you can't change the band. I haven't had it long enough but my band on my Flex eventually broke, so I was able to replace the band. If the UP2 breaks, you have to replace the whole device. I also like the option of alternate colors or styles as purple doesn't always go with everything.Overall, I like the product. I wouldn't switch from Flex now because it has 5 years of history, but I can see myself wearing both and challenging myself to hit 10,000 steps with both devices.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RHBF1PMFWBOJW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UNW6RAC#wasThisHelpful","RHBF1PMFWBOJW","A2SPV96SGOEO2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2SPV96SGOEO2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I waited for the price to drop on this for a while before upgrading from a 2TB to this one.In that amount of time, there are new products on the market that might have been better, but I’m overall quite satisfied with this one. I’ve got to believe the specs and reviews that say this is one of the better ones to go with for sensitive data; however, of course I also have secondary and tertiary backups.I was not blown away by the speed. Looking at the specs, I was under the distinct impression that I was going to see an improvement in the accessing of files, both on the local computer, and across the network.

"Overall this watch is fine. I saw many complaints of it losing time, but I think that I need more than a couple of weeks to see that effect, because initially I’ve had no problems with keeping the time that I set.It’s also very well publicized that the 12 and the 4 are not the correct Roman Numerals. Personally, I’ve used this as a conversation starter a couple of times. Really it just highlights that this is a nice enough watch, but this isn’t a Rolex. It’s a decent-looking watch where some corners were cut.I don’t appreciate the band though. I have lost a bit of weight recently, and I guess my wrists are kind of thin now, so I have to make it smaller, but my hands area apparently freakishly large, so slipping my hand through the loop is a bit more difficult than it should be.The watch face was larger than I anticipated, but it’s not unwieldy. I can’t wear it with several of my dress shirts because it is pretty large. I like the novelty of being able to look though from the front to the back so that’s a bit of a plus.So if it does start to lose time, I will probably knock down my review, but I gave it three stars because I think it’s okay. It feels fine on my wrist, and so far it hasn’t shown any signs of irritation.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RBRR09VGAYCAJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013JXHKG6#wasThisHelpful","RBRR09VGAYCAJ","A2SPV96SGOEO2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2SPV96SGOEO2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We got this for a small office (20 people) with a caffeine addiction.This is actually an impressive machine. Ours came slightly damaged in shipping, but nothing a hammer couldn’t straighten back out. The setup is pretty darn simple because there’s not a million pieces and knobs. You fill the tank with another pitcher of water when you want more coffee. For some people in my office – that took a little getting used to as more than one office member has made a HUGE mess pouring water into the tank without having a pitcher in the bottom part.The operation really couldn’t be more simple though. Turn on the warmers if you want, or don’t, but making a pot of coffee is as easy as putting coffee in the filter, and running a pot of coffee through.We live in a high-altitude environment, and had to figure out how to adjust the thermostat so that the water gets the right temperature, which was easy except that it would have been very nice to have a little gauge to make sure we got it to the right temperature. We did a lot of trial and error trying to find the right temperature, but once we got there – it was easy.Everyone is satisfied with the coffee and this thing is being used a lot now. So overall, we think it’s a great workhorse. If I had a comment I would say it’s almost too simple. But if you’re just looking for a traditional coffee maker for a bunch of people – this is just fine.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2NAD7274K14MU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0037XIP22#wasThisHelpful","R2NAD7274K14MU","A2SPV96SGOEO2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2SPV96SGOEO2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This printer was very appealing to me because of the Airprint compatibility. I had been using the Epson Expression Home XP-320 Wireless Color Photo Printer with Scanner & Copier, which is also a budget-minded wireless printer, but started showing problems right away. This Canon printer actually seems like a much more solid and easy-to-use product. It's a little larger footprint, compared to other desktop printers, but it has enough positive notes to make it a very decent value.The setup was not difficult. Connecting it to the Windows 10 computer was extremely simple, with the minor annoyance of having to download the driver from the Windows Store. For the purposes of this review I went through the setup process, step by step from both of the getting started guides (there are two). Surprisingly, the step I got completely frustrated on was loading the paper. I had inadvertently failed to push the tray back in after loading the paper, and while in hindsight I can easily see my failure, at the time there were a few annoying minutes attempting to figure out why the paper tray was not being recognized.So putting the printer together was quite simple, and loading the cartridges went very smooth. I really like the fact that the ink cartridges light up when they are securely sitting in the slots (although I am sure that adds cost to the new cartridges).As far as regular operation goes - Using the printer with the home computer is flawless. No issues what-so-ever. Printing is efficient and the quality is every bit of what you would expect out of an $80 printer. I am not one to use proprietary software, but when I used the windows-based scanning applications to scan in some magazine photos, I was satisfied with the result. I scanned some photos at 600 dpi resolution and there were absolutely no issues with recognizing the scanner. Using Adobe Acrobat DC to import both pictures and text was flawless without installing any of the additional software that came with the printer. And I really appreciate not having to install a CD worth of software to use the scanner.Then I moved onto the part I was most excited about - printing from my iPhone. Set up for that was actually easier than the desktop. All I had to do was scan the QR code from the instructions, download the app - then print a photo from my camera roll. The quality of the photo was average, but it wasn't the perfect result. The scanned photo I attached, shows that for some reason there was a line that printed down the side of the photo.  There's also no way to adjust the size or the placement of the photo (that I saw) but if you just want to print something off in a hurry - it's great. If you want a photo suitable for framing, I imagine you'll be printing from your computer instead.The next part was better. I had just been working on an Excel Spreadsheet that I had saved to my MS OneDrive. I wasn't optimistic when I went to ""print documents"" and saw only Mobile and iCloud as options, but one more click to get to ""Other Documents"" and it gave me the option of Dropbox, Google Drive or OneDrive. That was all I could have expected - but then it got better. I pulled up the email and just started printing. It was effortless to print an email from my iPhone - and I can see a BIG use for that. The only problem with that was it seemed to take a while, and I could only print the entire email (not just page one) but the double sided printing helped to minimize the waste.That’s the majority of my experience. There were of course features that I didn’t/haven’t gotten around to using yet, but so far I like this a LOT better than other low-cost wireless printer options. But my biggest complaint will be the cost of the ink cartridges. A rough search shows that an entire new set of ink cartridges is over $90 on Amazon… that’s steep. This thing better take a long time to go through ink.Other thoughts:- The eco setting that allows you to use two-sided printing was a surprisingly refreshing addition to a desktop printer. I liked that aspect of the printer a lot.- I am not a fan of having the five different ink cartridges, although I am sure that in the long run it may, possibly, be better than the all-in-one ink cartridges.-The double sided printing takes a while. As long as you have time to spare, it's fine.-When I max this out on 600 dpi scan from the Windows scanning app, it’s slow. The two pics attached are direct scans, the scone is a magazine cover. It’s not horrible, but I’m not overly impressed with the scanning quality.-I never did successfully scan from the printer to the computer, but I assume that’s because I refused to install from the CD. That really wasn’t a show-stopper.-The printer I got said black on the order slip, but I was delivered a white one. I don’t particularly like the white since it looks like it’s going to get dirty easily and discolor quickly. I assume the people ordering the white envision it fitting right in with the Apple eco system, and I’m sure it will, but black is slimming – the white makes it look like something from the 90’s.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R22E5B7H8W8WAN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013C0ZHLQ#wasThisHelpful","R22E5B7H8W8WAN","A2SPV96SGOEO2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2SPV96SGOEO2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Full disclosure: I really got Furbacca for me, the 41-year-old Dad, more than I did for my 9-year-old son. Our house has definitely housed Furbies in the past, and I distinctly remember the Furby-rush of 1999.When it arrived, I only played with Furbacca one night before relinquishing it to the 9-year-old boy. It does look like he likes to play with it more than me, but I’d also say that he might be on the higher end of the age-demographic for this toy, because my 11-year-old, who normally is all over small cuddly animals, really didn’t give it a second glance after I showed it to him. The 9-year-old though, bought right in.The app is a fairly large-sized one on iOS (won’t download over a cellular connection and my son ran out of room on his iPad) but it didn’t take too long to download and it worked fine on his first gen iPad Mini. I personally think the game is not the most exciting part of the deal, but it kept him entertained for a little while. In fact, my 9-year-old says that the app is the best part because of the interactive games and the ability to change the colors of the light-saber-shower, etc… He was simply amused by the app and found it interesting.Personally, I prefer to set Furbacca on the floor and let it mess with the animals in the house. The cat doesn’t go anywhere near him, and the dog seemed genuinely distressed when Furbacca was “talking” to her.As far as normal operation goes – The eyes and the mannerisms of the Furby are just as cute as they were with the first generation. There's a lot of movement going on with the rocking back and forth and movement of facial features, but I think the LED eyes aren't a very big battery draw.But back to my original thoughts – I think this was meant for Dad and Mom and not the kids. It retails for $30 more than normal Furbies, and there’s not that much of a difference except the Star Wars licensing and the cute bandolier. And the app of course, with the ability to collect the virtual Star Wars Furby Furblings; the first in the game being Han Solo. I liked the nostalgia and I am pleased that my son likes it too.And one last afterthought - Furbacca will interact with other Furbies - and it's pretty darn funny actually. They sit there and talk to each other. It's pretty cute.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1RBPLZW0JB6BN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TV0T0HY#wasThisHelpful","R1RBPLZW0JB6BN","A2SPV96SGOEO2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2SPV96SGOEO2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I took my favorite Bluetooth speaker to the office and no longer had one in my kitchen, so I was so happy when this one came along. It's surprisingly good for a $15 speaker (but again, it IS a $15 speaker, so it's not the greatest quality ever). It's sufficient for the kids and me to listen to the news and some fun podcasts in the morning while making breakfasts and lunch.I would say the worst thing about it is that you have to hang it somewhere, but I found a cabinet handle that is rarely used and hung it there. It says it's water resistant, but I would be reluctant to use it in the shower as it has to be hung somewhere (I currently have a Bluetooth speaker in the shower that suctions to the wall, which is much better for a shower speaker).I'd buy another one if I needed another small speaker in another part of the house. It's good quality for the price.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R20SMAICUOX833/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011W7IA42#wasThisHelpful","R20SMAICUOX833","A2SPV96SGOEO2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2SPV96SGOEO2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I picked these up for mostly home use, but they are actually quite convenient to have around the house as well. Handling discarded food is a great example (like after a party) and where we live, we need to sort food from the regular trash, so these are actually nice when we have to clean up after some forgetful kids.The came in a small, but they fit equally well over my wife’s tiny hands and my average-sized man-hands. My only ding came when using them to open mail (Where I work we have to screen the mail) and the picture I attached showed how fast they ripped after opening 5 boxes. That did not impress me. I don’t think they snagged on the box, I think they just tore from pressure.They are latex free (important for me) and do not leave a powdery residue which is excellent. They feel heavy duty when I’m wearing them and that’s a plus. They come off easily and go right in the trash.Overall they were fine. I’m not sure about the way the first one ripped the minute I used it – but for my purposes, that’s usually not a show-stopper (although I can see in some uses where it would be).","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R123ZJZ1KZVDBI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004BR8KXC#wasThisHelpful","R123ZJZ1KZVDBI","A2SPV96SGOEO2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2SPV96SGOEO2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It takes a little time to adjust to. It's difficult to balance on at first. I use it on my office chair and I have armrests on that chair, but if I didn't, I could see feeling like I was going to lose my balance.I like that it makes me sit up straight. If I start to slouch, my back starts to hurt, so I sit properly. I am up and down all the time during my work day, so I haven't had any numb butt issues, but the one day that I didn't have to stand up as often I did start to see what others reviewers were talking about.

"We've had a Withings WS-50 Smart Body Analyzer, Black scale for over a year and a half, and while it's been great overall, I felt like some of the readings were inconsistent (mostly a person's body fat percentage) and so I looked forward to finding something new and comparing it.First of all - the setup was pretty easy over all. The most confusing part seemed to be which app to download, because there are a couple options in the (Apple) app store. I downloaded the wrong one at first, but the app quickly pointed that out. So that wasn't terribly painful. The hardest thing about the setup was getting the app to sync (didn't happen the first time) but once the phone found the scale - it's remained perfectly synced ever since.The scale itself is very pleasant to look at - so if aesthetics is important to you - then this should be a very nice addition to your bathroom.This scale replaced a simple, digital scale in the bathroom where it ended up, and the difference is amazing. This scale is much more consistent with other scales, like the scale at the gym and the other Withings scale in the house. So from what my family has seen, this is far more accurate than other, cheaper scales that had been using in this specific location. Which makes sense because the retail price is a lot higher than the cheap scale it replaced.A big plus the primary user likes is the temperature and humidity levels of the room it's located in. I will add that's hard to gauge how accurate it is, but it seems like a nice feature.The integration with the App is essential, and to me, this is where this scale pulls ahead of the Withings scale. It was easier to sync overall (although not by a whole lot) but after having used the Withings App for a year and a half, I really appreciate the different measurements that this scale and app has to offer. Specifically, I like that this app has body water, muscle mass and bone mass measurements (although I am extremely suspicious of the bone mass measurements) in addition to Weight, BMI and body fat percentage.Initially when using the app, it seemed reluctant to bring up any measurement other than weight, and it took me a while to figure out what I was doing wrong. Admittedly that wasn't my favorite part. Overall I feel the app could definitely be more intuitive. The other downside to the app is that it, of course, is trying to sell you on the entire ecosystem of the manufacturer’s products. It will only give you complete readings if you buy the blood pressure device, and activity and sleep monitor, pulse oximeter, etc... The activity and sleep function can collect data from the iPhone, but for the most part, I felt like the app is really trying to get me to buy into all the products they sell, instead of concentrating on making this app the best it can be.That all said, even with the app's disappointment, I gave it five stars because the scale works great. It gets the data to my iPhone and I can see everything that I'm looking for. I like the expanded options that my Withings does not have, and appreciate that from here on out, I can monitor some functions on a daily basis.In the end – this ended up being the primary scale for our college-age daughter. She is thrilled with it and uses it often. She says that it’s quite motivating to see progress, even if it’s slight. She had no problems setting it up, and appreciates that it’s more accurate than what she was using before. The rest of us kind of like it too –and I like comparing the two scales.TL;DR: It’s been a great scale for setup, use and data tracking. We’re very pleased.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1RDCZVDCTWEB3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Y2N86JI#wasThisHelpful","R1RDCZVDCTWEB3","A2SPV96SGOEO2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2SPV96SGOEO2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Installation went well. Adobe automatically uninstalled previous versions of Adobe Acrobat which is pretty expected at this point. I was prompted for a serial number which I find annoying, but still necessary I suppose. I will admit that this is the first time that I have installed a program from a CD ROM in over a year. It felt very nostalgic.I will also add that the oversized package had no documentation at all – just a list of features on the cover and inside box flap, and a CD ROM. I expected the program to be largely intuitive with no documentation.After the setup was finished (about 8 minutes from the CD) and did require a restart from my 64 bit version of Windows 7. After the restart, I had to log in with my Adobe Live Account. Not thrilled about that part of the process as it seemed very unnecessary for my home use of this product.  Finally – about 15 minutes later – I am able to start working.The very first form I open and try to edit, I get this error message: “This form cannot be edited in Adobe Acrobat DC. Please use Adobe LiveCycle Designer to edit this form”.Let me reiterate – I am a home user. This was trying to edit a form widely available from the internet. That’s the only explanation given. So I have no idea why.Next I tried to edit a file that I scanned into Adobe using Acrobat X, and editing text there. I got a series of error messages.  At this point I had used the product less than 30 minutes total and was already finding it less functional than Adobe Professional X.And that ended up being me experience. My previous version of Adobe Acrobat did all the same things, but with less error message. I was already able to export PDFs, scan searchable text, use eSignatures, combine files, and all the other big features that were advertised on the box. Only easier.So if this is the evolution of Adobe Acrobat - it’s not user-friendly. I will most likely uninstall this and reinstall an earlier version of Acrobat Professional. This just wasn’t a positive evolution.

"Overall these headphones are fine for use when not moving around a lot. I didn't fall in love with them and I just don't see me using them on a regular basis because of the shortcomings.To start off with, I'm not sure what the industry standard is for being able to claim ""Noise Canceling"" but I am confident these headphones meet the minimum standards and do not exceed that. Perhaps my ears are larger than the average user, but these don't seem to completely cover my earlobes, and so I have a feeling that ambient sounds are coming through that way.Overall, using these both at home and on 2 long flights from Mexico to Boston and back – I don't see them being that special. I much prefer the Bose style that covers the entire ear. The company says that the noise cancelling feature allows you to have the volume set lower and still drown out other sounds, but I have found this to be a very subjective claim.The biggest problem I had with this set of headphones is the length of the cord and the size of the controller. All told – the length of the cable from the input plug to the headphones is little bit over 5 feet long. That coupled with the rather large sized inline controller, and the cord is actually quite unwieldy.  It’s not comfortable walking around at all, and is only tolerable when sitting for long periods. That makes it okay for the airplane (assuming you don’t need to stand up often) but for use around the house with three young boys making noise in the background – this whole set is not very practical.I will say that I appreciate that they added a belt clip to the controller (knowing that it’s going to have to be secured when walking) but that’s one more thing to clip to my belt.  Even as I sit here typing this review, the relatively heavy controller piece keeps slipping off my lap and yanking on the headset. These headphones have shown me that I STRONGLY prefer noise cancelling headphones with the battery in the ear pieces.The monitor function seems unique, and while I can appreciate it being there for the Captain’s announcements on the airplane, I found myself just using the pause button on my iPhone instead.And lastly on the complaint list – I’m going to forget to turn it off. An auto off feature seems like a must for this type of device.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R28Y1LWZJGUJTW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0028E4SF4#wasThisHelpful","R28Y1LWZJGUJTW","A2SPV96SGOEO2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2SPV96SGOEO2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Wow – I am blown away by the Schleich line of prehistoric animals. This one was so impressive I wanted to go back and give other brands (like lower reviews because I have not seen anything like the quality of this guy.  Moreover, this particular line of dinosaurs is way better than Schleich’s lower-priced toys – The sub-ten dollar range.My ten-year-old, who LOVES dinosaur action features, loved this one.

This guy feels heavy-duty. The balance is perfect, and frankly, I considered leaving it on my office desk because it’s actually darn near a work of art.

"I admit I was a bit skeptical when I ordered this.My first concern was the range of the Bluetooth capability, but when I press the button my keys will ring across the house - far better than my Wi-Fi Signal. So far I'm actually impressed.The app is pretty simple, but of course requires access to your location at all times. No real surprise there I guess.I also tried the feature where you can use your smartphone as a token, to locate the phone, but I don't find that any different than find my iPhone, so I guess I missed the point.For grins, I attached it to the dog (who tends to run away) but since the max range is about 150 feet, I had to pretty much be in sight of the moving animal. Not optimal for that.But it did work well enough that I find that I probably need to get some more tokens. I would prefer the ability to replace the battery when necessary and not just replace the token after a year, but I suppose that's not a huge price to pay (You get a discount if you buy in bulk).All told I like it. I don't have a wide range of reference because I haven't used one of these lost and found items before, but this worked flawlessly the first time. It seems to stay connected when I go in and out of range, and it's not terribly intrusive.Other observations:-The tone from the token is quite loud for me. I think you could hear it well if you had it attached to your keys, in your pants pocket in the bottom of the laundry basket.- The token is not exactly small, but it's not ridiculous. It does make my key chain a bit bigger.- It's fine for keys or the dog's collar, but if I want to put it on something else, I need to pull out the double stick tape or Velcro.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R11WYYB9RKMSV4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011HT9AL2#wasThisHelpful","R11WYYB9RKMSV4","A2SPV96SGOEO2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2SPV96SGOEO2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Well first of all - this is a very slick looking case. I think it's a bit bigger than I would like, but my computer components pretty much dictated I go with one of these larger models. But it does not disappoint in outward appearance. The polished black look could be confused for a nice stereo and the minimalist front design (2 switches, 4 inputs, a light and the CD portion) is very smooth. Appearance-wise. This is a great case.I did notice that when I screwed in, and then unscrewed the power supply. The black paint had already chipped away. That makes me wonder how this will hold up to scratching and general wear and tear and if it will still look so pretty in the next few months, but for now it's slick.I really appreciate how much work went into making sure that this box will hold as many components as possible while still keeping the functionality of a nice computer case. The three fans is a very nice touch, and thankfully they do include an adapter because I can't find a month board that has that many unused fan power supplies on the MB.The case is only as big as it needs to be. It's barely wide enough for a Micro ATX board, but it fits. My only complaint is that with most new motherboards, the eSata cables are all sticking off to the side (and not straight up) and as a result, most are RIGHT next to the front of this case. I think they kept that in mind because there is just enough room that you can play with the eSata cables. It's not perfect, but I think they did the best they could with that the motherboard industry is producing now.While it's a bit crowded, I think the manufacturer did a great job of using all available space. The mounts for a SSD and a larger 3.5"" hard drive is nearly genius. I loved the concept, but unfortunately I ended up taking it apart and putting it back together a lot because of a motherboard failure. But the third time building and rebuilding the system, I got the hang of it.I thought the price of the case was a bit much. I think the price point should be under $100 based on other cases, but I also really liked this one and thought that overall it's a very well thought out case. I did have my suspicions about how long it will stay pretty (because of the way the paint easily chips off at the screw points) but for now - I just can't give it anything less than 5 stars because I am so impressed at how they managed to make everything fit well. I would caution that if you're buying a power supply for this case - get a modular one so you can minimize the number of cables. It will be to your benefit because over near the power supply those cables start stacking up quick and it's not super-easy to tie them down because if you ever have to replace something - you'll have to cut all the ties and start over.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJU7UX8CYNIGY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008J0ZOV8#wasThisHelpful","RJU7UX8CYNIGY","A2SPV96SGOEO2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2SPV96SGOEO2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Bought this for my nine-year-old's birthday - and he absolutely loved it. He adored the illustrations and has gone through all the books twice now.He also helped his older brothers, 10 and 12, to discover these  timeless classics.If there was a downside, it's that the fancy books don't hold up well when dragged all round the city, on family vacations, etc... The books get dirty quickly and are already showing significant wear. Which is not great for an expensive set of comics.

"I'll start with the only con I could see: the smell. It smells like burning plastic when it's laminating. But this is the first hot laminator I have ever owned (I owned cold ones in the past that rolled the item through two plastic sheets), and it's perfect for my needs.I like that it's small. It takes up very little space. So when you are not using it, it fits perfectly in a drawer out of sight.It heats up fast. It was less than 5 minutes from when I turned it on. The ""ready"" light turned from white to green when it was ready.I laminated a few small items in the sheets, because I hate wasting, and I was able to cut around them and not have them come apart. One of the things was even slightly thicker (needed the 5 mil setting) and it came out really good.Overall, happy with this item.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1R74ARV6X9L02/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZI7MI96#wasThisHelpful","R1R74ARV6X9L02","A2SPV96SGOEO2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2SPV96SGOEO2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I researched microcurrent technology and I found no journal articles stating that microcurrent works for either wrinkles or scars. There's been no conclusive evidence so far.That said, I tested this for 2.5 weeks when I was alone without my family. This was perfect because then I could see what they thought when I returned. I used it 6 days a week and did the full treatment (with the original trainer and the ele attachment) nearly every day (there were probably 3 days out of the entire 2.5 weeks where I didn't have time for the Ele attachment). When I returned, no one noticed anything different.I had one coworker who told me I look good, well-rested. But there are so many variables there, being away from the family and work for 2.5 weeks could have been the reason for looking well-rested, I cannot attribute that to the NuFace.I, personally, did notice that my lips plump slightly when using the ele attachment. I noticed it particularly when doing half of my face (which is actually what they recommend). But it was no greater than the plumping I get from my favorite lip gloss.Overall, I personally wouldn't spend the money on this.

"Let me first caveat this review with I’m a huge George Forman Grill fanboy. We’ve used many electric grills, to include several in the George Foreman line for years, and have been very pleased with the results. Being a family that’s fairly health-conscious and on-the-go a lot, the grills fit perfectly in our lifestyle.And that’s probably the biggest reason that I was so excited about this griddle. I had visions of massive feasts on the weekends and even getting up earlier during the week to cook lavish breakfasts for the six of us, before we all go off to work and school. I was sure it would be perfect!Well after a couple of weeks, I see it’s a little less than perfect.For one, after less than ten uses, I can already see marks on the surface where the heating element is. It’s basically stained the top side of the griddle. It’s not a show stopper, but it’s a little unsightly for a device that has been used for less than two weeks. Couple that with the fact that I never turned it past 4 on the heating element, I don’t see why it shows wear that fast, unless that’s just expected.The cooking is more or less even – but not perfect. I find that I have had to learn the sweet spot on where to cook the eggs and pancakes, as the surface temperature seems to be significantly different, and changes depending on how many inches you move the food.  I did notice that a simple pancake recipe seemed a little more challenging (sticking to the griddle, turning too dark too fast, etc.. ) but over time I was again able to find the sweet spot.I’m not thrilled with the way it cooks the turkey bacon that we usually throw on, as it seems uneven in cooking compared to when we cooked everything on the cast iron griddle.Now the good parts: I tried cooking some Mexican chorizo and it cooked the sausage perfectly right on the top part (this is where I learned that splatter was a tiny issue with really greasy food). It does clean up super-easy, although we are still looking for where to store this thing when we’re not using it. The little removable trays are perfect and dishwasher safe. I do like that the power cord easily unplugs either for an emergency or for cleaning/storage.  I also appreciated how easy it was to run a paper towel over the surface, while I was cooking, to make room for other food. That’s probably one of the nicer parts about cooking a larger breakfast was the fewer dishes used and the easy clean up while you go.So this wasn’t perfect, and I dare say that I was a bit disappointed by my expectations, but once you get the hang of it, and learn from the flaws, it cooks eggs and pancakes pretty well. I haven’t used it for the fajita function yet (although I’d kind of love to try that soon) and so I can see possibilities.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RF6WD9K3394Y5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TQIZL38#wasThisHelpful","RF6WD9K3394Y5","A2SPV96SGOEO2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2SPV96SGOEO2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I always find reviews of supplements are so difficult to quantify. With supplement usage in general, I’m not sure how much is in my head, and how much of the effects are attributable to actual success of the product.To start off with – I like the taste of the watermelon. It went down like a regular Gatorade (not the G2) and there wasn’t a hideous after-taste. This made daily servings something I actually looked forward to. I only had experience with Blue Raspberry from this manufacturer, so I was happy that this was tasty.One of the major selling points for me was the claim (not FDA Verified of course) that it can help with muscle recovery/soreness. For the last several months I’ve really be ramping up my running routine (up to ten miles at a time – 4-5 times a week) and since I’m doing that on hills – I’ve had some mad-soreness in my calves that’s been lingering.So after less than a week of taking this regularly, the persistent soreness in my calves faded away. The caveat is I have NO way of proving that this actually helped, or if after several weeks of ramping up my workout my muscles had finally gotten comfortable. But it’s a positive nonetheless.On the other hand – about a week ago I jumped back into the gym with a killer upper body routine – I am still sore 6 days later and after drinking this every day at least once a day; however, since correlation does not causation, I can’t tell for sure if this isn’t having any effect, or if the soreness would have been worse. For that matter I can’t be sure that I didn’t strain something trying to do too many reps in the gym, but what is clear is that despite my previous success with my calves, this didn’t have the same magic effect on my biceps and forearms.  Mind you – I don’t think it hurt, but I can’t tell for sure that it helped.I will add that I personally can’t drink this before a workout. It’s really thirst-quenching after a workout, and I’ll usually mix it up with ice, have a full shaker, and then pour more water on top of the ice to retain the flavor. But trying to take it before a run (as is subtly suggest on the product’s webpage) is a non-starter. Assuming a similar reaction, I have not had this before a gym workout.And finally – And it’s hard to put this correctly for a G-rated review, but to me – there’s a side effect that I haven’t seen listed in any product description… but after taking this product for a couple of weeks, I’ve had an increase in blood flow in certain areas of my body. Again – it’s impossible to say that this particularly supplement caused that… but to me (assuming it’s not all in my head) there has definitely been more blood flow to areas of my body where that’s a good thing.For those reasons – I am probably hooked, and this will be a mainstay in my supplement program. Overall I really appreciate the effects that I’m seeing.Lastly – my parting words are make sure to read the fine print before you order… I did not see this when I placed the order, and it would not have affected my decision, but it would have been nice to have this in larger letters: “Do not use this product if you are pregnant, nursing, or are currently taking nitrates for chest pain or if you are taking medication used to treat erectile dysfunction such as PDE-5 inhibitors… Discontinue use 2 weeks prior to surgery.” That almost sounds ominous.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3ECF6C9FK4U2B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VAS21PS#wasThisHelpful","R3ECF6C9FK4U2B","A2SPV96SGOEO2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2SPV96SGOEO2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

We have them on a monthly delivery, and every time it seems they are packed with larger items and end up getting to us a little crushed.

Unless you are meticulous about it - the pieces don't get cut perfectly the first time (at least not with straight Nutella sandwiches).

"I am a military guy with pretty short hair, so when I found a gel that worked for me - I've stuck with it.Normally I use Herbal Essences Set Me Up Gel, Maximum Hold, 6 oz because it's proven to hold up pretty well.I tried this dove Styling gel because it was available, and I have been pleasantly surprised at how it compares to my usual brand of hair gel. The most noticeable difference from this and the gel I normally use is that this is very light and washes off my hands a lot easier than my normal stuff. The gel itself holds about the same, and can be easily managed when brushed or blow-dried. It's not particularly amazing at actually holding my hair, but it's still very comparable.The fact that it washes off my hands right away is a very positive point and one that will probably be good enough to make me switch brands.

"For many years in the military I have always carried a Gerber multi-tool (in a sheath – not like this with the clip on the device itself), and I really didn’t think that I was going to be very open to change. The way a Gerber opens is significantly different, and based on muscle memory alone, I did not have high hopes for this particular device.To my surprise, I have really grown to like this little guy.Being self-contained, it’s much easier to remove from my belt loop, but I have been more prone to slipping this in my front pocket rather than leaving it exposed. The change in habit with the way I open it took a little bit to get used to, but it’s been growing on me for the last week. I can now easily remove and flip open the pliers with one hand, but closing it back is still a two-handed operation.Once I spent the appropriate amount of time wearing it in, the parts started to move more easily. It comes well-greased (still a little bit of grease obvious when I opened it up) and so after a few days it really felt a lot more natural to use. It doesn’t take long before the press of the  button gets easier and the pliers pop right open. I still don’t think it’s a fluid as the motion of opening pliers on a Gerber multi-tool, but I can certainly see where I can get used to this too.The Swiss-Army tools that come are all standard and effective. The can opener and bottle opener came in handy very shortly after I got it. I really like the ruler (both in inches and centimeters) as an extra. That might be standard now, but it’s a nice touch. The awl is quite sharp although I’m not sure when that will come in handy, but the main blade is also pretty sharp (at least for now) and that will come in handy as I tend to use these multi tools a much for cutting open packages and boxes as much as anything else.The biggest selling point is the Lifetime Warranty. That’s where I get sold. I like tools like this to last for a long time, and if they will stand behind it (presumably) to replace it if it is defective years from now – then that tells me a lot. Ur firstSo overall there are no issues. My only caveat would be that if you are switching from using another brand, there’s a few habits that need to change. But I like the thinner form factor and the continued ability to use the pliers with one hand.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R33N8ENNMODJVR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TT9X4L0#wasThisHelpful","R33N8ENNMODJVR","A2SPV96SGOEO2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2SPV96SGOEO2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

ANY other board game box would be better than this. If it were just a card game, the box it comes in would be fine, but you at least have to keep the apples to write on somewhere in addition to the cards.If you are playing with family members or people you know really well, you will know the handwriting right away and it takes away the anonymity.

He read the entire thing in the morning, then picked it up to re-read it in the afternoon. I’m sure he’s gone through it a couple of times since then.In our house we always feel it’s better to read something rather than nothing, so while the jokes and themes aren’t exactly deep reading, we feel that if he really enjoys it – then it’s a success.The 10-year-old also read it but his response was a bit more mundane.

"From the minute the UPS guy delivered it, the 10-year-old immediately began to put this together. With absolutely no help from anyone else, he was able to pretty much instantly put together the configurations just by looking at the box. When his 9-year-old brother came home, they spent hours coming up with different possibilities.If there was a down-side to this set, it was that the set did not come with any action figures. The product really promotes the “Create a WWE Superstar” collection, but we found that using the WWE Battle Pack was more economical (half the price), and just as satisfying for the kids.After the 10-year-old had pretty much moved on from constant playing with the toy, the 9-year-old (I’m convinced that he’s a future engineer) really enjoyed taking it apart and putting it back together. The use of the wrestlers of course was an added bonus, but he really enjoyed making the shapes on the boxes and event trying his own designs. So that’s the aspect that I liked the most. It really brought out his creativity in putting the set together and then breaking it apart and trying again. There really wasn’t any frustration expressed by either kid, except when trying to take some of the pieces apart (they can be pretty tight for 9-year-old hands). Worth noting: The 1-year-old had little-to-no interest in this product.So aside from some pieces being a little tight, and the fact that they don’t throw in any courtesy action figures, this is actually a lot of fun. Even though they get more enjoyment out of making the different rings than they do from actually using it to stage wrestling matches!I should probably caveat that where we are stationed, we actually watch a LOT more Mexican wrestling than WWE (We attend Lucha Libre matches regularly) and so my kids gravitated towards the WWE packs with the masked Luchador. That’s worth a compliment to the WWE marketing folks.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R19OXWCHFZE7K4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00T03TFCW#wasThisHelpful","R19OXWCHFZE7K4","A2SPV96SGOEO2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2SPV96SGOEO2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"So we're not avid snorkelers - but this is by far the best set that we've tried.Mind you we don't normally spend a lot of cash on this sort of item, so our expectations are low, but this set worked really well for us.The kids tried it first (9 and 10 year old boys) and they had no issues with sizing. So then Dad (with a significantly larger head) was easily able to adjust and use it right away with no issues. It was refreshing how easy it was to make adjustments and go (unlike much cheaper alternatives).After a few hours of total use, we all like it a lot. Dad had to learn to keep his head down, but the feature that stops water from being inhaled accidentally is nice. None of us ever had any problems with fogging and that was a big plus.

"I used these to hang Christmas tree lights across a long metal I-beam. The only issue that I had with them is that surface had to be REALLY clean for them to stick, and since it was a metal beam, it didn’t get cleaned very often.So as I was about to knock one star off, I realized that they specifically included extra sticky parts so that if you do end up not being able to use some of the devices, you can just reattach and start over. So that’s a plus.Aside from having to be pretty darn clean, they worked perfectly. I have the lights dangling directly from being attached and it’s working fine. None of them fell off after-the-fact, and the kind-of humid environment seems to have no impact. ‘As long as you can stick this on a flat, clean, non-porous surface, they should be perfect for your needs.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R34K2NR5H2851A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SH2CDCG#wasThisHelpful","R34K2NR5H2851A","A2SPV96SGOEO2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2SPV96SGOEO2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I wasn't trying to do anything earth-shattering with this adapter. I was trying to upgrade the on-board wifi of a simple PC build to connect with my 802.11ac router.

It barely connected to the router at all, and the speeds using the n channel with the on-board wifi card were better than with this adapter. We're talking one room (albeit two walls) over. I wasn't going for across the entire house.In the same room as the router, the speeds were fine and I could stream HD video even, but I guess I just expected more.

"This was exactly what I was looking for.I was trying to get away from caffeine drinks in the morning as I’ve really been watching my calories lately. I dropped cokes months ago – and recently stopped drinking Red Bulls. I’ve been using this to slowly transition off of Starbuck’s on weekdays, and I’ve seen positive results.I only take one pill in the a.m., and try not to consume any caffeine after that. So far my body has agreed with this. No jitters and overall a fairly rejuvenated morning/afternoon.A small bonus is the 8% recommended daily allowance of calcium.

"genre: fantasy, erotica, romancesetting: alternate modern dayformat: stand aloneThis book stars Ann, a young lady fresh out of college. The main plot joins her with her three attractive men to do good deeds. There is a weak romantic/erotic subplot (menage) between him & him & him & her, thus the title and cover art.The best aspect of the book was the portrayal of Ann at work with a nasty boss (female). Ann manages to be assertive without getting nasty or aggressive, and I thought that those passages were a wonderful role model for us all. The second best aspect of the book was the creative magic system and curse terms. Those bought this book the 2nd star, where otherwise I would have rated this book 1 star.Now, for the negatives. Expect anti-military plot elements, no emotions (which makes it really hard to buy into the romance), explicit erotica (which somehow is still boring), over-the-top goody two shoes good deeds (nice but again pretty boring to read about), an amazingly bad  portrayal of soldiers (the author has obviously spent no time with any enlisted man or officer), and a lackluster romance (it reads like a business arrangement or friendship). The dialog is excellent between Ann and her boss, but bad between Ann and her three guys.

"This PNR could have been excellent.Instead, the leading lady is beyond TSTL. Here is her thought process every time a dangerous group of thugs wants to hurt her:  I'm safe here under guard, I hate being guarded, I must assert my independence by sneaking away from my guards and wandering around in dark alleys by myself.Her behavior qualifies in my opinion as criminally negligent, endangering her babies' lives. Three times! She lies to her allies and is not capable of learning from past mistakes. Her mind boggling stupidity results in her babies being born very prematurely, likely causing damage on top of her irresponsible choice to drink caffeine and alcohol during pregnancy. I could be wrong about the alcohol, but it sure seemed that she served everyone, herself included. She shows the total lack of judgement and selfishness of a maladjusted three year old, or maybe an out if control / rebellious teen in desperate need of therapy. If it were just her life on the line, I could look past this, but not when she is pregnant and risking her babies at such an incredibly vulnerable time. That is just plain wrong.If you can ignore her appalling behavior (and I can't), the writing quality is good and the universe is interesting.

"Genre: fantasy, romance, eroticaSetting: alternate modern dayFormat: standaloneThis book contains two novellas. Neither one is terribly outstanding, and both will be better reading experiences if you don't expect 4- or 5-star books. These novellas lack the innovation and charm of Dohner's earlier writing, with her daring plots that pushed the reader's comfort zone. As happens with most authors, the technical aspects of writing have improved with time, while the plots have devolved into low-risk standard plots. These two novellas are good enough to provide an enjoyable read, if you don't expect too much. Think ""Harlequin"" in a paranormal romance.The first novella is a sweet romance that brings together a widow and widower, both grieving for their losses. The strength of this story is for that interpersonal drama of healing past wounds, and a bit of interesting dynamic of how the New Species ""date."" This was the better idea, but too sad for me.The second novella is a ""second chance at love"" story. It has an interesting premise. The leading lady was effectively raised as per a New Species, and is just released. Her behavior and past is fascinating. Alas, her romance is pretty dull stuff. It would have made a better book if either her romance was eliminated entirely or she ended up with a different guy. Warning: contains rape and a slew of post sexual assault issues.

"The plot of this book is exactly as the title foretells. It is an erotic encounter between two strangers: casual sex without any expectation of seeing each other. The scifi setting was fascinating, as was the cyborg technology and role in society. That was definitely the best characteristic of the short story, and my enjoyment of this short story was entirely for the scifi aspects. The erotic encounter itself was not as well done, very lackluster. It seemed very abrupt with no apparent attraction beforehand---an obligatory sex scene.","2.0 out of 5 stars","September 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2HPBJFVAFN8TP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0136XWO4W#wasThisHelpful","R2HPBJFVAFN8TP","A26F5B12T242LL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A26F5B12T242LL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Though I adored the early books in this series, I found the later books so disappointing that I stopped reading entirely. Many prior books were boring multi-view monsters that included scads of alternate views to be ""charming"" looks into prior characters' lives---but I just found a waste of time & money. (Hint to authors: it isn't charming.) Or, worse, the alternate views described a totally irrelevant alternate plot that in no way connected to the main characters, and thus an actual insult to my spending good money on the book. So when this book started into the multiple view hopping, I got quite nervous.To my immense surprise (and pleasure), the multiple viewpoints in this book actually work together to form an interesting plot that otherwise could not be done. Most conflicts from prior books stemmed from problems that have been resolved in this universe, and instead of dragging things out unnecessarily, the author took a creative and interesting new direction. My only complaints are that this book is unlikely to have good re-read potential; and the leading lady was a bit too prone to melodramatic whining---but that is an issue with most of Singh's leading ladies.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1POGHZVB399U7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OQS4EMM#wasThisHelpful","R1POGHZVB399U7","A26F5B12T242LL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A26F5B12T242LL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"genre: romance, scifi, eroticasetting: spaceshipsformat: standalone novelA female engineer (J--) is assigned to control & manage a dangerously hostile cyborg (R--). Managing a cyborg is her life dream, so J-- is willing to do whatever it takes to make their relationship work. After years of abuse by humans, R-- is reluctantly impressed with J-- ... and wildly attracted.This book contains a wealth of elements that really impressed me. J-- was submissive without being vapid and brainless; she was likable in her own right, with skills and a situation that encouraged sympathy; and her enjoyment in a dominant man was totally believable. (Contrast this with 90% of Amazon D/s romance, where I have to wonder why the lady doesn't seek help from the police!) The plot contains male prejudice without grating; a sexual assault element that worked for me both as an intrinsic plot element and a sincere presentation of surviving assault (very rare!); revenge without sinking into evil; plenty of action and excitement; and well written erotica. The book got me to both laugh out loud and cry, both of which are very rare for an avid reader like myself.The writing was very good, the dialog interesting, and the characters' situation changed often enough to keep the book interesting. The beginning is perhaps a bit slow, but the pacing picks up about half way through.

Color has inexplicably been destroyed yet somehow candles abound. Rather than being an excuse for the ""marry an alien"" plot (which would be fine), the author uses this as a stump to preach a lot of ""humans are evil"" hatred and ""we deserve to die"" vile nastiness, plus a side of ""save the trees"" for good measure. Throw in some plot inconsistencies to enable more anti human rants, and half the book is done.The romance itself is lackluster. That plot had strong potential and could have been good.

"genre: dark eroticasetting: paranormal modern dayThe plot is forced sexual slavery with BDSM: the dark fantasy of a man dominating a woman completely against her wishes. No romance.The author warning is critical. This book starts with a werewolf raping a woman to get her pregnant, and the plot is their later relationship--or rather, his continued actions in that vein, since he decides to enslave her. The writing is skilled, more so than most Kindle Unlimited books.My first complaint is not that beginning, but instead aptly described by the woman about half way through: ""You have given me no reason to respect you."" And he never does. I had hoped for some personal growth on his part, or at least some consideration for her, but instead it is basically a woman falling in love with her kidnapper / en-slaver, a man who has money yet no redeeming values.  Do not expect personal growth on his part. My second complaint is that she very quickly loves him for abusing her, with no justification or convincing reasons. Being beaten into submission I could understand, that part was obvious, but affection and love? Such over-the-top claims require overwhelming proof, which is not provided. In my opinion, for such a dark erotic fantasy to work, the woman must get something out of the relationship. In this one, as described herein, she gets nothing.Overall: interesting idea, poorly implemented","2.0 out of 5 stars","August 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R35EQ7VTE00R92/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012QDX55U#wasThisHelpful","R35EQ7VTE00R92","A26F5B12T242LL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A26F5B12T242LL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The setting and premise of this novella could easily have been built into a fascinating full length novel, with building tension and surprise events...but isn't. The alternative would be to focus on your strengths, and continue to put out paranormal romance novellas. Hey, I'd enjoy reading them, and you'd learn what works and what doesn't.

"I got this for the cyborg story, and reading this one first would be a wise choice. Part 1 the cyborg story is great (5-star) and the ending is good enough to satisfy. Both are available on Kindle Unlimited.Cyborg part 1 (4 star)The premise is typical: evil scientists create cyborts, this leads to problems, they try to kill all the cyborgs, and the cyborgs escape to live elsewhere. (Why do the scientists always have to be the bad guys?) What the author does with this premise is unique and fun: a brilliant young doctor (pediatrician) is kidnapped by cyborgs to work for them, and the job is not at all what she expects. The creative & fun parts are personalities: for all their knowledge, the cyborgs are emotionally imature, not having had to deal with emotion & personal choice during their prior enslavement. She ends up falling in love with three guys, and has a few cybernetic surprises and erotic encounters.I wouldn't call this quite a romantic comedy, but it was close.

"This is a sequel to ""Omega,"" and the books must be read in order. The genre is scifi/fantasy in an urban setting, with an emphasis on dark fantasy. The grammar, editing, and Kindle formatting are excellent.""Beta"" suffers all of the typical flaws of the middle book of a trilogy. It does not seem to have its own plot, with theme & elements building to a climax. I had the feeling I could skip straight from ""Omega"" to ""Alpha"" without problem.""Beta"" is composed of individual scenes: interesting vignettes in an interesting but highly depressing universe. Where ""Omega"" at least gave us false hope for societal improvement, ""Beta"" is mired in a depressing now. Neither the establishment nor the revolutionists are trying to make life better, and D-- succumbs deeper and deeper into brainwashed obedience to an evil dictator. The book exposes more of their larger society, which just serves to expose the evil and corruption hidden behind a pleasant facade. D-- has no friends, no allies, dubious morals, and a drug addiction. There are no good role models in this book, and frankly that got really depressing too.(To be fair, I found the opposing alpha, R--'s, facade of perfection to be equally disturbing. A good person would not heap rewards on her chosen few while leaving the rest of her race to a cruel fate.

"So, the idea of this erotic MFM menage contemporary romance is good. First date of secretly in love people. The implementation alas had two major flaws. 1st, the erotic scenes were all from a man's POV, which does not interest me. 2nd, the entire plot fell apart with the morning after---major ccrash and burn in an explosion of junk plot.Great editing; good writing; decent emotional development.","2.0 out of 5 stars","May 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2IC7YJUNIGWXR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00P87F2DU#wasThisHelpful","R2IC7YJUNIGWXR","A26F5B12T242LL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A26F5B12T242LL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The other reviewers do a good plot summary, so I will start with the elephant in the room.This book is chocked full with nasty insults aimed at you, the reader. The author is the sort of self rightious liberal who thinks slander against conservatives and other political foes is acceptable behavior. Included are blatant accusations equating pro life, editing a child's TV habits, and running a company to rape, torture, and murder. Being Christian is equated with being a terorist, and the villain is named after a famous CEO. The author repeats his name about every other page to be sure you get the dirty insult.The author waits until after the free sample to start start spouting potty mouthed insults at 50% of the US population, so the free sample is misleading.Buyer beware.If the political opinions and steady stream of insults were deleted, the romance plot itself would have been about 3-star. The plot was a basic ""woman & bodyguard"" scenario.

"This probably is 3 to 4 stars if you want a M/M erotic romance...which I really don't.The setting is a fantasy future in outer space that feels more fairytale than sci fi. The two lead men are childhood friends who have been enslaved and left caged together while waiting sale. The plot is surprised by love; one of the guys thought himself stictly hetero. Decent erotica and romance if this is your thing. Me? I would not have bought if I knew this was the main plot.About 66% of the way through the book, a woman who had been adamant that she wanted to avoid all romantic and erotic encounters with them is between one page and the next committed as their third. No romance, no building plot. Her plot line is post rape recovery---and a lot of boring whining before her subplot begins. Neither particularly appealed to me.Another subplot is an adventure, creative but amateur writing and not strong enough to stand on its own.Another subplot is erotic encounters of an evil slaver, female, from her point of view.

"This paranormal romance is set in modern day. This is the 2nd in a serial. The prior one wasn't great but showed some promise. This book's plot is totally incoherent and nonsensical. It reads like the author had 20 different plot ideas and just threw them together willy nilly, with no coordination or planning. The leading man is totally unlikable and his personality seems to change at random. The author's strength continues to be portraying the leading lady's anger and hurt from being teased. This (and the lack of an understandable plot) totally ruins any chance of eroticism or romance. The action / adventure is also a bust.","1.0 out of 5 stars","March 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3RPFPP1Z9RMVG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TZLQTS2#wasThisHelpful","R3RPFPP1Z9RMVG","A26F5B12T242LL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A26F5B12T242LL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The plot of this paranormal romance is so complicated that I have no hope of summarizing. The other reviewers do not seem to really try, instead summarizing only one subplot: a menage second chance romance that turned sour for reasons that do not make sense and are never explained to anyones satisfaction. Then everyone seems to just shrug and ignore the whole prior arguement in a fit of inexplicable personality changes.This book starts strong with interesting characters and building romance. Then the author goes nuts adding rediculously complicated plotlines, one after the other, hoping against hope that one or another will inspire you to read the sequel. Meanwhile the romance plotline (the only decent plot) is resolved for no reason between one page and the next. Huh? There is no building tension, no climax, just confusing new ""but wait, also this"" complications, dumb personality changes, inconsistent worldbuilding, and obligatory erotica. Showing the worst of what a serial can be but shouldn't, this novella's cliffhanger is the least of its problems.Best read with low expectations and Kindle Unlimited.

"At the current $3 for 20 pages, this short story is terribly over priced. Still, I had already paid for Kindle Unlimited for a month and gave it a try.The plot summary is accurate enough. A single lady notices a space ship crash in her yard, rescues a hurt alien, and has sex with him that day. His description was pretty much a turn off for me. The whole thing is supposed to be erotic, but I didn't find it so. The ending is basically a cliffhanger with no indication of a follow-on story to come.There was a ""surprise ending"" but I thought it kind of lame.

"This is a modern paranormal romance, centered on witches & warlocks for once instead of the so popular werewolves or vampires. The plot was basically ""forced seduction"" with menage. The leading lady is bullied into a menage with two guys by the witch's council. The two guys also put pressure on her.I found the writing to be lackluster and uninteresting. Personally, I think the ""forced seduction"" plot only works if there is strong conflict within the lady, a mixture of unwilling & eager & enjoyment of being forced. In this book, I did not get that feeling of tension. My stronger emotional response was ""no I don't"" followed by ""whatever"".Best if rented under Kindle Unlimited.

"I liked the Cinderella story premise in this contemporary romance. The sex club idea worked surprisingly well.The big problem is that the leading lady does not own up to her own mistakes & failings. When an argument occurs between him & her, she demands that he accept all blame and beg piteously for forgiveness. Meanwhile she refuses to admit to her own share of the blame, of which there was plenty; do not buy her ""I am perfect"" self delusion. All sub-characters enable and support this very bad behavior. Terrible role model, and he would be better off without her. I've met women like her and none are happily married.That incident aside, this book contains a lot if men bashing prose. Wow, that gets old.If men bashing is not a trigger for you (as it obviously is for me), then add 2-stars to my rating. Best read as kindle unlimited, if you can justify the monthly fee with a few other books.*** SPOILER ***Here's the incident. A friend of the rich boss runs a sex club. Everyone is anonymous, wears masks, takes a pseudonym, and communicates by texting. Couples meet to flirt & have sex. Delilah goes there and ends up having sex with her boss, Nick. Neither of them recognize each other, and they have a 2-month affair that way (texting, anonymous sex). Nick recognizes Delilah at some point and breaks off the affair, uncertain what to do. Despite this, he tries to protect her feelings--by stopping the affair, by not telling her who is who, etc.The friend then breaks his company policy and spills the beans for no apparent reason---with the lame claim that it was all ""obvious"" and he ""thought they knew"". Yeah, right. Friend saw the books of who is who every day and that's the only reason that makes sense as to why he knew. The author made it very, very clear that both of their identities were extremely well hidden, Delilah's in particular, so this is very stupid. Friend also gets upset when Nick is mad at him. Um, duh? Why would anyone trust this company again? Worse, Nick is expected to apologize to this friend!!!Basically, this is my first pet peeve. Friend acts poorly and everyone gives him a pass. Grrr.The bigger problem is Delilah's reaction. The rules she agreed to (enthusiastically) was sex with a stranger. If her boss had continued the affair, I could see her being mad. He did the right thing. People go there for the thrill of an anonymous sex partner, not to learn who it was.But no, Delilah is not mature enough to take such responsibility for her own actions. She is the sort of woman who demands her man apologizes profusely for every argument and never admits fault. This is the behavior that I could not stand, and it ruined the entire book for me. She was 100% willing to do have anonymous sex, so she is to blame for her partner being someone she knew. Instead of being honest and saying that she is upset to have had sex with her boss, or that she is upset Nick did not tell her when he figured out who she was, Delilah claims a lame, ""I'm upset because you continued to be a good friend to me at work."" Seriously!To rub salt into the wound (so to speak), everyone in the book joins into the ""let's bash Nick"" brigade: Nick's friend, Delilah's girlfriend, etc. So the message is basically sexist (anti-men). Other sexist incidents occur, but none so blatant.*** End of Spoiler ***","1.0 out of 5 stars","February 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RII8O7UL6L0QD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FC09IUG#wasThisHelpful","RII8O7UL6L0QD","A26F5B12T242LL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A26F5B12T242LL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I enjoy reading novellas from new authors, including people who have never written a book before. That said, many such stories are not worth reading and I am sorry to say that I think this book falls into that category. The writing quality shows promise yet needs work.The setting is the future, an after apocalypse Earth with walled cities, werewolves, and shape changing dragons. The world is interesting enough to be worth the read. The leaders of various city-states make plenty of stupid or nonsensical decisions, but I suggest you ignore these and enjoy the world.The plot is a straight romance, where the leading lady is being wooed by two men. This is not a menage. Neither is this erotica. The lady jumps into sex quickly and with no reservations; and by personality she comes across as being kind hearted but with little judgement or wisdom. The reviewer who said ""juvenile and silly"" describes her personality perfectly.Faux violence (poorly described; take a few martial arts courses if you want to write better prose).

"This scifi romance stars a totalitarian man who must have his woman's constant obedience, even in her thoughts. She is seemingly only aroused by pain.She claims to want to make her own decisions. His response is always passive aggression and then punishing her if she does anything except cower in their bedroom--and she is okay with this. His punishment is BDSM then sex (repetitive, I thought), and apparently his mystic powers leave her brainwashed into standing up for herself less and less. She is always the one to compromise--or more fairly put, yield, such as to accept his chauvinistic society's rules. This is supposedly his desire to protect yet always came across to me as a bully's power play and subjugation of women.Unless you really like BDSM, I would skip this novel. The 1st book in series is hugely better.","2.0 out of 5 stars","February 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R36QM2C8C24HOL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00D71EY1K#wasThisHelpful","R36QM2C8C24HOL","A26F5B12T242LL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A26F5B12T242LL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the sort of serial where each book is interesting but does not have a stand alone plot and ends in a cliffhanger. This is a future paranormal, and this piece is all world building with no erotica, no sex, and barest hints of romance to come. The setting is creative and interesting. The length is a bit short for $0.99 as this 70 page book ends at 85%. The writing quality and editing are good.Plot of this piece is spunky lady fights back in a seemingly hopeless situation, with a surprisingly upbeat mood for all the occasionally nasty setting element.

"While the basic PNR plot was fine, the prose itself was so bland that I could not get into the story. I did not feel the emotions, see the visuals, or enjoy the setting. The whole experience felt like watching a movie on an overseas flight on those tiny TVs supplied by some of the big airplanes on the seat in front of you (video on demand). The loud nose of the airplane drowns out the music and makes it difficult to hear what people say; the screen is tiny and low quality so the picture looks faded and grainy; and the constant interruptions to the video stream make it difficult to keep paying attention regardless of the movie's original quality. That is how this book felt to me.

"This is the 4th in a series, and pointless to read unless you have read the prior three. The first book is free.This PNR picks up where the prior left off, just after the couple's mating, and contains a nice mix of romance, action, erotica and world building. There are quite a few open plot lines floating around (e.g., his son, the ocean sick, suspicious Councilman, his crazy ex, her old life, how his blood has changed her). This book focuses on the son while showing interesting progress on the others. Regardless being in a series, this book had enough of a plot/climax of its own to be satisfying. The ending is fabulous, and left me eager to read the fifth book. I vastly prefer such a promise of fun future events to cliffhangers.I thought this better than the last book. I appreciated the new setting changes and unexpected developments after their mating. I think a plot summary would be a disservice, because the plot surprises are the fun part of this series. Weaknesses are minimal personal growth and unclear physical descriptions--how exactly is he configured down there?This book has some BDSM elements, described from a fresh perspective. The creative ""why and how"" elements are refreshing to read since most BDSM books are boringly similar. Even if you aren't into BDSM, I encourage you to try the series.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3B7JXG9KZ9YHB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00S9XK77G#wasThisHelpful","R3B7JXG9KZ9YHB","A26F5B12T242LL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A26F5B12T242LL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is not a stand alone book, and the main plot line is not a romance. The free sample on Amazon matches the book summary; and that would have been a fun book. Unfortunately, this is not that book.This is a multi-view book that hops between many viewpoints. Most of these viewpoints assume that the reader has read a string of prior books and remembers them well. Since I had only read one of the author's prior novels (her first in this universe), none of the alternate viewpoints made sense and it certainly wasn't fun to read. There doesn't seem to be much romance here, being mainly focused on some sort of continuing adventure involving mainly characters from prior novels. The three characters mentioned in the book summary are seldom present.If you have read all prior books, this might be fun to read as the 4- and 5-star reviewers claim.

"This book reads like the author cobbled together disparate scenes in a rush to print and profit. The spunky chick from the free intro disappears almost immediately, replaced with a compliant pushover. Her panic over being teleported vanishes into thin air along with her gun. The plot is lame and nonsensical. Several times, the main characters are guilt tripped into doing something risky and stupid and illogical just to keep the plot moving. There is no tension between the him & her & him, so the romance and erotic elements fall flat. Most of the scenes read like lame re-writes of the prior four books. Finally, this book is way overpriced at $3 for an approximately 100 page novella.If you are a first time reader, I recommend you give the first book in this series a try.As an added complaint, the lead lady is supposed to be a handgun instructor. Her unsafe behavior with a handgun was highly offensive. My father was a hunter, so I met many hunters and gun safety instructors in my youth. All of them would be appalled at her behavior and loud spoken in their disapproval. I cannot imagine any shooting range in the US letting her teach. She plays out like a straw man (i.e., a fictional gun owner who behaves poorly to make gun owners look bad).","1.0 out of 5 stars","January 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3D3DRSABLHY5I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RT4A384#wasThisHelpful","R3D3DRSABLHY5I","A26F5B12T242LL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A26F5B12T242LL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"For genre, this is a modern day paranormal romance scifi. An ordinary young lady is kidnapped by aliens from today's Earth and sold into slavery. The book starts with her on a mining planet, horridly mistreated yet still resisting. The miners are to fight for their overlord's entertainment, and the winner gets her to do with as he wants (to her horror). The plot as it progresses from there is a mixture of scifi, adventure, romance, erotica, action, and introspection. I know that sounds like a lot of plot elements to mix together, but it all works. I found the plot to be well crafted and filled with wonderful surprises, so I won't go into much detail there. Let me just say that the book does not all take place on the mining slave planet. The setting changes often enough to be wonderfully entertaining.This story is a wonderful surprise in that it breaks from the typical romance plots. The strongest element of this book was the settings, and in particular the different cultures. The plot centers largely around culture conflicts, some of which are bold elements where one culture thinks the other culture's approach to sexual relations and courtship are downright wrong. All parties involved need to think through their morals and compromise to make their relationships work. I greatly enjoyed that the characters did this, instead of just throwing hissy fits like so many lazy writers. Now this sounds like a lot of thinking, but there is enough action and erotica to keep the pace lively.Here are a few warnings, though these may be elements you will enjoy to read about. Some interactions in the book can be interpreted as rape, so sexual assault survivors may want to avoid this book. I typically avoid such books like the plague, but I liked this book better for including this plot element, treating it in a very different and unique way, and not having the leading lady spend the whole rest of the book obsessing in depressed ruminations over the issue. The consequence is making you, the reader, have to think about morals and culture, which is a major theme. Another issue is that the book contains menage. This was very tastefully done, so that I do not think readers should avoid the book based on that.The book length is long; the price for length is currently very reasonable ($5 for 600+ pages); the writing quality is excellent; and the basic story elements are all done well (theme, characterization, plot, climax, resolution, etc.).I am greatly looking forward to the next book, ""Thunder Claw.""","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2U5O333FCWZND/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RG0IGH6#wasThisHelpful","R2U5O333FCWZND","A26F5B12T242LL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A26F5B12T242LL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Crest Pro-Health HD Two-Step Toothpaste System is a two-step tooth-cleaning process that requires minimal time to complete. The steps are simple: brush with the fluoride toothpaste for one minute, spit (but do not rinse), then brush with the hydrogen peroxide gel for an additional minute. The expectation is that you will use the system morning and night, totaling four minutes a day of oral care (not including flossing and all the other stuff you might or might not do).I can honestly say that my teeth have never felt cleaner than when I used this system with my Spinbrush classic. My teeth literally felt like perfectly buffed pearls in my mouth. I can only imagine how well the system works with one of the more high-tech brushes (sonic) applying the pastes.My complaint is in regard to the whitening claim. I literally saw no change in how white my teeth were even after weeks of use. This may be because I have used Crest Whitestrips within the past two years, or it may just be that whatever has caused the discoloration of my teeth isn't affected by hydrogen peroxide.

"_Fly Casual_ is a 96-page full color sourcebook for the Star Wars Edge of the Empire (EotE) roleplaying game (RPG) that focuses on the Smuggler career path. It contains three new player races (Falleen, Gotal, and Quarren), three new Smuggler specializations (Charmer, Gambler, and Gunslinger), two new signature abilities (Narrow Escape and Unmatched Fortune), new equipment, new vehicles, and a few additional rule expansions. The sourcebook is completely compatible with Fantasy Flight's other Star Wars RPGs Age of Rebellion and Force and Destiny.There was a lot of expectation for this book among players. While smugglers are some of the most interesting characters in the Star Wars movies and books, their treatment in EotE is generally considered less than stellar. Sadly, this book does not enhance the game very much for current smuggler characters. There are very few new rules or pieces of equipment in it that I will be referencing with any regularity. In fact, the recently released _Lords of Nal Hutta_ sourcebook actually provides better support for smugglers, as well as more useful equipment and information. Still, there are some interesting parts to the Fly Casual sourcebook, and its usefulness can not be completely discounted.New Races/Species. The racial choices are one of the highlights of this book, and definitely a reason to consider purchasing it. The Falleen (green-skinned pheromone-releasing aliens) and the Quarren (squid-faced rivals of the Mon Calamari) are both exciting choices with rich lore, and even Gotal (horn-headed energy-sensing beings) prove to be of note. Any of these races would make excellent choices for player characters, and are worth a look.Signature Abilities. The ""super powers"" of the career path fit well with the smugglers, and are not horribly overpowered. ""Unmatched Fortune"" gives players the ability to change a dice roll, and ""Narrow Escape"" lets them flee from combat. Of the two abilities, Narrow Escape does feel the weakest, and will have a tendency to be overruled by the GM.Ship Modifications. As one would expect, there are a decent number of vehicle modifications in this book (9 mods in all). Some, like the Rapid Cargo Evacuation Chute, are pretty specific to smugglers; others, like the astrogation droid brain, are useful for any career or situation.Additional rules and information includes:The Charmer, Gambler, and Gunslinger specializations. Sadly, none of these specializations have much to do with being a smuggler. The Charmer takes the unique (at least in EotE) strain-healing mechanic of the Politico and adds some debuffs in. The Gambler can alter dice rolls and change results. The Gunslinger is more of a Bounty Hunter or Hired Gun - basically, an old-West-style trick shooter/quickdraw artist (think Jango Fett). None of these have anything but a superficial connection to moving cargo (what a smuggler does), and would have been better in the sourcebooks of other career paths.New Vehicles and Ships. Vehicles include the TAGGECO Cargohopper speeder, Starhawk Speeder Bike, Sunrunner ZX Landspeeder, XG-1 Star Wing assault gunboat, Imperial Customs Frigate, VT-49 Decimator, CEC WUD-500 Star Yacht, Starlight Light Freighter, YKL-37R Nova Courier, GX1 Short Hauler, BAUDO-Class Star Yacht, Mobquet Medium Transport, Gozanti-Class Armed Transport, Corellispace Gymsnor-3 Light Freighter, Gymsnor-4, HWK-1000 Light Freighter, YT-2000 Light Freighter, Interdictor Heavy Cruiser, and Golan 1 Space Defense Platform.Rating: 3 out of 5 stars.

"The Star Wars: Imperial Assault Dice Pack contains 11 dice for use in Fantasy Flight's Imperial Assault miniature game. These dice are not the standard 1-6 most games are played with, but have special symbols and numbers on them that make them useable in Imperial Assault and derived games only. You get two black defense dice, two red melee/damage dice, two blue long range dice, two green midrange dice, two yellow short range dice, and a single white dodge/defense die. They had a suggested retail price of $11.95 on release in late February/early March 2015.There isn't a whole lot to say about these dice. They are identical to the ones that come in the Imperial Assault box set (unless your set had one of those rare misprinted defense dice with circles instead of triangles on it, which would explain why you want new ones). If you want another set to let the players use during a campaign game (only using one set for both sides during said campaign can be a bit annoying), they are currently your only option unless you intend to purchase another boxed set. If you are attempting to get into Imperial Assault ""on the cheap"" and only purchasing the dice pack and specific miniature expansions... well, it is marginally possible, but you'll still need the cards for a command deck (primarily found in the boxed set) and a partner that can provide the tiles/map to play on. To put it bluntly: that path is not recommended.The dice themselves all have six sides, and are pretty much only good for use in the Imperial Assault game (or throwing at people when you get angry at them, but that can put someone's eye out and get you banned from your local place of play). They can be stacked one on top of the other when you get bored, but 8-sided and 20-sided dice are far more challenging (and, thus, more interesting) to do that with.Rating: 5 out of 5 stars if you play the Imperial Assault miniature game; 0 out of 5 for anyone else.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R21GB1FNZTUEWC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1633440206#wasThisHelpful","R21GB1FNZTUEWC","A3GM64N13BILUP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3GM64N13BILUP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Pathfinder Battles: Iconic Heroes Set 1 is a box containing six miniatures and six cards for use in both the Pathfinder roleplaying game (the miniatures) and the Pathfinder Adventure Card Game (miniatures and cards). The plastic miniatures come fully painted, and include Valeros the Fighter, Seelah the Paladin, Seoni the Sorcerer, Sajan the Monk, Lini the Druid, and Droogami the Snow Leopard (animal companion). The cards are PACG boons for each character represented in the box (though the Snow Leopard's card is actually an Ally card owned by Lini, giving her two cards). The set is produced by WizKids in conjunction with Paizo, and had a suggested retail price of $29.99 on release in late February/early March of 2015.These items serve multiple roles depending on what game you play. For those that enjoy fantasy roleplaying games or miniature combat, they make very nice looking play pieces. While most people don't actually play the ""iconic"" characters in the Pathfinder game (there are some exceptions), the miniatures still make very nice representations that players can use, and are certainly worthwhile pieces for any Game Master to own.The greater use for the set, however, is within the Pathfinder Adventure Card Game (PACG). First, the miniatures can take the place of the hero cards within the play area, marking the location of each person in the game. Second, the set provides an additional boon card for each represented character, changing the game experience slightly. None of the cards have shown to be ""game breaking"" so far, but are a decent perks.Potential buyers will most likely compare these miniatures to the Dungeons and Dragons ""Icons of the Realms"" starter set released by Wizards of the Coast in July of 2014 at a SRP of $19.99. Both products contain six plastic miniatures representing some of the best known heroes of their respective game universes (Drizzt Do'urden being the big one of the D&D set). Head to head, the D&D miniatures come off at a significantly lower price, but much less detailed in terms of painting and sculpting. That $10 price difference goes to giving the Pathfinder minis things like the whites of eyes and intricate runes on sashes - details someone hand-painting the miniatures might add with a little effort, but certainly a noticeable and significant difference straight out of the box.That's not to say that the Pathfinder miniatures are perfect. There are some inconsistencies in painting (my Lini has an add green paint cast to her face), and there are reports of occasional bent weapons. My friendly local gaming store (FLGS) Art of War in Cincinnati got in four of these initially - of those, two boxes had slight issues due to insufficient packaging (Seelah had come free and was bouncing around inside one box, and Droogami was off its base in another [easy fix with a little glue]). Hopefully, Paizo and Wizkids will secure the miniatures a little better in the next release.Rating: 4.5 out of 5 stars (rounded up to 5). This is a great addition for the Pathfinder Adventure Card Game, as well as a set of nice looking miniatures for general roleplaying game use.Note: This is the first release in a series of Iconic Heroes boxed sets. Set 2 is expected to contain Amiri the Barbarian, Ezren the Wizard, Kyra the Cleric, Merisiel the Rogue, Harsk the Ranger, and Biter the Badger. Set 3 is expected to contain Alahazra the Oracle, Damiel the Alchemist, Imrijka the Inquisitor, Alain the Cavalier, Balazar the Summoner, and Padrig the Eidolon.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3E3R64DC1MOEO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TU3GK70#wasThisHelpful","R3E3R64DC1MOEO","A3GM64N13BILUP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3GM64N13BILUP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"_Nursing Student and Career Reference_ by BarCharts is a 300 page full-color book containing information used in the nursing profession. Chapters include Medical Math, Pharmacology, Nursing Assessment, Getting a Job in the Field, and a number of others - all concisely written and full of profession-specific information.This book fills an odd niche area between full NCLEX study guide, textbook, and CliffsNotes reference that both students and professionals will find useful.

"_Mort(e)_ is science fiction novel written by Robert Repino. It is the tale of a cat, a dog, rapid evolution, and an exploration into what really separates animals from humanity. Comparisons include _Animal Farm_ meets _The Matrix_, but, in all reality, I found _Mort(e)_ to be a significantly unique piece of fiction that is much more complex than an ""X meets Y"" categorization implies.Contrary to what the fantastical nature of this book might suggest, people thinking about reading _Mort(e)_ should understand that it contains some extremely serious moments. Life, death, love, hate, religion, and the human condition are all touched on within its pages, and that is some heady stuff. At the same time, it is a book about a cat with a gun, so there is definitely some humor and absurdity in it as well. All of this combines together to make a VERY different and, in my opinion, very interesting book that is worth reading. If you like your fiction more on the plausible side and less on the allegorical, however, this is probably a book you should avoid.Rating: 4 out of 5 stars.

"The OREI Diamond Enhanced Bass Bluetooth Wireless Speaker is a portable, relatively small (4.7 x 2.8 x 2.2 inches) speaker. It is designed to pair easily with other devices either through the wireless Bluetooth connection or via a more traditional 3.5mm audio cable. While it has numerous other features, one of the most significant is the built-in Lithium-Ion battery (rechargeable via the micro-USB port) which is listed as lasting between 8 and 10 hours per full charge. A 3.5mm male/male audio cable and a micro-USB to USB charging cable were including with my speaker.This is one of the best self-contained portable audio speakers I have ever used. The sound it produces is very clear, and does not ""lag behind"" my smart devices (example: lips properly syncing with sound on a YouTube video being shown on a phone). The audio is definitely loud enough to be heard for general use, though don't expect it to be loud enough to fill a large room for a party (it is, however, perfect for a dorm room or private office). I have not yet used it through a ""full charge"" (I charge it nightly), but I have used it for multiple hours straight with no battery issues.Rating: 5 out of 5 stars.

"The Singer 90S Special Edition with accessories is a modernized version of the traditional sewing machine. It contains such things as computer controls, a (very simple) LCD screen, and a modern lightweight body. It also contains built-in storage and accessory compartments.Coming off of my much older sewing machine, the 90S was a big change. First and foremost, I'm used to a heavier machine that contains a lot more metal (especially in the base) - this one, though, is much lighter (and appears to be made of plastic). While the light weight is generally a good thing for most people, it also makes the machine feel much flimsier. I haven't had any problems with it yet, but my guess is that I'll need to be more careful with this one than the previous, especially when moving it for storage when not in use. We'll see how things go.Other than that, I haven't had too many surprises with the 90S. There are A LOT of new features, but since I generally only sew to hem clothing or make simple costumes (and the occasional pillow), they're wasted on me. It gets the job done for my needs, though it has the potential to do more if I ever intend to press my skills.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R36Z6ASF5HH8JC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00P0J7R70#wasThisHelpful","R36Z6ASF5HH8JC","A3GM64N13BILUP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3GM64N13BILUP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I purchased these Utilitech bulbs from a local supplier for my mom when I was at her house in the spring. I had been using GE Reveal CFL Bulbs at my own place, but could not find 100 watt equivalents in that brand (she likes a lot of light). By the time Christmas rolled around, all of the Utilitech bulbs had burned out. Literally. The plastic bases on all of them have browning near the vent/glass sections that looked almost like scorching - this happened no matter where they were located in the house. On the other hand, the single OttLite 100w replacement CFL bulb I got my mom for her crafting area (a place she spends HOURS a day working) was still functioning.

"_Clash of Eagles_ is an alternate history novel written by Alan Smale. It follows the adventures of Praetor Gaius Marcellinus, leader of the massive 33rd Legion, as he explores North America in 1218 A.D. in search of gold for the ever-expanding Roman Empire. It is easily compared to the book/film _Dances with Wolves_, with the obvious difference being the replacement of the Union Army protagonist with a Roman soldier.It starts out slowly. Very slowly. You'd think the experiences of a Roman army visiting North America for the first time would grab the reader, but it is just a bunch of one-dimensional and stereotypical characters stomping around the woods with all that entails. There is some fighting, some things happen, and the situation eventually changes (how's that for a no-spoiler summary? :) ).Here is where the book takes off. The culture clash and technological expansion we see in the second part of the book is very interesting, and where Smale really shines. He's done a lot of research on the subject matter, and uses his imagination to figure out what suddenly adding these elements to a new civilization might do. There are also some small-scale battles that Smale is able to make very exciting, as well as a decent amount of character reflection and development.Then, at the very end of the book, we're back to a boring massive battle and a regression of the characters into one-dimensional beings again. Hooks are left for sequels, so expect at least another book if this one does well.There are a few other problems I have with the book, and they all involve technology. The first is the advanced level of technology the author gives to the Cahokians (primary Native American tribe in the book). Without giving away any spoilers, I just couldn't accept the advances in relation to what was developed in the real world, and had to constantly remind myself that this novel was more of a ""fantasy"" creation than one of realistic fiction. The second problem involves how the author seems to use whim instead of logic to haphazardly change whether technology will have a significant impact on a situation. In one instance, advanced armor and weapons allow a nearly complete slaughter of enemy forces; a few pages later, they make no difference at all. Such a lack of consistency makes all of the other events also seem implausible.Rating: 3 out of 5 Stars. If you can get through the boring beginning AND accept fantasy-levels of technology in an alternate history novel, there is definitely something worth reading in _Clash of Eagles_.","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R20BKPP9PP4QXL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0804177228#wasThisHelpful","R20BKPP9PP4QXL","A3GM64N13BILUP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3GM64N13BILUP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"For years, many masters of the ""striking arts"" (boxing, Taekwondo, Kempo, etc..) have proclaimed that blows to key areas of the head are far more efficient at knocking an opponent out than others. From boxers talking about the knockout button below the ear and behind the mandible to MMA fighters speaking of the efficiency of flying knees to the temple, such techniques abound. The problem has always been practicing these strikes properly so that they can be used with success - allowing someone to be repeatedly struck in the head so another can learn the correct location and technique simply isn't practical to the partner. Using the lifelike ""BOB""-style foam body opponent bags works to an extent, but those are often too bulky and heavy to practice anything other than the basic strikes against a stationary opponent.The Quest Training Allstrike training head is an attempt to fix that problem. It is basically a striking pad shaped like a human head that the trainer sticks his hand inside of (there's a handle inside to help him/her hold it). The student can then practice striking a lifelike head that is moving in a similar way as a normal human head (depending on the skills of the trainer). Believe it or not, this is A LOT different than just striking traditional pads or the stationary BOB, and those using it should see improvement in the pinpoint accuracy of their head strikes relatively quickly with regular (and proper) use.Be warned, though, that the Quest Training Allstrike isn't the answer to all of your training woes with such strikes, and does take some getting used to. Initially, we were holding the head too close to our own bodies during practice - and getting hit by it when the striker popped it too hard or at an unexpected angle. The trainer still has to hold the head out and away from his/her body like a normal striking pad (meaning it is harder to simulate an actual fighter throwing counterstrikes), but can simulate it moving like a real head would in a fight. But it really does help those training with it to improve their head strike accuracy, and should be considered for any gym, dojo, or martial academy that uses such strikes.Rating: 4 out of 5 stars. Definitely a worthwhile investment for those training others to use head strikes.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3AGFTM1Q8MQ73/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NXUCNZE#wasThisHelpful","R3AGFTM1Q8MQ73","A3GM64N13BILUP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3GM64N13BILUP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The OXO Good Grips 16-Ounce Healthy Portions Analog Scale is a portable cooking/meal measuring tool used to weigh out meals and ingredients. Probably most associated with those on very strict portion control diets, these types of scales are also useful for those that tend to be out-and-about when cooking/brewing or that are just looking for a decent kitchen scale that is easily stored. The OXO has a really nice design that screws together for easy transport or unscrews and flips to form a bowl-top for easier measuring.Overall, I am very pleased with my OXO scale, and especially like the compact design. If you are carrying the scale around with you (say, in a bag), though, it tends to be a little noisy - unless you keep the original packing materials. The little cardboard disk that slips into it will stop almost all noise when walking around, and should not be thrown away. In fact, keeping the entire box works well, as there is not a lot of excess space in the original packaging.Keep in mind that this is not an analytical balance, nor is it a digital device - it is a very simple item that works extremely well for what it is. No batteries required, and easily zeroed with a simple turn.Rating: 4 out of 5 Stars.

"This free diving mask and snorkel set from U.S. Divers / Aqua Lung America (imported from China according to the packaging) has a significant portion made from silicone, and sports a number of premium features not seen on base models. These include the mask's button-press buckles for easier fitting and pivot/filter top for keeping water out of the snorkel.I wish I would have had my set sooner (I think it would have been perfect for my visit to Dauphin Island), but I was able to put it through some trials. My only significant complaint is that it tended to fog up more than my previous mask, but a little adjustment cleared most of this up in the field. Other than that, I have no complaints about the product, and found it to be a joy to use. Though it has a higher price point than many sets, it is of excellent quality (and also large enough to fit my rather big head, while still being able to adjust down to my girlfriend's size). It is also below the price point of what I would consider the ""Prosumer"" level, meaning it is an great buy for those either just getting into the hobby or just wanting a quality set for vacation, but not looking to break the bank on something they'll be using only once or twice a year.Note: This mask is currently being listed as a ""Silicone Free Diving Mask"" - it should, in fact, be listed as a Free Diving Mask MADE OF SILICONE (though some parts are made of glass and/or plastics). That's a selling point - it doesn't stink of rubber and/or latex like older masks (perfect for those allergic to such things), and should (in theory) last a little longer.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 31, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R20HC00MXGM62Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MVKCJ2O#wasThisHelpful","R20HC00MXGM62Q","A3GM64N13BILUP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3GM64N13BILUP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Let me preface my review by stating that I have read through a large number of supposed ""game programming"" books over the past few years, and every single one of them has fallen short. Most of the time, they are just ""fluff"" books with no real content (no code, no real physics, no explanation of the math) looking to make a quick buck from those interested in making computer games. Sadly, that means my useable knowledge of the subject matter has come from the internet, coworkers (that do most of the actual coding), and using general professional programming books (a great reference, but often a bit broad)._Game Engine Architecture_, Second Edition, is the first REAL book I've seen on the subject. This is not some poorly written, quickly printed piece of junk - it is a full-blown resource for understanding how games are made. Rightly, it focuses on the game engine (the software that creates the game experience), and provides the code examples, explanations, and mathematics so that you can learn HOW to do it yourself (or, more accurately, be part of a team that does it). For many, the information inside will be over their heads initially (do you know how to program in C++? Do you know how to use Visual Studio?), but that just means readers know WHAT TO LEARN in order to make their own games. It is the best book on the subject I have ever seen, and I look forward to putting more of it into practice.Rating: 5 out of 5 stars.

"The George Foreman GRP360R Grill continues the line of clamshell-shaped kitchen appliances made famous by the former world champion boxer back in 1994. This model has a number of useful features, including removable grill plates (that can be cleaned in the dishwasher), a pre-heat light (so you don't start your cooking at the wrong temperature), and (of course) the drip pan that collects the unwanted fat (a familiar feature on these grills). The line's concept is that the fat drips out of the food, slides down the grill's panels, and into the collection pan - making the food cooked in it healthier.To me, the leaner meat concept of the grill is just a nice side-benefit - what I like about it is how easy and quickly it can prepare food. Let me give you an actual example of exactly HOW EASY it is to use: I can put two FROZEN tilapia fillets into it, and IN UNDER FIVE MINUTES the fish is done (generally four-and-a-half minutes for me). Toss on some blackening powder or other seasoning, and you've got yourself an extremely healthy main course. If you've got some fresh salmon or thick-cut tuna steaks, it will work on those, too. Fast. And you can use it on chicken, hamburger, steak, veggie patties, and more!The grill itself is not quite perfect, though. The EXTREMELY short cord can be VERY frustrating, especially for those with only a few outlets in their kitchens. And the device has no off switch, so you have to yank it from the wall every time you want it to cool down.

"_Social eCommerce_ covers the exact subject of the title - how to use electronic and internet resources such as social media to improve your business. It is paperback, roughly 276 pages, and filled with a bunch of new business buzzwords that people not reading these sorts of books have never heard before (but that business people seem to love).I definitely have mixed feelings about this book. It seems written for business professionals that have little idea what social media (or the internet) is. If that's you, buy this book. :) If you're a little bit more social media/tech savvy, there is still a lot of information you might find useful. Each chapter (and they include such titles as ""Marketing Strategy: Physical Goods,"" ""Event Promotion,"" and ""Book Promotion"") has a number of headings that contain tips and techniques for being successful in that area. This information is not all-encompassing, but usually includes links to websites that have more details. That makes this book a great starting place (especially if you just want a broad understanding of the subject), but not an in-depth resource - you'll need a more focused book/webpage on that specific area if you want to completely understand it.

"This Farberware New Traditions Nonstick 8-1/2-inch Skillet rises to the high level of quality I have come to expect from Faberware cookware over the years. With a durable (and insulated) handle, stylish red enamel outer coloring, slick nonstick coating, and just general high quality construction, it has all of the qualities I desire from a skillet. I find it more than adequate to use when cooking for myself or when preparing certain side dish items, but the listed 8.5"" size can be a bit misleading - the modern-styled ""bell-shaped profile"" means there is less bottom to cook on, but that just seems to be the style these days. It doesn't seem to negatively impact my cooking, and it can even make it easier when using the spatula in certain instances.This New Traditions product also has a number of features I don't ever see myself using, but should probable list anyway. For instance, it is listed as being oven-safe up to 350 degrees Fahrenheit (good for reheating and certain cooking tricks, but nothing I'd ever use). It supposedly has a limited lifetime warranty (but how often does anyone actually use that?). It probably also works really well when used to fight zombies, but that's another aspect I will (probably) never use.

"_The Peripheral_ is a subgenre-destroying novel by speculative fiction author William Gibson. It is also extremely hard to describe, other than to say that I consider it the pinnacle of Gibson's work thus far. Take the speculation and edge of of his novel Neuromancer, add the style and flow of the Bridge Trilogy, give it the relevance and polish of his more recent works like Zero History, mix them all together with some lightning and you get _The Peripheral_.

It is listed as being Windows 7, Windows 8, and Mac compatible, though I can only vouch for the W7 aspect of that (what I use at home).My issues with the router started right out of the box. The box clearly states that the router has an easy 3-step setup. Only, if you look at that third instruction carefully, you'll notice it is to connect to your router network and FOLLOW MORE INSTRUCTIONS. That's a bit of a cheat if you ask me.Then there's the actual size of the device. It is a little bit larger than my previous one, and it is designed so it can not stand vertically. I am sure there is a technical reason why it has to lay like a wide, flat rock, but it also takes up more space (I just tucked my previous router on the side of my printer and it covered the entire house).

"Continuing right after the events of _Children of Fire_ (CoF), Drew Karpyshyn's _The Scorched Earth_ (SE) follows the travels of Keegan, Scythe, Vaalar, and their companions through a sword and sorcery fantasy adventure. Though not entirely necessary, readers should pick up _Children of Fire_ first, as SE doesn't do much explaining of past events - after a brief prologue dealing with The Big Bad Villain, the book takes up with little backstory/retelling of previous happenings.The easiest way to determine if you will like this novel is to ask yourself, ""Did I like the first book?"" _Scorched Earth_ is really just more of the same - it has similar pacing, similar events, and the same characters with most (but not all) acting the same way. Once more, nothing really happens in the first third of the book (certainly not enough to justify the thousands of words it took to get us there); then there is an event, a bunch more nothing, and finally a relatively fast-paced and exciting ending. The villains remain typical caricatures with laughable plans, but there are a few great scenes with some of the heroes to make it worth suffering through. In the end, not a lot is accomplished, some heroes and villains are dead, and the protagonists are poised to jump right into the next novel.Rating: 3 Out of 5 Stars.

"_Far Horizons_ is a Star Wars Edge of the Empire (EotE) roleplaying game sourcebook that focuses on the Colonist career path. It contains rules for three new races (Arcona, Chevin, and Gran [though the Gran were already introduced in the Age of Rebellion core book]), three new career specializations (Entrepreneur, Marshal, and Performer), two new signature abilities (high level career abilities for colonists), new vehicles, new equipment, and more. In total, it is 95 beautiful color pages of material for the EotE game.While I have greatly enjoyed ALL of the other expansion books for EotE so far, I found Far Horizons to be a disappointment. The reason for this is simple: it really doesn't focus on Colonists. What it does is try to introduce space police as player characters into the EotE game, and that's not really what I wanted from THE COLONIST SOURCEBOOK. The vast majority of the material is centered around this concept, so players of the already established Colonist career specializations (Doctors, Politicos, and Scholars) are out of luck. If you think it is a terrible shame that the Hired Gun sourcebook actually contains more new medical equipment than the one for Doctors does, you'll also be disappointed.Ignoring the idea that the sourcebook should contain more information for established Colonists, it still leaves a lot to be desired. The Entrepreneur career specialization, for instance, is basically just filling the same role that the already established Trader does (just with a different talent mechanism). The Performer is okay, but it won't fit into everyone's game (talents like Biggest Fan, which is exactly what it sounds like, are a perfect example of this). The Marshal, which the author focuses the majority of the sourcebook on, is basically a combat-modded version of the Colonist that is immune to Deception at high levels (their Unrelenting Skeptic talent is unbalanced and needs to be modded right out of the gate, especially when compared to Scoundrel talents dealing with Deception). A little bit of text is actually given over to the equipment Colonists would use (Atmospheric Processors and Vaporators, for instance), but most of it is just for flavor - besides price, there isn't actually a lot of game data supplied with these items (especially compared to all of the new police equipment; but, hey, everyone was looking forward to stats for a riot shield, right?).The one thing I really did enjoy about this book was the section on establishing a Base of Operations (pages 81-85). Though it only covers about five pages, this gives new rules for buying and upgrading a base for your characters. A base gives bonuses such as a bonus career skill, but takes money and/or obligation to establish and enhance it. This section could have been thirty pages longer in my eyes - in terms of rules, it really adds an element to the game. Hopefully, we'll see this concept expanded in future sourcebooks (maybe even Age of Rebellion, where having rules for specific types of Rebel bases would make a lot of sense).Rating: 3 out of 5 stars. If you're looking to bring space police into your EotE game, this sourcebook is for you; players of established Colonists, however, will be disappointed.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 31, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R25M265H9B029C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1616616911#wasThisHelpful","R25M265H9B029C","A3GM64N13BILUP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3GM64N13BILUP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Tattle Tea Earl Grey is a stylishly packaged loose leaf tea. It has nice hint of flavors to it, and is definitely an upgrade from the standard (and horribly bland) Earl Grey most people drink.

"Prior to using the KOBI Electric K2L3 LED Bulb, I'd been using CFL and hybrid-CFL bulbs in my home. The problem with CFL, however, is that they take a while to warm up before they glow with their full brightness. That's not an issue above the dinner table or next to the TV, but when it comes to those lights that are constantly being turned on and off (say, on the stairs), it can cause problems. This LED light, however, does the job perfectly, and I'll be putting similar ones in the utility room and the basement.In terms of performance, this light instantly brightens like a star. It provides brilliant illumination throughout the area, and it has very good coverage (especially for an LED bulb, which tends to produce shadows ""behind"" the light). It still creates a few shadows around it, but it does better than the other LED bulbs I've seen. Also, unlike most traditional LED bulbs, it can be dimmed if your lamp/outlet has that option built in. I highly recommend it.Rating: 5 out of 5 stars. Brilliant light that will work with a dimmer!","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2W6XY204OPDYY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IKUDHA2#wasThisHelpful","R2W6XY204OPDYY","A3GM64N13BILUP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3GM64N13BILUP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Legendary Encounters is a deck building game that uses cards and a game mat to create exciting playable scenarios for 1 to 5 participants. While the heart of the game uses two relatively simple mechanics (basically money cards to buy things and damage cards to kill things), Encounters is also complex - there are numerous special rules to pick up, and some options allow players to actually battle each-other. It is a standalone game, meaning everything you need to play comes in the box.While the Legendary game system has previously been known for using characters from Marvel Comics (those such as Iron Man, Captain America, and Spider-Man), this Legendary set goes in a completely different direction by exploring the universe of the Alien movies. Yes, you can still cross-over cards from the other sets into Encounters (Wolverine & Ripley vs. the Alien Queen can actually happen), but most people will find the real fun is playing out the various scenarios - scenarios that recreate the movies and can be extremely difficult. This game is MUCH HARDER than previous Legendary games, and optional rules allow players to even fight each-other (either as a sort of traitor or when they are turned into aliens by a facehugger). These aspects make Encounters an exciting but at times a very dark game - one that will take even veteran Legendary players a number of tries to become skilled at.Rating: 5 out of 5 Stars. If you like deck building games and the Alien movies, this standalone game is for you - it truly captures the feel of its source material well.Note: as always, I recommend putting the game's cards into standard card sleeves. These will help the materials last through multiple play sessions, drink spills, and being touched by pizza sauce-coated fingers.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2VOTVT2CTNJN8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MU2DQAW#wasThisHelpful","R2VOTVT2CTNJN8","A3GM64N13BILUP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3GM64N13BILUP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"75034 Death Star Troopers is a 100 piece LEGO Star Wars set released in early spring 2014 with a LEGO Store suggested price of $12.99. Following the instructions, four minifigures (two Emperor's Royal Guards and two Imperial Gunners) and a turbolaser cannon can be built. Hand-held weapons for each figure are also included.With these minifigures previously being difficult to find, it is hard to imagine a better Imperial army-building set unless a four stormtrooper box was put on the market. Still, with two of each of these iconic figures, you'll be able to fill out your rows of Imperial soldiers easily and at a relatively affordable price. The turbolaser also makes a nice background piece, and can be re-assembled into various other things (as many as you can imagine) or just added to the larger brick pile as desired.The other interesting feature of this set is new blaster pistol. Two are provided for the Imperial Gunners to brandish when not at their stations. They are very love-em or hate-em for most fans - those looking for movie-similar pieces hate them (the guns are very bulky and don't look like Star Wars blasters); those that like ""action"" bricks love them (they are simple levers that can shoot small bricks EXTREMELY far). Like any good LEGO part, these blasters can be further customized, with pieces from other LEGO sets turning them into grappling guns, rocket launchers, and other things.Rating: 5 out of 5 Stars. This is an excellent Imperial Army-building set with interesting new blasters to make things even more interesting.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1JFH9J58X32JP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IANTUX2#wasThisHelpful","R1JFH9J58X32JP","A3GM64N13BILUP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3GM64N13BILUP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"One of the co-owners at my friendly local game store (Art of War in Cincinnati) introduced me to Upper Deck's Marvel Legendary game, and I enjoyed it. When he added in the various hero expansions (Dark City and others), it was great. When he switched it up and we started playing Legendary Villains, I was completely hooked.At its heart, Villains is a relatively standard deck building game (all the cards you need to play are provided) with streamlined rules and fast play. You have your money cards and your attack cards, and you'll work each turn to defeat the city's heroes (the various X-teams, Avengers, and more) by both attacking them and buying new abilities to make yourself stronger (cards that are shuffled into your hand). Take too long, and the schemes of your head honcho hero opponent may come to fruiting and defeat you; don't plan far enough ahead, and you won't have the strength you need later in the game.Villains works as both a stand-alone game and as an expansion to the original Legendary. As a stand-alone, you get all of the rules and mats to play an exciting game in which the villains try to defeat the grand efforts of the heroes of the Marvel universe. It plays in a similar manner as the original Legendary (relatively easy to learn), though some new card mechanics and rules add needed challenge. When used as an expansion, it opens that game up in new ways, and adds epic comic book team-ups to an already exciting experience (Professor X and Magneto teaming up is probably one of the best examples).The game is designed for 1 to 5 players, but take note: adding more players generally makes things harder, and a full 5 player game can be very difficult to win. The Villains game in general is also a bit harder than the original, which I find to be a positive (there were complaints that the first was too easy).Rating: 5 out of 5 Stars. Fast play, exciting team-ups, and hours of fun both for fans of the Marvel universe and general board game enthusiasts.P.S.: I highly recommend buying and using card sleeves (plastic covers for the individual cards). This will significantly increase the life of your game, especially when Cheeto-eating friends put their greasy fingers on them.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2SIJCBAGHAL2F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KDPPNPY#wasThisHelpful","R2SIJCBAGHAL2F","A3GM64N13BILUP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3GM64N13BILUP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The new Dungeons and Dragons Player's Handbook is a unique form of game that transports players into a fantasy world of stout Dwarves, noble Elves, and everything in-between. It does this by using the power of the players' imaginations, along with some oddly-shaped dice (sold separately) and this rulebook. Older players will understand that it is a redesign of the legendary tabletop roleplaying game (RPG) that was originally published in 1974. Sometimes called D&D Next, 5th Edition, or just 5E, it is a significant revision of the game that plays different than any other version. Still, enough of the core mechanics remain that it can be easily learned, and none of the rules are so odd as to make the game unrecognizable.The main focus of the revision seems to have been streamlining and focusing the game so it both plays faster and requires less rule referencing. This tends to polarize players - those that want to customize every aspect of their character (rule-focused) will be disappointed by the changes; those that are more interested in the adventure (story-focused) will probably enjoy this. Mechanics like ""advantage/disadvantage"" (rolling two twenty-sided dice and taking either the best or worst depending on the ad- or dis-) replace a lot of the number crunching bonuses; early character customization is more about making broad choices (Race, Class, and Background) rather than many smaller choices (example: skills/proficiencies are primarily determined by Class and Background, and you don't choose how to spend skill points every level like you did in other editions). It is definitely a change in concept, and one that makes the game easier for new players to pick up and understand.A gaming aspect that makes a strong comeback in this edition is that of ""Theater of the Mind"" - that is, not using miniatures and grid maps, but having combat and other events take place through words and descriptions (in a storytelling atmosphere). 5E supports both aspects with its rules very well, so those that enjoy their figurines shouldn't be put off, either.If this seems like a lot of changes, it is. There are, in fact, too many changes to cover in a casual product review. Additional ones include: Toril (Forgotten Realms) is now the default campaign setting; every class has been altered from previous editions; classes transition into ""archetypes"" that are specialized versions at about third level.Other info: Player races include Dwarf, Elf, Halfling, Human, Dragonborn, Gnome, Half-Elf, Half-Orc, and Tiefling (along with multiple subraces). Classes include Barbarian, Bard, Cleric, Druid, Fighter, Monk, Paladin, Ranger, Rogue, Sorcerer, Warlock, and Wizard. The book itself is full color.Note: if you are unsure whether this game is right for you, Wizards of the Coast is currently providing a PDF version of what it consider the core rules for free on its website. This document has all of the information needed to create characters, advance in level, experience combat, and play the game, but only contains a limited number of races, classes, and backgrounds to choose from. Feel free to visit their website and try the free basic rules to see if you'll like the game before significantly investing in this book.Rating: 5 Out of 5 Stars. 5E can't be everything to everyone, but it is an incredible re-envisioning that manages to separate itself from all of the other editions by creating a unique play experience that can still be recognized as the venerable game it is based on. Highly recommended for all tabletop RPGers to try!","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1UK8ZGIMUVGRB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0786965606#wasThisHelpful","R1UK8ZGIMUVGRB","A3GM64N13BILUP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3GM64N13BILUP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Star Wars Age of Rebellion: Onslaught at Arda I is the first hardback adventure book/module released for the Age of Rebellion game. Though it can be run with players at any XP level, it is designed for newer characters. The book itself provides a few suggestions for integrating this adventure with the one found in the back of the Age of Rebellion core rulebook if that has not already been played (basically, just changing a few names). It should take multiple gaming sessions to run through this adventure completely.Overall, I found the Onslaught at Arda I adventure to be a very respectable, both gameplay-wise and in maintaining the feel of the Star Wars movies. Rebel characters of varied careers/specializations will all find they have something different and important to do in various parts of the adventure; as well, the different parts have varied objective focuses to keep things interesting (one is starship piloting, another is combat, another is investigation, etc..). My biggest complaint is that there's not a lot of flexibility to things - the characters will be heading ""down the rails"" and can really only succeed or fail at each task (there's no jumping around or significantly altering the course of events).As to the ""New Rules for Handling Mass Combat"" the back of the book touts, they cover 2 pages (30-31). I didn't find them to be particularly significant, though they do make Leadership a lot more useful (it acts to upgrade dice).On a side note, this adventure can be easily modified to run in an Edge of the Empire campaign. Perhaps the EotE characters are mercs hired to help the Rebellion / smugglers delivering needed supplies / etc; only a few ""speeches"" and a little creative reasoning are needed to make it work.Rating: 4 Out of 5 Stars. If you are looking for a decent Age of Rebellion adventure, Onslaught at Arda I definitely has the feel of the movies to it - just don't buy it only for the new rules, however.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3EX7OA05Z89IR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1616619120#wasThisHelpful","R3EX7OA05Z89IR","A3GM64N13BILUP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3GM64N13BILUP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Age of Rebellion is a pen-and-paper roleplaying game (RPG) based in the Star Wars universe.  Its rough focus is the time and events of the original Star Wars trilogy, and it primarily deals with the Rebel side of things. It is also the second core rulebook in Fantasy Flight's Star Wars roleplaying game series, and is compatible with the earlier core rulebook Edge of the Empire (a game focused on the scoundrels and outcasts of the galaxy, but in a similar time period). In order to properly play either of these games, you will need a set of specialized dice that have symbols on them instead of numbers (listed as either ""Edge of the Empire Dice"" or ""Age of Rebellion Dice"" and sold separately; there's also an app to simulate them). The dice themselves tend to be the most intimidating part of the game, but most players get used to them after a few sessions of use.But on to the game itself! If you enjoy RPGs and Star Wars, Age of Rebellion (AoR) has a lot to offer! The book itself is filled with some of the best FULL COLOR artwork of any product to date, and really helps to get the feel of the setting into the minds of the players. The gameplay flows well (after the shock of the dice is overcome), and allows for a large selection of humans, aliens, and droids to be chosen as player-characters (PCs).  AoR tends more towards storytelling, and even has dice mechanics that allow players to briefly take control of events and sculpt the outcome. Those prospective players that lean more towards hard rules and number crunching might prefer the previously published D20 Star Wars game by Wizards of the Coast, which was a fine but very different experience.While the contents of the 460+ page book are too large to cover in detail, the book contains everything needed to play except for the dice. Examples include rules for character creation, rule for advancement, career (class) section, equipment section, ship section, Force section (probably a bit lacking for those that really want to play a Jedi, but there will be another Core Book for that in the future),  adversary section (sci-fi bestiary), Galaxy and Rebellion information section, and a short introductory adventure.Note to Edge of the Empire (EotE) players: this book can also serve as an expansion to the EotE game. It contains multiple new races, many new ships (Rebel and Empire-focused), and some new career options (though some are repeats and others do not balance well with those in EotE [example: medic vs. doctor]). It does not, however, significantly expand The Force or greatly increase the amount of available equipment. As well, it repeats A LOT OF INFORMATION FROM THE EotE CORE BOOK. I enjoy AoR greatly, but it may not be the best expansion for EotE players on a budget.Note - PC races covered in the book: Bothans, Droids, Duros, Gran, Humans, Ithorians, Mon Calamari, and Sullustans.Rating: 5 out of 5 stars. An excellent pen-and-paper roleplaying game for fans of the original Star Wars trilogy! Also a respectable (but sometimes repetitious) expansion for Edge of the Empire.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3P5CZO2EIAUBH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1616617802#wasThisHelpful","R3P5CZO2EIAUBH","A3GM64N13BILUP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3GM64N13BILUP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Mead Trapper Keeper (I call it the modern version, though maybe 2012 version would be more appropriate) is a three ring binder with sewn cloth exterior and metal snap closure. It doesn't have a lot of other frills, though it does have a piece of clear plastic on the front (that you can slide your own cover image into if desired) and comes with 5 plastic dividers. And that's it. If you're looking for a decently durable binder with a closure, this may be one for you - but there is not a whole lot to it for the price.The strength of the Trapper Keeper system is in the additional products you can buy for it, such as the Trapper Keeper Plastic Folder or the Trapper Keeper 2-Pocket Portfolio. In the end, though, there is not a lot that separates the Trapper Keeper system from many of the other binder and organizers on the market, except perhaps nostalgia (just remember that this model isn't the same as the one from the 80's, which used Velcro and had a different design).Rating: 3 Stars.

"The Five Star 2"" Zipper Binder Plus Multi-Access File is a mouthful to say, but is also the standard by which I judge all other binders and organizers. It is one of the best choices for people that want to carry their papers and writing supplies with them WITHOUT using a backpack, or that are looking for an extremely high level of protection for their materials. Here are the highlights:- Zipper-Closed Compartments. The two main sections of the binder zipper close, insuring that your papers stay protected and locked inside. The organizer section zips COMPLETELY closed; the three ring binder section zips almost completely closed except for a small (roughly half-inch radius) section on one end. Papers can not escape once the zippers are secured.- Internal Compartments. There is an additional small compartment in the binder section for writing utensils (pens, pencils, and whatnot); there's also an additional zippered pocket for whatever longer items you want to store in it. Finally, a second accordion-style paper organizing section is also in the binder area (it is closed with Velcro, and is in addition to the zippered one on the outside of the binder).- Durability. The binder is made with cloth to help resist the wear-and-tear of the world. The zippers are of a heavy make and also strong.Certainly, this product isn't for every situation (a simple three ring D-ring binder might work better and cheaper if you're already carrying a backpack everywhere), but it is a top choice if you are looking to take papers and writing utensils with you in one neat, easy to carry item.Rating: 5 Stars. This is a great binder and organizer for multiple situations.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1RG684B52388J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JIXXHEG#wasThisHelpful","R1RG684B52388J","A3GM64N13BILUP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3GM64N13BILUP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"So, yeah, three-ring binders aren't always sexy.. but what you put in them can be! When using a D-ring binder, whatever interesting tidbits you put in yours will tend to suffer less wear-and-tear than those stored in the more common O-ring binders - and that means the precious pages will last longer without needing to be taped or reinforced as often. Nothing but the heaviest reinforcements will stop the top page of any binder from suffering damage, but those further in will thank you for sparing them additional suffering if you go with the D-ring (or they would if they could talk). Add in the clear cover that allow you to slide your own pages in to display just how naughty or nice the interior material is (very handy if you are using multiple binders and want to distinguish between the one you use for chemistry notes and the one you use as your private journal), and you have an obvious winner in terms of product. Finally, the binder's cover also folds completely under, making it easier to hold/set down on a small desk when copying notes into. Flexible, protecting, and open to displaying whatever you want it to on its cover... now that is a great product!","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RX7ZBXOG6SCQV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JBK74IQ#wasThisHelpful","RX7ZBXOG6SCQV","A3GM64N13BILUP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3GM64N13BILUP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Dungeons and Dragons (5E) Starter Set provides players with everything they need to begin their adventures with fantasy roleplaying games (RPGs). The box set contains a six-piece dice set, rulebook, adventure book, blank character sheet template, and detailed character sheets for each class - in short, all the stuff besides players (and maybe a few pencils/pieces of paper) you'll need to run the game. It does this at a very reasonable price ($19.99 suggested U.S. retail), making this box set an excellent value for those looking for an ""entry point"" into the exciting world of tabletop RPGs!Starter Set Rulebook in more detail: the rules themselves have been ""streamlined"" from those presented in the 5th Edition (5E) system to make them easier to grasp for new players. While the basic mechanics remain the same, more complex details like proficiencies and racial bonuses have been simplified or skipped. In fact, character creation has been completely removed - players just select their characters from the previously generated (pre-gens) ones provided and start. Those experienced with RPGs should not panic about this, as Wizards of the Coast (WotC or Wizards for short) is currently providing expanded rules with that information FOR FREE on their website. Once players are ready, transitioning to the full rules set is both easy and exciting.Lost Mine of Phandelver Adventure Book in more detail: this is the gem of the box set. Primarily used by the Dungeon Master (DM), it contains the base story that the person running the game will present to the players. Set in the famous Forgotten Realms setting (now the default D&D world), there is enough adventure to get the group from level 1 to level 5; in other words, enough material for multiple days of play in most cases. But the information contained in Appendix B (MONSTERS), can last even longer. Providing stats for many of the traditional fantasy monsters players would find interesting to encounter (the list includes ogres, orcs, skeletons, goblins, bugbears, and even a young dragon - pretty much everything but kobolds), DMs can use this to help design their own adventures without having to buy additional products.Conclusion: those new to RPGs will definitely get the most out of this box, and are the target market for the product. More experienced gamers, however, may notice a number of flaws with it. For instance, the books are printed on relatively light paper with less-than-sturdy covers (especially compared to many of the previous boxed sets). As well, the dice set is BEAUTIFUL (a marbled blue set), but lacks a percentile d10 (not necessary, but desired by many gamers). Finally, there is a definite lack of that feeling of epic adventure that many previous D&D products contained. Why? Probably because there's no introduction story (a piece of fiction that sets the mood when you first start to read the rules) or single-player adventure (included in previous edition box sets). While I know space was a concern, including text to fire up the imagination for a game that primarily takes place in the mind would have been a good idea in my opinion.Rating: 3 Out of 5 Stars. With its low price and streamlined rules, this box set is an excellent entry point for those new to roleplaying games. More experienced gamers, however, would probably get more out of downloading the expanded rules WotC provides for free on its website or buying the Player's Handbook.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R19Z9LBONVH3JP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0786965592#wasThisHelpful","R19Z9LBONVH3JP","A3GM64N13BILUP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3GM64N13BILUP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Star Wars Edge of the Empire Game Master's Kit is a fine addition to any GM's toy box, but is a bit mislabeled - what you are purchasing is actually a heavy cardboard GM's Screen and a 30 page magazine-style booklet. The booklet itself is 25 pages of adventure and 5 pages of information on how to better run a Nemesis. The adventure was an interesting but not truly dazzling work involving Hutts and droids; the Nemesis section I've so far found useless. The GM screen is extremely sturdy, and displays basic tables from the core rulebook on the four different partition sections. That pretty much sums up the product.So, for a recommended retail price of $19.99 + tax, you get a sturdy GM screen, a short adventure, and a few pages of explanations for GMs only. To me, this wasn't worth the price - I'd rather buy a cheaper partition (maybe from an office supply story; maybe just use a GM screen from a different game) and spend the rest of my money on another Edge of The Empire product (perhaps a full adventure book like _The Jewel of Yavin_; something with adventure hooks and source material like _Suns of Fortune_; or maybe one of the career ""splatbooks"" like _Dangerous Covenants_).Rating: 3 out of 5 Stars.

"I purchased the _Sisun USB 3.0 3.5-Inch SATA aluminum hard drive enclosure with cooling fan_ (USB 3.0 to SATA - Model WLX-393U3) and use it with both my Western Digital Black 2 TB SATA III 7200 RPM 64 MB Cache Hard Drive and the WD Green 2 TB Desktop 3.5 Inch SATA III 64 MB Cache Hard Drive (I switch them into the enclosure as needed). What I can honestly say is that the enclosure WORKS when it comes to connecting the hard drives to my computer via USB 3.0 (and previous USB versions, since they are backwards compatible). That is the most important aspect of the product, so it earns a base 3 stars from me for that reason alone (you'd be surprised at how many electronic items DO NOT work properly).The enclosure just doesn't do much beyond that, however, and is not well made. The enclosure does not secure the hard drive inside itself with any sort of cradle or rack - you just plug the drive in and screw down the lid. If the enclosure fit the drive snugly, it wouldn't be a problem - but, because there is a lot of space inside, the drive rattles when the enclosure is moved and seems susceptible to damage. The cooling fan is also significantly louder than those on the other enclosures I own, but does not produce any additional air flow.Note: I did not use any sort of install disk - I just plugged my hard drive into the enclosure and then slotted the device into the USB port of my Windows 7 internet-connected PC. The drive itself had to be formatted before it could be recognized, but that is not the responsibility of the enclosure - that's something that can be done through the Computer/Disk Manager software.Rating: 3 out of 5 stars. The enclosure works, but is cheaply made. It is almost more of a hard drive docking station than an enclosure, since enclosures generally provide more protection (and a snugger fit) to the hard drive inside of them.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R34G0VT5JVAZ4W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JEYRKSS#wasThisHelpful","R34G0VT5JVAZ4W","A3GM64N13BILUP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3GM64N13BILUP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This review comes in after just over three months of play from the official release date. At this point, many of the common release bugs others have complained about have been fixed. As well, some of the larger issues (such as the guild bank item and gold duping bug) have been found and dealt with. While there are still some gold farming spammers and bots roaming the land, their numbers have been significantly decreased. In short, the Elder Scrolls Online (ESO) world is now playable by all standards.The basic game mechanics are excellent. Significantly different from the stand-alone Elder Scrolls computer games, I actually find ESO's combat system more enjoyable than Skyrim's (previous ES game), especially when it comes to casting combat magic. By leveling and gaining shards, characters can learn a large selection of skills in the game - but are focused into a specific role by only having a limited number of associated abilities available at any given time. Abilities can be switched during non-combat situations (so a character filling a damage role could switch to one of a healer), but they are locked in during a fight.I've also found the quests to be very enjoyable. Though there are some of the traditional Fed/Ex and rat-killing quests, most others are more involved and are associated with one storyline or another. The over-arcing world quest (the same for each character) and the guild quests are well thought out and feel truly epic. The problem is, they also tend to feel like they're designed for a single player experience (because they are in the case of the world quest and the guild quests); most of the time, other players get in the way of enjoyment of these quests rather than enhancing the experience. As an MMO (Massive Multiple Online Game), this SHOULD NOT BE THE CASE.Which brings us to ESO's biggest problem: it really isn't designed as an MMO. The group finder is difficult to use and is less effective than a zone-chat call of ""LOOKING FOR GROUP."" The presence of other players in dungeons detracts from the experience, especially when they are camping certain spawns. PvP is not particularly enjoyable, and is far behind that of other games. The game doesn't have a lot of ""sandbox"" features that would allow it to be played over-and-over again differently - as previously mentioned, all characters play the same main world quest, and upon its completion you're expected to submit to be randomly assigned another starting faction that you play in what amounts to hard mode. To put it simply: after you play through ESO's main storyline once, things get boring.Rating: 3 out of 5 stars overall. If you enjoy quest-based CRPGs and have already played Skyrim, you'd probably enjoy buying this game and playing it for a few months (keeping in mind ESO has a monthly subscription fee at this time). If you're looking for a really good MMO that is fun to play in a group, though, look somewhere else.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2PNDI5FF2YI6H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0081Q58AW#wasThisHelpful","R2PNDI5FF2YI6H","A3GM64N13BILUP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3GM64N13BILUP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you're looking for an interesting book that hits many of the interesting points in the history of modern medicine, _Kill or Cure_ may be for you. A moderately hefty tome (400 pages in hardback), _Kill or Cure_ touches on everything from prehistoric medicine to modern robotic surgery. It is in no way completely comprehensive, but it is certainly an excellent start for those wanting to learn more about the subject matter.The book's biggest draw is the large number of photographs and illustrations it contains; these both allow readers to better understand the material and help lift the sometimes monotonous subject matter. They do an excellent job of this, but could stand to be somewhat larger on some occasions (the tattooed caveman remains on page 19, for instance, take up less than a fourth of a page and are difficult to clearly see).Rating: 4 out of 5 stars.

"I've had difficulty finding larger gloves that fit properly and don't rip. These gloves did the trick. They fit much better than the vinyl gloves I had been wearing, and don't rip nearly as often when putting them on. Also, they come unpowdered, so there's no significant hand drying or getting fingerprints everywhere when you take them off.

"This wet/dry contractor vac works great; I have no complaints about it. Great design, excellent power for the style - it does what it is supposed to do. I can't say it any more clearly than that.What I can do is comment on some of the negative reviews I've read of this model and its lack of wheels. Most of these have come from Vine reviewers that received a free vac in order to review it (I know this because I am also a Vine reviewer and received one for free). Such reviews are like receiving a free sled and then complaining because it doesn't have wheels like a wagon. THIS MODEL ISN'T SUPPOSED TO HAVE WHEELS. If you want one with wheels, go buy a model THAT HAS THEM - they're out there. This specific tool doesn't have wheels, and there are many areas/functions where the wheels would be counterproductive.

Others have complained about them breaking easily, and they do not feel particularly sturdy when being worn.

"The GE100 Blood Glucose Monitoring System is a nice starter kit for those either just getting started with blood sugar checks or those needing a (semi-) complete kit. It comes with meter, test strips, control solution, lancets, lancing device, a really nice (and short) quickstart guide, manual, and case. What it doesn't come with are alcohol wipes, bandages, or cotton balls (items I was told to use back when I learned how to do a check, but that may have gone out of favor - or maybe not).Overall, my experience with the monitor has been pretty positive. The display is very large and easy to read; the strips don't need a lot of blood for an accurate reading. My problem comes from the lancets (the thing that prick your finger) - I have very minor arthritis in my hands, and I find it EXTREMELY difficult to get the caps off the lancets without bending the needles. This may not be a drawback for everyone, but people with moderate arthritis should be aware of the issue (they may have to get a different lancing device). Otherwise, I have no complaints about the system, and have used it well.Rating: 4 out of 5 stars. The monitor has worked well for me, but the lancing device might be difficult for people with hand issues to use.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 12, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R28DN1WP9BBWG5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CI4KF56#wasThisHelpful","R28DN1WP9BBWG5","A3GM64N13BILUP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3GM64N13BILUP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the English translation of Limit, originally written in German by author Frank Schatzing. I am a fan of both fiction (especially Sci-Fi) and German authors (example: Markus Heitz's translated Dwarves series), and was looking forward to reading this book when I first heard about it. So, when this massive 950+ page tome arrived in the mail, I was elated. After reading 200 pages, though, my enthusiasm had declined significantly; by the time I was half-way through, I was wondering what I had gotten myself into.But let's start at the beginning. The prologue, which details the happenings of one very unlucky astronaut, is incredible. Highly descriptive, it contains action, character development, interesting sci-fi, and (*GASP*) an actual story arc where things happen at a reasonable pace. If the entire book had been like this prologue, I would have been extremely happy!But it wasn't. So I'm not.Limit is a book of uneven pacing with painfully long stretches of nothing important happening. It also needed a better editor. There are chapters that are flooded with newly introduced cookie-cutter characters that will overload the short-term memory of readers. Other chapters are devoted to painfully long dialogues that are supposed to inform readers of world happenings, but just drag on over superficial points. The worst part is, hundreds of pages pass with almost no advancement of the main storyline. It speeds up towards the end of the book, but you have to read a lot of pages before then - and most people just don't have the time and patience for that.Rating: 2 out of 5 stars. I liked the Sci-Fi concepts introduced, but the book just moves too slowly for me.","2.0 out of 5 stars","December 12, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RFXL96ILVQA1P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1623650445#wasThisHelpful","RFXL96ILVQA1P","A3GM64N13BILUP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3GM64N13BILUP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Adobe Premiere Elements is one of the best selling consumer video editing software packages on the market. That title was well earned with earlier releases, but - in my opinion - one that the software failed to live up to in more recent versions due to bugs and other glitches. Using PE 12, I can honestly say most of those bugs seem to be gone for the Windows version, and all I am seeing is a great program I enjoy using.So, what makes PE 12 so enjoyable to use? Simplicity and power. While the current version is not quite as user friendly as some of the earlier ones, most users will find it much easier to figure out than, say, Sony Vegas Movie Studio (my other favorite Windows video editing program). Adding special effects is easily done, and the various modes allow more experienced users to skip over guided creation when they are ready to do so. As well, PE 12 has seamlessly integrated DVD creation that will let you make professional-quality menus from templates with ease (add Photoshop Elements for the ability to completely customize these templates).Please note that prospective buyers should consider the Premiere/Photoshop Elements software bundle that is also available. The bundle tends to provide significant savings over the combined cost of the two programs, and Photoshop Elements can be very useful when producing videos (creating DVD menu templates, making still images for the videos, etc..).Rating: 4.5 Out of 5 Stars (rounded to 5). Powerful and easy to use video editing software. I can highly recommend the Windows version.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 28, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2QIKYZWLBEJ3B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EOQZB32#wasThisHelpful","R2QIKYZWLBEJ3B","A3GM64N13BILUP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3GM64N13BILUP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Boston Acoustics MC100 is an impressive speaker system that merges modern connectivity with excellent sound. Designed to be small enough to fit on a shelf or the corner of a desk, it never the less has enough volume to clearly and completely carry music through a noisy room (say, during a party). It has the typical ""modern style"" look of being black with blue lighting accents, and also comes with a small remote for volume control (the volume buttons are also duplicated on the top of the device). Connection is done easily through one of three methods: traditional Bluetooth, NFC, or direct cable connection via an auxiliary port.I primarily use mine with my laptop, and have yet to have any issues. Initially connecting the device wirelessly took seconds, and it has played through hundreds of songs and videos now without a glitch. All I get is clear sound!An interesting note about the system: did you know it has ports? It has both an auxiliary-in port and a headphone port. Don't discount either of these - the ""Aux-In"" allows you to connect older or non-BT devices easily with a cord (like when you want to listen to your old iPod Shuffle mix); the headphone port not only allows you to connect headphones (if, say, you're in the office and want to be courteous to others), but also allows you to pass a signal through to other devices. You probably won't ever need to pass a signal through, but I have done it once.Rating: 5 Out of 5 Stars.

"The Defender 22502 Digital Wireless Video Monitor System falls into a niche somewhere above traditional baby monitors but below most home security monitoring systems. It is actually somewhat difficult to completely gauge the device's features and limits because so little documentation is provided (mine came with a single sheet of paper that amounted to a quickstart guide; the promised manual that was supposed to be online had yet to be released when I checked). Still, I was able to figure out most of the menu options, and have used the device successfully.The system does have many good points. The camera works well, and is easily controlled by the monitoring unit. It produces a respectable color picture in normal light, and a decent black-and-white image in low light. The monitor has excellent range when the antenna is extended, and ""video"" can be recorded to the MicroSD card with a simple press of a button (.SNX file). There are also many other features, including a digital zoom, photo mode, and an intercom feature (though the sound produced is not particularly clear).The bad points, though, are also numerous. My biggest complaint is the lack of documentation - it literally doesn't even show you where to put the SD card. That documentation could also have answered some of my concerns like how exactly does ""ClearVu Technology"" make the signal secure (can anyone with a monitor see the image? How about anyone with a Defender monitor?). But there are other issues as well. These include the camera image ""flashing"" in total darkness, needing to remove the monitor's battery to download the videos to your computer, and the camera jumping to night mode too quickly in areas with shadows.Finally, the fact that this system DOES NOT have a lot of options is worth mentioning. For instance, with the provided materials, you can not link this system up to your WiFi network, computer, or smartphone (you can with many other security systems); this package is expandable only in the sense that you can buy more cameras for it. Also, there is no motion alarm mode or other security function for the device (it can turn on if it detects noise, however - just not sound an alarm). If features like this interest you, then you should look elsewhere for your monitoring needs.Rating: 2 Out of 5 Stars. The Defender 22502 is little more than a glorified baby monitor. If that's all you want it for, it will serve you well; if you're looking for an actual security device, though, you should probably look elsewhere.","2.0 out of 5 stars","November 27, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3B9W1E3XS1S2P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00G28IP38#wasThisHelpful","R3B9W1E3XS1S2P","A3GM64N13BILUP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3GM64N13BILUP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The TP-LINK TL-WN823N 300Mbps Mini Wireless N USB Adapter is VERY impressive. I've been using similar devices for years to connect my computers wirelessly to the internet, and this one has impressed me the most. Its extremely small size when plugged in is a definite plus (much shallower profile than the hard edge of my power cable), and it picks up signals just as well if not better than my previous adapters that were three times the size. It functions extremely well on my Windows 7 system, and I have no complaints about the adapter itself.What dropped my rating from 5 to 4 stars for this product is the included TP-Link Wireless Configuration Utility. The software could not seem to figure out how to connect to my wireless home router with one-touch setup. I fixed this by using Windows 7's built-in network connection software, and everything worked perfectly. So, you may think about just installing the drivers from the included CD-ROM and not the configuration utility.Rating: 4 out of 5 stars.

"I really wanted to like the Genius Cam Mouse. I do freelance work that involves QR codes, so having a code scanner on my computer is something I could really use - and the Genius Cam Mouse promised to do that and more. The problem is, the only thing this mouse does well is move the pointer on the screen, and that's something a much cheaper mouse could also accomplish.There are so many things wrong with this product that it would be difficult to properly list them all in the space allotted for this review. I'll hit the biggest ones in the order I discovered them: the 25+ page manual only has three pages of actual instructions in English, and those aren't enough to properly explain how to get features like the QR code scanner to work (doesn't seem to work with most programs, either); installing the provided drivers actually slowed down the booting of my computer slightly but noticeably; the 2.0 megapixel camera shoots grainy photos, and is not as advanced as the ones on most modern smartphones; the video recordings are choppy and grainy; the various camera features DO NOT WORK WELL with programs other than the provided Genius/Arcsoft photo and video software; it is difficult to properly aim the camera (no sight other than lagged video image on screen); getting the mouse to actually scan QR codes is a difficult process that only seems to be possible within the provided software; the provided software does not work completely with touchscreens; etc, etc, etc...I have now unplugged the mouse from my computer and uninstalled all of the software. It will sit on my desk as a paperweight for the next few days until I can give it away to charity or otherwise dispose of it in a way that might actually benefit society (the two dollars the secondhand store will get for it will do something for someone, after all).Rating: 1 Star (wish I could give it 0).

"This review is for the AmazonBasics DSLR and Laptop Backpack with Orange Interior. A black backpack with three primary sections and multiple pockets/straps, the name of this product is a bit misleading - you can hold all different kinds of stuff in it, not just a DSLR camera or a laptop. I use mine to hold my camera, camcorder, various battery packs, chargers, USB mouse, laptop accessories, and (yes) even my laptop on some occasions. The primary feature of the pack is the central compartment, which contains Velcro-edged interior pads that can be easily positioned to make 9 different compartments; they can also be removed completely to create larger (but fewer) spaces or one large opening (like a normal backpack). The other two primary sections include a completely open section for a laptop, and another section with a pouch and straps for smaller items (keys, pens, whatever).My experience with the backpack has been pretty positive. The orange interior does help to differentiate smaller pieces in lower-light settings (to an extent), and it does have a lot of storage room. I have positioned the main section's compartments to hold exactly what I need, so it is certainly doing its job. And the exterior pockets and straps are a nice touch, though I have not yet trusted my tripod to be attached to it yet (mine is probably a little too large for it - a monopod or lightweight tripod would probably work, however).There are two areas I'm not 100% happy with, however. The first is that small items can slip from the positionable compartments and end up further down into the bag. Design-wise, this could have been fixed by having Velcro on three sides of the interior pads that form the wall of the compartment, as well as having some sort of webbing over the opposite side. That, however, probably would have raised the price significantly, so the cheaper fix is to store those pieces in smallTupperware containers or other storage boxes at least a couple inches long on each side so they don't slip out. My other area of concern is the felt-like material the interior is made of (and that the Velcro sticks to) - it just doesn't feel particularly sturdy. Every time I move one of the Velcro compartment walls, it seems like the interior is going to rip. There are already a few threads hanging, so I don't reposition those compartments often (you really shouldn't have to). Again, for the price and what I am using it for(transporting my camcorder and camera to different events around town), I'm okay with that drawback.Rating: 4 out of 5 stars. Great backpack for general use, but buy something more durable (and expensive) if you're going to use this in adverse conditions such as long hikes, bad weather, or anything beyond general storage and transport across town.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 21, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3M0BLOQ9AALJ5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CF5OGP8#wasThisHelpful","R3M0BLOQ9AALJ5","A3GM64N13BILUP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3GM64N13BILUP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Raise the Bar is an incredible book that explains the business philosophy of famous bar owner and TV personality Jon Taffer. The entire book can be summarized in one sentence: to Taffer, everything is about reactions. Evidence of this includes the title of chapter one (""You Sell One Thing: Reactions""), the title of chapter three (""Money is in Reactions, Not Transactions""), and the majority of the non-background content from the front cover to the back. This ""reaction management"" philosophy sounds easy, but - for the majority of readers - it is a mind-blowing and out-of-the-box concept they may have thought of in the past but have almost certainly not given enough consideration to.So, now that I've told you the secret of the book, do you still need to buy it? Probably. The strength of the writing is in both convincing the reader how important the reaction philosophy is AND in how to properly execute it in the real world. Though _Raise the Bar_ is certainly not a college textbook, Taffer does directly lay out a number of methods point by point to achieve this goal. This includes how to hire the correct people, the four rules of Taffer's overarching business philosophy, his five customer service standards, an explanation of four-walls marketing, and much more. There's even an appendix called ""Creating the Perfect Menu"" that some may find useful.Is everything in this book perfect? No. The writing style may be a little bit too informal for some, and I also don't think Taffer focuses enough on marketing strategies (his excitement and pride over ""the big fat claim"" in chapter 5 seemed a bit odd to me - people have been using freebie and chained coupons for a long time). But there are other books out there that can fill in the few weak spots, so to speak.Rating: 5 out of 5 stars. If you're interested in business (even non-bar business), you'll probably find something of use in these pages.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 1, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R12H94PXGCAXJ6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0544148304#wasThisHelpful","R12H94PXGCAXJ6","A3GM64N13BILUP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3GM64N13BILUP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Tomcat Live Catch Mouse Trap is a device I've successfully used to catch five critters living it up in my unused extra bedroom. Thanks to this trap, all five were caught and released alive in the woods down the road, there to take their place in the ""circle of life"" rather than ending up as so much rotting landfill in the local dump. Either peanut butter or Nutella was used to bait the trap in each case, and the device itself came out undamaged every time.So, what is this item? It is a fulcrum (think see-saw or teeter-totter) with a hinged lid at one end. The mouse goes in the open hinged-lid end, travels down the tube to the bait, and its weight causes the trap to tip slightly. The tipping trap raises the hinged lid, which then closes. When the mouse tries to scoot out the way it came, the lid is pressed closed even tighter, and the critter is trapped!If you are looking for a low cost, extremely effective mouse trap that is no-kill / humane, then this might be the trap for you. I say might because, quite honestly, there are some people that should not use this trap. For instance, if you can't check the trap at least twice a day (preferably three or more times), you shouldn't use it - anything caught in it for longer would probably die. Why? Because this isn't the mouse version of the Barbie Dream House (there actually is one of those, and it costs twice as much and isn't quite as reusable) - this is a small tube that will catch mice alive in a relatively cramped area. Also, if you have very large mice or rats, the tube may not be big enough to capture them (they will tend to knock the trap over on their way in, which allows the bait to be eaten but keeps the door from closing. This has happened to me twice). There are some larger traps (including the previously mentioned ""smart"" mouse trap and the Havahart traps) that might work better, but keep in mind that they have their drawbacks, too.The biggest negative I have about this item isn't the trap itself, but is the lack of decent directions that come with it. The device is packaged with a single sheet of instructions, but they are painfully lacking in useful details. For instance, a lot of the complaints I've seen about the trap not being sensitive enough to catch lighter mice could have been avoided if the directions stated that using more bait (thus increasing the weight on one end of the fulcrum) would be necessary to catch lighter mice (the trap will also not stay open if too much peanut butter is used - gotta find the right balance). Additional tips include: place trap on a hard surface such as a box top or multiple CD cases when using in a carpeted area; transfer mice into a larger enclosure if transporting long distances (taking the mouse for a three hour drive to the country in that tube = dead mouse); place in corner to help prevent large mice from knocking it over when entering trap; placing a tiny bit of peanut butter covered cracker in front of the trap's opening draws them to it more quickly.Rating: 4 out of 5 stars. Excellent trap that works, but needs better directions.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 18, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3W1LVSLSPVK1S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000X7VM6G#wasThisHelpful","R3W1LVSLSPVK1S","A3GM64N13BILUP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3GM64N13BILUP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Baseball players are on strike and many of their fans are furious.  How dare these millionaires ask for more.

When the baseball crimes grab huge headlines they are recruited(of sorts) to aid in the solving of the hideous endings that befall the rich, pampered players.I hate to say more as mystery/crime books depends so much on the element of surprise.  I detest the thought of giving too much away so that your reading of this cozier mystery will somehow be impeded.There are a few problems; perhaps a bit too much background on characters that are not pivotal to plot; maybe a few effusive musing from a character that I couldn't image waxing this elegant.  Overall, however, if is a fun, enjoyable read and Michael Draper has improved so vastly after this first endeavor.

"I am always loathe to give low scores for new authors who really have a good story going.  In fact, I was uncomfortable carrying the large trade cover I received from Amazon so I purchased the book from Kindle.  I did this thinking I liked the first 100 pages and since it was longer this venue would provide me with my favorite form of reading.(these days)  But, as I read page after page after page of this book I began to weary.  The problem in my mind is the author stays way too long on subjects until they are like beating a dead horse.  I did plow through, but didn't have the pleasurable experience I was counting on.The positives;!) I did get through it where I usually toss a book after the first hundred pages if it is boring me. I am 60 years old, have been reading since I was 4 and am really particular about things like the flow of a book.2) The characters are deeply scoped which allowed me to care about them even with their powerful eccentricities.3)  The writing it is beautiful, but just too redundant.I will say no more as I wish this author great good wishes.

"The writing is delightful, the historical elements well sought(though in all honesty  haven't checked all the facts) the characters well described and the banter between Queen Elizabeth the 1(daughter of Henry the 8th and Anne Boleyn) and her subjects including a handsome renegade , Robert Dudley is interesting.  Elizabeth staunchly refuses to marry any princes or kings from France or Spain to garner allies, deciding instead to make her own choices.My problem; all apologies to Alison Weir who has totally entertained and enlightened me over the years with the Tudor reign;  I think I am just worn out of the subject.  It was my fault in picking this book to read not realizing that I have wearied of so.Please buy it if you like the subterfuge and wrangling inside the walls of the castles.  Alison Weir does an excellent job.

"I received a free copy of this book from Amazon Vine in trade cover.  Drawn in by the first page or two, I found it so hard to read as the print was inordinately  tiny and my eyes felt so strained.  However, my love of the exquisite writing pushed me to a choice that readers everywhere will understand......I decided to purchase the book for $9.99 from Amazon Kindle.  I will lend the free one out to better eyes than mine, but I do NOT regret in any form the money I spent.The story is an epic tale of man against time, place and situation.  Morgan's prose describing the Depression hit me so acutely;  though the Richard's were poor back wood folk, their ownership of a cow, a garden, etc made them able to reach out to the troubled hobos, some with families, that straggled by.  This family's whole lives were hard but they accept it with grace and humility.  Far from perfect human's, there are moments of trouble but even they seem valiant.The narrator, Annie, shares with us the time period from the 20's to the 40's.  Robert Morgan descriptions made this reader honestly see the Appalachian area and the characters.  It is not a fast moving pace, but one that dares you to dwell for moments upon the historical fact, upon moments that are tiny but so significant and to gaze upon this vast land and taste it as the Richard's did.Superb!!  I read ""Gap Creek"" several years ago and remember still how tough the lives of that group......Robert Morgan conveys this subject matter with such finesse.  EXCELLENT!!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1MTXELKE5U85R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1616201614#wasThisHelpful","R1MTXELKE5U85R","A10YWQ4AAAE29O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A10YWQ4AAAE29O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"From the opening page of ""What I Remember Most"" I was absolutely hooked.  Ms. Lamb as a writer has done this before to me; what a talent that is!  I spent two sleepless nights(at least until my eyes hurt so badly I had to get a bit of sleep) reading this book as it is that compelling. Her characters are so rich, so beautifully explained through her composition of each.  The story is more suspenseful than anything I have read by her before.(which just lit the fire under me to keep reading at a nearly insane pace.)I won't delve into plot and such as other reviewers have done that beautifully.  I just want to concur that this is my favorite Cathy Lamb book, tied with ""Henry's Sisters.""  I will say I have her prior two books to read so they may tie as well, but you cannot go wrong buying ""What I Remember Most.""Happy, eye blurring, reading! :-)","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3CROUFKU1COFA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IUPCKLY#wasThisHelpful","R3CROUFKU1COFA","A10YWQ4AAAE29O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A10YWQ4AAAE29O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"""Margaretville DM3400-000-000 Bali Frozen Concoction Maker"" is absolutely fantastic.  Large in size, it can almost be daunting, but it is so easy to utilize if you follow the directions.  Not only does it mix your drink it dispenses it as well.  THUS, no need to play ""hostess with the mostest"" pouring maybe two drinks at a time from your blender.  The early recipients of drinks are ready for another before you serve all your guests.  No problem with this dynamic device.  I have noticed others have explained the details of how to work this, but I want to share just how easy it is to throw a party and not be working the whole time.  Smoothies in the morning that can be refrigerated for later consumption in a pitcher.  Party time at 5(cause you know what they say about 5 0 clock and party time?)  Make sure you have plenty of ice, fruits and whatever alcohol(or not) you would enjoy.  I myself love frozen alcohol-free drinks, but this fits all taste buds.

There isn't any creepy smells afterward which is nice.  Of course keeping it up high and out of sight is always a good plan if children reside in your home.The one con I have is that when I went to snap off the white cap at the top it nearly fell in my hands. I don't like the safety issue with that.  It can easily be pulled off if a little hand decided to try it.

"Father Tim and Cynthia are back from Ireland and ready to take on their quiet retirement. Ha! Mitford and it's cast of quirky, but lovable townspeople have other ideas.The new priest, Father Talbot, fights inner demons that lead to his own demise.  Of course Father Tim is called to be his replacement till Father Bob from Colorado can come in.  Will Father Tim take on this challenge?  Will he give up ""retirement"" to honor this request?Sammy, Dooley's youngest brother is angry and sharing that anger with all that cross his path.  That he lives next door in Father's Tim's home in the basement with his brothers, puts a conundrum at Father's Tim next door step.  Helene, who rents out the basement, is calling for Sammy's dismissal and runs to Father Tim to come up with a solution for her dilemma.Hope, from ""Happy Endings Bookstore"" is happily pregnant, but this blessed event confines her to bed with no one to run her shop.  Who, if anyone, will step in and keep it running?J.C, the editor of Mitford's ""The Muse"" has hired a new reporter who asks, ""Does Mitford Still Takes Care of It's Own?""  This becomes a heated debate among the townsfolk.Jan Karon offers other problems, but also joys as she writes in her famous heart-rending prose.  I laughed, I cried, and I LOATHED coming to the end of this larger than normal tome.  I could have read 500 more pages and still never been bored.  She writes with such grace, such understanding of characters, bringing them alive so that you swear you know these people.  Mitford is your town as are the occupants.  I own this whole series and pray that I may re-read them all someday.....for now I will say that ""Somewhere Safe with Somebody Good"" will be my favorite tied with ""Shepherds Abiding?""  Course I would always feel each had it's own ambiance and fulfillment.  All are top notch.I almost envy you who now have this book coming in September to read for the first time.  I love being in Mitford every time I visit and pray many, many more visits are to come.  Glad you are in  great health, Ms. Karon, and pray that you realize how many of us out here love you for the series that brightens our lives.

"Laura McBride, first time novelist, has written a tour d force book set in the bowels of Las Vegas.  Behind the glitz and glitter many live quiet lives of desperation.Meet Baskim, a 7 year old boy whose parents are refugees from Albania. His family consist only of Baba, an angry bitter father, Nene, a loving, but lonely, depressed mother, and Tirana, a 2 year old sister.  Their tiny income ekes  from an ice cream truck and Nene's job at Kohl's.  Baskim is often hungry.  His elementary teacher and principal rise to the occasion by sharing their lunches and snacks.  They listen to Baskim very astutely.  This without knowledge of Baba who is erratically suspicious of  government personage.May I introduce Specialist Luis Rodriguez-Reyes and Nathan, both soldiers serving 3 tours of duty in Iraq, returning physically and emotionally damaged to their homes in ""Sin City.""  One accepts help from those that rise to assist; one does not.Encounter Avis, recently and surprisingly divorced after many years who is the mother of Nathan; Abuela Reyes, Luis's loving grandmother; Roberta, an attorney who volunteers with CASA(child advocate group) and Mrs. Delain, a foster mother who has loved, cuddled, and supported many children over her lifetime.Baskim, Avis, Luis Rodriguez-Reyes and Roberta are the narrators explaining the situation while introducing other characters who must rise.  All of these people's wits, hearts, and souls are tested after a horrible tragedy occurs.I don't want to indulge too much of the plot, so instead I will deeply encourage you to read this masterpiece of heart-ache assuaged by humanity.  Each person rising up to meet the situation as best they are able.This is an astounding tale not to be missed.  The flow is page turning, the characters deeply rooted and sometimes gutted for the reader's understanding.  A tale heartbreaking, yet hopeful.Ms. McBride has based this on a real event that occurred in Las Vegas years ago, pulled from headlines with knowledge from other sources.  Fictional, but all too real.The author was angst to present this tale without severely depressing her audience.  She succeeds.

""Degree Motionsense"" does EXACTLY what is promises in that it keeps you from sweating and also controls the scent of said sweat.

The promise to be invisible is kept; you can wear those sleeveless shirts and not worry that the underarms of your blouse  will get stained.

"In 1832, at the age of 18 Alice Burrows leaves the roots of her family farm behind, lured by the giant cotton mills in Lowell, MA.  Her own money, promise of gals and guys her age, and independence convince her these places must be perfect.  She has room and board(a broken down old building that is freezing in the winter and stifling in  the summer) her own earnings( paltry for 6 day-12 hour shifts of uncompromising work) and friends(who she commiserates with during their few free hours)  Alice awakens to the harshness and it is with a jolt; the mill which is so dangerous because of outdated machinery, no safety measures, the cotton that falls freely into the lungs of the girls weaving it and the easy firing of those who won't keep up the shifts or report problems.When people begin to become miserably ill or die the book picks up pace.  Secret meetings by all the cotton workers are held, plans are hatched to insure safety measures, a murder trial ensues, a romance commences that may not be the best for either participant.  Intrigue ensues making the pages turn much more quickly.This was an interesting read and though I didn't love it as I did ""The Dressmaker"" I read it and found it informative about the ancestors of those times that made the way a little less rocky for their predecessors.  I would like to visit these mills that have been preserved if I ever get out into that area.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3VDK317KWA30C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385536496#wasThisHelpful","R3VDK317KWA30C","A10YWQ4AAAE29O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A10YWQ4AAAE29O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Anna Quindlen is a favorite author of mine so it was predestined that I would get this book.(smile)  I didn't know what to expect, but I really enjoyed that it was a quiet, slower paced, endearing fictitious novel featuring Rebecca Winter, a renown photographer, middle aged, who has fallen on hard financial times due to a divorce and life changes. A need to find her refreshed self through art once more drives Rebecca to rent out her trendy NYC apartment and move to a sleepy little town.  She allots one year to find new direction in her pictured career.The writing is very descriptive and the characters really intriguing. Down home folk; quirky, realistic and ultimately endearing.  Events in this sleepy berg awaken Rebecca to unperceived choices that await her finding; for her enjoyment, for some disappointment, but ultimately for her awakening from entrenched habits to new possibilities.I think women will appreciate this soft, touching, observant book more than men.

"Lee Smith is a new find for me and I must say I struck gold immediately.  ""Guests on Earth"" is written with vivid descriptions, imaginative similes, characters so acutely discussed that I felt as if I knew them one by one.  Ms. Smith personifies the title of author and storyteller.Evalina Toussaint, having lost her fragile mother(an exotic dancer in New Orleans) to suicide is sent to a very posh mental facility financed by the mother's ex-lover whom is riddled with grief and guilt.  At twelve the establishment seems glorious to Evalina; the hospital mandates long hikes, swimming, and a multitude of physical activity.  Also garnered is artistic fervor and all forms of painting, dance, theater and music are enjoyed by the wealthy cliental.  Evalina even meets Zelda Fitzgerald at Highland House; amused and somewhat frightened by Zelda, Evalina gives her wide berth.  The Carroll's, psychiatrist and wife, foster the gifts Evalina exudes thus providing her with a great education, a prowess for the piano, etc.  But during the twelve years of her life lived in and around, Highland House, Evalina witnesses the many cracks of this institution as well as a fire that lead to demise.  And the treatments that can be used are less than humane.Walking through this time with Evalina was so fascinating. Surprisingly not terribly maudlin, the writing flows so easily and Evalina steals the readers heart and head as do former and present patients within the mental institution.Amazing read that assures I will be perusing  more of  Lee Smith's masterpieces.RECOMMENDED!","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1WEHV3HKWB4O5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=161620253X#wasThisHelpful","R1WEHV3HKWB4O5","A10YWQ4AAAE29O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A10YWQ4AAAE29O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The high quality of these ""Liquid Ink Dry-Erase Markers"" led me to purchase a message board.  Having erroneously read these to be markers for packaging and labeling I thought at first, ""oh, no.""

"I have been a reader of  most literature for years now so occasionally if I come upon a book that doesn't keep my interest I no longer insist I must finish it.  Having read other books that cover abuse of women with a greater panache, I stopped at 124 pages in.  My major complaint was it was not moving me and I am quite an emotional person.  I am usually drawn into dilemmas like this of a young mother and her two young daughters forced to flee a punishing husband and father.  However, for whatever reason the story evoked no senses in me of their peril.I realize how hard it is to write a book; how a novelist anguishes and gives it the best they know how.  I admire anyone with that fortitude to complete one.  Perhaps with more time, Suzanne Redfearn will master the ability of high drama more astutely.  I am sorry I didn't enjoy the read and am sure some others will connect.  It may have been I have read this plot line too often, so will offer that as a stance.  But I know I wasn't drawn in and had to MAKE myself try to read.  Life is simply too short in your 50's to force oneself to plod through a book.  That is just my truth.Please keep writing, Ms. Redfearn and I will not be afraid to try you again.  We just missed each other in this read.","3.0 out of 5 stars","February 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RTWUO0X42P1QD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1455573205#wasThisHelpful","RTWUO0X42P1QD","A10YWQ4AAAE29O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A10YWQ4AAAE29O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

It is so tastefully done that I doubt whether people will question it's validity on any level unless a jeweler. The chain is tiny links that highlight the piece to even more brilliance.

"While this will not replace our current household vacuum, Dyson Ball Compact Animal Canister Vacuum Cleaner - it is up to the task. We prefer the versatility of our canister vacuum over this upright...mainly due to mobility, size and weight. This is also louder than most vacuums we have owned...but also not the loudest - middle of the road. Favorite thing is the EXTRA long bright orange cord - can vacuum almost the entire carpeted area of our home without moving the plug (everything but the laundry room).

"In Shameless, author Laura Wright gives readers two strong-willed characters that evolve quickly into each other’s happy ever after. The dialogue is fantastic…both are very vocal with their individual desires.Most Nephilim consider being called to join the Harem as an honor, but not Rosamund. She dreams of having a life, home and family…an impossibly if she remains at the Harem. She is forced to deceive everyone into order to ensure that she is released from her obligation after fulfilling her year. With only four days remaining, her determination is stronger than ever - until Incubus Master Scarus Vipera arrives. It has been five years since he last visited the Harem – forced to return due to his fading strength. I loved that he is unapologetic in his quest to consume power (feed). He selected Rosamund initially because she met his two criteria (1) has great power and (2) not in her fertile time.“I do not see the problem, Rosamund. You are Nephilim and I am Incubus. I take power and give pleasure. You give power and receive pleasure”Laura Wright ’s Dauntless novella is the retelling of the well-known Cinderella tale, with a few erotic twists. It is a story that has been told many times, in many ways – the Incubus/Nephilim makes this adaptation unique. Another unrepentant male...The Trevanion family tradition dictates that Incubus Master Casworon must mate with the Nephilim chosen for him. Cas believes that arranged matings is an antiquated practice and should be discontinued. The duty is a source of great contention between him and his mother. His mother is determined to solidify alliances with the royal families…no matter the cost to her son. Once a high-ranking and respected Temple Blade, Lia, now a servant in the House of Trevanion has yet to be introduced to the Lord of house. Cas’s Watchmen, Pennice, acts as the fairy godmother of this story offering Lia the opportunity to attend the party as a guest…restored to her previous beauty.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~I lowered the rating to 3 mainly due to the fact that I felt overall that there were important elements missing from these novellas. For Example: Who are the Three?

"My little Panasonic Lumix camera broke recently. The ""fins"" wouldn't open and it wouldn't zoom. I had been carrying it in my purse in a soft case. I'm not absolutely sure but I think this is the reason it broke. It was never dropped or abused so that's why my conclusion is an assumption.I really liked the camera I had so I bought another one. I didn't want the same thing to happen so I purchased this hard shell case. The camera fits like a glove and I feel it is very well protected. I carry accessories in a small zippered plastic bag so I didn't need any extra room.

"I purchase this for my 11 year old lab who had lymphatic fluid draining into his chest a year and 1/2 ago. I continued giving it to him after a very extensive surgery and I think, in part, it has kept him healthy. I also give him dehydrated sweet potato chips and a prescription low fat dog food. They call him the miracle dog! I was buying from from GMC, but buying at Amazon saves me about $12.00 per bottle, I think. Same brand, same everything.Chylothorax is a condition that results from the accumulation of lymphatic fluid in the chest cavity where the heart and lungs reside (pleural cavity). The main culprit of this condition is chyle, a digestive fluid that is formed in the small intestine and conveyed by the thoracic duct to the veins. En route to the veins, chyle can leak into the chest cavity, accumulating there and causing excessive pressure on the chest and its organs.Chyle is a milky to slightly yellow fluid made up of lymph and fats from the intestines and transferred to the circulation through the thoracic duct (the main trunk of the lymphatic system, which crosses the chest near the spine and empties into the circulation system). Lymph is a watery fluid that is produced by the tissues of the body and which contains white blood cells, which are essential for protecting the body. Lymph travels through the lymphatic vessels, transporting lymphocytes (white cells that function specifically for cellular immunity) and fats from the small intestines to the blood stream. Commonly, when chyle has accumulated in the chest cavity, blockage or obstruction of the lymphatic vessels will occur, causing the vessels to dilate and affecting the tissue that covers the lungs and lines the inner chest cavity. This tissue becomes inflamed and scar tissue forms, narrowing the space and constricting the lungs. Severe breathing problems may result.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 13, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R22X5PAZ0KFT9I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00014FLOA#wasThisHelpful","R22X5PAZ0KFT9I","A1AGAMA2YMJ90Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1AGAMA2YMJ90Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"These pads are perfect. The filling is quilted in tightly, the outer seams are secure, and they are very absorbent. You won't fling junk all over your house shaking one of these out to unfold it! And it won't fill up with one pee (unless your using it for a big dog!). They work as well as another good quality brand we have been using, but their larger size makes them more flexible. You could probably use these comfortably for up to a 15-20 pound dog. My dog is 15 pounds and has a small shower lined with 4 overlapping pads, but if he had better aim I'm sure I could get away with one.My husband and I are dog trainers and operate a doggie boot camp out of our home. One of the lovely tasks we often have is pad training small breeds. Since this is a helpful lifestyle choice for many people, finding an affordable source for quality pads is important. These pads will definitely be on our list!I received a free product in exchange for my honest review. Most potty pads I have used are terrible.

"I received a free item in exchange for an honest review.First of all, the gloves are manufactured well and feel very sturdy. They resist heat very well, allowing me to hold a hot dish comfortably for more than a few seconds. With my regular oven mitts I have to be quick or the heat seeps through. These allow me to take my time. The reason for only three stars however is that they are thick and inflexible, making my dish feel very unstable in my hands. This is a little scary when handling a hot chicken sitting in a pan of crackling grease at 450 degrees Fahrenheit! They are still a good product, and perhaps it's a stylistic thing - I'm sure many people will love them if they find them comfortable. For me the five-fingered glove feature is not as practical as a mitten-style oven mitt. But if you need fingers for something (nothing too delicate) these may also be a good choice.

"I received a free item for this review, but my opinions are my own.The backpack is very portable and easy to unpack/pack. It holds quite a bit. It is on the smaller side for a backpack, but then again it is portable. This is by no means a replacement for a real hiking backpack. I am not the sporting type and don't have any hiking equipment, so I did use this as my primary pack for a small family trip to the Grand Canyon. I just needed it for water bottles, a first aid kit, snacks, and miscellaneous small essentials. It came in very handy and took up practically no space in my luggage.One little thing I really liked is that the pouch that holds the backpack transforms into a small usable zipper pocket inside the bag when opened up. It's a pet peeve of mine that many manufacturers don't do this on foldable bags. Such a minor thing, I know, but an easy useful addition to the design.The only thing I really disliked about this pack, and the reason for losing a star, is that the mesh pockets on the sides for water bottles are only good for a standard 16.9 oz water bottle. I used two 24oz Contigo water bottles and they were a squeeze to get in, and they kept falling out anytime there was any slack in the bag, like if I squatted down to talk to one of my little kids, which was often. I was constantly having to put one or both bottles back in. It was very obnoxious. Eventually one of the bottles cracked on the lid from falling out so many times. And towards the end of our day I had lost a bottle completely (it's lying around out there somewhere).I also didn't think the bag felt very comfortable on my back. This was't a huge problem, as it's not something I would use often, but something worth noting. The bag seems built for smaller people, not this 5' 8"" German-heritage lady!","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJAFZA1GR1KJ0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KX0B5TW#wasThisHelpful","RJAFZA1GR1KJ0","A3GSGG1WDWPBIR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3GSGG1WDWPBIR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I glanced and saw that it was 448 pages and read the leading description, and EVERY OTHER BOOK of this nature that my son has ever checked out from the library has been a large, coffee table sized book. I was disappointed to receive something barely larger than a pocket book. I take full responsibility since it is in fact detailed online, however if this is an unusual size for this type of book, which it seems to be to me, I think it would be nice to mention that somewhere near the beginning of the description.

"Very nice! A little larger than I expected, but then I've always had a hard time visualizing size, even given measurements. I was really looking for something tiny, but these are fine too. They aren't huge at all. The a good, full-looking size on my 4 year old daughter and small-ish on me, if that makes sense! The stones are very sparkly without being gaudy.

"By far this is the best game case I have come across, but that's not saying much since every other case I have tried (and returned) was literally junk. This case is cute and functional, but the threads were coming apart even before I opened the package. But I was so sick of returns that I just kept it. I wish I had exchanged it now since it is getting pretty bad. The sleeves work well, but I don't expect the heat-pressed seems to last forever.

"It looks good, though a little too masculine (I'm a woman). It looked classy online but more utilitarian in person. I did want a case that offers real protection and looks good - I got real protection and looks ok, which is fine. It has protected my phone from a few drops already. I can literally hear how lightly it hits the ground on both concrete and tile. I recommend a glass screen cover as well. The gold edge coordinates well with my gold toned phone and hasn't scratched yet after two months of being in a purse, pocket and even dropped. The case still looks brand new. What keeps it from being a five star case is that it makes the buttons on the side, especially the power button, very difficult to push. I have removed the case multiple times and tried to wiggle the button portion around for an optimal fit. I got it to be a little better, but it's still not great.

"Very flimsy plastic. There is no protection from drops - no padding or cushion, just a plastic shell. Little more protection than a skin. The stand wouldn't stay open and when it would pop back into place it flipped the phone over onto its face. The buttons on the side, a large surrounding area around the buttons and the full bottom are exposed, keeping those areas free to be scratched. It also offers no protection for the face of the phone (no raised edge to keep the screen from being scratched when placed face down and no protection for the edges of the front of the phone). Nothing about this case offers any real protection at all. The grey frame clashed horribly with my gold toned phone so it didn't even look good.

"They look classy and are incredibly comfortable for tall heels. The heel isn't has tall as it looks since your toes are on a platform, so you get that stiletto look without killing your feet. My husband says they are very sexy!I wear a size 9 in US sizes, though typically an 8 1/2 in sandals and dress shoes. That should translate to a 39. But since others reported them being small I ordered a size 41, which is a 10 1/2 in US sizing. They fit perfectly and I probably would have fit in a 40. So I do recommend ordering something larger than you'd normally order.UPDATE: I do not handle high heels well, and I just love these! We went on a cruise and I wore them twice for dress up night. I was able to keep my balance on a tilting ship, even after a couple drinks.  ;)  I got several compliments and lots of looks. I highly recommend these shoes.

"The case is made out of plastic, not leather. I was really hoping for leather since I had hoped it wouldn't split as easily as a plastic hinge. It seems flimsier than the official HTC one, which I just returned because the flap split off after a month of use. I haven't decided yet if I will return this one. If it breaks, at least it's only $13, not $30. I really do like the concept of this case. It's easier to use than a screen lock, it offers snazzy features, and I LOVE talking on the phone with it closed rather than having the screen against my face. I will probably keep it. And if they drop the price I'll just keep buying new ones when they break.UPDATE: I reviewed too soon. The plastic ""hinge"" started to split within two days of use. Returned for refund.

"UPDATE:After several months - and very hot summer - of use, I have decided that the Simple Solution Stain and Odor Remover works better than this one. Really I would venture to say that it helps to alternate. Maybe they each kill different strains of odor-causing bacteria. If you aren't having great results, be sure to check out Simple Solution, even though it's labeled as an indoor product. The downside to that one, though, is that it has a stronger smell. I do love how this Simple Green one as no discernible odor of it's own. It still works very well and I'll leave my rating at 5 stars since I think I'm really trying to achieve the impossible (perfectly stink-free lawn) and I'm happy to have any help at all!Original Review:Works great on our artificial lawn. We live in Southern California and keep dogs at our home for training. We'll have up to 8 dogs pottying on about 1000 square feet of fake grass for two weeks at a time and it gets STINKY. We fill a hose-attached pesticide sprayer with this stuff and douse the yard. The smell is completely eliminated.In the summer we use this 1-2 times a week. There is then no smell for at least a day or two and then a very mild stink for up to a week before we have to apply it again.In the winter we use this only once every 3-4 weeks. There is no smell for about a week and then a tolerable smell for a couple more weeks.Be sure to spray this on the yard AFTER THE SUN GOES DOWN. The UV rays will kill the living enzymes and it won't work. I tried it. It won't even work on a cloudy day. Also, be sure to use a generous amount of water. Don't just spritz the grass, give it a good soak. We use about 16 oz for our 1000 square foot yard, but it takes about 15 minutes to apply it with a hose sprayer since we use a lot of water. We've experimented many different volumes of cleaner and water and this combo works well for us.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3DGIOBSLJLN34/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0098QN9SC#wasThisHelpful","R3DGIOBSLJLN34","A3GSGG1WDWPBIR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3GSGG1WDWPBIR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have loved Canon for years because I had an amazing printer from them. When it sadly died I was eager to buy the newest model. What a piece of crap! Why? Here's the list.* I can't get it to print a straight line to save my life.* I can't print envelopes without every one - or EVERY one - getting jammed.* It also tells me there's a jam when there is no jam.* It goes through ink like crazy.* Part of that is due to the fact that the print heads constantly get clogged so I have to clean them all the time.* It resets the internet connection so that I have to re-enter the password (4 or 5 times in one year).* It decides to do some sort of maintenance or something almost every time I print so that it whirs and moves and thinks and does God knows what so that it takes 3 minutes before the first page is printed.* Did I mention it can't freakin' print a straight line??* The words look blurred or like they have a shadow effect.* The output tray is horribly designed. It is too large (the entire width of the printer) but the actual functional is so narrow that it can't support more than a few sheets of paper at a time so paper falls to the floor constantly.Seriously, I hate this printer so much that I doubt I will buy another Canon. Most of it's problems are so subtle that I didn't really catch on that it was the printer and not user error for too long so now I am stuck with it. Pros? NONE. To say works ""good enough"" is like paying $10 for a burger and saying, ""Well, at least it isn't poison."" No, I invested in what was supposed to be a good quality machine and got screwed.

I wasn't sure what the size 6-8 meant, but was hoping it was toddler or child sizes since the title of the product is ""Kids Super Soft Fuzzy Socks."" My kids wear toddler 10, 12 and youth 1 and these are much, much too large.","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2JDAUUK11D83G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004E2COPY#wasThisHelpful","R2JDAUUK11D83G","A3GSGG1WDWPBIR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3GSGG1WDWPBIR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It's made of glossy paperboard and rather small. The necklace hooks are just a piece of flat cardboard that will bend with use right away. It's impossible to open and close the tiny drawers without supporting the entire case with your other hand. My husband got this for me as part of my birthday present. He was so apologetic it broke my heart. He said he didn't have time to return it and get something else, but that I could if I wanted to. I missed the deadline though, and maybe on purpose because I hated to return a gift he gave me. It is just so cheap, it's really a toy. His intention was to replace my old jewelry box, which this couldn't do. Very disappointing. I gave it two stars only because it is cute and I'm sure I'll find a use for it...though it's been sitting around just looking cute since October 2013.UPDATE: I have made an honest attempt to make use of this. I put most of my hair accessories in it. The little drawers are so hard to open and close. It's a two-hand job - one to hold the box and one to pry a drawer open. I find myself wearing the same clips and pins forever because I dread opening this thing up, and again closing it. It's such a chore. The large open areas - one vertical and one horizontal - are useless. I have to move the whole box to access anything so whatever I put there just falls out. I'm basically having to fully reload the box every time I access it.

So the regular bulbs went back in and I will have to buy a lamp to use these in.UPDATE: We bought two lamps to use as bedside lamps and put these bulbs in them. Very nice!

"The pink is a god awful pepto bismol puke pink. Fortunately it broke 5 minutes into using it (I put too much hair into it and it beeped and spit my hair out - then never took up hair again). I returned it, got a quick refund, then ordered the all-black one. Much better looking and no problems so far. It has beeped to tell me that I have too much hair it in many times and hasn't broken yet. It gives me a more natural, playful curl than a curling iron. I use the setting that alternates the curling direction. I get compliments frequently. Everyone thought I got a new haircut.I have very short hair, cut jut below my chin, with heavy layering. The shortest pieces on top are about 4-5 inches long. At the bottom the hair is maybe 3 inches long. I put it right up to my head and get a really good curl out of it. At the bottom it curls just enough to keep it from looking like curled hair over straight hair. I can make it loose or tight, depending on the settings I use. The only reason I'm not giving this 5 stars is because for whatever reason I cannot get it to give a nice curl on the parts in front, to frame my face. I'm not sure what it is I'm doing wrong, but I figure it shouldn't be this difficult.I have naturally wavy hair with thick strands that usually has a hard time holding a curl. What helps me is to put in some Crew Fiber (men's product) in when my hair is wet. Just a SMALL amount. Dry naturally or with a hair dryer. The curl holds better and lasts to some degree all day long. Sometimes I'll re-curl a few spots if I need to look better in the evening.If you want a tight, classier, more controlled curl, do use a curling iron. This is great for a casual, fun look. Or a lazy day when you don't want to do a lot of work.UPDATE: After 6 months of very frequent use (practically daily) it is still going strong. Better yet, it doesn't kill my hair like my old curling iron. I can use it daily and my hair is still healthy. And it gives such a playful curl I get compliments ALL THE TIME. Just recently at dance class (YES! The curls hold up well in dance even when they're 12 hours old already!!) someone commented on how cute my curls were and another woman said Oh yes, she always has the cutest hair! Now I am a 35 year old tired soccer mom so it's a big boost to hear such commentary.  :)  I love this curling iron.

"I have been fighting warts for 4 years on my son. This has been the best product so far. One wart is already gone! We will keep using it. Many others are getting smaller.  :)UPDATE: I broke down and finally took my son to a dermatologist to have his warts treated. He underwent one very painful treatment, and I was instructed to use an at-home product for a month and bring him back (really just 2 weeks - one week of healing, 2 weeks of at-home treatment, and another week of treatment before his next visit). When we went back the dermatologist was amazed to see that all of the warts were 100% gone! She wanted to know what I used and I told her it was this product. So I don't know if this stuff is just that amazing, or if it was the combination on me treating him at home for long time first.

"I was truly leery about buying this swift.  I've been burned with cheep Chinese made products in the past.  But as someone that doesn't need to wind yarn into cakes all that often I just couldn't justify spending more than twice as much on a handsome wooden swift. But it got good reviews in general from other buyers so I thought I would give it a try.  After all, if it was a real disappointment I would rely on Amazon to make it right.Much to my surprise it works very well.  I used it with a Knit Picks ball winder to make 4 yarn cakes from super bulky yarn. It was fully assembled out of the box.  I clamped it onto my coffee table and it worked smoothly and easily. Can't say I love the green plastic (white? blue?) but that is certainly minor.  While not as esthetically pleasing as a wooden swift, which are so handsome and harken back to the ""olden days"" and wooden spinning wheels, this one is less expensive, lighter weight, and more compact to store. If I had a craft studio where the swift would remain up and visible all the time, maybe it would matter more. And yes, while it is early days still, I expect that this swift will work well for my purposes.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R337IIY4OBTH41/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VGD39O4#wasThisHelpful","R337IIY4OBTH41","AS6LCGHKDEWT1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AS6LCGHKDEWT1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've recently resumed knitting after a more than 30 year hiatus, due to the arrival of my first grandchild. Way back when I never saw yarn in hanks and never used a swift or ball winder. Only some of the yarn I've bought arrives in hanks, and I can't justify spending top dollar on equipment I only occasionally use.  I've learned that Knit Picks is a reliable company and I expect that they will stand behind their products.  There were a few winders that were less expensive but I chose this one because of the reputation of this company.I had no trouble setting it up, clamping it to my coffee table, or using it to wind four skeins of super bulky Spud & Chlo yarn.  The cakes are even, clean, and well wound.  I'm very pleased with everything except for the colors in the winder.  Silly, I know.  It is a rather muddy-milky coffee color and a drab burgundy.  How about red and white? Black and purple? Maybe next time...  By the way, the instructions for assembly and use are printed on the box.

"I think I am going to love this cover! I have had a seat cover on my Lexus RXs since 2001.  I'm on the second Lexus and on the second golden retriever. I have tried and worn out several, each one different from the previous one as I'd never found quite the right cover. My last one, a Kurgo hammock style, wore out in less than two years. The fabric totally separated where the seat joined the back. I spent a lot of time studying options for a replacement. Eventually I settled on this one, despite the fact I've never heard of the brand, AND I would have to pay extra for shipping (not Prime eligible) AND wait much longer for delivery than I'm used to. But based on other user reviews here, and features I wanted and needed, I decided to make a leap of faith and give it a try.I needed a vertical half zipper between the backs of the two front seats because the only air conditioning that is directly blown into the back seat comes from the rear of the front seat center console and without that zipper opening no air flow would get back there.  I wanted a sling/hammock type to keep sand and dirt from the dog getting down on the floor. I wanted a non-slip backing that would not mar my light grey leather seats. I needed seat belt/LATCH access.It arrived today.  I am so impressed.  The top surface is black micro suede, and it is quilted (and I'm certain there is some batting between the layers) to a subtle gold smooth fabric backing with non-slip little bumps all over that is designed to keep it from sliding and keep the cover in place.  It has long flaps that protect the sides of the seat.  There are adjustable straps that go around the front and rear headrests (they have buckles that actually open, you don't have to try and slip them over the headrests), and for the first time in all the covers I've tried, there is a similar but much longer strap that goes horizontally around the back of the seat back to keep it snug.The fit and finish of this seat cover looks very good indeed.  I suspect that it will be very effective and will last a long time.  After using it for awhile with the 85 lb dog, as well as my infant granddaughter in her car seat, I will post an updated review. I've posted a picture with a corner of the back folded over onto the front so you can see the no slip bumps, as well as a photo of the three pockets, two with snap flaps, that are behind the driver's seat and could hold a ball, leash, treats or whatnot.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3OE0HQ2RIEETT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YR2X3DI#wasThisHelpful","R3OE0HQ2RIEETT","AS6LCGHKDEWT1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AS6LCGHKDEWT1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought this mirror to be able to see what my 5 month old granddaughter was up to in the back seat of my car. She only rides in it a few times a week but I felt an investment in a mirror would be a wise thing, especially since babies ride rear facing for so much longer nowadays. Her mother (my daughter) rode rear facing for less than a year, which was what was customary and recommended 30+ years ago. Now it is for at least 2 years and that is a long time not to see what's going on back there!  This mirror is terrific!  It is quite large which makes seeing her so easy. The mirror surface, while not glass (for safety's sake) is distortion free and was protected by an easy to remove film so it was clean and unscratched. It was very easy to install on my rear headrest with woven straps and secure adjustable buckles-one for up and down and one for side to side. The best thing for her is that she now sees ""another"" baby in the back to entertain her. And one day down the road she will realize that she can see me as well. I couldn't be happier. No, it isn't the least expensive such mirror that is available but I believe it is an excellent value and I like the fact that the seller is a small family owned company. Give it a try.  You can always return it if you're not satisfied, but I cannot imagine why you would!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R34AWKCEYR34L2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LPAFQ26#wasThisHelpful","R34AWKCEYR34L2","AS6LCGHKDEWT1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AS6LCGHKDEWT1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"My 18 month old iPhone 5S got to the point where a battery pack became necessary.  Even with intermittent charging of the iPhone during the day I could run out of ""juice"" and I didn't want to spend the money to have Apple replace the battery. I had a Mophie case for my iPhone 4S and while I liked it very much, I wanted to spend less than that case had cost.  This Lenmar case is perfect.  The case is an excellent value at the price.  It feels substantial and sturdy without being heavy. It doubles the total battery life of my iPhone. It uses a microUSB connection for charging.  The red is a terrific pop of color. There is a switch on the back that turns off or on the connection between the pack and the phone. You can leave it on to have the iPhone have access to the battery pack, or wait until your phone needs it before turning it on. The subtle light on the back next to the switch indicates the level of charge remaining, from green to blue to red. I can't think of a single thing I would change about this pack.

"I couldn't get a full bodied, strong cup of coffee with these.  I bought the Keurig machine because there are now choices in making your own K cups at home, saving money and the waste of throwaways, as well as being able to use your own freshly ground favorite coffee.  I tried to get the same weight in the same grind of the prepared K cups, but the best I could achieve was a rather weak cup of coffee.  I've tried starting the brewing process, and then immediately stopping it, to wet the grounds and let them bloom (as was suggested at several coffee lovers websites), and then brewing just the smallest cup.  I think these allow the water to come through too quickly.  Unfortunately I do not seem to have the packaging, so I'm stuck with them.  It was a lesson in disappointing coffee.  I've tried the Java Jig and wasn't happy.  The stainless steel Ekobrew is next.  I'm determined to be able to get a full bodied, strong cup of coffee out of my Keurig.  I'm not looking for espresso.

"Disappointing.  I have used Melitta products for many years.  I had hoped these would be the answer to my goal of getting stronger cups of coffee out of my new Keurig machine (yes, I do use freshly ground dark roast coffee), and to saving the trash caused by single use cups and being able to use my favorite coffee.I disassembled a prepared K Cup of my favorite coffee to see the grind and to weigh the amount.

"Beautifully made, heirloom quality kitchen tools.  Yes, they are pricey.  But after having bought several kitchen scoops for cookie baking and having them fail, eventually, to properly sweep and scoop out the dough, I got tired of fighting with my old ones (one was a recent OXO brand that I had high hopes for) and splurged on these.  They are American made, by a family owned company who only make a few things.  I'm not sure why cookie scoops are a mainstay of their line but they are.  The set is packaged nicely enough for a wedding or shower gift.  I mean, who has velveteen drawstring bags for their kitchen tools?  They also have a lifetime warranty.  AND once you register them with the company, they offer you a PDF download of a cookie cookbook - sugar, chocolate chip or peanut butter.  The peanut butter one I requested is over 80 pages!I don't know that i will have enough years left to really put them through their paces, but I do know that I can pass them onto my children who can enjoy them for many more years to come.They do exactly what they are supposed to do, and do it well.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2FEZFJP0WUF0C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IM6ZF90#wasThisHelpful","R2FEZFJP0WUF0C","AS6LCGHKDEWT1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AS6LCGHKDEWT1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Just what I wanted!  My old tin fluted biscuit cutters were tired and rusty.  This set is a wonderful replacement.  There are several sizes, they are two sided so they will cut fluted and plain, and they nest.  If you pick them up one way they all separate from one another.  The other way, they stay ""connected"" and nested!  Clever idea!  And no rust!

"As I've been trying to rid my house of what I believe is a single mouse (and having laid snap traps around) I thought I would add this to my arsenal.  While dubious of its efficacy, I did read positive reviews of it and similar products, so I figured what the heck.  Well, I am returning it.I frankly have no idea whether it works or not.  What I can say is that the package ""instructions"" and ""description"", including the name of the product, is written in the most peculiar version of English, with any number of mysterious language words I've ever seen.  I'm sure that most of us have encountered the rather charming efforts that non-native English speaking people/companies that can appear on directions, assembly instructions, and so on.  This goes way beyond it.  Frankly I don't think anyone who is half-way fluent in English wrote the copy.  There is NO manufacturer name, contact information, location and so forth on the product.  I've no way of knowing whether it was made in China, Thailand or elsewhere.There certainly isn't remotely $20 worth of materials and manufacturing in it.  Moreover, while it is supposed to be inaudible to human ears, that isn't the case.  I decided that I wasn't comfortable with the whole thing and contacted Amazon Customer Service.They graciously offered to give me a full refund with no return shipping charge, or a 40% discount if I wished to keep it.  They also offered me overnight shipping for a replacement product. I have decided to return it.  I don't know if I will replace it with a competitor's product.I encourage you to be cautious about this.

"This is a wonderful book, and if you have any desire to learn to smock, I would grab a copy as it is out of print.  My mother gave me a copy 34 years ago when I had a newborn daughter.  I was able to teach myself to English smock from just this book alone.  Over the next several years I made over a dozen heirloom quality smocked dresses for my daughter.  Some are bishop dresses (round neck, raglan sleeved dresses that are gathered into the neckline) and some are yoked dresses where the pleats go across the bodice.  One of the best parts of this book are the instructions of how to adapt clothing pattern to heirloom quality clothing-changing a zipper closure in the back to classic buttons, making an extra deep hem to add drape and body (and possibly to be able to drop the hem halfway to accommodate growth), adding a sash for a beautiful bow at the back, and so on.  Having an 8"" deep hem looks elegant.Not all patterns in the book are smocked but many are. There is a kilt pattern and a sailor suit, a smocked pillow, christening gown, romper, etc. If you are a reasonably capable seamstress you can make incredibly beautiful clothes for your children or grandchildren. And now my daughter is expecting her first child, a girl, in a few months, and while I've saved all the dresses I made for her, I will make some new items for my granddaughter. I'm so glad I've saved my copy of this book!There is a wonderful website for smockers called Garden Fairies Trading Company (www.smockingbooks.com).  They have been in business for many years.  They have patterns, supplies, and help.  There are pleating machines that can save you some effort in making the pleats that are the basis of smocking.  They aren't inexpensive but may be worth it.  Back when, I used iron on dots that I used to hand pleat my fabrics before smocking, and this website has those for sale as well.Between this book and the resources at Garden Fairies, you will be in great shape to make gorgeous clothes!","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3HRWATRB4T0MM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0878512047#wasThisHelpful","R3HRWATRB4T0MM","AS6LCGHKDEWT1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AS6LCGHKDEWT1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

It is made of a very attractive and sturdy vinyl-like coated fabric.  It stands up by itself so it is easy to reach in to find what you need.

"I had this range installed about 6 months ago. It replaced a nine year old Frigidaire gas range which was generally satisfactory but I was always frustrated with the lack of speed of the burners, despite the fact that it had what was, at that time, about the highest BTU burners available on a regular gas range.  Water took ages to boil, and with pasta, it almost never came back up to a real boil before the pasta got soft and stuck together without the benefit of a proper boil.This new one has a more ""pro-style"" appearance, much sturdier iron grates, and wow, the burners! The 11,000 BTU burner in the old one has morphed into a 17,000 BTU in the right front, and the next more powerful one is 15,000 BTU in the left rear.  That means the fastest burner is nearly 50% more powerful than the old one, and boy, does it show!  Water boils so quickly I can scarcely believe it.  I can stir fry in a wok! There is a long oval center burner that I've not had occasion to use.  The grate for it can be replaced with an included griddle, for pancakes, eggs and bacon, and more.  I expect it will be very useful for making my Thanksgiving turkey gravy.  The roasting pan will fit very nicely on it.The convection oven is terrific, but I have found it takes longer to preheat than the beep would indicate.  I've no idea why I would want a ""pizza"" setting, however. I've not tried the broiler as I use an outdoor grill, but I expect it would work as well as any gas broiler, moderately well.  I've also not yet the need to use the self cleaning cycle but as it worked very well in the old range I expect it will do so with this one. I love to bake and have found the convection oven allows me to actually bake three pans of cookies at a time very evenly.  I expect to put the flexible half shelf to use this Thanksgiving, stacking the stuffing and vegetable casserole to the side of the turkey, and that will give me a chance to try out the temperature probe (and undoubtedly the self cleaning feature!).My only caveat about the rack that pulls out when the oven is opened is to be careful of it.  It must be the lower rack, and it will make it easier to burn your hands as it is raised up higher than the oven door when the door is open.  Just be aware of it, and know that you can disable this feature if you choose to.I feel that there is excellent value in this gas range, and as an avid and skilled cook and baker, I'm enjoying it to the max.  I paid about $900 for it.  A great price for an excellent range. I cannot imagine how a range costing twice as much could improve my cooking. I couldn't be happier!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3T0V8H2Y36UBV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005DN6GUC#wasThisHelpful","R3T0V8H2Y36UBV","AS6LCGHKDEWT1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AS6LCGHKDEWT1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I bought this oven as part of a package on Groupon, but not until I'd read all the reviews here and on several forums on the web.  After all, one doesn't buy a $400 outdoor oven on a whim.  At least I don't.  And yes, I had some concerns after reading that some buyers had received either defective ovens or parts damaged in shipment.  I was encouraged to know that Blackstone responded immediately to everyone who had trouble. When I was unpacking I had my heart in my throat expecting a broken or bent piece. Everything was perfect. I was incredibly lucky. But you'll be in heaven once you get it up and running.  Mine is just 10 days old.A few suggestions based on my very recent experience:You will need a AA battery for the igniter (insert bottom end first - which the directions don't tell you), and you will need two D batteries for the motor.  My suggestion is to take advantage of the opportunity and insert the D batteries in the motor before you connect it to the oven.  Of course, you'll have to eventually replace the batteries while the motor is on the oven, but at least you'll have a chance to see what's what without getting way down and looking up into the battery compartment later on!If you've not bought a thrust bearing to help with the rotation of the tray, please consider it.  I read about it here in the reviews of the oven here on Amazon.  It apparently makes a huge difference and it costs under $12. Look at 51205 Thrust Bearing 25x47x15 Thrust Bearings. 51205 Thrust Bearing 25x47x15 Thrust Bearings You place it on the horizontal cross member that the stem of the rotating tray goes through (obviously around the hole for the stem) and just thread the stem through the thrust bearing and the cross member, and it rotates so smoothly on those bearings!After buying one thermometer that only went up to 715'F, I exchanged it for this model-the least expensive model that measures over 1,000'F (to give some latitude) this is the one I got from Amazon and am using:TopG TG8550 -58 to 1022°F Instant-read IR Infrared Thermometer Non-contact Temperature Gun with Laser Sight Targeting Pointing range -50 to 550°C Celsius or Fahrenheit; Built in infrared (IR) sensor and LCD screen with backlight; Battery includedThere are several models on the same page.  I got the royal blue one. It was the one that met my criteria.The pizza took three minutes and ten seconds to bake.  The laser temperature of the stone was about 700' and the air temp shown on the built in oven thermometer was about 400'.  The pizza had only been in the oven for under 10 seconds when I got the filming going.Here is a link to the 3 min You Tube video showing my pizza bianca baking.  It had only been in the oven for fewer than 10 seconds when I got the camera rolling:http://youtu.be/AGqah_VS60gI've made a couple of different pizza doughs from Peter Reinhart's book American Pie: My Search for the Perfect Pizza pizza book last night for the next baking trial.  I can't wait to try more!  This is an excellent book, highly recommended.BTW, it was suggested to me to have both a wooden peel and a metal one.  Assemble unbaked pizzas on the wooden one, remove them from the oven with the metal one. There are a lot of wooden peels out there.  I did splurge on the J.K. Adams handmade alder wood one, made in the US.  It was about $37, but it is beautiful and has a lifetime warranty. I've read posts in various places of wooden or bamboo peels cracking or splitting. This may be a case of you get what you pay for.  I find using semolina flour on the peel to be a wonderful way to keep them from sticking and to have them slide nicely onto the baking stone as it is more granular than regular flour.I buy just about everything I can from Amazon, mostly because they have excellent prices and better service and it saves me a whole lot of time.  Sure, I do live in San Francisco and I can get just about anything I want here, but shopping isn't my favorite thing to do.The peel is the J.K. Adams 23-3/4-Inch-by-14-Inch Alder Wood Pizza Peel. $37.I do try to support US manufacturers when I can (just bought a US-made kitchen range too) and this is a family owned company in your neck of the woods, Dorset, VT. 2nd generation.  There's a lot of information about the company here on Amazon's website.I also used John Boos Mystery Butcher Block Oil on the peel. John Boos Mystery Butcher Block Oil, 16 ouncesOne of the reasons I chose this oven over the Pizzeria Pronto or the Uuni wood pellet oven was to be able to cook other things in addition to pizzas.  To that end I looked for a pan that could handle high heat and would fit in the oven, and that cost as little as possible.So I chose the Lodge L9OG3 Pre-Seasoned Round Griddle, 10.5-inch, (Amazon item ASIN: Lodge L9OG3 Pre-Seasoned Round Griddle, 10.5-inch)  $13.79. It is on its way and will be here today.  I plan on cooking salmon, steaks, shrimp, chicken.  I think this is relatively new territory here, and we all will learn.I think you'll find that making your own dough is NOT difficult, especially if you have a sturdy stand mixer or food processor. I do bake a lot (but have less yeast dough experience) and highly recommend King Arthur flour.  You may know they sell a gluten free flour ($7.95 for 24 oz, unfortunately) that gets fry positive reviews.  I don't know what your frozen pizza dough is like, but I encourage you to give making your own dough a try.  It is very satisfactory and highly rewarding.Amazon carries Caputo Double 00 flour, and if you get a pack of 10 one kilo bags the shipping is free.  The price is what I pay locally for mine, and you can get it just about anywhere. Antimo Caputo Chef's Flour, 2.2 Pound (Pack of 10)  There are lots of ways to make dough, and I also use King Arthur's bread flour, available in many grocery stores as well as from their website.  Prices here on Amazon are pretty high.San Francisco backyards (if you have one at all!) are not generally known for being spacious, and mine is no exception.  Devoting some of it to my small Weber grill and now to this oven is huge.  I have no space to assemble my pizzas outside. I do what you seem to do outside and have everything laid out in my (also small) kitchen and move them to the oven on the wooden peel, and bring them back to the kitchen on the metal peel that came with the Groupon offer. That allows me to assemble the next pizza on the wooden peel while someone else keeps an eye on the one in the oven.It is a learning process.  Yum, yum, yum!","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RW3INHPIYL8SU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CELFJ4A#wasThisHelpful","RW3INHPIYL8SU","AS6LCGHKDEWT1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AS6LCGHKDEWT1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I received this cover as part of my Groupon deal for the oven, a metal peel, and this.  I was expecting some half-baked (no pun intended) vinyl former garbage bag wanna-be cover.  No way.  It is very heavy, excellent quality woven fabric with a water resistant (proof?) backing, and it conforms nearly exactly to this not easy to fit outdoor pizza oven. Given that the cover also covers two side shelves, this is no mean feat! The 'sleeves' for these shelves have wide heavy elastic bands that go under the shelves and the sleeves completely cover the shelves and wrap over the ends by some considerable way, and has elastic there as well.  No doubt this is designed to keep them in place even in windy conditions.  The Blackstone name is very handsomely embroidered in front in two colors.  It is certainly worth $50.  And if you live in a harsh climate, I would think it is essential.  I'm frankly delighted to have it, even though I live in San Francisco and our climate can hardly be described as anything close to ""harsh"".I love the oven, and this cover is just icing on the cake.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RLH3YY27YLIJG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IHDGM4U#wasThisHelpful","RLH3YY27YLIJG","AS6LCGHKDEWT1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AS6LCGHKDEWT1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I've just bought an outdoor pizza oven (Blackstone 1575) and needed a wooden peel to supplement the metal one I got with the oven.

"I've been on a long hunt to essentially replicate the two piece Smart Cover case for my original iPad 2, and it has been very frustrating. With that iPad I used an Apple real leather Smart Cover with another vendor's soft gel back cover. It worked perfectly for my needs for three years. I assumed it wouldn't be difficult to get a similar solution for my brand new iPad Air but that was a wrong assumption. I really wanted genuine leather, and I found that many cases that say ""leather"" mean PU leather, which is a polyurethane coated leather derivative. Be aware of what you are buying, if it matters to you.Apple no longer makes a real leather Smart Cover, only a Smart Case that covers the back as well, but it is $79.99 and it doesn't feel as much like real leather as I wanted. I thought I could do better. I wanted sleep/wake function with the cover, I wanted the back protected with something that would keep the iPad from slipping on a desk or other surface, and I wanted to be able to easily use the iPad in the lower propped up typing position, as I use the virtual screen keyboard about 95% of the time. When I travel and have to do a great deal of writing I take a separate Bluetooth keyboard with me. And I wanted the case to be red, preferably.This case was one I did buy but returned:Belkin Quilted Cover / Case for iPad Air (iPad 5) (Ruby), $39.99 ASIN: B00F6A5TEG. Very nice looking despite not real leather. But the frame that holds the iPad doesn't lie flat enough for me to type on virtual keyboard. The most feminine looking case and very attractive. I wish the typing position was better.This ended up being the the last case I bought and kept:StilGut Couverture Genuine Leather Case for Apple iPad Air with Smart-Cover Function, Red, ASIN: B00GXCJ8LQIt is bright red, it is beautifully crafted, and it securely holds the iPad Air without covering any of the edges of the iPad Air's screen, what I call the ""frame"" around the screen.This case has a fairly stiff back cover that grips the iPad Air quite securely. The entire iPad is covered in red leather, and the case is lined in black suede or suede like fabric with the StilGut name woven or stamped in. All buttons and ports are open and useable. The red color is beautiful, and exactly the red color I sought. It also comes with a two year warranty, and feels better made than the Apple Smart Case, at the same price. My only quibble is that I would have preferred to have had smooth textured calfskin or similar, not the textured leather this case is made with. But it seems I couldn't have everything I wished, and this beautiful case came the closest.I've found that many cases do count on the iPad being secured by the case itself using pieces of leather or faux leather to cover the frame, showing only the screen. But that type of frame prevents my thumbs from easily reaching the virtual spacebar and prevents me from typing effectively.The StilGut company is a new one to me, but is apparently a highly regarded German firm, long established.

"I've been on a long hunt to essentially replicate the two piece Smart Cover case for my original iPad 2, and it has been very frustrating. With that iPad I used an Apple real leather Smart Cover with another vendor's soft gel back cover. It worked perfectly for my needs for three years. I assumed it wouldn't be difficult to get a similar solution for my brand new iPad Air but that was a wrong assumption. I really wanted genuine leather, and I found that many cases that say ""leather"" mean PU leather, which is a polyurethane coated leather derivative. Be aware of what you are buying, if it matters to you.Apple no longer makes a real leather Smart Cover, only a Smart Case that covers the back as well, but it is $79.99 and it doesn't feel as much like real leather as I wanted. I thought I could do better. I wanted sleep/wake function with the cover, I wanted the back protected with something that would keep the iPad from slipping on a desk or other surface, and I wanted to be able to easily use the iPad in the lower propped up typing position, as I use the virtual screen keyboard about 95% of the time. When I travel and have to do a great deal of writing I take a separate Bluetooth keyboard with me. And I wanted the case to be red, preferably.This case was one I did buy but returned:YOOBAO Executive Genuine Leather Case for Apple iPad Air/iPad 5 Tablet With Auto Wake / Sleep Function Rose, $37.99 ASIN: B00GNU30QW nice enough leather, but same frame issueThis ended up being the the last case I bought and kept: StilGut Couverture Genuine Leather Case for Apple iPad Air with Smart-Cover Function, Red, ASIN: B00GXCJ8LQ It is bright red, it is beautifully crafted, and it securely holds the iPad Air without covering any of the edges of the iPad Air's screen, what I call the ""frame"" around the screen.This case has a fairly stiff back cover that grips the iPad Air quite securely. The entire iPad is covered in red leather, and the case is lined in black suede or suede like fabric with the StilGut name woven or stamped in. All buttons and ports are open and useable. The red color is beautiful, and exactly the red color I sought. It also comes with a two year warranty, and feels better made than the Apple Smart Case, at the same price. My only quibble is that I would have preferred to have had smooth textured calfskin or similar, not the textured leather this case is made with. But it seems I couldn't have everything I wished, and this beautiful case came the closest.I've found that many cases do count on the iPad being secured by the case itself using pieces of leather or faux leather to cover the frame, showing only the screen. But that type of frame prevents my thumbs from easily reaching the virtual spacebar and prevents me from typing effectively.The StilGut company is a new one to me, but is apparently a highly regarded German firm, long established.

The entire iPad is covered in red leather, and the case is lined in black suede or suede like fabric with the StilGut name woven or stamped in. All buttons and ports are open and useable. The red color is beautiful, and exactly the red color I sought. It also comes with a two year warranty, and feels better made than the Apple Smart Case, at the same price. My only quibble is that I would have preferred to have had smooth textured calfskin or similar, not the textured leather this case is made with. But it seems I couldn't have everything I wished, and this beautiful case came the closest.I've found that many cases do count on the iPad being secured by the case itself using pieces of leather or faux leather to cover the frame, showing only the actual screen. But that type of frame prevents my thumbs from easily reaching the virtual spacebar and prevents me from typing effectively.The StilGut company is a new one to me, but is apparently a highly regarded German firm, long established.

"I have (had) an old, tired real Rubbermaid rubber spatula that was finally giving up the ghost after about 20 years. I really wanted to replace it exactly but cannot find the same thing. I hoped that this would work nearly as well, but it doesn't.  Granted, it was less than $5, and I bought it based on the other reviews, but I'm very disappointed.  It feels very flimsy. The wood handle is rough and lightweight. And the spatula itself isn't rubber, but also isn't silicone, so it isn't heat resistant.  Doesn't scrape all that well, and will melt in a hot pan.  It wasn't worth my returning it, and I might find it somewhat useful from time to time, but frankly I should have passed this by.  As my children would say, ""Meh"".Update ****28 April 2014*****Completely unusable now.  The ""rubber"" top no longer adheres in any way to the handle. There is little that is more useless than a spatula whose head falls off in a bowl of cake batter (or anything else).

"It was totally my fault for not checking, but the vendor I bought this lamp from charged much more than my local IKEA store, and I didn't realize it until after I ordered.  More than TWICE their price.  After the two lamps I'd ordered arrived, (and after I learned how way much more I paid than I should have) I arranged to send one back, at my expense, unfortunately.  I will say that the vendor was very quick to respond to my request to return one of them, and answered my questions very quickly, so they get kudos for that.  But how they can charge more than twice the price IKEA does is beyond me.  It cost me over $25 to send the second lamp back so my net credit after returning the lamp was about 50% of what I paid.I really like the lamp a lot - very clean lines, lovely woven grey shade that allows the light to peek through the weave, and nice brushed nickel base and pole.  I bought the corresponding wall lamp (with a white shade) directly at IKEA and they look great together.  Even with the huge price increase, if you don't have an IKEA store near you, it is still a great looking lamp at less than comparable ones.  But just know IKEA charges half again as much.So I knocked off one star because of the price and only because of that.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3T4JAGIIXH3TA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007F6FPZC#wasThisHelpful","R3T4JAGIIXH3TA","AS6LCGHKDEWT1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AS6LCGHKDEWT1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have never used anything like this product before and wasn't completely sure even what to look for.  My cheaply made kitchen cabinetry have had drawers that haven't tracked well for years.  As I was finally having my cabinets refinished (long overdue) I decided to empty out the silverware drawer and see what wasn't working right.  I really only needed to replace the plastic grip that attaches to the back of the drawer but this kit contains everything, and for under $4!  So I just went ahead and ordred several.  It was very easy to screw on the new grip and now the drawer glides as well as it ever did. I can't say how easy it would be to add drawer glides where there had been none, but I suspect it would not be too hard. Good directions, shipped quickly, excellent price.

While I've used Scotch's Command line to hang things, I didn't think they would stand up to the repeated re-hanging of the towels.  And they are expensive. This stuff is great! I probably have a lifetime supply now, but the cost of this entire roll vs the Command strips made buying his roll a no-brainer.What more can you ask for than a simple, well-designed product at a good price that does what it is supposed to do? Have it shipped to you in two days by Amazon, of course!Highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3TK0E6BSS0E3C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00006IF7L#wasThisHelpful","R3TK0E6BSS0E3C","AS6LCGHKDEWT1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AS6LCGHKDEWT1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've used this product for two years now, and have been very pleased with it.  A little goes a long way-so much so that I dilute it in the wall dispenser I use in my shower.  The fragrance is pleasant, my color treated baby fine hair is manageable and easy to style. I like that these products have UV protection for my hair. My stylist recommends Alterna. Buying half gallons is a good way to save money over their smaller bottles.  I will continue to use these products. I encourage you to give them a try.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 17, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Y08L77B04SXU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005CCQELK#wasThisHelpful","R1Y08L77B04SXU","AS6LCGHKDEWT1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AS6LCGHKDEWT1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These are an excellent alternative to Lutron or Leviton decorative switches, especially the basic ones.  I was replacing every plug and light switch in my house and wanted to avoid paying those name brand prices. i learned of these on a a site that electricians use, and was very pleased that my favorite Amazon had them, and in boxes of 10, which saved me even more money (though you can get individual ones too.  These are also compatible with the decorative, screw-less cover plates made by Lutron, Leviton and others. Cooper makes a very reasonably priced one, and I was glad to learn they all seem to be standardized and interchangeable, so sticking with one brand isn't necessary.  I updated the look of my entire home for less money than if I'd used Lutron or Leviton exclusively. I did buy some of their dimmers that are incandescent/LED/CFL compatible, though, and that had features that I was looking for and was willing to pay for.  But for basic switches, plugs etc, you can't go wrong with this brand or Cooper.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 17, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3RYLTN1A6X0L7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00361V66C#wasThisHelpful","R3RYLTN1A6X0L7","AS6LCGHKDEWT1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AS6LCGHKDEWT1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"this is one of those unusual bargain watches that fall into a rare niche of form and function at an astoundingly low price; as everyone knows, Timex watches today are generally pieces of junk, with low-end components and ultra-cheap Chinese-made movements, all sold at vastly inflated prices to a generally unknowing public...on the other hand, this particular model is more than meets the eye: is it a low-end watch? yes... does it use a low-end movement? yes... but what makes this watch stand out from the Timex trash heap are a couple features: first, the leather band is nicely made, with good stitching, and big enough for my large wrist... and second, this watch, unlike other Timex dive-watch pretenders costing almost four times as much, has a functioning unidirectional bezel!that's right - you get a watch that's actually usable for timing (i use mine for flipping steaks on the grill or making hard-boiled eggs)please understand and make no mistake: this is one cheap watch... the bezel only has 60 clicks, and the battery is ginourmous compared to most quartz movements - a CR2016... but the indiglo is only momentary and entirely adequate (you can read the face in the dark); i cannot speak for the longevity, but the movement keeps accurate time... another nice feature is the date-only display (i don't like day/date functions - useless to me, but at least this is only a date to deal with).so, as a pitiful Submariner homage, this cheap Timex actually delivers more value in looks, features and function than any others in its Timex trash-heap class - a rare bargain at its current price point","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2IXLE2V6HIGV6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000T7QC6A#wasThisHelpful","R2IXLE2V6HIGV6","A18ECVX2RJ7HUE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A18ECVX2RJ7HUE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Tested in 35F darkness:Seat was easy to install in an older bucket-seat import sedan. Attachment straps easily wrapped around non-airbag areas.Power cord was long enough to reach 12V port in back of seat, although the front (driver area) port was used.Seat heated quickly, especially on the 'Hi' setting; for extended trips aside from a short 15-minute commute in the cold, the low setting would be better.What this seat's heat control needs however, is an LED to indicate that the unit is on. This isn't a problem for those vehicles that turn off 12V power to the ports when the ignition is off; but this seat could possibly drain your vehicle's battery if, like some vehicles, power is always on to the ports.Overall, a recommendation - especially at its price point - it's an inexpensive upgrade for cold-weather driving.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R28ORB9FLA33NC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013XT2Z6Q#wasThisHelpful","R28ORB9FLA33NC","A18ECVX2RJ7HUE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A18ECVX2RJ7HUE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"i like this watch - much more so than any of the other offerings in its genre (inexpensive, almost girly-man big, over-hyped and pretentious but made to fool the non-watch knowledge into thinking they see a masterpiece of horological engineering)...why? well, for a number of reasons:1) this is a thinner piece than most2) it has a plain, simple face - lacking a second hand, but featuring a tiny day of month display3) it has a movement, but who is to say whether or not it is Chinese or Japanese? (well, it doesn't say 'Japan' on the face, so...)4) the leather band is well-made5) the safety clasp - a positive - and a negative, but mostly positivethe downsides?1) still a bit bigger face than a 'normal' watch, but very good for these old eyes2) confusing instructions - especially on setting the date: (""turn back one day, then forward""?); stem settings ""pull out stem 2 clicks"" [can't]; ""make sure to screw down crown"" [can't]3) the clasp - very confusing to set, but once you figure it out, seems rather secure - have never run across one like it (a press-fit, levered hooked clasp - kind of like a hybrid between old style belt buckle and folding friction clasp)all in all, a nice watch - we'll have to see how it keeps time (you won't know if the battery runs out until you notice you're late for that appt or you got a parking ticket) - the watch came in the 'off' position, with the stem pulled out and a plastic insert","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3YKHCK8BIKC9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013JXIGQY#wasThisHelpful","R3YKHCK8BIKC9","A18ECVX2RJ7HUE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A18ECVX2RJ7HUE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"this unit is like most toy drones on the shelves and due to flood the market during the upcoming holiday season... there are some things to like about this kit and some things not to like...the drone worked out of the box, but you will need to download english instructions first if you want to get started - getting this drone up in the air right after a charge and after inserting 4 AAAs into the control unit is not intuitive... things to like include the inclusion of spare props and protectors, along with spare soft landing pads...things not to like include the hinged battery compartment on the control unit using a small phillips screw, the need to have a USB charger, the fact that only when charging is complete will you see a red LED on the USB thumb portion of the charger, the small drone start button and its position (awkward - should be on top), the confusing auto-flying mode start procedure (pressing the 'Juice' button on the controller works intermittently), confusing 'sync' procedure (toggling the throttle), the fact that even in 'Juice' mode, the hovering is inconsistent with variable speed to the props, resulting in awkward maneuvers for a novice, the fact that trim is required even when auto hovering - and finally, the extremely short (less than 5 minutes) flying timethat said, you will have fun with this toy, and it should provide at least an afternoon's worth of enjoyment - it will be interesting to see how these toys evolve on the next few years","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1UOBEK4K658NR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00X9CEVII#wasThisHelpful","R1UOBEK4K658NR","A18ECVX2RJ7HUE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A18ECVX2RJ7HUE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"a big, heavy watch with a few interesting features... comes in a plain white cardboard box, inside a bright yellow padded box... the contents must have shifted during shipping, as the protective plastic on the face was skewed and folded, and the instruction booklet was mashed with torn corners into the top of the yellow padded boxother than that, the watch was fine... i think i'm beginning to see why some folks enjoy buying and using watches - this watch had a couple features i've never seen or used before: a tiny stopwatch with a red hand at the six o'clock position - like other chronographs though, you start and stop the timer with a button press of the top right button, then reset with a single press of the bottom right button... the crown on the right functions as most to set the time and date - with the caution to NOT set the date between 9 p.m. and 1 a.m. - curious!you can also continue running a timing session, and do split times - make sure to read the included manual, not the simple one-page summary of the watch's componentsbut the feature that caught my fancy and attention was the inner-rotating bezel - twist the crown at the lower left of the face to rotate the timer bezel, which is beneath the synthetic sapphire (an added bonus for scratch resistance)this watch will also function as a knuckle duster in a pinch - and even if you have a large, thick wrist, you will most likely need to remove one or two links in order to wear this watch securelythis is an attractive watch with a readable face - i'm not sure i care for the large logo underneath the noon position though - a bit more understatement would go a long way","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2Z1ZSE6BBVOM2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AZKXXTU#wasThisHelpful","R2Z1ZSE6BBVOM2","A18ECVX2RJ7HUE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A18ECVX2RJ7HUE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a fairly small section of Catit's Circut track - not enough to make a full oval. It doesn't come with any instructions but there isn't really any other shape it can make other than an ""S."" It can be difficult to snap the sections of track together (again, no directions) but if you slide one notched side into the hole from the top as you slide the other in from the bottom in a twisting motion until you hear the click of the tab, it goes a little easier. The transparent green sections just drop in then slide back in their slots to lock.We already have the Catit Design Senses Super Roller Circuit Toy for Cats so my cat knows how to play with the Catit Play Circut design and we have plenty of track to make a closed shape with hills and valleys. I took the advice of another reviewer and added the new ball as well. She seemed to like it, especially when they clacked together.There are things I'd change about the Catit Circut Toys: the track covers make it far too difficult to swat the ball. Not only are they a little small for an adult cat but she can't really get a good swing. She ends up tapping the ball which leads to problem number two: the ball needs to be weighted more/differently. It doesn't roll as well as other track balls. We also have the Bergan Turbo Scratcher Cat Toy, Colors May Vary and the heavier ball takes off. It would be fun if Catit could make something like Bergan Twinkle Replacement Ball, Colors Vary - it keeps my cat glued to her other cat track when she plays with it.Right now the Catit Circuit is her upstairs track (because it's a heck of a lot quieter than the other!) and when she gets frustrated with trying to get at the ball, she likes to lay on top of it. One thing I do like about Catit's system is that you can add other things to it. This particular Catit Circuit needs to have other pieces added to it for maximum fun.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RM6X1O6WU5R5W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00D3NI5YO#wasThisHelpful","RM6X1O6WU5R5W","A1TFMR7RE985MF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TFMR7RE985MF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This seems like such a good idea and I was excited to try it. Unfortunately I ran into trouble immediately when I found out I needed to download an app to use it and my phone wouldn't work (there's a list of phones that will on their website). I did a little begging and the dude let me borrow his Galaxy S5 so I could set things up. Well, not only did I need his phone to download the app and input my information (age, weight, ideal temperatures, etc.) but I needed to keep it with me and keep it on throughout the night. I begged my way into keeping the phone with me and after all that, the app kept losing its connection to the unit. For days.As I mentioned, this is a great idea and other than the major issue with the app, I could have loved it. Setup of the pad and base until was simple and it was comfortable to lie on. I wish Nuyu would find another way to let their customers input information. Not everyone has a smartphone, not everyone wants to leave their phone on all night and they would avoid the endless headaches caused by apps not working.In the end this turned out to be a useless product for me. I can't continue to try to figure out the app, especially on a borrowed phone, and I'm not buying a new phone just so I can download the app myself.","2.0 out of 5 stars","November 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R7XNLHL97SMVZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00X1INP3C#wasThisHelpful","R7XNLHL97SMVZ","A1TFMR7RE985MF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TFMR7RE985MF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a really attractive, cozy infinity scarf. I've never worn one before and boy, what a mistake. I live in the midwest and in the winter I'm constantly struggling to keep my ears warm with a regular scarf (no hat head, please). Even though this has a relatively loose knit and wrapping the six-foot length twice around my neck gives a kind of cowl effect around my face, it still feels warm on my head, ears and neck. There's plenty of scarf to pull up and arrange around my face if I'd like some protection there too. The soft elasticity of the knit keeps the scarf on my head, hugging my ears and up on my face without being tight. It's light and very comfortable to wear; the knit isn't itchy at all.The scarf I have is a true black and cream mix and it looks great with my gray coat.

"This bath step is perfect for anyone who needs some extra help getting into the shower, especially someone with hip or knee issues. It's completely non-slip with a soft foam top and a wide base that will be comforting for anyone who's unsteady. It does look big and it takes up a lot of floor space but as someone with intermittent knee issues who's also taken care of a parent after a knee replacement, it can be scary to get out of a shower with wet feet and trust your unstable weight to a smaller area. The step can be put up or put away after each use - we put ours in the tub since the shower curtain hid it from sight - so the issue is workable. I like that it's stackable so that in the future if we need it to be higher we can add another step.There are many other uses, most obviously as a step for children in the bathroom.

"I think this is a product that's a great idea - and is something I wanted, badly - but it isn't really right with the FitBit One. Even though it's small, the FBO is still too bulky to fit comfortably on the wrist like this. I have an average 7"" wrist and when inside this wristband, the flat area taken up by my FBO spans nearly the entire top of my wrist. I had a difficult time getting the straps tight enough because it wouldn't conform to the shape of my arm, then when I got it as tight as I could I had some issues getting it fastened. The way the wristband closes - two black rubber pegs are pushed into two slots - isn't secure enough that I'd wear this outside. It was fine for wearing around the house, especially when under the sleeve of a shirt but I wouldn't take it elsewhere.As far as accuracy goes, I haven't found a place to put my FBO yet that measures it properly so this isn't any different. It seems to give a low count vs the high counts I get when I put it in my pocket or clip it to my sock and the low count when I attach it to my bra.Discounted product received for evaluation and review.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1102DUL8Y76Z1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016OBD4TW#wasThisHelpful","R1102DUL8Y76Z1","A1TFMR7RE985MF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TFMR7RE985MF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"There are parts of this tree I think my cat will like and use a lot and parts that are poorly designed and make this clunky.From the beginning: I took another reviewer's advice (which was invaluable) and assembled this upside down. It really doesn't come with instructions, just a blown out diagram of the pieces in the general idea of what the tree looks like. It actually ended up taking three of us in the end when the bottom wouldn't go on without pulling the legs into square. It only took about a half hour and it wasn't difficult, just fiddly. The sisal on the posts is nice and tightly wound and the carpet is soft without any sharp staples or tacks exposed.Even while we were putting it together, I didn't understand why there was a swinging platform under the top tier. No cat I've ever had likes to jump on a moving surface and there's no way to step or jump on or off of it without it moving back and forth *and* side to side. If you've got multiple cats, it's also likely that if you manage to get one on the swinging platform, you'll have one devil underneath that'll decide to bat at it. My cat hated the thing (she kept staring at it, I think she thought it was going to fall on her) so after a day, I took it down.The small ledge on the right is too small - the angle of the image gives the impression it's longer than it is, there's actually only about four inches difference between the top edge and the back of the second tier's edge. It might be large enough for a little cat or kitten to sleep on but it's barely wide enough for my cat (an average-sized three year-old) to get on her back legs and leap to the top tier. She looks nervous every time she stands on it, enough that I've put a footstool on that side of the tree so she can get a running start at it if she'd like.There are things she likes about it which is why it gets three stars. She loves the middle tier in the morning because it's big enough that she can stretch full out on her back in the sun. Later in the day if she's on it, she's on the top tier and a couple of times I've found her in the little cubby hole. She likes to hide her toys around the house and she's deposited a few in the lower hammock.This is a big piece and like I mentioned at the beginning, it's kind of clunky. Unless you have a larger room, it'll look best near a corner because it's such a big rectangle and it's so very *beige.*","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2K33DMKMQOCA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XY250YC#wasThisHelpful","R2K33DMKMQOCA","A1TFMR7RE985MF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TFMR7RE985MF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm close to a beginner when it comes to photo manipulation - I'd tried Photoshop Elements a few years ago and it was too much for me so I downloaded a free basic program and have been using that. I'm comfortable with a lot of the tools now and this version of PaintShop Pro has been much more pleasant to pick up. I was able to immediately start using the basic tools I already knew plus some new features like auto correct that immediately improved what I'd been creating. When I installed and registered my products I was sent to Corel's website and offered some extra downloads along with a signup for a newsletter for weekly tips that I took advantage of and a section devoted to tutorials that I bookmarked.I installed this on my laptop running Windows 10 and I haven't had any problems at all. Installation was smooth and it hasn't caused any problems even when I keep it running all day with other things in the background.I absolutely love this so far.

"I seriously cannot be without these bags - I use them for everything. The regular zip bags don't work at all for leftovers, they don't keep things fresh or keep odors in. These are perfect. Not only can I store leftovers in the fridge, I can put them in the freezer and know that they'll be just fine. There's a little click at the end of the zip letting me know the seal is complete and I've never had a problem with liquid leaking.I use these for many, many other things too.

"I wish I had something to report but after a few weeks, this hasn't done one thing for the dark spots - some small scar residue, some freckles and some other non-freckle spotting - I applied it to. I don't know how long it's supposed to take for a noticeable difference to occur but other products make claims that theirs produce results within shorter time frames so I assume it's possible to achieve results within less time than I used this. I just know I'm a little frustrated that I used this religiously on top of skin treatments I already use religiously, and nothing happened beyond some over-moisturizing.I actually WILL continue to give this a chance for another couple of weeks to see if it'll do something and if there's any change at all, I'll come back and adjust my rating.","2.0 out of 5 stars","October 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RSUCN1ZHN9BZI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00M0V083Q#wasThisHelpful","RSUCN1ZHN9BZI","A1TFMR7RE985MF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TFMR7RE985MF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We have several Bluetooth enabled devices in our household so with a tween and near-tween who are obsessed with boy bands, I reluctantly turned this over to them. With some assistance, they were able to figure out how to link their phones and how to use an SD card with it (ugh!). The older girl figured out how to use the phone through the speaker and had clear coverage from anyplace in her room. They were able to easily tune into all of their favorite radio stations as well.All of us love the sound the speaker produces. For such a little unit (a bit smaller than a loaf of bread), there's a decent level of bass. It won't rattle your internal organs but it's better than I expected and with the clear treble makes for a nicely rounded sound. There's no distortion or crackling even at the highest volume.The unit comes with a USB cable and it holds a long charge, seven or eight hours worth of use. It doesn't affect performance but it's also a very nice looking speaker - the curves and dips make it less clunky and more like a display piece.

"This is a really nice pair of sunglasses, better than the price would lead you to believe.

I've got really sensitive eyes and these have provided perfect protection. They come with a very nice semi-hard zippered case, a drawstring bag and a microfiber wipe for the lenses (essential!).I'm a child of the 80s so I love this particular style of sunglasses.

"The dude had a bad experience with another beard trimmer and until now, rather than risking an accidental shearing, has waited until trips to the barber to get it cleaned up. That means he looks like a maniacal lumberjack for a few weeks. Not good. This is a great trimmer, one he can easily handle on his own without fear of accidentally shaving off his beard.This is a highly adjustable unit - you can leave slightly-more-than stubble to an inch of hair between the beard and hair comb attachments. You adjust the length by increments on the dial. The dude used the ""9"" length with the beard comb and it cleaned up his short beard nicely. The unit is very quiet and light and holds a long charge.This is strictly a beard trimmer and he has to keep his razor to get a sharp edge around his ears and anywhere else. If he ever went on a month-long trip someplace and had to pack both of them it would be a pain but since that probably won't happen, it's not a big deal. The trimmer comes with a kind of flimsy little bag that only holds the body, not the cord.

"I use my ear buds primarily in the gym so my requirements are pretty simple: I need good sound so I can turn up my music loud enough to block out the sounds of the machines, I need the cord to be tangle-free and I need the ear buds to be comfortable and secure.The sound is really good through this set. It's clear without any distortion - there's not a great bass quality though and when I really cranked the volume up it became more apparent. I don't know if you're ever going to find great sound balance in a low-to-mid-priced set of ear buds and compared to other similar sets I've tried, it's about the same.The flat cable is fantastic - I can't believe what a difference it makes when it comes to tangling. I usually just toss my ear buds in my workout bag and worry about straightening them out the next time I need them, something that takes a while because they end up in a knotted mess. These just didn't tangle - I dropped them in and when I picked them up the next day they were perfect.The ear buds are a comfortable soft rubber - there are several sizes included and it's not hard to remove one and put on another. I can't wear any of the hard ear pieces or anything that wraps around my ears so this is pretty much my only option and I need it to be extra secure. I decided to keep the silicone bud that came on the set because I got a firm seal and it hasn't come out even when I run. The metal housing looks and feels solid and strong so I hope it lasts longer than all of the plastic-housed ear buds that have ended up in the trash.There's a multi-function button on the cable that can be used for pausing/starting music and answering calls but it's not something I use. It comes with a nicely sized zippered case that you can actually store the ear buds in.Discounted product received for evaluation and review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3TVI6SWOCNG32/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RGK8AS6#wasThisHelpful","R3TVI6SWOCNG32","A1TFMR7RE985MF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TFMR7RE985MF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I really like this set of cleaning cloths. I have the white set and my recommendation would be unless you're planning on bleaching them - or don't mind them looking grubby - pick a color. The scrubby cloth is really tough and great for pans and other places you'd need major elbow grease. The striped cloth is a mixture of a medium weight scrub and microfiber and I use it for cleaning my counters, cook top and stainless sink. I'm able to get a nice shiny finish to my sink and appliances especially that I don't normally get with just cleaning. I haven't used it there yet but it would also be great for cleaning the bathroom. The soft microfiber cloth is fluffy and I keep one dry for wiping dust off off my televisions and other electronics.

I live someplace that gets a lot of snow in the winter and even though I have a have an entryway rug there already, it slides around and I always end up with a dirty, slippery mess by front door. This rug isn't going anywhere - it has a thick rubber backing and didn't move around at all when I put it down. The top feels like it's made out of a kind of industrial material, between rubber and nylon, and is sculpted with deep ridges that will hold all kinds of gunk and liquid. It still has a low clearance and I have no problem opening and closing my door.I don't see why you couldn't use this outdoors if you wanted to prevent dirt from shoes coming in if you don't have a mud room, like in a garage or on a porch.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R112RHG1WWABN3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00URLLUV0#wasThisHelpful","R112RHG1WWABN3","A1TFMR7RE985MF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TFMR7RE985MF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a festive egg platter with room for a dozen eggs (or a half dozen deviled eggs). It's slightly bigger than my dinner plates and the salt and pepper shakers are a nice size, maybe three-fourths the size of my regular stoneware set. I was slightly disappointed by the appearance of the set, given the Lenox name and the supposed retail value. It feels closer to stoneware than fine china - it's very thick and clunky and the glaze is dull. The color is also a much darker bone than any other pieces in my holiday collection - it's bordering on tan.

"I'm not 100% happy with the way NuPro engineered this case even though I appreciate that it's a low-cost alternative. There are several little issues that are obvious when you open it up. First: it's bulky. The thickness of the faux leather and lining add quite a bit of clunk once I compare it to my HDX with an Amazon cover. My Fire seems stable enough inside for now but it's very, very easy to bend the elasticized edges and pull it out again. The magnetized cover doesn't turn the Fire on and off and with the raised buttons on the top, it's easy to accidentally start or turn it off even while you have the cover closed. I've done it several times now.I don't usually watch videos or streaming television with the back folded up on my lap so it's not as much of an issue for me but the easel mechanism is kind of odd. There's a tab in the back that the edge of the cover folds back into. I can't get mine to stand up the way it does in the image - it leans back too far - and I can see the tab causing problems eventually.There are some good things. Nothing is blocked and there's easy access to the camera. The faux leather is kind of pretty - I have the purple and it's a nice deep eggplant with a dark gray lining. There's also an elastic tab at the top if you have a stylus. And again, there's that price thing.Whether you choose this or a different case, you should get one. The Fire is a fingerprint and dust magnet and having this case has at least kept mine clean(er).","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3JV09O2VABC5B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011LRV63U#wasThisHelpful","R3JV09O2VABC5B","A1TFMR7RE985MF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TFMR7RE985MF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I used this on two scars: one is fairly recent (within the last six months) and on my hand and one is older (several years) and on my neck. I have sensitive skin that's relatively pale, I keep out of the sun and these two areas are not places I treat with other products. So, that out of the way....I'm not sure why this is called a ""gel cream,"" because it looks like a straight up gel. It's a brown gel that immediately left a brown-ish stain where I applied it. I tried to make sure I put the gel only on the scar itself and not the surrounding skin but that was just about impossible and I'm sure not a product requirement anyway. The brown discoloring took a couple of days to wear off from my neck and the scar looked a little faded but I don't know if the scare was worth it to me.So this had a slight effect during the time I used it but the side effect was too scary for me to continue using it; I'd rather explore other options until my scars faded fully.Product received for free for evaluation and review.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3MNIPDRJK7F7R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00T8NFRUS#wasThisHelpful","R3MNIPDRJK7F7R","A1TFMR7RE985MF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TFMR7RE985MF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Because I have what I delicately refer to as ""aging"" skin that doesn't break out, I've rarely used astringent toners lately even though some of my other treatments (plus the hot summer) have left my skin feeling a little greasy. I definitely don't need anything harsh and artificial so I like that this toner is made of natural products and is relatively gentle. After the initial shock of the witch hazel, the aloe and tea tree oil are quite soothing and felt cool the few times they hit some sunburned skin. It has what I think is a nice citrus-y herbal scent that doesn't linger once I add my other skin care products.I don't think there was any long-term pore minimizing effect from the toner but I think that's true from just about every product that makes that claim; if you've got big pores, short of an aesthetician, you're not going to find the answer. My skin can dry out pretty easily but this toner didn't have enough astringent in it; there were days when I used it that I didn't need moisturizer at all. I didn't like having to apply this with a spray bottle. In addition to my *ahem* aging skin, I have aging hair and while I'm sure this is only made of natural products, they're products I don't want near my hairline or on my hair. I can unscrew the top and pour some out onto a cotton ball but it's clumsy and messy; it would be easier if the product was simply packaged that way to begin with.I liked this toner and while I may not use it every day, it's one I'm using every so often, especially after I use a facial scrub.Free product provided for evaluation and review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R13DJAS17F5AAH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NLKAVL4#wasThisHelpful","R13DJAS17F5AAH","A1TFMR7RE985MF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TFMR7RE985MF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This has been perfect for reorganization in my sewing room (for the 1,000th time) and I'm ordering a second unit to sit next to this first one because  it's so easy to fill up with my little boxes and bins.The entire unit is heavier than I thought it would be. I made the mistake of unfolding it and trying to set it up downstairs and carry it up (it comes mostly assembled but flattened in a large box) - it's big, bulky and heavy and a couple of broken fingernails and bruises later I decided to leave it alone and carry it up the way it came in the box. It's easy to figure out once you're ready to set up: expand the large main piece and the two file boxes (dropping the bottom pieces in before you expand them all the way, something I forgot then puzzled over, duh). There are runners in the bottom that the file boxes slide in to keep them moving smoothly.I wish there were some kind of lock to actually keep them in the channel but that may be asking for something too fancy. I have a lot of heavy pattern files in the drawers right now and when I'm not careful and pull too hard the entire file boxes come tipping out. My files don't stand up well either; they're too heavy and tip the box back and forth. It would be nice if the file box were able to accommodate hanging file folders but again, I may be wishing for something too fancy.

"Because of my dry mouth I drink a lot of water during my workout; I decided to add this to my bottle rather than see about its effectiveness afterwards. I used a single packet in my 16 oz. bottle, mixed with water and a couple cubes of ice. In my opinion, you need the ice since this has a bland orange taste with an underlying hint of cornstarch. After I licked my lips, I could actually taste the Stevia (and I know, having switched over to it from sugar and all other artificial sweeteners more than a year ago). When the drink is warm those flavors are amped up.I don't know if Everlast's claims about focus and energy and muscle recovery are true; I don't injure myself when I workout and I don't do any hardcore things that require focus or energy that would make me notice any difference. Is there some stimulant in here? That's hard for me to tell too since I always feel a little energized after a workout. I will agree with them that this boosts hydration.

"I normally purchase Charmin and in terms of tissue thickness this is pretty similar. The rolls are more compressed partially because of the tubes being squished; in order to open them back up and get them to fit on a roll dispenser you just squeeze the roll back and forth to make the opening round again. The entire thing expands little bit while doing that, to the size of a regular roll.The tissue is super soft, more than what I'm using now. It would be perfect for delicate bums or if you're strolling by the bathroom and had to sneeze, your nose. It's just as strong as any other brand name tissue I've ever used, the sheets tear perfectly well and these are good-sized rolls. I'm used to mega rolls so while these didn't last as long, the thickness of the tissue meant a little went a long way.As I just mentioned, I use the mega rolls so compared to those, these looked smaller than normal to me.

Well the joke was on me because she loved this and wears it when she's at home (only because she still can't accept that she still has to wear readers, or she'd wear it out).It's a pretty blend of smallish chunky purple beads with a rubber loop at each end that fits over the earpiece of the glasses and has a sliding metal clamp that tightens them up. The heads seem to be strung on some very strong and flexible material - Mom's abused it and it's held up great.I looked around for a mid-priced eyeglass holder for awhile because they were more expensive than I realized but I still wanted to get Mom something nice.

"I've used the other ""C"" brand of toilet paper but I always come back to Charmin. There's no other TP that doesn't irritate (thanks, diuretic!) me like this one, no other that cleans up other things that the dude does (because everyone knows women only pee) and no other TP that flushes as well as Charmin.I know there's some controversy about what constitutes a double/mega roll and how these can be regular size package and still be called that. In my opinion only, I think it's because it takes less squares to get the job done? I know I use far less than I do when I have an emergency and have to run to the convenience store and grab a single pack of the regular stuff. The mega rolls last quite a long time for me.As for value, Amazon is pretty even with my other options. The big buying clubs have it for a bit more when I figure in gas and unless I'm there for other things it's irritating to haul myself out there. The local big box stores don't carry the mega rolls and the regular ultras are slightly more. With my Prime Pantry this is a great deal for me right now.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3QHCEMXSDECOY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XSFLOCC#wasThisHelpful","R3QHCEMXSDECOY","A1TFMR7RE985MF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TFMR7RE985MF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is such a pretty, plush set, perfect for cuddling on a chilly day. The faux fur has a short velvety pile that's sculpted on one side with channels that are about a thumb length wide; the back is a solid. I don't think the color is for everyone - it's a deep plum that looked terrible when I opened it up near my brown furniture. I selected it thinking it might go with my lavender, white and gray patterned bedspread though and it went very well. The additional shams even looked nice next to the bed pillow shams and it's great having them there for extra support when I'm working in bed at night.The one thing that worries me is the zipper area on the included shams. The zipper is in the middle of one edge, leaving a few inches on either side to either corner. My sofa pillows are relatively firm and were difficult to fit in. Hopefully I won't be taking them in and out but if I do I'm not certain the zipper and/or stitching is going to hold up to repeated stretching for those extra firm pillows. I may end up just filling them with polyester stuffing or buying a blank form from a fabric store.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3C7Z5MXN9Y4X9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0131LJ7NA#wasThisHelpful","R3C7Z5MXN9Y4X9","A1TFMR7RE985MF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TFMR7RE985MF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a really nice lotion, not surprising because it contains Tea Tree Oil. I love the silky texture that absorbs quickly without feeling goopy and heavy. It doesn't leave a sticky, slippery film although because of the oil that doesn't soak in right away there's some slipperiness for a few minutes. I have a lot of built up callouses on the front balls of my feet because I always go barefoot and a week later I still have shine for ten or fifteen minutes after application. My feet feel great though, and in conjunction with my Emjoi Micro-Pedi Man Callus Remover - Tough Calluses (Super Coarse Roller), they're softer than a baby's you know what.I had some extra on my hands the first day and to get rid of it, I put it on my elbows.

"The dude really likes Wrangler cargo shorts and normally they fit true-to-slightly-smallish (with the standard waistband). This pair was on the large side and since the style of short is loose and casual, they look baggier than either of us expected. He's young enough that baggy, super casual and belted are a frequently-seen style so he doesn't mind but if I order again, I'll size down. He's around 6' tall and they come all the way to his knee.The fabric is a weathered charcoal color and looks stiffer in the image than it is. Enjoy how nice and crisp the shorts look when you get them because they probably won't look that way again unless you have them professionally cleaned. No matter how you dry them, they end up a little wrinkled and no matter how you press them, the pockets will never look the same again. Since these are ultra casual shorts, I don't think Wrangler made that a priority though.Overall, the dude likes these a lot for everyday knocking around. They're comfortable, sturdy and while he thinks they look fine as baggy as they are, I wish I'd have gone down a waist size for something closer to a more perfect fit. These are shorts I'd buy again.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3BSXZCXJHVR8K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XKYLKFM#wasThisHelpful","R3BSXZCXJHVR8K","A1TFMR7RE985MF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TFMR7RE985MF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I also just received an infusion bottle from iNeibo that was similar, it just was a plain bottle without the sport top. My review is generally the same for the bottle itself because the bottom part of the bottle is the same and my feelings about it are exactly the same.I've never even thought about using an infuser water bottle before so I kept thinking there were some pieces missing when I took the bottle out of the package. Weren't the seeds and little pieces going to come out through the holes into the water? Where was the lid thingie that would plug the extra holes on top to keep the water from flooding out when I drank? The bottle really is quite simple though - just a few pieces, nothing missing and easy to use. Yes, depending on what fruit you use and how small you cut it, there's a chance you'll end up with a few floating pieces in your water but it's not the sea of seeds I was thinking of.The infuser tube is about an inch and a half or so in diameter. For clean-up later on, it's best not to pack it too tightly - it's easy to pull it out afterwards, flip it over and give it a hard shake over the sink or trash to empty the contents. What's left can be rinsed out and cleaned it hot soapy water very easily. I made the mistake of packing it full of berries and ended up with a terrible gloppy mess. The dude likes citrus water - he's cut up lemons, oranges and tangerines into wedges, then cut the wedges in half so the maximum surface is exposed.After you fill the tube with fruit, you drop it back in the bottle and push down so the top clicks into place. Then fill it with cold water through the slots in top, let it steep for 15-30 minutes for best results and voila! You have awesome flavored water.Where my review of this bottle differs from my review of the plain bottle is in my feelings about the top. I still don't love all the holes in the top that mean if you're not careful you end up with either a face or potentially a shirt full of water if you're moving and drinking. Because of the sport top though, this bottle is easier to take on the go at least. It's also bigger so if I want to avoid drinking through those holes, I can pour out a couple of glasses from a single bottle. The plain bottle is still good for when you're drinking water at home but if you're on the go, I prefer this one.Product provided for evaluation and review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3NGCQMZ0HZ2QY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010URLXOE#wasThisHelpful","R3NGCQMZ0HZ2QY","A1TFMR7RE985MF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TFMR7RE985MF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the sixth set of 1/2 liter SodaStream bottles I've picked up. I've done it because I like the size - they're easier to use than the liter which are sort of ridiculous for taking places. The problem with using them daily is that the clear plastic gets cloudy from the carbonation. They look so nice for a month or two but that's about it.Within my other sets, I have a pair that's not set to expire for another four months that's not as airtight as it used to be.

"I love this blender so much! I didn't even realize what a piece of junk my old blender was until I opened this and made my first smoothie - I called one of my friends and gushed that all I had to do was turn it on and push a button and it did all the work. There was dead silence for a minute and she asked me what on earth kind of prehistoric blender I had been using.This one though, I think is perfect for me. I didn't want to spend a fortune but since I make a smoothie every day, I wanted something that would do a good job - but I didn't need something that would juice a turnip (although this may do it, I haven't tried). It's handled nearly everything I've thrown at it, frozen, fresh and powdered, with one frozen drink cycle. The one time I've had to get my spatula in there was when I had my ingredients ready to go in the blender (Silk soy milk, frozen cherries and a powdered smoothie mix) and I had to run off for a few minutes. When I came back to blend, the cherries had softened into a clump that refused to sink and separate. As soon as I broke it up, all was fine though.I've also done a cream of mushroom soup and was thrilled by how quickly the bits of onion were pulverized, which was where my old blender failed.It cleans up very easily. I have one of those long wands you fill up with dish soap and as soon as I'm done with my smoothies I run it over to the sink and rinse and scrub it out. Every few days I send it through the dishwasher minus the bottom and seal just to kill any bacteria. My next purchase will be an additional pitcher just to have on hand. You never know with glass, you know?I don't know if I'll ever do more than smoothies or soup in this but for the value, this is absolutely worth it for that alone. I looked a long time for a blender because I was so picky and I highly recommend this one.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3RJX1M4IUEQL4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002RBXHSC#wasThisHelpful","R3RJX1M4IUEQL4","A1TFMR7RE985MF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TFMR7RE985MF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I eat a lot of fresh fruits and vegetables which means I do a lot of prep; I've always used those standard thick cutting boards and on occasion just carefully sliced things on top of my counter. This is so much easier and safer to use. The silicone is non-slip and doesn't shift around, no matter what or how much sloppy fruit I'm cutting. There's a little channel around the edge that catches some liquid if it's a minor mess but if you've tried to cut multiple papaya or melons, for example, you know how quickly a cutting board can start floating around and that's why I like the silicone. Even though the surface feels a little soft, I can still make clean cuts in my fruits and veggies. The only knife marks that ever show on the board are faint surface scratches, no matter how hard I score it.Clean up is easy, especially if there isn't a big wet mess. The board rolls up so you can cup anything in it and take it right to the sink. Depending on what you used the board for, wash it in the sink or dishwasher. Since it's so flexible and thin, it would be easy to take directly out to picnics, cookouts, etc., without taking up too much room in your cooler or bag and could be rinsed off with a splash of water until it could be washed at home later.Product provided at no cost for evaluation and review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R11PZN8J3ESNTQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VI145KQ#wasThisHelpful","R11PZN8J3ESNTQ","A1TFMR7RE985MF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TFMR7RE985MF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The dude loves these shorts. They fit great (the waist is as expected); he has more muscular thighs and these have a perfect amount of room in the seat and thigh without being loose and sloppy; they hit about three inches above his knee (he's 6'). The elastic in back didn't have a lot of stretch but the waist fit well enough that he didn't need it or want it. The fabric is a nice medium to lightweight twill, though darker than the image appears to me - it looks like ivory on my screen, in person it's a light khaki. The other difference is that the D ring is missing; it didn't bother him at all but if someone wants it for hanging something from, they should be aware.There's not much more to say about these shorts - they're great, Wrangler's fit and style has improved a lot over the years and these shorts are a good example.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3UNKK5J7B9ZJ6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XKYXFW8#wasThisHelpful","R3UNKK5J7B9ZJ6","A1TFMR7RE985MF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TFMR7RE985MF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I admit I don't think much about smoke detectors until there's a news story about a fire with injuries or deaths that could have been prevented if the residents had them. When I saw the email from the manufacturer though, I realized what a fire hazard my sewing room was and that I should have had a smoke detector in there years ago. Between my iron, glue gun, various specialty lamps and the piles of fabric, stuffing, batting and thread, I'm lucky I haven't even singed anything over the years.This smoke detector is pretty snazzy with it's photoelectric sensor. It senses those flickers before they have a chance to become a blaze and sets off the alarms. I also love the simultaneous flashing red lights. If I've got my sewing machine going and either the television or music on (which means my headphones are on), chances are I wouldn't hear a bull crashing through a wall. I would see the light flashing on the ceiling in my peripheral vision though.This smoke detector comes ready to go with a battery and mounting hardware. I installed mine on my sewing room ceiling and it's easy enough to stand on a chair and test it twice a year (when the time zones change!) because the button is right on the side, no prying the top off to get to the button inside.Free product provided for evaluation and review","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R179V54VEHG77E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01326H682#wasThisHelpful","R179V54VEHG77E","A1TFMR7RE985MF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TFMR7RE985MF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I gave this four stars because it is what it says it is and it's well constructed, true to size and if you're looking for a strapless bra and you're a certain size this'll work for you. I found it a little...odd.I'm a 36A which put me in the XL and it fit fine. I thought the foam cups were a little thick (a little more than one quarter inch) and they look a lot like flexible flat bowls. It gave the impression I had more than I do which I can't complain about although it felt sort of weird until I got used to it. The fabric is soft and the seams don't itch or anything. When I took it off I didn't have a lot of marks all over.I think the problem for me (and it isn't the fault of the bra) is that it flattened me out too much I'm looking for more lift and separation for what little I have. This is absolutely not a bra for women with large chests because there's not much support. I think it'd be great though for women with a small to average chest who want something comfy under casual tops that need a strapless bra and they don't care about the whole lift, separate, cleavage thing.Free product provided for evaluation and review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R341K8NWIZUX2J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XJ08UC8#wasThisHelpful","R341K8NWIZUX2J","A1TFMR7RE985MF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TFMR7RE985MF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm happy to say this is one dry shampoo that does what it says, although there's a trade-off when it comes to styling. Using it is very simple; you lift up sections of your hair and give a burst of the spray at the roots of your hair, tousle the dry shampoo in then brush it out. It's a little startling at first because the spray is white and if you're a brunette (I mostly am), it turns your hair gray. It takes a bit of brushing to get it out and I'd recommend a bristle brush vs. a styling brush. When I was done, the oil was gone and my hair looked pretty clean.That trade-off I mentioned is that whatever style you had your hair in before you used the product, you can kiss goodbye. The good part is that it adds volume; the bad part is, it takes out everything else, including curl. Plan on wearing barrettes, headbands or if your hair is long, putting it up. My hair is mostly one length and it even took out the shine for a couple of hours until some oil worked back in. It looked clean though!I've used the dry shampoo in the morning and it's lasted all day, something that surprised the heck out of me. My hair does feel a little odd, sort of rough, but it washes out easily the next morning and it's worth it for the instant image pick-up.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1RJXK46V7J4HF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TB00DK2#wasThisHelpful","R1RJXK46V7J4HF","A1TFMR7RE985MF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TFMR7RE985MF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The lotion feels very soft and light when it's blended into the skin despite looking and initially feeling creamy. It doesn't take much for me to get itchy and rashy when I try a new product and that didn't happen with this either. I know theoretically it contains ingredients proven to reduce swelling but given my experience with it, I wonder if there's enough of any of them in here. I have only what I'd call minor swelling and beyond some soothing from the cool temperature I didn't see any difference.There's always going to be an anti-wrinkle quality to a product with glycerine and various oils in it (which this contains). I like this because despite that, it was lighter than anything else I've tried. It has a faint, pleasant floral scent that reminded me of honeysuckle but it doesn't last long and it wasn't irritating despite being right near my nose.Something I found a little funny: 99% of the text on the package is written in multiple languages other than English. I believe there are only a couple of sentences in English and that's it.

"It's difficult to tell from the image but this is one thick belt. At around two inches wide and fairly rugged-looking, it's best suited for jeans or even occasional work wear. The leather is relatively thick and compared to other belts the dude has in his closet that are roughly the same width, it's stiffer and has an overall more heavy-duty feel. Neither one of us thinks it would hold up to daily use holding a lot of heavy tools on a job site but for a modest tool pouch, it would work.Size up though - the dude is around a 36-ish; I ordered a 40 just because past belt purchases have taught me to be wary of sizing. I chose well; the 40 wasn't too big but I'd have definitely worried about a 38 being on the edge of just right/too small.My star downgrade from five to four was because the belt has a terrible smell that I haven't been able to get rid of yet.

"(review is for Casual Leisure Socks for Men, 6-Pack)Men's socks can be pretty expensive and for the value, this is a really nice pack. There are two brown, four black pair in the package; when I think of a ""leisure sock"" I picture something for lounging around and these are more of a medium weight dress sock. The knit is soft and stretches quite a bit without making the socks thin or tight. The dude wears a size 12 which is at the top of the suggested size range and he found them comfortable with plenty of room. I snagged a pair to try out (I'm a women's size 8.5) and I thought they were a good fit for me too. The knit cuff that runs around the lower calf is about an inch thick and didn't constrict at all, something the dude always worries about with socks. He confirmed that his feet were dry after a day in leather dress shoes too.This is a nice pack of socks, comfy and well-made.

"I own another set of DII potholders and they work well and hold up great in the washing machine. These feel just as nice; they're thick and well-padded and unless you're carrying a dish directly from the oven to a table that's fifty feet away, they give good heat protection. I rarely use the hand pocket on the square potholder and truthfully, often use the mitt as a trivet on my counters as I move things around. It's just easier to grab my squares to pull things out and I have enough sets by now that I have a lot of them. The mitts are very thick and perfect for keeping my counters protected.This set is cute - I got the red and it's a true cherry red that pops when contrasted against the white. The reason I downgraded my rating from five stars to four is that on the mitt there are a few quilting lines that are broken and over time and with washings, I think the stitching is going to undo more. It's purely cosmetic - the quilting isn't what holds the potholders together and with this pattern you can barely see the red thread anyway. It's just sloppy. Still, this is a nice value overall.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1937SOA15GI71/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002WRI8I0#wasThisHelpful","R1937SOA15GI71","A1TFMR7RE985MF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TFMR7RE985MF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm more of an essential oil dabbler than anything else. I've picked up vials here and there on Etsy, blends that I assumed I'd like the smell of based on their ingredients (not always successfully). One scent I've always avoided has been lavender - it makes me sneeze and it seemed cloying to me. This oil seems to be the right blend to change my mind. Sage is one of my favorite herbs to cook with and I'd never have thought to mix it with lavender but it works. Those are the two strongest things I smell but they wouldn't work so well together if they weren't cut through with balsam and marjoram and finally mellowed with the chamomile.I don't sleep well and have a very sensitive sense of smell (the curse of the migraine-sufferer). Once I figured out that just a couple of drops on a cotton ball slipped into the underside of my pillowcase was the perfect amount, getting a different part of the oil's scent every time I breathed was very relaxing. Personally, because of my sensitivity, I wouldn't use it in a diffuser, but that's me. It was exactly enough in that cotton ball.It didn't knock me into dreamland but this oil blend relaxed me and actually made me like lavender (a miracle in itself).This is an evaluation of a product received at no cost from the manufacturer.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R8Q30Z2S45ZKE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YWHZG8S#wasThisHelpful","R8Q30Z2S45ZKE","A1TFMR7RE985MF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TFMR7RE985MF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I dithered for days whether or not to pick up this bag and in the end, I'm so glad I did. I *love* it.I have the gray and it has a beautiful weathered look. The leather is an olive brown and with all of the straps, buckles and large stitching it has the look of a utility bag. It's like a magic tote or something - it looks like a nice roomy bag from the outside but I kept packing and packing and packing and ..you know - and it still closed. I couldn't believe how much it held. It could even make a decent overnight bag.I can't find any fault with the seams, buckles, heavy duty zipper or magnetic snaps. I didn't initially like nylon-like lining because it makes a bit of noise but after using the bag a while I can see why Sherpani uses it. It's really sturdy, it seems like it'll be easy to clean and difficult to tear. The pattern is nice too, a weathered dark gold with olive and burgundy polka dots.There aren't a lot of things I don't hesitate to give five stars to but this is one of them. It's an awesome bag.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RC405DZHPTHX9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UUGICCW#wasThisHelpful","RC405DZHPTHX9","A1TFMR7RE985MF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TFMR7RE985MF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm not great at removing the stems/cores of strawberries - seems like a simple thing but I usually end up removing half of the strawberry along with the green stuff and the tough white interior. Anything to make the job easier is aces with me and this not only made the job easy it did a slick job making a perfectly round cut. The operation of the gadget is very simple - depress the green plunger to open up the claw and sink it into the top of the strawberry. It doesn't matter if you cut into the leaves, just make sure you get the center core inside the claw. Then let go of the plunger, give the tool a few gentle twists as you pull up and voila - you get a nice sharp cone-shaped hole in the middle of your strawberry.If you've got a huge pile of strawberries to core for jam or something and you need it done quickly, this probably isn't the tool you want to use. However, if you're a little klutzy like me and only need a handful or if you'd like to have a young person help you and don't want to hand them a knife, this is perfect. I have a great recipe for cheesecake stuffed strawberries (that are chilled and the tops dusted with graham cracker crumbs, YUM!) and this makes them so pretty - plus it fits my piping bag tip making the filling job go quickly.Free product provided for evaluation and review","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2KF4WY0G0EIFO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0111KHRNK#wasThisHelpful","R2KF4WY0G0EIFO","A1TFMR7RE985MF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TFMR7RE985MF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Alive Souls: Inception, Elena Yulkina, Amazon Digital Services, Inc., 2015Maya is your average teenager, but not really. She can read minds, and she can control fire with her mind. She knows that she is not like her classmates in school. One night, she asks, out loud, who is she and where did she come from. Then she gets the answer.Maya suddenly finds herself in a well-lit ballroom with lots of expensive-looking paintings on the walls. It is also full of people. She is suddenly hugged by a younger man who treats her like his long-lost daughter, which she is. It seems that Maya is a real princess who was sent to Earth to get her out of the way. All of the inhabited worlds have been fighting a long-running war against the Darkness. They have been holding it off, as best they can, while waiting for Maya to become old enough, and powerful enough, to fight the Darkness single-handedly (scripture says so).Maya can't go back to Earth, because there is too much chance of her being found by the Darkness. Her twin sister, Varvara, takes her place. She can't stay where she is, on a planet called Zabir, for the same reason. Maya is sent to another world, called Udas. A young man named Mayvert volunteers to go with her, as her bodyguard, but he does not do a very good job of it. There are several narrow escapes, including Maya being burned at the stake as some sort of monster, and walking out of the flames, totally unhurt. Did I mention that Maya and Mayvert are able to grow actual, working wings? Does the Darkness come to Udas to find Maya?This is a short novel, less than 100 pages, but it is surprisingly good. It works as a teen/young adult tale. It also works as a fantasy story, with interesting possibilities for future stories.

"These are harder times than usual for the Lord of the Jungle.Someone who calls himself ""Tarzan"" has been kidnapping girls and women from the local tribes, never to be seen again. It is causing Tarzan's usual allies, both human and animal, to turn their backs on him. The latest kidnap victim is Sandra Pickerall, a white woman from Scotland. A couple of bounty hunters are very interested in the reward offered by Sandra's father for her safe return. They certainly won't ignore the reward for delivering Tarzan, dead or alive, also to Sandra's father. As an added complication, there is a tribe of cannibals in the area who are best avoided at all costs.Sandra is rescued from the cannibals by Tarzan, and he is shot, and severely injured, by one of the bounty hunters. In their travels, the bounty hunters discover that the cannibals wear lots of gold jewelry.

Sandra is very uninterested in becoming a goddess.Later, ""Tarzan"" rescues Sandra from the Portuguese, after learning the truth about them. As time goes on, she begins to have feelings for him. She realizes that he is not insane or a psychopath, but an average guy with a case of total amnesia. When the Tarzans meet, can Sandra keep Tarzan from killing ""Tarzan?"" The bounty hunters find the mine, with chunks of gold just lying on the ground. Do they make it back to civilization with their new riches?This is a lesser-known, but pretty good part of the Tarzan series.

"Beau Walker is a brilliant psychological researcher with a strong dislike for military authority. He is practically forced onto a military aircraft by Burton Grimes, the source of his dislike. Along with several other eminent scientists, he is taken to what was a secret research facility near Moscow.Something happened to cause the total destruction of the facility and the nearby town, at the cost of several thousand lives. Whatever the cause, this was not a ""normal"" explosion. The crater from a normal, even nuclear, explosion would not be still growing. A normal explosion would have blown the nearby trees, outward, not inward. A normal explosion would not create a time warp inside the crater. After investigating the best they can, the group gets back on the plane.They are taken to a Very Top Secret research facility inside a mountain in the California desert. Experiments are being conducted in parapsychology, with the intention of creating people who can, for instance, set off explosives from a great distance away, or perform cutting-edge genetic engineering, with their minds. That is what the Russian facility was doing. At the exact moment ""it"" happened, an American nuclear-powered space shuttle in orbit vanished, and several other such anomalies happened all over the world. Back in California, the same complex is conducting research to create extremely lethal toxins (not just ""regular"" Ebola, but ""super"" Ebola), and genetically created hybrid super soldiers, with an explosive device implanted in their necks, in case of death.The group manages to escape, along with Adena, the first psychic test subject, and her two children. Of course, the military will not let them go so easily. On several occasions, the children show that they are the next step in human evolution. The final confrontation takes place in an abandoned town in Nevada.It is not easy for any author to sustain the reader's interest for almost 500 pages, but this author does an excellent job at it. It covers a number of subjects, from psychology to physiology to government conspiracy to santeria. Much of the book is very technical (the science can get a bit overwhelming), but the last part turns spiritual. This is a gem of a book, and is very much recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RAU1HAQ9JPRAY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UP8XLAI#wasThisHelpful","RAU1HAQ9JPRAY","A25P31WA3F4040","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A25P31WA3F4040?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"On his deathbed, Kia's father, an interstellar space trader, entrusts to her a diamond from the planet Malem. The problem is that it is very illegal for any off-worlder to possess a Malemese diamond; the penalty is death. In order to get away from an unpleasant home life, Kia engages in the occasional theft to get money to pay for translator school.Kia is caught by Agatha, part of the Order of Universal Benevolence; sort of like the religious police. Kia is sent to Malem, as Agatha's translator. Malem is a cold, wet planet, in great contrast to Kia's dry, arid home world. Malem recently got over a plague which may, or may not, have been started by Malem's planetary neighbor. Among the thousands of casualties was the Queen's young daughter. She blames Kia's father for not reaching the planet quickly enough with the necessary medicine.Kia learns that she cannot, for instance, go into a local tavern and say that she found the diamond lying on the ground. Diamonds are passed down from one generation to another, with the recipient keeping it for their entire life. She has to find its rightful owner. A young child contracts the plague. The requirement is that she is quarantined, alone for seven days, in the Plague House, a stone house in the middle of a swamp. At the end of that time, she either walks out of the House cured, or someone goes in to get her dead body. Agatha volunteers to enter the Plague House to take care of the child, even though it means almost certain death. While she is in there, Kia begins to get the idea that the High Priest is using the Plague House, and what it represents, to mess with the facts, and keep the people on edge. It involves Agatha not leaving the Plague House alive. Does Kia find the diamond's rightful owner? Does Agatha survive the Plague House?This one is really good. It's easy to read, and very well written. Having a main character of color certainly helps. This is recommended for teens, and adults.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1HVNQFQ8VSKY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1770530754#wasThisHelpful","R1HVNQFQ8VSKY","A25P31WA3F4040","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A25P31WA3F4040?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Written in the early 20th century, This fantasy tale is about a small town that wishes to be ruled by a magic lord.Several leading citizens of the Vale of Erl go to their King, suggesting that a magic lord will help their town to be famous far and wide. The King sends his son, Alveric, into Elfland to bring back Lirazel, the King's daughter, as his bride. The misty border between the two lands causes those who live just to the west of Elfland to pretend that the compass direction of East, toward Elfland, does not exist.Lirazel produces a son, Orion, but the marriage is not happy. She is unwilling, or unable, to give up her belief in praying to the stars, in favor of Alveric's religion. In his desperation to get her back, Lirazel's father sent over a powerful rune to Lirazel, which she puts in a drawer. She knows that if she reads the rune, it will immediately send her back to Elfland. After being told, again, to give up her religion, now, in frustration, Lirazel uses the rune. Alveric immediately goes after her. After traveling for several days through a vast wasteland, he is forced to realize that not only has the castle of Elfland disappeared, but the entire land of Elfland has vanished.Alveric goes back to Erl and puts together an expedition to the far North to find some piece of Elfland that is not gone. After several years, a couple of members of the expedition return to Erl, no longer as committed to finding Elfland as they once were. Alveric shows no sign of giving up. Watching with her father, Lirazel begins to think that maybe she should go back to Alveric. Do they get back together? Do the people of Erl get their wish to be ruled by a magic lord?This was written in a very different time, so it is not a quick read; it will take some effort on the part of the reader. But that effort will be richly rewarded, because Dunsany, one of the overall masters of the fantasy field, does a wonderful job with the language and descriptions of this story.

"This is a rarely reprinted science fiction novel of the early 20th Century about three people suddenly sent on a wild adventure.Set in Philadelphia of the early 20th Century, Robert Drayton is a young lawyer in ethical trouble. Terry Trenmore is a big, strapping Irishman, full of muscles, but perhaps a bit lacking in brains. Viola is Terry's teenage sister. Through a busted burglary and a bit of intrigue, they are sitting at a table with a mysterious glass bottle in front of them. The sterling silver stopper is shaped into Cerberus, the mythological three-headed dog. It contains ""the dust of Purgatory,"" said to have been collected by Dante himself during his time there. Terry touches the dust, and immediately disappears. Viola and Robert soon follow.They find themselves in a strangely changed Philadelphia. After just a few minutes on the street, they are arrested for not wearing their number in public. It turns out that they have traveled 200 years into the future, to a dystopian Philadelphia, where everyone has numbers instead of names. They are taken to the Hall of Justice, where the punishment for breaking the law is to be thrown into the Pit of the Past. It is a large pit that is home to a carnivorous creature with steel spikes for teeth. Instead, the three are entered into ""democratic"" civil service exams, to become part of the ruling class.Actually, the contests are fixed, and the losers die. The ruling class does have names, like Cleverest, Swiftest and Loveliest; they also have total control over the population. History has been suppressed, and literacy is forbidden. Drayton gets in big trouble simply for asking for a newspaper. In 22nd Century Philadelphia, William Penn is worshiped as an angry god, and the Liberty Bell has been turned into a disintegrator machine. Can the three return home? Do they survive this dystopian nightmare?This novel should be much more available than it has been. It does stereotype its characters, but the author stays away from insulting stereotypes. It certainly works as a dystopian novel, and is very much worth the reader's time.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RUR70UFCYM4TV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1617209392#wasThisHelpful","RUR70UFCYM4TV","A25P31WA3F4040","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A25P31WA3F4040?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This novel is about an attempt to artificially enhance the abilities of the human brain.Richard Powell is the CEO of Cerebrical, a high-tech company that has created Trillium, a serum that it says will create geniuses. To get much-needed venture capital financing, the company needs a well-known neuroscientist as its public ""face."" Alan Price is a world-renowned Stanford researcher who has fallen on scientific hard times after switching to the ""dead end"" of investigating Alzheimer's Disease. The venture capital meeting does not go well.The US military has a secret unit called Project Genesis. Sophisticated computer algorithms are used to predict which politicians, or rebel leaders, around the world are going to pose a threat to America in the future. They are then assassinated before they can do anything. Project Genesis is very interested in Trillium, and it is administered to the members of the team. It really does increase their IQ by a lot, but, naturally, there is a huge and unpleasant side effect. A member of the team kills the other members, and takes off on what he is convinced is a mission to keep America safe.The latest victim of Project Genesis was Nassir Lwazi, the president of Kenya. He was a tyrant who pitted the two main tribal groups against each other. The whole country is on edge, just waiting for the spark to start a civil war (can anyone say ""Rwandan Genocide, Part 2?""). Thomas Amani is a student at Harvard who does not know that Lwazi was his father. He feels compelled to go to Kenya to bring peace, even though he has no idea what he is going to say. The surviving member of Project Genesis is totally convinced that Amani is just as much of a tyrant as his father. Therefore, Amani must die, along with the American President, who is there as part of the ""peace process."" Can he be stopped? Is there any way to reduce the influence of the side effect? Can Trillium lead to a cure for Alzheimer's Disease?This story works really well. It works as a regular political thriller, and the scientific part feels very plausible.

"Environmental degradation and over-consumption are destroying Bel'lar's home world. A growing movement among the people is to adopt the Syn (synthetic) lifestyle, to practically live on synthetic chemicals. The minority Organs (organic) want Bel'lar to take a ship called Light Traveler, and a small crew, to the semi-mythical planet blue/white planet. to see if it is suitable for colonization.Just before their hurried departure, just missing a mob of rampaging Syns, a beautiful mystic and seer named Ry Sing gives Bel'lar a horrifying vision. Long, long ago, Bel'lar was the Great One, the religious leader on a world called the Planet of Abundance. It faced a similar over-consumption crisis. His advisers convinced him the purifying the planet was the only option. It wasn't until it was too late that Bel'lar realized that ""purifying"" the planet involved using several nuclear weapons buried around the planet to kill everyone. Even worse, scripture says that he is destined to do it again.After visiting the blue/white planet, with an unscheduled stop at its smaller, red, dead planetary neighbor (the Planet of Abundance), Bel'lar and crew head home to tell the people what they have found. Because of time dilation, nearly 350 years have passed since they left. Their world is on the verge of environmental collapse. The air and water are full of synthetic chemicals. There are no fish or animals left. Genetic modifications from the Syn lifestyle have made the population fat, hairless and stupid. The few Organs who are left are forbidden to leave their compound on pain of immediate death by the Syns.An entire religion grew up around Bel'lar during his absence. A competing religion has grown up around a man named Quasar, leader of the Organs, and de facto ruler of the world. Bel'lar is to be forced to publicly recant (he has no interest in being another Great One), so that the people will have no choice but to worship Quasar. A short distance away is another planetary purification device. Does Bel'lar ""purify"" another planet? Is there anyone worth saving?Personally, the first half of the book, when the crew visited the two planets, felt a little too new age-ish. The second half of the story, when they were back home, was much better.

"The US federal government has a seemingly unlimited number of grant opportunities. This book attempts to simplify the grant-writing process.The first step is to find the grants that are being offered. There are a number of places to look, including the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance. Apply for grants only in areas where your non-profit is qualified (if you are an arts organization, why are you applying for an agriculture grant?). Get a copy of the instructions from the grantor, usually called something like Request for Proposal, or RFP. Read it thoroughly, then read it again. The grantor may get very picky about what should, or should not, appear in your application. You don't want an otherwise first-rate application to be rejected because you couldn't follow directions.How do you get a government agency to notice your little-old non-profit? Have you handled similar projects in the past? Is your non-profit, or your staff, distinctive in some way? As you put together your application, follow exactly the directions in the RFP. Give the grantor some sort of idea about your anticipated budget, and the financial records you will keep about the project. When the application is done to the best of your ability, send it to the grantor.The RFP should indicate the waiting time for an answer from the grantor. If the answer is Yes, the celebrate and rejoice (and start work on your next application). If your application is rejected, it is not the end of the world. The grantor will usually tell you why it was rejected. That way, you will be much more prepared for next time.This is a short, and very interesting, book about a potential source of revenue for groups and individuals. It is very easy to read and understand, and is very much worth the reader's time.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2NG2U6SSMGR6B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1607468522#wasThisHelpful","R2NG2U6SSMGR6B","A25P31WA3F4040","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A25P31WA3F4040?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Next to him is a woman also just regaining consciousness. A simulated atomic bomb will be tested in just a couple of minutes. If they don't get under cover, now, the bomb will not only kill them, but incinerate them, and then turn them into dust.After barely surviving the bomb blast, Ben learns that his companion is Taja Singh, owner of the Mojave Research Center, a private lab with Top Secret government contracts. She is also beyond gorgeous. The two have nothing in common, so who was the target, and who was in the wrong place at the wrong time?If anything illegal was going on the Center, Taja was confident that Roger Stillwell, the Center's day-to-day manager, would know something about it. But he is killed by an unknown assailant right in front of them. As an added wrinkle, Jim Carr, a friend of Ben's, is worried about his sister, Paula, an employee of the Center's marketing department. She hasn't been seen for several days, so he asks Ben if he can ask Taja to look into it. Could the big conspiracy be something ""normal"" like industrial espionage, or could it be something much more sinister? The end of the book finds Ben and Taja in a small private plane, several thousand feet in the air, with the culprit pointing an Uzi machine pistol at them.This is a first-rate piece of writing.

"Mesmer's Disciple, Edward Swanson, River Run Select, 2012This historical novel is about a man forced to confront evil beings directly from Hell.Alvord Rawn is a police captain in 1840's New York City. He is not afraid to fight violence with violence, until the day that he goes too far. Now an ex-police captain, he is traveling to St. Louis, the gateway to the frontier, on a private matter. Charles Deas is an up-and-coming artist, whose letters home to his mother, a member of New York's high society, have become increasingly dark and bizarre. She asks Rawn to find her son, and bring him back home.Deas has fallen under the influence of Count Abendroth, a practitioner of mesmerism. It's an early form of hypnosis, but, in Abendroth's hands, it is a lot more than just hypnosis. In looking around Abendroth's estate, Rawn sees a woman literally climbing the walls. He also hears hideous sounds, not of this earth, coming out of people's mouths. Abendroth's plan is to train disciples in mesmerism, and use them to control the state of Missouri, then control the neighboring states and territories, and then, who knows?Rawn gets his own taste of mesmerism (which has led to a population explosion in the psycho ward of the local jail). He is exposed to black, unspeakable beings who are just waiting for a chance to suck an innocent soul to Hell. Rawn fights his way out of it, but, to get to Abendroth, he has to get past Otto Volkmar, A Prussian giant and Abendroth's chief enforcer. Who wins the epic, no holds barred battle? What happens to Deas and Abendroth?This is an excellent novel. It feels historically accurate (Charles Deas was a real person who lived in St. Louis, and later went insane in New York City), and is very easy to read from start to finish. It also has plenty of action. This is highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1GCULGGILRW7F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0988537060#wasThisHelpful","R1GCULGGILRW7F","A25P31WA3F4040","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A25P31WA3F4040?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This short book, written by a teen for teens, shows how to get more out of life by setting and achieving goals.The goal could be something small, like earning enough money to buy a new mp3 player. The goal could be something bigger, like spending more time with your family, or improving your academic performance in your worst subject in school. It needs to be specific; vague goals like ""I want to get healthy"" or ""I want to win the lottery"" are not acceptable. It needs to have a time limit attached to it. It is totally OK to break a large goal into smaller, more manageable pieces. Write your goal on a piece of paper, and post it somewhere that you can see it every day. Putting it on paper is more permanent than leaving it in the back of your mind.When you write your goal on paper, put it in terms of what you want, and not what you don't want. For instance, if your goal is to lose 20 pounds before the start of summer vacation, write ""I want to lose 20 pounds before the start of summer vacation so that I can feel better about myself, and so that I can look hot at the beach."" Don't write ""I want to lose 20 pounds before the start of summer vacation because I don't want to be overweight anymore.""There will be days when you don't want to do anything toward your goal; you might have to dig deep to find the discipline and motivation to keep going. Consider doing just one goal-oriented thing per day. After a couple of weeks, you will be that much closer to your goal. When you reach it, be sure to celebrate, then start looking for your next goal.This book is short, very easy to read, and goes step-by-step through the whole process of setting goals. My only criticism is that it needs a trip, or another trip, to a proofreader or copy-editor. Get past that, and this book is well worth reading, for teens and adults.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R4MO3POOGPNG7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=145632764X#wasThisHelpful","R4MO3POOGPNG7","A25P31WA3F4040","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A25P31WA3F4040?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This novel is about a young boy who finds himself in a very strange situation.Owen's father committed suicide, and people around town whisper that Owen will follow in his father's footsteps. Mom has sunk into a fog of depression. In Owen's forest hideaway, there is a huge flash, and everything has changed. Geographically, Owen is in the same place, but everything, and everyone, that he knew is gone. A person called the Sub-Commandant tells Owen that a rag-tag group of humans called the Resisters are at war with ethereal beings called the Harsh. They have succeeded in causing time to run backwards. The intention of the Harsh is to go back to a time before humans, take over Earth, and turn it into a frozen wasteland.Some of the Resisters think that Owen is a spy for the Harsh, or, at minimum, a collaborator. Before he died, Owen's father played a significant part in causing the war. The only way to end the war, and to get time going in the right direction, is to bring a special piece called the Mortmain, to the Puissance, or Great Machine, far to the north. Then Owen must go down into the earth a great distance, and place the Mortmain in the right spot. Naturally, the Harsh will be waiting. Does Owen succeed? Does Own even survive? Is everything restored to the way it was?As you may have guessed, this is a young adult novel, and, as such, it is pretty good. There are good characters, and plenty of action. Older young people, and adults, will also like this book.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RB5TGJMIQRNG0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0375839100#wasThisHelpful","RB5TGJMIQRNG0","A25P31WA3F4040","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A25P31WA3F4040?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In a time of what seems to be a rise in global activism, this book presents a very different view.Things are not at the point of ""Greenpeace/Pepsico"" or ""Amnesty International (A Division of Unilever),"" but a person could be forgiven for thinking that such a day is coming. Major NGOs have entered into multi- million dollar partnerships with corporations like Shell, Coca-Cola or Walmart (they certainly have more global reach than the United Nations). These corporate partners are going to expect more business-like behavior out of what, twenty years ago, was a rag-tag bunch of activists. Groups like the Sierra Club or World Wildlife Fund now have multi-million dollar annual budgets, boards of directors, offices all over the world and hundreds (or thousands) of employees. A growing number of organizations are interested in ""corporate friendly"" activism.The consumerizing of activism is another growing trend. Purchase a certain item (usually made in China) and a portion of the money will be donated to some worthy cause. It helps the retailer to look good, and the worthy cause may get a small amount of extra money in their bank account. On the other hand, is more consumerism really the answer for world hunger or cancer research?When dealing with the police or city officials, taking the streets has never been easy. Post-9/11, new laws have been passed which make it nearly impossible. Almost any public protest or disruption of daily activity can be equated with terrorism. Facing a police force that dresses and acts like the military, courtesy of surplus equipment from the Defense Department, certainly doesn't help.In the middle of the 20th Century, there was much more of a social interest in getting together, like at the local union hall, to discuss the state of society. Those days are gone. Today, society is much more atomized. People are working two jobs, just to make ends meet, or they are spending their free time playing video games, so getting together to better society is low on the list of priorities.This is a gem of a book, though also rather disheartening. It is a huge eye-opener, and should be read by all parts of society, including activists and non-activists.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2PR6YZ8VY0T0S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0745669492#wasThisHelpful","R2PR6YZ8VY0T0S","A25P31WA3F4040","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A25P31WA3F4040?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This novel is the story of a young man named Sage Rojan. Even from birth, Sage's parents knew that he was ""different.""In the crib, it looked like he was talking to someone. He spoke in complete sentences at a very young age. As a child, Sage would suddenly fly into a rage, for no apparent reason. He was also incredibly smart.The reason was that Sage had a Presence, not an actual being, living inside him. The Presence needed a technologically advanced planet, so, with its ""help,"" Sage invented all sorts of techno-marvels. It started with a way to learn what was happening on the other side of the world. Imagine if America had technologically progressed from the light bulb to the Internet, within ten years. Sage becomes the most popular person in the world.The Presence thought nothing of taking over Sage's body, working it past the point of exhaustion, and letting Sage deal with the aftermath. He couldn't tell anyone about the Presence, because his popularity would vanish, and he would be thrown in the equivalent of a mental hospital. His popularity did vanish, because the Presence's single-minded determination turned Sage into a mean, rotten person.In space, Sage is forced to build a thing which goes very wrong. It starts moving toward Sage's planet, and will destroy the planet if it reaches it. An attempt to tow it out of the way is a failure. A plan to teleport the whole population to another world never gets going. The only possibility is for Sage to plead his case before The Artisan, the being which created the universe. Does he succeed? Does The Artisan help Sage get rid of the Presence, once and for all?The story is very easy to read, and does a fine job at showing a society in technological fast-forward. From start to finish, it is very much worth reading.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1I9DE4I0IOJEL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1894063988#wasThisHelpful","R1I9DE4I0IOJEL","A25P31WA3F4040","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A25P31WA3F4040?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In part one of a series, in India, a Buddhist holy man dies of old age, but not really. His spirit stays around, somewhere between life and death. He is able to inhabit, and speak through, any being that he wishes. Spirit's press conference, via a talking German Shepherd, is a worldwide sensation.In present-day Greece, Spirit urges Konstantino, through his parrot, Hook, to do a really heartbreaking thing concerning Myrna, his long-time girlfriend (no, he doesn't kill her). He is convinced, through mental images supplied by Spirit, that it really is for the good of mankind. Myrna is not told, intentionally, but Konstantino's emotional anguish is very severe. When ""it"" happens in Vienna, Konstantino begins to start to understand.Everything involves the holy man being born to Myrna, and leading mankind to new era of peace and happiness. Rahul, one of his followers is brought in and will be able to tell if the holy man has made it into the soul of Myrna's child.The CIA gets interested. Many years before, they kidnapped a brilliant scientist, and have kept him isolated ever since. It's for a good reason; his invention would totally revolutionize the world. His only companion has been a parrot, which is how his invention got to ""the group"" (it's more than just Myrna and Konstantino). They have been quietly amassing huge amounts of money, to bring the invention into reality. Despite their very diligent precautions, the government is closing in. Does everyone survive? Does the holy man make it into the soul of Myrna's child?This is an intriguing idea that almost makes it to the level of ""excellent."" There is nothing specifically wrong with this book, just a feeling of ""almost, but not quite.""","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3ROQJQJEH7BTC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1300040416#wasThisHelpful","R3ROQJQJEH7BTC","A25P31WA3F4040","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A25P31WA3F4040?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book gives a very different view of the world of college tuition.It's rare when any college's annual tuition increase is at or below the rate of inflation (usually they are far above the inflation rate). Colleges know that parents are a captive audience, that they will pay whatever the college decides.A major culprit is the yearly college listing published by US News and World Report. Among the things they measure is college expenditures, so any thought of cutting spending is forbidden. Heads will roll at a college if it drops in the ratings. Is there any real difference in the quality of education between a Top Ten and a Top Fifty school?Back at school, the academic requirement that professors must ""publish or perish"" needs to stop. Most academics will make no real contribution to their field, but they still require the latest in (very expensive) equipment to do their ""research."" If they do get published, it will be in some obscure journal that no one reads, and that exists only to publish papers. Professors should be hired to just teach.A large number of clubs or other activities at a school shows that the academic part is not enough to hold a student's attention. Are parents shelling out tens of thousands of dollars a year so their children can get an education or be involved in the Chess Club or Drama Society? There are colleges that focus just on academics, and they are surviving quite nicely. When a wealthy benefactor gives money for a new library or sports building, is the gift enough to cover the entire cost of construction, or is it just enough to start construction, with the school, and the parents paying the rest of the cost?The author also has nothing good to say about multiculturalism. All points of view, even those that hate America, are to be celebrated, while the achievements of white Americans are denigrated or marginalized. At Hamilton College, a private ""elite"" school in New York where the author spends most of the book, all of the fraternities were arbitrarily abolished, in the name of ""diversity"". A person from the outside was chosen to teach a course in the school's brand-new Gender Studies Center. This person just happened to have spent twenty years in prison as part of the Weather Underground. A public outcry forced the canceling of the teaching offer.This is a very eye-opening book. Read it, and then look at your local college. You might be surprised at what you suddenly see in your own backyard.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1AIXIHVBIIMXL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0971349827#wasThisHelpful","R1AIXIHVBIIMXL","A25P31WA3F4040","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A25P31WA3F4040?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Who was Paul Robeson? He was a lot more than just the singer of ""Ol' Man River.""A native of Princeton, NJ, Robeson received a four-year athletic scholarship to Rutgers College. He was twice named All-American in football, and also played basketball, baseball and track. Graduating as class Valedictorian (an member of Phi Beta Kappa), Robeson attended, and graduated from, Columbia Law School. His attempt at a legal career did not go well. Robeson continued to play semi-pro football on the weekends, and tried his luck as a stage actor.He became a huge star on the stage, including almost 300 performances as Shakespeare's Othello. Robeson also became a world-famous concert singer. He couldn't help but notice that during trips to Europe, especially the Soviet Union, he was treated much better than he had ever been treated in America. From the 1920's through the 1940's, Robeson made about a dozen films, including a couple of silent films. On the positive side, audiences could actually see a strong, intelligent black man in the lead role. On the negative side, Robeson's performance was usually the best part of the film. It was otherwise filled with clownish stereotypes about blacks. In frustration, Robeson walked away from Hollywood.Robeson was not afraid to speak out on political issues, ranging from the Spanish Civil War of the 1930's, to racism in America, to opposition to the Vietnam War. Such activities made him a victim of the 1950's Blacklist, along with having his passport seized. This, plus his wife's diagnosis of terminal cancer, brought on a huge bout of depression. When he was next allowed to travel overseas, the ""magic"" was gone. There was time in a sanitarium, and a suicide attempt. For the last dozen or so years of his life, he lived quietly with his sister in Philadelphia, and saw very few people.This is a wonderful book. Robeson's erasure from 20th century history should be on the level of a national embarrassment. This book will start to correct it. It is very highly recommended for everyone.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1VSI8R8OV2OUR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1934389811#wasThisHelpful","R1VSI8R8OV2OUR","A25P31WA3F4040","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A25P31WA3F4040?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the third in a series of novels about several people who learn that they are the offspring of various ancient gods of antiquity. They also have unique abilities to help them fight non-human evil.Lisa Mikoto (daughter of the Japanese god Izanagi) travels to a Japan in crisis. An unknown force has put a sort of permanent black cloud over the whole country, cutting Japan off from the sun. Electric power plants have been attacked, leaving electricity sporadic over the whole country. The famous Tokyo nightlife is dead. Anyone who can leave Japan, by any route, is doing so. Those who remain do not go out after sunset, because of carnivorous flying creatures looking for a meal.Lisa's initial task is to look for a young woman from Texas who vanished, without a trace, several years previously. She is rescued from a sex slavery ring, and put on a plane back to America. The other five members of the group fly to Japan, and join Lisa to find the cause of the black cloud. Many evil creatures are thrown in their way to stop them, or, at least, to slow them down.A Shinto ceremony will encourage Lisa's sister, the sun goddess Amaterasu, to bring back the sun. An important part of the ceremony is the use of three very old mirrors, from Japanese folklore. The group has to travel considerable distances to get them. Naturally, the mirrors are not exactly in plain sight, just waiting to be found. This leads to more battles with inhuman creatures, including goblins and a giant spider. A major complication in the ceremony happens when the Shinto priest is murdered by the ""bad guy"" before he can finish. Does the sun return to Japan? Do all members of the group survive?It's rare when the first three novels in any series are all excellent, but this author has done it. It has plenty of action, and the reader will learn more than they ever wanted to know about Japanese folklore. The reader will not go wrong with this book.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1CL7NL1B9R7QC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1478708417#wasThisHelpful","R1CL7NL1B9R7QC","A25P31WA3F4040","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A25P31WA3F4040?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This novel is about a man who wakes up in a strange, neo-futuristic world, after his murder.Paul Donner is an NYPD detective who is out for the evening with his wife. They walk in on a bodega robbery, and are killed. He wakes up, forty years later, due to something called the Shift. Said to be the side effect of a retroviral attack, it re-animates the DNA of dead people, causing them to come to life. No, they don't turn into zombies, but they do age younger (an adult becomes a teenager, who becomes a child, then an infant, and ends as a hunk of protoplasm). Such reborn people, or ""reebs,"" are considered third-class citizens, so Donner has to investigate his murder on his own.A protective blister, or dome, is being built over New York City to keep the Shift ""virus"" (for lack of a better term) from infecting the rest of America. Manhattan has reverted to the 1930's, the time of Dashiell Hammett and the Studebaker. Harlem has gone back to the time of the Harlem Renaissance, and Greenwich Village is now in the 1960's hippie era. As Donner looks into his murder, he discovers some interesting things, like the person accused of killing him was intentionally released, without being charged. The conspiracy gets bigger and bigger, with Donner and his wife at the center. It involves the existence of an actual immortality serum, and a plan to kill millions of people in a very public, and gruesome, way, to solidify social control over the Big Apple.This book works on a number of levels. It works really well as a regular detective story. It also works for those who liked the film ""Blade Runner."" It's well done from start to finish, and the twists and turns will keep the reader guessing. Here is a first-rate piece of writing.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3CVZ3GECAM9D4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1597803154#wasThisHelpful","R3CVZ3GECAM9D4","A25P31WA3F4040","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A25P31WA3F4040?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"There are many ways to tell the early history of America (some of them work better than others). In this book, a grandfather tells the story to his grandchildren.Over the course of a year, ""Gomps"" tells his grandchildren, nine-year-old Carter and eleven-year-old Hannah, the story of America. He starts with the voyage of the Mayflower and the Jamestown Settlement. The early settlements barely survived, but when they became established, nobility from all over Europe wanted a piece of the New World. In the 1630's, Connecticut was the first colony to have a written constitution, called ""The Fundamental Orders.""The reader will learn about Molly Pitcher, the War of Jenkins' Ear, the Indian Prophecy, the day the British shot themselves in the foot, the Sons of Liberty and the Hundred-Year Lawsuit. The reader will also meet the Super Six, which included Thomas Jefferson, John Adams and Benjamin Franklin. Gomps also explains how, during the Revolutionary War, General George Washington got little or no financial help from the Continental Congress.Start with ""excellent"" and go on from there; that's how good this book really is.

"For many non-profit organizations, grants are a very lucrative source of income. How does one get their modest non-profit noticed by all those corporations and foundations?It is going to take a lot of time and research. Visit the website of your local bank or credit union. Visit the websites of major retailers in your area. They are always looking for opportunities for good public relations. For a new non-profit, applying for a grant from the federal government might be reaching a little high, so try your state government first (the book provides websites to visit).Some foundations might restrict their giving to, for instance, a certain geographic area, or groups run by women, or veterans, or minorities. If the grant is for a specific purpose, make sure that your group can handle it; don't apply for everything. Read the requirements, usually called the RFP, or Request for Proposal, thoroughly; then read it again. Some grantors will get very particular about what should be in the grant proposal, and how long each part should be. Follow those directions exactly. You don't want an otherwise first-rate grant proposal to be rejected simply because you didn't follow directions.How does one get the grantor to approve the proposal? Be concise, but tell a compelling story. Mention other grants that you have received in the past. Include your proposed budget. How will your group fulfill the need better than any other group? In short, force the grantor to choose your group. If your proposal is rejected, it's not the end of the world. Sometimes the grantor will explain why they rejected it. Therefore, you will be that much more prepared next time.This book is short, it gets right to the point, and it's very easy to read. For any person, or any group, who is new to the grants world, here is a good place to start.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RAJH8YCAGESNS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1494770636#wasThisHelpful","RAJH8YCAGESNS","A25P31WA3F4040","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A25P31WA3F4040?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is another novel about Victoria Custer, your average citizen of the early 20th century who really is not so average.On the outside, Victoria, who now calls herself Vic Challenger, likes to wear pink and has a big interest in cloches (women's hats). On the inside, she has an avatar that is a part of her. It's name is Nat-ul, a female cave dweller who lived about 100,000 years ago. Because of her presence, Vic has acquired a desire, or a wish, to go to places that even the most experienced male adventurers would hesitate to visit. She is searching for the modern incarnation of Nu, her lover from all those centuries ago.In this book, Vic, and her friend, Lin Li, travel to Mongolia. On the boat ride across the Pacific, they assist in a murder investigation. Upon reaching China, they meet up with Chu, whose family lives in an isolated bit of Mongolia. These are tough times for Mongolia, with the Chinese on one side and the Russians on the other, and criminals from either side ready to attack at any time.The trio narrowly escape being eaten by giant worms that live under the sand. If the mouths full of sharp teeth (like a lamprey) don't get you, then the liquid they spew, that can dissolve flesh and bone in seconds, will. Later, they come under attack by a band of Russian pirates. They get some unexpected help from more of the giant worms. Chu shows them the entrance to a buried city that really is full of treasure.

"This book is all about a very easy weight loss program. It consists of only two rules.Greatly reduce, or eliminate, your consumption of refined sugar. Greatly increase your consumption of fiber. That's all. The author strongly believes that most ""diets"" are much too complicated. He subscribes to the MISS principle (Make It Short and Simple).When digested, refined sugar, is stored in the body as body fat. Among the potential, and reported, side effects are: it may lead to childhood and adult obesity; it may increase your risk of stroke, heart attack and vascular disease; it may lead to Type 2 diabetes in children and adults; obesity will increase the risk of cancer, and it may double the risk of developing dementia or Alzheimer's Disease.Sugar substitutes, like saccharin and aspartame, are much less unhealthy than is refined sugar. A popular weight loss idea is to do a colon cleanse. Getting rid of that waste material will drop your weight by several pounds. Don't do it. The colon is supposed to have waste material in it. A cleaned-out colon can lead to very bad things physically.The human body is over 60 percent water, so drinking several glasses a day is a very good thing. Fast food restaurants are increasingly adding healthy items to their menus. Another side effect of excess refined sugar is that it causes the body to produce more insulin, which leads to the production of more cholesterol. The book also includes a list of low-sugar and high-fiber foods, and those foods that are to be totally avoided.Just two rules: how much easier can it get? This book is short, very easy to read, and it has a lot to say.

"Everyone has heard of Big Data; huge amounts of information, usually involving computers or the Internet. Is there a cultural or historical equivalent of Big Data?Yes, and it comes from Google's intention to digitize all the world's books (or, at least, a significant portion of them). The authors created an algorithm that would search all those books for certain words. On a chart, it will show, for instance, how many times, per million words, the name ""Abraham Lincoln"" was used, or ""World War II."" It can also be used to compare the historical use of pairs of words, like Satan/Santa, evolution/DNA, men/women, war/peace, tea/coffee or old school/new school. It can be found at books.google.com/ngrams (""Possibly the greatest time-waster in the history of the Internet."" - Mother Jones magazine). Google needed convincing that this was a good idea, that it would not open them up to millions of copyright infringement lawsuits.Using this algorithm, it is possible to look at things like historical attempts at censorship. It can range from Nazi attempts to remove Jewish artists like Marc Chagall from the German cultural landscape, to the 1950's Hollywood Blacklist. A person can also look at how long a certain word or phrase stays in the cultural memory. For instance, ""Korean war"" has a huge jump in usage in the 1960's, then an equally huge drop in usage soon after, down to its present level of almost nothing.The book also looks at the evolution of the English language. If we have pairs of words like drive/drove, what happened to thrive/throve? Also, what happened to words like burnt, learnt and dwelt? It all has to do with irregular verbs, which change over time.This is a fascinating book, but it will take some effort on the part of the reader. It's very well done, and it gives the reader the chance to do their own historical research.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R23XRN12RWTPTW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1594487456#wasThisHelpful","R23XRN12RWTPTW","A25P31WA3F4040","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A25P31WA3F4040?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Based on Fortune Magazine's ""40 Under 40"" column, this book gives short profiles of some of the biggest names in American business, and how they got there.Of course, the people that one would expect to see in any such book are here, including Marissa Mayer, Elon Musk, Tony Hsieh, and Larry Page and Sergey Brin. Also included are the CEO's of Rent The Runway, TOMS Shoes and Change.org, senior executives from Heineken and ArcelorMittal (one of the biggest steel producers in the world), and Lebron James.It is very acceptable to want to take on Goliath (the dominant company in your field). It is just as acceptable to concentrate on doing one thing really well. These days, it seems to be fashionable to jump from one company to another during your career, never spending more than a couple of years in one place. There is absolutely nothing wrong with spending your career at one company.Some people are serial entrepreneurs. They thrive on getting a company established, or taking it public. Once that happens, they go one to the next one; they are less interested in actually running the company. What do you do after making a large, public blunder? Do you stay at the same company, withdraw from the public eye, and work to rebuild your image? Do you move to another company, and work to rebuild your image? Find something that you are passionate about, something that gets you up in the morning. It may be possible to find, or create, your dream job in that area, no matter how un-high tech it may be.If they can do it, why can't you? This is a very inspiring group of portraits of today's business leaders. Each portrait is only a few pages long, so they are also easy to read. This is well worth reading for anyone in business, whether large, small or start-up.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1P56AMGL15QC3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1603209573#wasThisHelpful","R1P56AMGL15QC3","A25P31WA3F4040","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A25P31WA3F4040?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Like it or not, the streaming of movies and music is becoming an increasingly large portion of all internet traffic. This book gives the details.Why shouldn't a person be able to pay a few dollars to stream a movie at home, when going to the theater or buying the DVD costs a lot more? At the theater, does the projectionist load a film canister on a 35mm projector and turn it on? Increasingly, the answer is no. The majority of theaters have gone to all-digital systems. The movie is downloaded from the distributor, along with an electronic code. That code can be good for just one showing, on one specific day. If the right code is not available, or if it does not work properly, then there is no showing.Fewer and fewer movies are being shot on actual film, because fewer and fewer theaters have film projectors. Unless there is an art house cinema nearby, any watching of older, or less well known, films, on actual film, is pretty much impossible. When is the last time that an older or obscure film was available at the local multi-theater megaplex? If whoever has a film copy of that older, obscure film, does not think it is lucrative enough to put it on DVD, there is little that can be done about it. Soon, the only way to watch films of any kind, will be through on-line streaming. Depending on your point of view, this is either that natural progression of technology, or it's the end of the world.What Netflix is doing to the movie business, Apple is doing to the music business, and Amazon is doing to book publishing. Amazon is now selling more Kindle copies of books than paper copies. Facebook is little more than a way to suck up people's personal information, and sell it to advertisers (Google Glass, plus new facial recognition technology, will make that much easier). Facebook has created over 80 million fake accounts. The hope is that the author, for instance, will see their account already set up, and decide to use it. For that reason, the author says that he will never post on Facebook.This is a very interesting book. For some, it may be common knowledge, but I learned a lot from it. It's non-technical, and very easy to read. It's also very much worth checking out.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2IOUXJU4IKTZ5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0813142199#wasThisHelpful","R2IOUXJU4IKTZ5","A25P31WA3F4040","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A25P31WA3F4040?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This present-day murder mystery is about a small town being menaced by a serial killer, soon after putting another serial killer in jail.Detective Max Larkin of the Rockton Police Department has just returned to work after taking a mandated psychological leave. Larkin and Jesse, his partner, are investigating a double homicide. After a third murder, suspicion falls on Liam, the hot-headed estranged husband of one of the victims. The circumstantial evidence is pretty strong, but it's not enough to force a confession. Larkin, whose instincts about a person's guilt or innocence are usually very good, is convinced that Liam is innocent. Jesse is just as convinced of his guilt.After Liam goes to jail, there is another dead body. Suspicion points in a totally different direction, toward someone a lot closer to Max and Jesse. After that possibility is no longer a possibility, another person is found dead. Can Max and Jesse stop the killer before Max becomes the next victim?This one is really good. It feels realistic, and it has lots of twists and turns. The reader will be kept guessing until the last few pages. It is very much worth reading.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 28, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3PK4H23NZ3JNX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1492166472#wasThisHelpful","R3PK4H23NZ3JNX","A25P31WA3F4040","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A25P31WA3F4040?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Why are some people able to permanently give up drugs or alcohol, and start to turn their lives around, and some people just can't do it? Are those people destined to be alcoholics or junkies forever?You, the addict, have to want to change; today, and tomorrow, and the next day. There will be setbacks and relapses. Are you going to give up because you fell ""off the wagon"" once, or are you going to re-focus your efforts to never let it happen again? Don't be afraid to ask for help. If your friends and family see you making an honest effort to change, they might be willing to meet you halfway.There are many things that you, the addict, need to stop doing, now. First and foremost, stay away from your drinking or drugs buddies. Stop being so self-centered. Denying that you have a problem, when everyone around thinks otherwise, helps no one. Drop the ""My way or the highway"" attitude. Stop lying to others. You are responsible for your actions, and no one else. The world is not out to get you.Anger, depression and anxiety are normal human feelings. The way a person deals with those feelings is what, figuratively, separates the men from the boys (or the women from the girls). Once you are clean, what do you want to do with your life? Come up with some life goals. Learn to follow directions, and honestly share your feelings. Last but not least, learn to recognize the situations that could lead you back to using drugs or alcohol.This is general book, intended to start a person on the road to sobriety, and not so much a detailed, everything-you-need-to-know book. The chapters are short, and it is very easy to read. It is highly recommended for everyone, including addicts and those whose family member is an addict.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 26, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1F4BKUR5WDSMD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0989569810#wasThisHelpful","R1F4BKUR5WDSMD","A25P31WA3F4040","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A25P31WA3F4040?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""High cholesterol and saturated fat are the major causes of heart disease."" That statement has been a medical article of faith for many years. According to the authors of this book, it is also very wrong.There are several different types of ""good"" and ""bad"" cholesterol (some ""good"" cholesterol is bad for the body, and some ""bad"" cholesterol is good for the body), so a single number for good and bad cholesterol each is rather worthless. People with really low cholesterol numbers can easily get heart disease, and those with really high cholesterol numbers can live their entire lives without one bit of heart disease. Why do some native cultures, who practically live on saturated fat, have little or no heart disease?The real cause of heart disease is chronic inflammation, which comes from damage caused by free radicals (the book explains everything). Sugar is much more harmful to your heart than fat. It contributes to inflammation in the walls of your arteries. It increases the amount of insulin in your blood, which increases cholesterol and raises your blood pressure. It also raises your level of triglycerides, which is a much better indicator of heart disease than cholesterol.What is the problem with statin drugs, the usual treatment for heart disease? Their benefits have been extremely exaggerated. The brain depends on cholesterol to function normally. A common (but under-reported) side effect of statin drugs is sexual dysfunction. Most doctors dismiss complaints of side effects from statin drugs, and don't report them to the FDA. The only people who should take statin drugs are middle-age men with documented coronary artery disease.The book mentions tests that are much better indicators than cholesterol of heart problems. Ask your doctor to order them. Get rid of sugar, soda, processed carbohydrates and trans fats from your diet. Eat more vegetables, berries, nuts, beans and dark chocolate. If you can add only one supplement to your diet, make it Coenzyme Q10.This book easily reaches the level of Must read, especially for anyone on a statin drug. It is an eye-opener that will give the reader plenty to discuss with their doctor at their next appointment.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 21, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R192B4DIUBOHFO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1592335217#wasThisHelpful","R192B4DIUBOHFO","A25P31WA3F4040","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A25P31WA3F4040?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Most science fiction stories are about tall, square-jawed adventurers exploring the galaxy and singlehandedly vanquishing the alien foe. What about the people who perform the unexciting ""blue collar"" jobs that make the voyages possible?A being, of indeterminate gender, maintains a ship's waste treatment system. A female asteroid miner has a unique companion. It is an alien-constructed being, made from human sperm. It looks exactly like a human, but, on the inside, there is no mind or personality. Imagine an episode of the TV show ""The Deadliest Catch"" moved to the asteroid belt.On Titan, a human miner is caught in the conveyor belt that carries the pieces of rock out of the mine, and deposits them in a giant pile, in open vacuum. A trio of women spens their days walking on top of a domed city, patching up holes and cracks in the dome. Another story takes place on an Earth that has run out of energy. The only working motor vehicles are those that people build themselves. There is also a news story about the hazards involved in being part of the crew building a space station in orbit.This is a strong, well done group of stories about a not-well-known part of society.

"June is your average resident of the planet Pren. It's a beautiful place, with colorful trees and flowers, and birds who tweet Mozart. According to June, it's also really boring. Out of frustration, she fashions something called a pencil out of a piece of coal, and sits down with lots of paper, to write stories of a whole new world. The place is called Earth.June learns that she is a Writer, with the ability to Write an entire world into existence. One Earth, June meets a young artist named Jackson. He has a hard time believing her story; he has an even harder time believing that he has related ""abilities"" of his own. As a Writer, the intention is that June create a Writer for Earth, someone who, out of frustration and boredom, will Write a whole new world into being.Meantime, Vivien is the Master Writer. Her son, Victor, is a manipulative little you-know-what who thinks that he ""deserves"" to be the next Master Writer. He also desperately wants to be reWritten (reborn). It is used only in cases of extreme emergency. In her Will, Vivien makes June the next Master Writer, and practically begs her to never, ever reWrite Victor. She is afraid that it will magnify his negative qualities (of which he has many). When told that the answer is No, Victor does not take it well. He spends weeks and weeks plotting the ""perfect"" way to force June to reWrite him. Does it work? Does Earth get unWritten out of existence (always a possibility)?This one is surprisingly good. The author does a fine job from start to finish. She is only 16 years old (!), but writes like someone older.

"American business is supposed to be a tough, ultra-competitive arena where only the strong survive, and nice guys get trampled, right? According to this book, that is not totally true.This book looks at three different kinds of people. Takers claim as much value for themselves as possible. If, for instance, they are the CEO, they are the sort of person who has a full page picture of themselves in the company's annual report, where most other CEO's will have a much smaller picture in their annual report. Takers are very deferential to superiors, and very mean and inconsiderate to subordinates. They use words like I, me and mine, as if they single-handedly caused their company to have a profitable year.Matchers aim to trade value evenly, as if they want to keep their spiritual inbox and outbox equal. Givers contribute to others without expecting anything in return.The giving could involve something like arranging a business introduction, or mentoring a younger employee. There is a fine line between being a giver and a doormat; a giver must also make sure that their business duties are not being ignored. In the short term, takers may do better than givers, but, in the long term, a giver's networking, collaboration and leadership skills will come to the forefront. A giver uses words like we, us and ours.How can a person increase their giving capacity? Take a test to see just how much of a giver you really are. Start a reciprocity ring at work. A group of employees meet weekly to make requests of each other. The intention is that everyone do what they can to fulfill those requests. It may seem a bit silly, but someone in your circle may know someone who knows someone who can fulfill your request. Publicly recognize givers at work. If you would rather give on your own, start a Personal Generosity Experiment.This is a very thought-provoking book, which shows that nice people can finish first. The average CEO, or division head, could do a lot worse than read this book, and start to implement its recommendations.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 21, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2O1NAUDH7TVXL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0670026557#wasThisHelpful","R2O1NAUDH7TVXL","A25P31WA3F4040","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A25P31WA3F4040?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is part 2 of a series about a group of average humans who are actually offspring of the gods of antiquity. It is not just Greek gods, but also Norse, Japanese and Aztec gods, who are alive and well, and mating with present-day humans.In this book, the group of six has been given three different tasks, forcing them to split up. Jane and Ryan head into the Nevada desert, looking for a drug factory that is creating a very powerful and very addictive drug. It happens to look and taste exactly like regular tap water.After several days of hiking, they find the drug factory (by being taken prisoner). Among the other prisoners are several women who are used in all sorts of unspeakable ways, and members of a US Army unit who were ambushed while on a training exercise. They are guarded by a number of dark elves, and members of the Army unit who were induced to go over to the ""dark side."" It is run by Andre Wittenburg, the local crime boss, who knows exactly what Jane and Ryan really are.To call conditions ""brutal"" is a huge understatement. Jane and Ryan free the other prisoners, and destroy the camp. They have to fight a mythical creature or two along the way. After a few days to recover, the six are back together and off to their next challenge. The tears of Freya (Norse goddess and Jane's mother) were encased in amber a millennia ago. It is very important that they not fall into the wrong hands. The group heads to a very restricted part of the Atlantic Ocean, just off the Florida Keys. It's the sort of place that no sane ship's captain would ever visit. There they meet another couple of mythical creatures (who really are not so mythical).Most times, literary sequels are not as good as the previous book. That is not true in this case. If anything, this book is better than Volume 1, because the reader gets more of the back story. This is very much worth reading.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 21, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2UJ7EJPUSAUQW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1432788965#wasThisHelpful","R2UJ7EJPUSAUQW","A25P31WA3F4040","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A25P31WA3F4040?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Digital technology and the Internet have changed American business from top to bottom (what else is new?). What can you, or your company, do to survive in this new landscape? This book gives some answers.If your company doesn't already have a social media presence, forget about hiring some college kids to create one, while the rest of the company continues with its 20th century mentality. The entire company has to embrace social media, starting with the CEO. Most companies assume that they know who their customers are. Do some research, and find out for sure.There are ways to measure, for instance, who visits your website, what pages they click on, and how long they stay. If your company is not already up to its eyeballs in analyzing such data, you are missing out on a lot of potentially useful information.When you are talking to your customers, ask them how they stay connected. It's not a case of web or mobile or tablets being most important, but whatever screen the customer is using now. How can you make your customer's lives easier?This book also looks at how individuals can thrive in this new landscape. It is very rare for a person to, for instance, grow up wanting to get into marketing, and then spend their entire career in marketing. It's even more unlikely for it to happen at one company. You career path is going to resemble a squiggly line. Embrace the squiggle.As much as possible, get rid of cubicles and internal walls at your company. Encourage collaboration between different parts of your company. Such collaboration may create the new must have ""killer app."" The office itself is becoming less of a requirement, as it is now possible for a person's ""office"" to be anywhere they can use their laptop, tablet or smart phone.Many books have been written about the new digital world.

"This book is about a world totally changed by genetic engineering.GeneTech is, by far, the biggest company in the world. Human youth treatments, that make people look younger than they really are, are common. The world of agriculture harvesting has been turned upside down by XenoMats. Imagine genetically-created, dwarf size, green gorillas with tentacles instead of arms that are bred to pick produce in the fields. Commercial buildings are no longer built with steel and concrete. They are made of genetically created material based on the bones of this animal or the shell of that animal.Amade Bertrand is a New York Times reporter who has gotten a tip about strange happenings at GeneTech. She wonders why there has never, ever been a negative story about GeneTech in the press. It is because Whitfield Gray, GeneTech's head of PR, has been given, by GeneTech, a genetically-enhanced ability to bend anyone to his will, to make anyone do anything he wants. Is the fact that Amade is falling in love with him real or coerced?For years, the Church of Traditional Biblical Values has been very vocal in its opposition to genetic engineering in general. A very secret plan is hatched to get a dose of the influence drug, and inject it in the Leader of the Church. His influence will turn America back on the path toward God. It is led by Colonel Ron Savage, who goes up against general Sutherland, GeneTech's Head of Security. The two are ex-military, and have a long and unpleasant history together. A full-blown military assaultis unleashed against a complex of buildings that are full of the latest in high-tech and genetically engineered safeguards.The author does a very good job at making the characters not all bad or all good. There is no well-defined ""good guy"" or ""bad guy."" This story takes place only a few decades from now, it's very plausible, and more than a little spooky.

"Last of a trilogy, this book is about a new age on Earth with the coming of the Mayan Sixth World. This time, something is really going to happen.Several years previously, Amy Magee, archaeologist and expert on Mayan hieroglyphics, discovered some real Mayan pyramids that were buried. . . in central California. It seems that the Spanish wiped out only some of the Mayan race several hundred years ago; they did not wipe out the entire race.Today, Mayan workmen are busy unearthing the new Mayan city of Ixabal, getting ready for the coronation of the new King. Amy has a major part in the ceremony, as the Bringer of the Sixth World. Everything has been kept very quiet, so that the public does not know what is happening. The exception is a nosy newspaper reporter, who has been asking questions.A major complication happens when Will, a major figure in what is to come, gets conked on the head during a cavern cave-in, and loses a large chunk of his recent memory. That includes the memory of just what he is supposed to say and do in a couple of weeks. Candis, Will's sister, knows and accepts her part in the coming ceremony (think ""human sacrifice""). Leo, her boyfriend, most assuredly does not agree. He comes up with a bold plan for the both of them to flee to someplace where they will never be found. Rumors of a huge treasure attract the attention of several international bad guys. Meantime, Amy races to interpret an ancient Mayan book which may have a very different interpretation of the start of the Sixth World.As with most trilogies, reading the first two books first is a good idea. It's also a good idea because this book, and the whole trilogy, is that good.

"This near future science fiction story is about a young man who suddenly finds himself in a very dangerous situation.Steve Kowalski is a teenaged crew member on the ""Phoenix,"" an interplanetary space ship that is the flagship of the International Space Alliance. He is spending a few days leave in Miami, helping to design a new star drive. Next thing he knows, Steve finds himself in a tiny jail cell in a very special place called Juno Colony. It's on the far side of the Moon, and does not recognize ISA authority. The ""special"" part is that not only do women rule the colony, but men have no rights at all; they are lower than slaves. There are some men who, emotionally, want to be treated like that; Steve is not one of them.Learning of Steve's plight, the rest of the crew is not going to just leave him there. A bold and daring plan is conceived, which involves several crew members visiting Juno dressed and acting like dominatrices (plural of ""dominatrix"") and their slaves. Steve was forced to sign papers making him the property of an arrogant, manipulative little you-know-what named Gianna, who is not going to give him up very easily. The male members are forced to enter the colony's gladiatorial games. Officially, the contests are not to the death, but if a contestant dies in the ring; oh, well. As an added complication, the losing male slave automatically becomes the property of the winner's Mistress. To make things look as legitimate as possible, the male members of the rescue mission signed the same ownership papers. Is Steve saved from a lifetime of slavery? Do all the members of the rescue mission make it out in one piece?This one is surprisingly good. There is one mild bit of S&M, and no actual sex. What it does have is heart, emotion and good writing.

"Here is a novel of intrigue set mostly on the Moon.The operation of a processing plant to mine Helium-3 from the Moon was supposed to be totally automated. That didn't work, so it was not long before a casino was built for the Lunar residents and tourists. It is run by the Cherokee Nation of North Carolina. Annie Taylor is there to investigate the disappearance of a large amount of money.A solar storm forces her to take shelter with Clint Baker and his family. They found a large cavern, sealed it up. pumped in air and brought seeds and animal embryos from Earth. They now have their own Texas cattle ranch (groups from other countries take over other caverns). Annie finds herself falling in love with Clint and the ranch. She heads back to Earth upon learning that Maddie, her sister, has been murdered.Annie knows of a few people in the Cherokee community who are high on the list of suspects, the sort for whom the term ""human scum"" is too generous. They have fled to the Moon, where Earth law cannot touch them. Before her return to the Moon, Annie is contacted by a Bahraini prince, whom the UN has appointed as Governor of the Moon. He offers Annie the position of Lieutenant Governor. The UN decided a long time ago, that there was to be no land ownership on the Moon. If a person or corporation wants to sign a lease, go right ahead, but there will be no landlords charging exorbitant amounts of money for industrial or living space. It also means that Annie will spend the rest of her life on the Moon.After several continuous months on the Moon, the human body can no longer tolerate Earth's gravity. Does Annie bring her sister's murderer to justice? Does she re-kindle her romance with Clint?On the positive side, this book has some interesting ideas about Man's expansion into the Solar System (money will be a major factor).

"This book shows how to look at your life through astrology. It also explores how famous people recognized their abilities and how those abilities were used.The first thing a person must do is to have their natal chart created. It's much more specific than the average newspaper horoscope, in that it looks at the position of the planets at the exact date, time and place of your birth. It will help identify major obstacles in your life. The position of Saturn at the time of birth means a lot. The other planets of the solar system correspond to areas of your personality (any angles or connections between them can be very good, or very bad).The author spends much of the book with astrological biographies of famous people, ranging from Elizabeth I to Albert Einstein to Lady Gaga. Read about their childhood challenges, and perhaps they will sound very familiar. After each negative part of their personality, the author lists ways that the reader can overcome such obstacles.Here are some examples. If your Sun opposes Neptune, maybe one or both of your parents demeaned you when you were younger (like Angelina Jolie). Find someone you can trust who can help you decide if your goals make sense. If your Mercury is square with Uranus (like Lady Gaga), you have a know-it-all attitude with a short attention span. Ask yourself why are you rebelling; is it just to challenge authority? If your Sun opposes Jupiter, you tend to promise more than you can deliver (like Nostradamus). You need to learn your limitations and develop some self-control. If your Mercury opposes Pluto, you tend to obsess about everything (like Pablo Picasso). Think before you speak, especially when you feel emotional.This is a very interesting book, and will help people, both astrology believers and skeptics, make their way through life. I admit to being an astrology skeptic, but I am always ready to change my mind.

"Grilled bacon.  Sounds great, right?  Pretty good, but let's go through some practicals1) The basic design is practical.  The grease traps on each side collect the grease and prevent it from dripping onto the flame and causing flare-ups.  They are large enough that even with a lot of bacon on the rack, they do the job.  So, you can grill the bacon for your bacon cheeseburger right alongside your burgers.2) Will you notice the taste?  On a bacon cheeseburger, not much.  The bacon is already smoked in all likelihood, so if you put it on grilled burgers, it isn't that much smokier.  It does give you very nicely crispy bacon, though, and eaten alone, you can taste the additional smoke, as long as you use charcoal rather than gas, and if you are using gas, why are you bothering anyway?3) The size of the rack is a practical constraint.  Folded out, it is basically 10-inch-by-10-inch square, which takes up a lot of space on my circular webber grill.  Keep in mind also that you don't want to cook the bacon at the same temperature at the burger, which means putting the brickettes on one side, and the bacon rack on the other.  If you want to grill the burgers, some onions, and maybe a few other veggies along with the bacon, pretty much everything but the bacon winds up being directly over the brickettes.  If you have a larger grill, this won't matter to you, but take some measurements because a 10""x10"" will take up a lot of space and force the brickettes to be arranged very specifically.4) Clean-up is fine.  Once you collapse the rack, the two pontoons of grease drain easily, it goes in the dishwasher, and collapses to store easily.Over-all, I wish I could lock the rack into a position that isn't fully folded out to take less space on the grill, but if you are willing to set aside 10""x10"" for the rack, go for it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RKL14ASG0HTY2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N0L5NGM#wasThisHelpful","RKL14ASG0HTY2","A2QYWB6UH4J7Q0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2QYWB6UH4J7Q0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"For those familiar with THIS Gilmore's discography, Unified Presence may come across as a wonderful surprise.  He was one of the M-BASE Collective/Strata Institute guys back in the heyday of the group/movement.  Like his compatriots, he played a frenetic style built around convoluted rhythms.  Anyone expecting that here will be in for a shock.  Gilmore's playing on this beautiful album is grounded enough that even your non-jazz friends will be able to enjoy it.  Christian McBride and Jeff Tain Watts are just about the most rock-solid rhythm section in jazz today, equally capable of challenging bop-based material and the funkier side of the genre.  While original, the compositions here sound like they could be standards, threading the needle between Monk and Silver, with the unexpected twists of the former and the driving power of the latter.  Honestly, I kept having to check the liner notes to see if either were credited, but no, this is just a well-led group staying true to the spirit of long-gone masters while playing with a modern warmth that avoids the ostentatiously challenging elements that are intended to scare away the rubes.  It may sound like an insult that even the rubes will like this one (I admit to my own snobbery), but Gilmore and crowd will get your jazz-hating philistine friends to stop whining about how jazz is a naked emperor.  And you can still be a snobbish jerk about the ""ur"" vs. ""re"" thing.  Those looking for a dose of Gilmore going nuts on the fretboard in a more M-BASE style should check out Numerology, his live album.  Here, he throws in some elegant acoustic work, plenty of clean-toned electric work, and plenty of Christian McBride: bassist extraordinaire.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RFXJ80D13H2WL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000GYHR9W#wasThisHelpful","RFXJ80D13H2WL","A2QYWB6UH4J7Q0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2QYWB6UH4J7Q0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a pretty good little set-up.  I got it to pair with a Macbook Pro currently running 10.10.3 Yosemite.  I have the computer on a standing set-up, which puts the keyboard and trackpad at the wrong height, and using wired keyboards or mice takes up precious few USB ports.  Despite the Microsoft brand, both items pair quite easily with a Mac, and the music control keys work just fine with iTunes.  I have two minor complaints.  One is visible, but you might not notice it.  To keep the keyboard compact, the arrow keys are integrated into the rest of the keyboard rather than given their own separate section, which means you might have to look down to find them rather than going by feel.  A minor nuisance, but worth pointing out.  The second, you wouldn't be able to guess. I prefer to set the computer not to be awoken by bluetooth devices-- I have cats.  However, if you do that, then every time the computer wakes up, you have to re-pair the mouse with the computer.  Strangely, that isn't true for the keyboard.  I have no idea why.  The result, though, is that the computer must be set to be woken up by bluetooth devices, i.e., by meddling cats.

"Damon Fowler is one of the most interesting blues guitarists around today, combining the loping rhythms of swamp blues, a bit of rock snarl, and a hint of country twang.  On this 2000 album, though, he was still working out his sound and just starting to peak his head out from the shadow of SRV and the rest of the modern blues-rock pantheon.  This is some solid southern blues, but a bit more rock-oriented than what he has played since, and with Southern Hospitality.  That means a few more rip-snortin' riffs to show off his skill, and a bit less space for everything to breathe.  To me, that space is essential to the greatness of what he now plays, but for those curious to see just how ferocious he could be before he mellowed out, this is a good one.  As my comments above indicate, the sound is more SRV than Tab Benoit, but that suits some people's tastes anyway.  The band is solid, but again, the bass and drum fills keep the sound busier than his recent albums.  If that's what you like, then great, but if you are already a Damon Fowler fan, be warned that his earlier work wasn't as spare-sounding.  Fans of Damon's slide work should also be warned that this album is heavier on fret-work than slide, and the date should be a tip-off that the ""sacred steel"" influence won't be very obvious.  I keep writing as though the album is a disappointment, but really that is just comparing it to Damon's more recent albums after his sound matured.  This is still a good, solid southern blues album, and if you just want to hear some fancy fretwork, Damon delivers the goods here.Further listening:  Josh Garrett, Colin Lake","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R9RSRWGUAJP2Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001BS81FG#wasThisHelpful","R9RSRWGUAJP2Y","A2QYWB6UH4J7Q0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2QYWB6UH4J7Q0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The bluegrass/Celtic/classical crossover thing has been done.  A lot.  It can get boring, but this is a pretty exciting album.  The unique trio arrangement combined with the vitality of the players gives the album its power.  Jordan Tice has been quietly pushing flatpicking forward with more classical influences for a few years now, including in other trios including the brilliant Corbett/Chrisman/Tice album.  He isn't a flashy player, he just tries to play the unexpected note.  He succeeds.  Like Charles Sawtelle if he had been influenced by the Edgar Meyer side of the genre, Tice doesn't disappoint, even in the mellower moments.  Paul Kowert should be a familiar name, having been attached to geniuses from multiple generations, ranging from Mike Marshall to Sarah Jarosz and Chris Thile.  Like Tice, he favors unique phrasing over flash, so don't expect Edgar Meyer-type flash.  But that complements Tice well.  The new one for me was Brittany Haas on fiddle, and she's the fiery one.  That lends the critical balance to the more restrained playing of TIce and Kowert.  The music itself will sound right at home to fans of newgrass in the post-Strength In Numbers era.  Fans of Berline/Crary/Hickman, Douglas/Barenberg/Meyer, Ickes/Leftwich/Pomeroy or Phillips/Grier/Flinner should appreciate this one.  The guitar/fiddle/bass combination gives a complete range of pitch and tonalities, while TIce's odd sensibilities keep you guessing about what comes next.Further listening: Grant Gordy, Jake Schepps, Jayme Stone.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2HBQ74TL54IAQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LV8A8VQ#wasThisHelpful","R2HBQ74TL54IAQ","A2QYWB6UH4J7Q0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2QYWB6UH4J7Q0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Personally, I like real instruments, and this live album is just Danny, sans tricks.  He is a masterful banjo player, and his reputation for that has strangely overshadowed his acoustic guitar picking skills.  His nasal voice is... an acquired taste, but this unadorned album is basically a showcase for Danny's fiery picking.  While Bad Livers gained its reputation for mixing bluegrass, jug band sounds and punk aesthetics, this is pretty much a folk album.  An aggressive one, but a folk album nonetheless.  Fans of Danny and his previous band should already have versions of the tracks here, but not like this.  Without Mark Rubin or anyone else around, Danny has nowhere to hide, so he just plays his guts out.  Leave the electronics for those who can appreciate them.

"Jim Hurst, despite being one of the most fascinating guitarists on the bluegrass seen, has a pretty sparse output, and this is his first true solo album.  This is Jim, stripped down to the essential sounds of his easy-going voice and always-innovative picking.  His previous solo albums have had accompanists, and his two duet albums with bassist Missy Raines were, obviously, collaborative efforts.  In my opinion, he is the type of musician who is at his best when there aren't any distractions.  That isn't to knock his rhythm playing, which is rock-solid, but his guitar work is so unique that it works best when it isn't competing with anyone for attention, which was what made his work with Raines so great.  Here, Jim has nowhere to hide, which is what brings out the best in him.  Let's talk, then, about why his playing shines so much here.  Innovation is always hard, and doubly so in bluegrass, which has traditionalism built into its DNA.  Jim breaks the rules in so many ways.  For starters, most bluegrass guitarists take their cues from the adaptation of fiddle tunes, like Doc and Clarence before them.  Jim, though, understands that one of the things that made Doc Watson so incredible was that he was as interested in fingerpicking as flatpicking.  Even with a plectrum, Jim draws on the influence of folk-based fingerpickers, giving his musical phrasing a sound that cannot be confused with any other flatpicker.  He also understands that you don't need each note to be articulated with its own picking motion.  Jim has found ways to incorporate the occasional slur into his flatpicking so that he can add his own rhythmic accompaniment while giving him the freedom to play more elaborate breaks.  And somehow he does all of this with the warmest tone of any bluegrass guitarist, which goes well with his voice.  That's pretty much what there is here.  Jim pulls out every trick in his extensive book, but the casual sound makes you feel like you are sitting right next to him listening to him mess around for fun.  Much of the album isn't bluegrass, but bluegrass fans are sure to appreciate it anyway.  This one might even be as good as Synergy (the second duet album with Raines).","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RSCD0NP8DCZFT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007FDSNUE#wasThisHelpful","RSCD0NP8DCZFT","A2QYWB6UH4J7Q0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2QYWB6UH4J7Q0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"14 years.  That's how long it has been since the first Word album introduced me to Robert Randolph.  That's a long wait, but this is quite a follow-up.  It is a marvelous blend of the blues-rock-gospel energy of their original album with the funkier and jazzier styles that one might hope they incorporate.  Randolph himself has matured greatly as an artist, no longer falling back on safely repetitive riffs and bringing more funk to his sound than his original ""sacred steel"" style of playing.  When one thinks of truly great slide guitarists (presuming one includes pedal steel), Robert Randolph has earned to have his name among the very best.  However, Randolph's maturity is not the only improvement.  The sound is more eclectic, partially because the rest of the musicians are no longer so intimidated by Randolph the phenom that they just stand back.  I'm not a fan of Medeski, Martin & Wood, and even when they became every proto-hipster's favorite jazz band in the 90's, I didn't get it.  But here, with a bunch of blues oriented musicians keeping him grounded, Medeski brings just the right amount of jazz without any of his more self-indulgent tendencies.  The North Mississippi Allstars are a bigger force here too, with guitarist Luther Dickinson trading licks with Randolph more confidently than 14 years ago.  Ironically, I'm not an obsessive fan of NMA either.  Together with Medeski and Randolph, though, the magic happens, and this album is magical.  It rocks harder than the first, it brings the funk, and there are even some nods to country, perhaps in honor of more traditional uses of Randolph's pedal steel.  I could do without the vocals, even if they bring in Ruthie Foster, but there isn't a bad musical choice here.  It is simply that there is a market for instrumental gospel for those who want to enjoy the music without being preached at.  It is mostly instrumental anyway.  Masterful instrumentals, to be clear.  A fine follow-up.  Hopefully it won't take another 14 years for the next.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RUH546L8UQGYZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00U6WUIFE#wasThisHelpful","RUH546L8UQGYZ","A2QYWB6UH4J7Q0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2QYWB6UH4J7Q0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Queen Esther is an odd one.  I learned of her through Hoosegow, her blues collaboration with experimental guitarist Elliott Sharp.  While Hoosegow was a stripped down affair filled with unusual twists and turns courtesy of Sharp's weirdness, Talkin Fishbowl Blues will sound more familiar to most listeners.  It is mostly R&B-flavored blues, with neither Sharp's attempts to challenge the listener nor Esther's jazzy flourishes.  Esther's voice is powerful without being overbearing, and the band is not particularly showy.  Occasionally, Esther draws from her other influences, including gospel and even some country, but mostly Esther and the band sound like what every bar blues band wishes it could be.  The Tammy Wynette cover at the end of the album will undoubtedly alienate some listeners who are either averse to country or the sentiment (anyone remember 1992?), but it is actually a fine way to cap an album by demonstrating more range than the band had shown up to the last track.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2LBCTA9AUYB0P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000CAJJ1O#wasThisHelpful","R2LBCTA9AUYB0P","A2QYWB6UH4J7Q0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2QYWB6UH4J7Q0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""Scruj MacDuhk"" is basically a rough draft of ""The Duhks,"" led by banjo player Leonard Podolak.  Without a vocalist like Jessee Havey on board, though, the sound is much more firmly rooted in Celtic and Cape Breton styles, without the bluesy elements that Havey brought to the table.  Not as eclectic as the Duhks, but as proficient and energetic.  Vocals mix English and French (these are Canadians), with the latter sounding like the precursor to Cajun music that it essentially is.  With a few rhythmic changes and more accordion, one could imagine the band moving south and fitting in.  As is, though, the sound is basically the Celtic-Cape Breton fusion that one would expect-- the new world version of Solas when Karan Casey was with them.  Later, Podolak would collaborate on the TurtleDuhks with a few fellow Canadian musicians, and return to this sound.  The album stands as an interesting testament, though, to the roots of the Duhks.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1D93QQFO3K0RY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00006L6D4#wasThisHelpful","R1D93QQFO3K0RY","A2QYWB6UH4J7Q0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2QYWB6UH4J7Q0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

A large house with multiple doors and easily accessible windows just requires more.  Still, the basic motion sensor seems pretty effective with causal testing, setting a schedule for the lights is relatively simple, and there are no obvious holes to me, but I'm a casual consumer rather than a security expert.  I will admit, though, that the cameras make me nervous.  Do you really want internet-enabled cameras monitoring your home?  Remember a couple of years ago when someone found a way to hack into people's built-in computer cameras to turn them on remotely and watch through them without the light even going on?

"Let's be blunt about the iPhone 6 +.  The thing is huge.  If you use one, you are already sacrificing convenience.  For me, the extra battery life is worth it, but your mileage may vary.  Do you really want to make it bigger?  This case is a heavy duty protective case, but the result of using it is that the device is now not only too large to use comfortably one-handed, but too thick to put in your blazer pocket.  If you are biking, though, the tradeoff for protective casing is probably worth it.  Similarly, if you work in an environment with heavy activity, the protective case is probably worth it.  I didn't want to drop my iPhone just to test a case, but if I weren't an office-dweller, I would be much more comfortable with this than with the slimmer holster case I have.  However, the slimmer holster case allows me to use either the belt clip, or put the device in my inside blazer pocket.  With the Drop Tech case, that second option just isn't an option.  So should you get it?  If you care about extra protection for your device more than minimizing the inconvenience of the already huge size, then yes.  Similarly, if you want some rubberized flaps that keep dirt and grime out of the ports, this will do the job.  If you don't need a lot of extra shock absorption and aren't taking the phone through environments with a lot of extra particulate matter, go with something slimmer.

"This desk has a couple of nice features, but before buying it, keep in mind a couple of points that you might not have considered.  First, the USB ports.  Nice, right?  Remember, though, that we are in the process of transitioning to the next version of USB, and that will require dongles to mix the old and new USB systems.  Is now really the time to buy furniture based on the built-in USB ports?  Maybe not.  Second, consider something that may be more aesthetic.  The curve in the base puts your chair in the center of the desk.  Fine, but where does the printer go?  That depends on the size of your computer, and the size of your printer.  If you have one of those tiny things like my old lexmark inkjet, it can go on that top shelf and stay out of the way.  However, I have a larger Brother printer/copier/scanner unit that just doesn't have a convenient location here.  On the other hand, were it not for the curve in the base, you could put your computer and seat on one side, and have room on the other for the printer.

"Leftover Salmon is back.  WIth Drew Emmitt off on his own (or playing with Bill Nershi from String Cheese Incident) and Vince Herman leading the outstanding roots-country-rock group Great American Taxi, Leftover Salmon was basically on hiatus for a while.  They came back with Aquatic Hitchhiker in 2012, which was a fine entry into their catalog, although they played it a bit safe (by the standards of a group who describe their style as ""polyethnic Cajun slamgrass,"" anyway), and the album was just a comfortable demonstration of their old style.  On High Country, they are back in top form, with a few guests and Little Feat's Bill Payne on keys.  It is hard to say which element brought them back into peak form, but even though the basics of their style remain the same, the playing just has more excitement to it than Aquatic Hitchhiker did.  There are more hints of what Herman was doing with Great American Taxi, more patience on the slower numbers reminiscent of one of my favorites from Bridges To Bert-- Nothing But Time, and Andy Thorn has more fully integrated himself into the thankless task of replacing the irreplaceable Mark Vann on banjo.  In fact, one of the highlights is a straight-up traditional bluegrass number called Thornpipe, in reference to Andy and the traditional ""hornpipe"" pieces.  The band even dips into Little Feat's catalog with Bill on board, and not surprisingly, the transition to LoS's sound works just fine.  One can forgive them for the slightly juvenile final track, Finish Your Beer, which is about exactly what you think.  I don't know what to read into the transition from the  hints of pot in their earlier albums (they are from Colorado...) to a song about beer here.  It probably means nothing.  The song is fun, in a sophomoric kind of way.  The rest of the album, though, is Leftover Salmon, back on top.

"JJ Grey can do no wrong, and he has honed a style of southern, funky blues to perfection.  His secret?  Hold nothing back.  Ever.  JJ sings and plays his heart out.  It took me a while to understand that this was his real trick.  The first two albums, credited merely to ""Mofro,"" had a very different sound from what he started to play on Country Ghetto while playing as ""JJ Grey and Mofro,"" with more emphasis on lo-fi acoustic sounds early on.  Even when he moved to the ""JJ Grey and Mofro"" monicker, he kept a lot of open space in his music, which I thought was the key.  Since then, his arrangements have gotten bigger and fuller.  And it's still great.  He doesn't even need Anthony Trube to play flashy guitar solos all over the place.  The horn arrangements have gotten more confident, and everything just keeps that propulsive groove going at full power throughout another inspiring album.  The music is inspiring.  It is cathartic.  It makes you feel like you know everything about JJ.  And that's before even talking about the lyrics.  Usually, I'm not big on lyrics, but JJ is worth listening to.  And who else can write such an inspiring song about lusting after his wife?  Just great.  Put on Ol' Glory, and don't do anything else.  Just listen and be up-lifted.Of course, Derek Trucks puts in another appearance, which is always welcome.  I'd like these two to play together more often, but with the Tedeschi Trucks Band reaching similar levels of perfection, Derek's wife is already the majestic singer needed to compliment his slide guitar.  Different, of course, but equally powerful.  JJ, though, just has the best gritty voice around.  I love this stuff.  JJ can do no wrong, and he manages that by holding nothing back.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1WMBG4WA34VRL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QSDACJM#wasThisHelpful","R1WMBG4WA34VRL","A2QYWB6UH4J7Q0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2QYWB6UH4J7Q0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There just isn't enough of Clarence White's bluegrass picking.  Even with the Kentucky Colonels, he was an ensemble player.  That is to his credit, but I'd rather listen to Clarence than Roland.  On the surface, then, this looks like an ideal album.  In a stripped down setting, you get more Clarence, proportionately.  Unfortunately, the album is quite short (around half an hour), and the sound quality is far from ideal, including plenty of pops and cracks from the source tape.  And it still isn't just half and hour straight of Clarence taking lead breaks.  This is good music, and both Roger and Billy Ray are fine players.  At the end of the day, though, even for the value of Clarence's playing, I'll take Appalachian Swing over this one, and both Clarence's ""Flatpicking"" album, and the compilation of solo recordings offer a broader array of what Clarence could do with a plectrum.  This trio album is a good addition to the Clarence White acoustic catalog, which is sparse enough that we'll take what we can get.  Appalachian Swing is still pretty hard to top, though.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R94LIG2HWLMPA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0053ESHTO#wasThisHelpful","R94LIG2HWLMPA","A2QYWB6UH4J7Q0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2QYWB6UH4J7Q0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Twenty years of Geoff Achison.  Strange.  Some musicians take a while to develop.  Some come right out of the gate fully formed.  I recently tracked down Geoff's long-out-of-print first album, Big Machine, which was released twenty years before this concert, hence the title.  It is fascinating to see how fully formed Geoff's concept was, and yet how finely he has honed his approach since then.  Geoff is truly devoted to his craft, and his fluid, slippery guitar technique just gets more precise every year.  Still, nobody sounds like him, not even Hamilton Loomis, and nobody blends scorching blues, funk and R&B like him.  He doesn't disappoint.  So, how do we assess this concert?  First, the material, which is the only real stumbling block for me.  It makes some sense for an anniversary concert to focus on favorites, but the material on Geoff's electric concert albums is getting somewhat redundant.  Tell Me Something I Don't Know, Crazy Horse, and others are great pieces, but not only do I have other versions of them, I have other similar live versions on his other live albums.  A bit more diversity in song selection would be nice.  Also, for an anniversary concert, why not showcase some of Geoff's spectacularly percussive acoustic work?  Nothing here disappoints, but I'd rather have a live album of rarer selections and a broader overview of what he can do.  Second, Geoff's voice.  He always has that slightly histrionic warble, but it is pretty subdued here.  No complaints.  Finally, Geoff's propensity to have backing musicians play rinky-dink keyboards.  The keys sound pretty decent here.  All-in-all, then, I would rate this at 5 stars if I didn't already have similar live versions of most of these tracks anyway.  That said, it isn't entirely redundant.  It took a while after his time in Georgia, but it sounds like he is finally incorporating some Allman-type sounds, which is ironic since Whipping Post has long been in his repertoire, although his versions are totally unique.Note that this set comes with a DVD, but it won't play on a region 1 player.  Just be warned about that.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ARZPBWPPIWWL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Q2TEUFY#wasThisHelpful","R1ARZPBWPPIWWL","A2QYWB6UH4J7Q0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2QYWB6UH4J7Q0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Geoff Achison is just amazing.  His guitar style is so fluid and elegant that you can tell within two notes when you hear him playing.  His acoustic work is always astounding.  His electric work can be more hit-and-miss.  While there is some acoustic work here, the album is predominantly electric, and it is the best of Geoff's electric studio-based work.  He strikes the perfect balance between tight arrangements with a strong band and his funk/R&B-laced blues guitar playing, and unlike many of his live electric albums, the keyboards here don't sound like those rinky-dink Casio things from the '80s.  I have commented in reviews of his live albums how that can detract from the genius of his own instrumental work, but everything here just sounds good.  What is fascinating about the sound, though, is that while it reflects Geoff's time in Atlanta hanging around various Allman-affiliated musicians like Randall Bramblett, there isn't much influence of that.  Instead, I hear more shades of '70s Jeff Beck in the slightly reggae-tinged, jazzy fusion sound that pops up all over the place on this album.  At this point, I have pretty much come around to Geoff's voice.  It will never be my favorite, and I still find it somewhat affected with the over-emphasized warble, but I just associate it so much with his guitar work now that they are part of a total package.  And there's the bottom line-- Geoff sounds like no one else.  What else can a musician aspire to?  I still can't figure out how he gets those guitar sounds, and even Hamilton Loomis can't come close (Hamilton being the most similar I have heard.  Keep it up, Geoff","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R17SAUI83OKFFD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0028NSEQY#wasThisHelpful","R17SAUI83OKFFD","A2QYWB6UH4J7Q0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2QYWB6UH4J7Q0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Billy Cardine is at it again.  One of the best dobro players around continues his quest to show that there are players whose names aren't ""Jerry Douglas.""  This project shows just a few hints of bluegrass, and along with a guest appearance from Biscuit Burners bandmate Mary Lucey on vocals, Cardine works primarily in a dobro/bass/percussion trio to explore a very Indian-influenced world-jazz-fusion type sound.  The Indian sound isn't new for Cardine-- he has been weaving those sounds into the Biscuit Burners and his solo works for a while, but this album tries to embrace the Indian sound throughout, augmented by a few more western traditions.  This kind of thing has been done before for slide guitarists, but not generally with a dobro.  Ry Cooder, of course, recorded with VM Bhatt, Bob Brozman recorded with Debashish Bhattacharya, and recently Jeff Lang has been playing with tabla player Bobby Singh after years of incorporating Indian sounds into his playing.  Cardine, though, favors the dobro, whereas Cooder prefers bottleneck, Brozman liked resonators, and Lang uses primarily a Weissenborn when playing with Singh.  Also, all three come from a blues background, and even with the bluegrass kept to a minimum, the subtle hints show that Cardine is coming at this from a separate field entirely.  His accompanists are good, and one could easily mistake the bassist for Michael Manring.  Whether that is a good thing or a bad thing for you depends pretty much on your opinion of Windham Hill.  The vaguely new age/fusion type vibe is definitely here, though.  Make no mistake, though-- you won't hear this while getting aromatherapy.  The music is interesting, and it will be nice to hear where Cardine goes with it.  The album doesn't hold up quite as well as Lang's ""Djan Djan"" project for me, though, simply because it doesn't surprise as much.  When I read about Djan Djan, that didn't quite prepare me for everything in it.  The Billy Sea pretty much sounds like what I expect, and I sort of expect Cardine to throw some weird ideas out that I wouldn't have seen coming from his previous work.  Cardine usually surprises me more than this.  Again, ""Global Americana"" is a good album, and worth listening if you want to hear the dobro in an unconventional context, and for someone other than Cardine, I might give this four stars.  Billy, though, has set a higher standard for himself.  The next one will probably be weirder, and therefore better.By the way, keep an eye out for Maru Tarang-- Jeff Lang's current project with Bobby Singh.  Also, track down an old album by Crowsong called ""Dark Comes Light,"" in addition to the stuff mentioned above.And should I mention that Jerry Douglas recorded an album with VM Bhatt?  No?  OK.

"Second time's a charm.  The duo of Andreas Kapsalis and Goran Ivanovic put out their first album in 2009.  It was quite good.  But this one is genius.  It just took some time to put their collective talents to their best use together.  I have been a fan of Goran for years now.  His albums with Fareed Haque were masterpieces blending Haque's unique jazz leanings with Goran's Macedonian roots.  Fans of Vlatko Stefanovski & Miroslav Tadic's albums together should check them out.  Kapsalis, though, is more of a slap-n-tap type, following in the tradition of Michael Hedges and Preston Reed.  I didn't learn about him until he hooked up with Ivanovic.  Together, their first album had moments of greatness, but the percussive approach of Kapsalis and Ivanovic's Macedonian sound are not as obviously compatible as Ivanovic and Haque's styles.  On Blackmail, though, everything comes together perfectly.  Kapsalis' percussive approach provides the propulsive energy while Ivanovic's mastery of Macedonian folk with hints of classical and jazz provide the unique flavor.  Guitar duos risk either redundancy when the players' styles are too similar, or awkwardness when they can't find the right middle ground.  Blackmail shows what happens when two completely different guitarists  figure out exactly the right balance.  Imagine Miroslav Tadic and Michael Hedges trying to jam.  It could go very wrong.  Or it could go very right.  This album sounds like the latter.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1W7KPFCHJ8Z4D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00D6O18SK#wasThisHelpful","R1W7KPFCHJ8Z4D","A2QYWB6UH4J7Q0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2QYWB6UH4J7Q0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This album is credited to Bad Livers, but it should be noted that (with the exception of an older live track) it is just the duo of Danny Barnes and Mark Rubin, sans fiddle.  Danny sticks to the banjo, and Mark sticks to the bass.  You might think, then, that they play a bit more traditionally than the Bad Livers' normal bluegrass/jug band/punk weirdness.  Perhaps, but when they start out with a Sun Ra cover and throw in nods to Monk, you know you are still listening to Danny Barnes.  The stripped down sound appeals to me, and the background noises add to the easy-going, casual nature of the recording.  Basically, you are listening to Danny and Mark play around and have fun.  The album lacks the visionary brilliance of Delusions of Banjer, but it also isn't as challenging, meaning that it may be a good way for more traditional roots-music fans to ease their way into Bad Livers and the musical world of Danny Barnes.  The voice is as nasal as ever, and that could remain a turnoff, but Danny's hard-driving banjo work and relentless need for fun make this about as accessible as any Bad Livers album is likely to be.  Come on, give it a try.  Let Danny take you on a journey through Appalachia by way of his own disturbed mind.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1E4ONQ5LWMBQ5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000J3Q1J2#wasThisHelpful","R1E4ONQ5LWMBQ5","A2QYWB6UH4J7Q0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2QYWB6UH4J7Q0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Beppe Gambetta could easily be written off as a novelty from the short version of his bio--  he is an Italian musician drawn to bluegrass-based flatpicking because he developed an early obsession with Doc Watson.  Any such illusions should be dispelled by this fine compilation of live tracks just by looking at the roster of musicians anxious to share the stage at the Teatro Della Corte with Beppe.  He is joined here by a rotating cast of musicians from both sides of the Atlantic, including Darrell Scott, Mike Marshall, Bruce Molsky, Dan Crary, Patty Larkin, Jim Hurst, Tony McManus, and others.  If that guest list doesn't have you anxious to hear the album, you probably don't listen to modern acoustic music.  They are distinguished not only by their stature in the acoustic music world, but by the diversity of styles that they play.  And they are the ones lined up to play with Beppe, who shows his wide-ranging musical palette here with styles ranging from American folk and bluegrass to Brazilian to jazz to European traditions, and even some Balkan hints on a track with Bruce Molsky.  Beppe is a musical omnivore who just happens to play mostly with a plectrum.  There may not be another flatpicker out there with such range.  That wouldn't matter if he didn't play his heart out every time.  Fortunately, he does.  Beppe puts on a great show.  It would be nice to have a compilation of live tracks from his fantastic solo shows, but he is such a fun accompanist that this album is easily recommended to any Beppe fan, or anyone else curious about the Italian flatpicking phenom.  Would this list of guests play with a slouch?

"I had low expectations for this device, but my expectations were surpassed.  Let's take this step by step.1)  Sound quality.  It's a tiny, bluetooth speaker.  How good can it be?  Better than what I had in college, and that thing took up a lot more space.  I would put the sound quality at least on par with those boom boxes we all used to have and probably a bit better, which, for the size, strikes me as reasonable.  I can take this thing around the house, take it outside while grilling, take it for picnics, etc., and we're happy.  The key to that assessment, of course, is that the speaker is fine when the music isn't the center of attention.  It's good accompaniment.  Like those old boom boxes, but much smaller.2)  Set-up and operation.  Easy, as bluetooth devices should be.  The only thing worth noting is that I kind of like being able to pause the music with a button on the speaker so that I don't have to pull out the iPad or whatever is streaming the music.  This is the only surprising feature, and I like it.  Convenience is a good thing.3)  Battery life.  This one had me worried.  I get about 9 hours on a full charge, which is good enough for most purposes.  The device works on a rechargeable battery, which has its benefits and drawbacks.  The benefit is obvious, but rechargeable batteries don't work for as long, and have a limited number of charges.  Once the internal battery goes (probably around three years, depending on how much you use it), you will basically just have to keep it plugged in by running the USB charge cable through whatever old block you have sitting around from an i-whatever that died years ago.  At that point, it just won't be as portable.Over-all assessment: better than I expected, and pretty darn good.  Perfect to give to a kid going off to college since it packs easily, gives portability, and to be frank, they just don't care that much about the audiophile experience anyway.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RKC4PNLL7MKGX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LC27UF8#wasThisHelpful","RKC4PNLL7MKGX","A2QYWB6UH4J7Q0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2QYWB6UH4J7Q0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Just when I think I have a handle on Elliott Sharp's blues-based ""Terraplane"" projects, he releases ""4am Always.""  What do you listen to at 4 AM when you can't sleep and the air is thick with menace?  You need something spooky, with the darkness of Skip James and the funkiness of Maggot Brain-era Funkadelic.  If you are in New Orleans, you listen to Dr. John's first album, ""Gris Gris,"" from his Night Tripper days.  Apparently Elliott Sharp has decided that the world needs New York's answer to Gris Gris, because it just wouldn't sound right in Greenwich Village.  So he put together this perfectly titled gem, which is vaguely rooted in blues, but mostly just spooky music, filled with odd textures, rhythms that feel like they could fall apart at any moment, and instead of the loping rhythms of New Orleans, we get New York's tension and the feeling that an explosion is just one slip away.This doesn't really sound like Sharp's last few Terraplane albums.  Those recent albums have been rooted in both blues and the jazz stylings of Mingus, Rahsaan Roland Kirk, and Sun Ra, with the free-wheeling energy implied by those associations.  This is a darker album, stripped of the horn section led by Curtis Fowlkes that graced more recent Terraplane albums, stripped of Mingus's son's vocals, and sadly stripped of Hubert Sumlin's guest spots (RIP, Hubert).  With a configuration that is basically a trio (augmented sometimes by Tracie Morris's chant-like vocals), Sharp overdubs different string instruments in a few places, but leaves a lot of open space, with plenty of subtle menace rushing in to fill the space.  As always, Sharp's guitar cuts deeply without ever calling attention to itself through needless flash, and the oddness of Sharp's background in avant-garde jazz creeps in just enough to keep everything off balance.  This is a masterpiece of dark, blues-based weirdness, and it is the perfect soundtrack to those late night moments of unease in places like New York.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2NXED36T7N5LU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IZ1RQN0#wasThisHelpful","R2NXED36T7N5LU","A2QYWB6UH4J7Q0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2QYWB6UH4J7Q0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I suppose I am not the real target demographic for this speaker set.  It is pretty clearly aimed at those who want a modest, budget enhancement for gaming, whereas I am a music fan.  The speaker set basically exists for the primary purpose of having a small, unobtrusive subwoofer.  However, the main speakers are not exactly audiophile equipment, so what you really get with this set is the ability to crank up the bass a bit so that there is a modest rumble with those explosions in games.  For music, the sound is only a modest improvement on the built-in speakers on my iMac desktop.  Frankly, I have no desire to crank up the bass while listening to Miles Davis, so without good treble, these speakers are not for me.  The other limiting factor to keep in mind is that the cables are rather short, meaning you won't have many options for speaker placement.  They are just long enough to keep the subwoofer at your feet underneath the desk with the main speakers to either side of your monitor.  For music, speaker placement matters far more, so you need to have longer cables.Is this for you?  That depends.  If you want a good listening experience for music, sorry, but you'll have to shell out more money.

"Alas, The Bridge is no more.  This album, which predates their self-titled not-really-debut, is an interesting rough draft of the band, with some live tracks and some relatively informal studio tracks.  The basic elements of the band that released ""Blind Man's Hill"" (an all-time classic, in my opinion), are here, including Little Feat-style rock, some country, some bluegrass, some funk, and yes, some beatboxing.  Two things merit discussion.  First, the sound here just isn't as tight.  Several of the tracks are extended jams, making it sound like the band was trying to cash in on the tail end of the jam band resurgence brought on by the HORDE festival in the 1990's.  Here's the thing, though.  If you are a virtuoso on the level of, say, Derek Trucks, you can play a 10-minute guitar solo that is thoroughly exciting for every second of it.  Not many guitarists can pull that off.  Cris Jacobs is a fine guitarist, in the David Hidalgo tradition (Steve Berlin would later have a hand in The Bridge's sound, so Los Lobos is a pretty good reference point anyway).  Hidalgo's perfectly structured, elegant, concise solos are vital to the sound of Los Lobos, and Jacobs learned that trick too, helping to make Blind Man's Hill such an amazing album.  On the extended live tracks here, though, the band gets a bit self-indulgent.  The elements are all here, but they just didn't quite have that Little Feat-level of tightness yet.  Had I been in the audience, I'm sure I would have loved it, but without that live energy, the extended solos here come across as just a tad self-indulgent.  Don't get me wrong-- this is good music.  It's just not GREAT music, which Blind Man's Hill is.Then there's the beatboxing and hip hop stuff.  OK, I'll admit that I'm just not a hip hop fan.  The beatboxing on their later albums comes across as perhaps a bit too cute, but it doesn't detract.  Here, though, there is more of it, and more direct reference to hip hop beyond the beatboxing.  Their clear fondness for funk makes it seem at least somewhat sincere, and the beatboxing might just be a nostalgic childhood reference, particularly when it references the theme from Beverly Hills Cop.  But it doesn't sit right.  The word, ""appropriation,"" has an ugly history, and I wouldn't go so far as to accuse the band of it, but some of the hip hop references seem aimed more at the frat boy audience than real hip hop music snobs.  I'm neither, though.  On their subsequent releases, The Bridge toned down the hip hop and beatboxing stuff, recognizing that it could easily come across as gimmicky, but like I said, this is kind of a rough draft for the band.I don't want my criticisms here to take away from the fact that Cross Street Market is an enjoyable album that fans of the now-sadly-defunct band will enjoy.  It just isn't as good as what was to come.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2SWJYXI2GP3IL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000A2GB1K#wasThisHelpful","R2SWJYXI2GP3IL","A2QYWB6UH4J7Q0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2QYWB6UH4J7Q0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As far as I'm concerned at this point, Elliott Sharp's avant-garde jazz career might as well not exist.  I never liked that style anyway.  Sharp, as the leader of the ""Terraplane"" band, is simply one of the leading blues guitarists around, and this album is as seamless a blend of blues, jazz and funk as can be found anywhere.  This particular album from Terraplane turns the jazz influence up higher than many others, but fortunately for those of us who don't like avant-garde jazz, Sharp dips more into Mingus territory, which is appropriate given the bassist's son's presence in the band.  Perhaps more than Mingus, though, I think of Rahsaan Roland Kirk when I listen to this album, and what would have happened if Rahsaan had recorded with Hendrix, or maybe Buddy Guy.  Nowhere is that combination evoked more clearly than on ""USA Out Of NYC,"" during which I cannot help but think about ""Blacknuss"" due to the structure, the feel and the chanting.  The piece's title is an elegant middle finger to those who implicitly, and sometimes explicitly, denigrate New York and its residents as not being real Americans as a cheap political attack.  Some might be offended by Sharp's sentiment, even some who express similar regional loyalties to regions other than NYC, but let's be honest.  The people who make snide comments about New York not being a part of ""real America"" are more likely to buy Lee Greenwood albums than Elliott Sharp albums.  Really, then, the piece just serves as an opportunity to blend Rahsaan-style, funk-infused jazz with blistering blues guitar that somehow manages to be virtuosic without ever calling attention to flashy technique.  And that pretty much sums up Sharp's approach on this album.  Take the best from hard-edged funk, jazz and urban blues, stick it in a blender, and have a lot of fun.  Maybe Sharp wouldn't be able to make this kind of music if he weren't steeped in some of the more experimental kinds of jazz, and if so, I appreciate what he has taken from that, but at the end of the day for me, Sharp is just an awe-inspiring blues musician.My references to Mingus and Kirk suggest other blues/jazz hybrids like Heritage Blues Orchestra, and this is probably the Sharp album closest to that approach, but where Heritage draws more from rural Southern styles of blues, Sharp is a New York musician through-and-through (hence that song...).  Technically, he wasn't born there, but he may as well have been, and the gritty urban sound makes Secret Life a wholly different animal from Heritage Blues Orchestra.  Nevertheless, fans may appreciate both.  I do.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3FQ70JAY7V7B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000ARHNF8#wasThisHelpful","R3FQ70JAY7V7B","A2QYWB6UH4J7Q0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2QYWB6UH4J7Q0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When most blues fans think of the people pushing the genre forward most effectively, names like Otis Taylor come to mind.  A strong case can be made on the basis of albums like this that avant-garde jazz guitarist Elliott Sharp belongs in that category.  This album was recorded under the auspices of Sharp's ""Terraplane"" project, which is the name he gives to the band with which he plays blues-based material.  The first Terraplane album was an interesting but not particularly innovative Hendrix-plays-the-blues type of album.  By the time this album rolled around, though, Terraplane had evolved into something truly unique.  While everything here is clearly derived from the blues, half of the time I have no idea what I am listening to.  I just know I love it.  There is Mingus-style jazz, with none other than the bassist's son on vocals, some pretty hard funk, some experimental noise, all tied together by a few basic blues patterns and a disregard bordering on out-right contempt for any form of traditionalism.  It is aggressive, exciting and dangerous music, as unpredictable as anything you are likely to hear in modern blues-based music.The more time I spend listening to Sharp's Terraplane project, the more I find myself thinking about Gary Lucas-- another current obsession of mine.  Whereas Lucas' weirdness has a distinctly punk-ish feeling, owing to his background with Captain Beefheart, Sharp traces his routes back more to people like Ornette Coleman.  What is interesting to me about this is that I'm not really a fan of Beefheart, I never really got into Coleman, and I don't like either punk or avant-garde jazz.  Yet, phenomenal guitarists like Lucas and Sharp can use their backgrounds in genres I don't like to make some truly creative blues.  Basically, I wouldn't have expected to like Forgery as much as I do, but the wild improvisations, just barely rooted in blues, have so much vitality that I can't help but love it.  I still don't like Sharp's more high-profile avant-garde recordings, but albums like this make a strong case that he is a leading light in the future of blues.  Or ""blues.""  Or whatever the heck we want to call this Frankenstein's monster of an album.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2MRV5UCXM61NP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000TETNJQ#wasThisHelpful","R2MRV5UCXM61NP","A2QYWB6UH4J7Q0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2QYWB6UH4J7Q0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Typing and texting is much easier without being limited to a single finger.The gloves are stylish and soft, and I experienced no problem using my touchscreen with them on. I can text, tap, pinch, and glide without any problems, all while keeping my hands warm and toasty!Why freeze your fingers texting in the cold when you can keep your fingers warm and toasty with Glider Gloves?I received this product for free in exchange for sharing my honest and unbiased review.

"This 3 person tent from FiveJoy is fantastic. It sets up in seconds - truly an instant tent! I also love how quick and easy tearing it down is. It is super easy to use and made well too. The material is lightweight and breathable yet very durable and water resistant.This tent has some neat features as well. Not one but TWO doors, which are great for ventilation. It has mosquito mesh that can be zipped up on the doors so that you can enjoy the open door feel and breeze without subjecting yourself to bugs. I also like that there is a lantern hook at the top of the tent, so that I can easily set up a lantern to provide light.Another feature I love about this tent is that it doubles as a sun shade / pergola by separating the rain-fly (top part) from the rest of the text.

" 3:59 MinsThe Pure Clean Automatic Vacuum Cleaner works well to vacuum up dust and crumbs from the our  tile and laminate floors. It has a large garbage collection tray which is great because it takes a while to fill up. I love that it is thin enough to fit under my tables and sofa, so it can reach areas my regular vacuum cleaner cannot.The only thing that I do not like about the Pure Clean is that I found that it gets stuck on my area rug. It would be fine if it just didn't go up on it, but it does go up on it, and then gets stuck. So, whenever I use my Pure Clean I have to keep an eye out for when it gets stuck on the rug so I can take it off. This gets annoying, and removing the area rug when I use this is not an option (a table is on top of it!). Therefore, I have been only able to use the Pure Clean in my kitchen. It works beautifully in my kitchen, and I will be using it daily in the kitchen.I would definitely recommend the Pure Clean Automatic Vacuum Cleaner. It is inexpensive and works well. However if you have area rugs like me, buy with caution.

"This Electric Shaver from Creation Springs is awesome. I got it for my husband, and watched him shave with it for the first time. We love that it can be used wet or dry, and the large shaving area it gets with it's 3 heads. A larger shaving area means quicker shaving, which is a plus. There is a contour trimmer built in that can be popped up and used for sideburns or other contouring. After shaving the heads can be rinsed off in the water (since this baby is waterproof) and then opened up and emptied out. I like how all the hair is trapped in the heads rather than falling all over my bathroom sink and floor.We are very happy with this Electric Shaver, and would recommend it without hesitation. It would make a great holiday gift or birthday gift for a man or young man as well.I purchased this product at a discount in exchange for sharing my honest and unbiased review.

"These hair removal strips from BodyHonee are great. They are made from an all-natural formula so I know that they are safe to use on my sensitive skin. I love that they come in strips, makes waxing so easy-peasy! I run the strip together in my hands for a minute or two to warm it up, then just peel and stick on my skin. I run it down really well then pull up quickly in the direction opposite of the growth. It helps to hold my skin tight while pulling it off.TIP: make sure skin is completely dry before using - otherwise it will not work well!I love these strips, and would definitely recommend them.I received this product for free in exchange for sharing my honest and unbiased review.

There's nice detail in the ringer (in the shape of a Christmas tree), too. It's sized nicely for the average tree (not too small), so I can see it becoming one of my favorite ornaments over the years.

"This is a cost-effective way to get some basic Spanish skills under your belt. I've previously used Pimsleur's Italian and Portuguese CDs and prefer their style - but the cost is so high it's hard to justify. The lessons are pretty basic, but they're good for an absolute beginner (like me). One reason I prefer Pimsleur is that I picked up some of the grammar as I went, which I'm not doing as easily with these lessons. I find that understanding grammar helps me form my own sentences and have conversations in a new language (I got around Italy for 2 weeks with the Pimsleur courses), so I'll probably pick up some books to supplement this course. But overall, I'd recommend this for basic, ""getting-started"" language training.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1N2NEGGJVWDB6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015NXVJJE#wasThisHelpful","R1N2NEGGJVWDB6","A1QXE7OX7MSL2H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1QXE7OX7MSL2H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I haven't used this type of hair wrap before, so I wasn't sure what to expect. I hoped for faster-drying hair and a fast-drying towel. The promise of fewer split ends, etc. from less blow drying time was nice, too. That said, I'm going back to my usual towel unless I'm traveling.This wrap is very thin. The fabric is soft (as you'd expect from microfiber), and while it may hold ""up to seven times its weight in moisture,"" that's not a lot of moisture given the starting weight. I tried wrapping this several different ways over several days (I'm glad another reviewer posted instructions), and never noticed that it did more than my usual towel. It even seemed less effective if I didn't wrap it ""just so.""So while this might be a nice addition at the gym or in hotels with paper-thin towels, I don't see this as being of much use at home.

"Otterbox cases are my go-to for protecting my phone, so I had high expectations of this one. Another reviewer put it well when s/he described this as ""Otterbox lite"" - it's definitely a lightweight case with about half the usual Otterbox protection. It does fit well, and all the ports are easy to access. The inserts are a (kind of) cool idea, but they're definitely gimmicky. For this price, I'd expect the case to come with 2 or 3 inserts, at least, especially considering they seem pretty cheap and flimsy.If you're going for a decorative case, this one has some decent options.

"What I liked:1. Gorgeous photos. This cookbook is as much eye candy as it is inspiration. If you're a cook who likes to browse a cookbook by the pictures to find your dinner ideas, this one does not disappoint. Most recipes include full-page photos of the finished dish.2. Recipe layout. I appreciate having the ingredients in bold on the left, with the instructions spelled out in easy-to-read, short paragraphs alongside. Especially nice is that none of the recipes require a page flip, which is particularly helpful considering the long ingredients lists a lot of them have. Flipping back and forth for amounts and process could get tedious mid-recipe.3. Seasonal menus. Using seasonally-fresh ingredients really puts the emphasis on flavor, and Cogswell makes it easy to pick and choose by what you've found at the market.4. Complete dinners. Menu ideas for each season give you the entree and sides in one recipe set, so it's simple to make a complete meal without mixing and matching or tagging multiple pages. That said, you can do that, too - she makes the point that her menus are just guidelines.5. Non-traditional recipes. Peaches and cream salad for summer, lobster and celery root bisque for winter, or roasted monkfish with farro risotto for fall, are all examples.What I didn't like so much:1. Organization. This is my biggest challenge with this cookbook. While Cogswell explains that she's divided the recipes into menus (2 for each season), the menu organization doesn't make sense to me since they're not ""complete meals."" Rather, they're a collection of (I assume) related recipes that could be combined to make a meal. For example, Menu 2 for summer includes two appetizers, three entrees, and a dessert. Menu 1 includes 2 appetizers, a salad, 3 entrees, and a dessert. Why are these on separate menus? Cogswell points out that we can pick and choose from each menu, so why not group ""summer appetizers,"" ""summer entrees,"" and ""summer desserts"" together?2. Dinner only. There are no recipes I'd cook for meals other than dinner, so look elsewhere for New England breakfast/lunch/brunch/party ideas.3. Techniques are only sort of explained. The recipes assume a certain level of kitchen knowledge (how to tell if pistachios are toasted, for example, or what ""stiff peaks"" are in beating egg whites. I wouldn't gift this cookbook to a beginner. (But a regional, restaurant-inspired cookbook like this one is rarely for beginners, is it?)4. Not simple. None of these recipes are ""quick"" or ""easy"" meals for a busy weeknight. I'm never going to pull this cookbook out at the last minute or when I need something foolproof. This cookbook is a weekend companion for experimentation for me (still working my way up to pumpkin pana cotta with cinnamon whipped cream and honeycomb candy, for example).As a gift for experienced cooks, this cookbook would be excellent. As inspiration to experiment with interesting ingredients and flavors, this would be, again, a winner. As a practical, everyday cookbook - keep looking.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RR4ADU2I3616A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1624141773#wasThisHelpful","RR4ADU2I3616A","A1QXE7OX7MSL2H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1QXE7OX7MSL2H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I've previously used other scents of this spray when I lived in an apartment. It was great for that, especially when we had overnight guests. My husband took this bottle to work, where four men share a small, single bathroom in a very small space. They've used Lysol and an ozone product in the past, but those haven't really done away with the bathroom smells. Lighting a match works pretty well, but doesn't always do the job.According to his report, this does a very good job not of masking the smells (like Lysol does), but actually preventing them. He gave it 3.5 stars, though, since he said the fragrance is ""very strong"" (even with just 2 pumps instead of the recommended 3-5), and ""overwhelming"" in an enclosed space. But given the choice between bathroom smells and this fragrance, the guys apparently choose this. I suspect they'll be ordering another bottle with a different fragrance when this one runs out (I liked the Deja Poo fragrance when I used it before).","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/REBMLE74QLVC9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0108XRHJU#wasThisHelpful","REBMLE74QLVC9","A1QXE7OX7MSL2H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1QXE7OX7MSL2H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"We recently installed this range in a kitchen island during a renovation. The installation specs and instructions were spot-on, making the electrical, gas plumbing, carpentry, and counter fabricator's jobs less complicated. (The range does have a small overhang on the sides to prevent food from falling between the range and counters, so make sure to take that into account in your design.)Functionally, I'm (mostly) thrilled with my new range. Burners light quickly without the large flare some gas burners exhibit, and the gas burns evenly. The ovens heat quickly, and I don't notice the kitchen overheating like it used to with my 2-year-old oven in my last house. The oven doors open smoothly, without the hard tug some doors require, and they stay open until you're ready to close them. This latter seems like a small thing until you have a door that constantly wants to close on you while you're sliding a heavy pan onto the racks.I've deducted one star because the oven temperature seems to consistently be low. Not only do cookies and biscuits take 3-7 minutes longer than usual, my thermometer shows the temperature is several degrees off. I haven't yet looked into anyway to address this (just finishing the renovations), but I expect a range this expensive to work as advertised on installation.Side note:I expect to use the top oven 90% of the time, but am thrilled to have the bottom oven when I need something bigger or a second dish. For those who are debating whether the double oven is worth it - I'd say for me, it definitely is. I'm very happy I went ahead with this instead of a single oven, even with the greater expense.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RXGFZ5AQIGLVH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ET0M2GM#wasThisHelpful","RXGFZ5AQIGLVH","A1QXE7OX7MSL2H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1QXE7OX7MSL2H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"We had this hood installed on 9-foot ceilings at a height of about 31"" over a GE Profile gas range (1 inch higher than the instructions recommend).1. Appearance. The vent cover came dented in one place, but it was covered by another piece so I didn't trouble to contact the company. Although the vent was hung straight, the cover installed slightly skewed, so it took considerable adjustment to get things looking straight.2. Installation. The installers mentioned that this was one of the better vent hoods they've installed, and said they were impressed by the inner workings. They compared it to high-end Thermidor hoods they installed, and said the only difference they noticed were some cosmetic differences.3. Functions. I love having the controls on front and back, and the buttons on both sides are very responsive. The four lights are very much on the cool side, glowing blue when on (I'd guess they're around 1500K color temperature, maybe even cooler. I'd definitely prefer warmer lights.)4. Ease of use. Nothing complicated about this range, including removing and cleaning the baffles. I'm very impressed with how easy they are to clean, in fact, unlike other hoods I've seen.5. Performance. This vent does draw smoke and grease pretty well, even at 31"". That said, I can tell NO difference between levels 1 and 4, either in performance or noise. It works as well as I'd expected an island hood to work, given the height and air currents.6. Noise. It's supposed to be 1.5 Sones at level 1, going up to 6 Sones at level 4, but there's absolutely no discernable difference. Instead, it's a constant loud hum no matter what level it's on. I'd love to leave it on level 1 to finish venting during dinner, but it's too loud in our open floor plan. I'd compare it to a very loud garbage disposal (in loudness, not type of noise), whereas I'd expected the hum of a loud refrigerator level 1. We're VERY disappointed by this aspect.Overall, it's a decent hood for the price, with a much higher CFM and stainless baffles, unlike comparably-priced hoods. But the noise, lack of performance variation from level 1-4, and quirky installation deduct 2 stars.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1T0F3E16SD6HZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009D68NSI#wasThisHelpful","R1T0F3E16SD6HZ","A1QXE7OX7MSL2H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1QXE7OX7MSL2H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"When I first tried these lids, I was ready to give them a glowing, five-star review. Placing them on a bowl resulted in a nearly-instant, tight seal, and they're endlessly reusable (and dishwasher safe). I could see my days of wrestling with plastic wrap coming to a close.Now after using them for a while, I'm much less impressed. Sure, they seal to perfectly round bowls smaller than their own diameter (makes sense). That said, if I put a dish in the fridge at night, half the time the seal's gone by morning. At first I thought it was just warm dishes causing this, but I tried it with cold dishes, too. In both cases, condensation collects on the underside and the seal vanishes. The three sizes are also too small for many of my bowls, so their overall use is pretty limited.Another disappointment is that these don't seal even a little bit on bowls with any kind of pouring lip, even when the lip is also fully covered and seamless with the lid. Again, this makes sense, but that means half my bowls can't be used with these lids. This isn't a design flaw, but something to consider if you like to use lipped bowls, like I do.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2C4CLU8IWM312/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00L291QVK#wasThisHelpful","R2C4CLU8IWM312","A1QXE7OX7MSL2H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1QXE7OX7MSL2H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Edit: I also received dish towels in the same pattern, but the reviews appear to mixed up with the apron reviews. I'd give the dish towels only 2 stars, since they're pretty but not functional. Instead of drying dishes, they just kind of smear the water around. So even more than the apron, they're more decorative than functional.Original review:Cute, nicely-made apron! The color (mustard) was just as it appears in the description. Fabric is heavy and stitching seems fairly secure. There were  a few loose threads, but the seams appear tight.What I liked:1. Well made, as mentioned above.2. Functional pockets! It's really handy to have pockets in the apron, and I wish more aprons had such deep, wide pockets.3. Decorative. This apron is attractive enough to stay on display when not in use.4. Good coverage. Unlike some aprons, this one covers enough of my shirt front to actually do its job of protecting my clothes.5. Adjustable. I'm 5'4"", so most aprons hang much too low in front to be useful. I like that this one's neck length is adjustable, so I can shorten it as needed.Why it's only 3 stars:While the adjustable neck is great, it's also the biggest design flaw. The neck and waist ties are one continuous piece of fabric, so tightening the waist ties tightens the neck. This results in pulling on your neck as another reviewer noted, and there's no waistline at all. What's even more annoying to me is that when you go to hang the apron after use, your only option is to hang it by the neck loop. So the neck loop loosens and the apron droops on the hook, then you have to readjust everything every time you put it on.A relatively quick fix would be to sew the neck ties in place once it's adjusted to your preference. Sadly, this also negates one of the benefits of this apron. It might work for some people, though.Note that the fabric is only printed on one side, so you'll want to adjust the folds if you don't want the white backside showing when you display it. Note, too, that I haven't washed this yet, so I'll update my review if it washes poorly.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3EJZY7HBFRE63/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00I5IVJ9U#wasThisHelpful","R3EJZY7HBFRE63","A1QXE7OX7MSL2H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1QXE7OX7MSL2H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I took a chance ordering this rug, disregarding ""you get what you pay for."" Knowing that monitors can vary in how they show color, I took care to view this rug on three different devices. On all three, the dark brown appears... dark brown. The tan appears... tan. Likewise the other colors. When it arrived, I actually wondered if I'd been sent the right rug. The dark brown was a medium mud color, and the tan was a yellow beige (VERY yellow). The blues and greens were completely washed out, all leaning toward the very yellow end of the spectrum. What looks like a ""cool"" brown rug with distinct tan, blue, and green was actually a yellowy-beige wash of blah.If the wrong colors hadn't decided me, the cheap quality would have. This is the thinnest rug I've seen of this type, even including rugs hanging at Home Depot.

"I have a smallish obsession with perfectly sharpened pencils, and my old sharpener started eating the pencil leads (I assume the blades were getting dull).

"Both our picky cats love these treats. I appreciate that they're 100% salmon and made without additives. The treats in the bag I received wasn't too crumbly or dusty, but maybe I got lucky.Unlike other reviewers, I haven't had an issue with the cats' receptivity to the new design. This could be because I spent the last year switching to a Wysong rotation diet, which changes the cats' food every few days. I've noticed they're a lot less picky since I did that, as if they're more receptive to different flavors. If your cat is used to the same things every day and you used the old treats, these new treats might not work anymore.

"I really wanted to like this book. This is a genre I usually enjoy, the world seemed intriguing, and it was nice to have a strong female lead for what is basically the standard commoner-saves-the-world plotline. Given the summary, I wasn't expecting anything epic or especially complex, but rather a fast-paced adventure with strong characters and interesting plot twists. In the end, I was disappointed.-- Plot -- The plot, while pretty straightforward, actually managed to get confusing - not because of interesting twists, but because the storytelling was choppy, disconnected, and uneven. I kept wondering where the editor had gotten to when this book was coming along, since it seemed like entire paragraphs were misplaced or pointless. And the flow from beginning to end didn't follow a logical story arc, but that's because of the...-- Narrative -- Far worse, the author repeatedly tells us about significant developments rather than showing them to us, making for a very, very dull narrative. The storytelling, itself, has some great moments, particularly at the beginning. Sadly, whole chapters of the story are replaced by italicized plot summaries (written a lot like a Star Wars movie intro) that gloss over character development, world-building, and even actual action. ** minor spoiler** For example, chapter 2 is prefaced by a quick synopsis of several years of the main character's life, telling us that she changed her attitude twice, learned a lot, and discovered that she was ""brighter than some of the other Chosen."" We're then introduced to a main character who has very little in common with that of chapter 1, and I was left wondering why chapter 1 existed. **end spoiler** This happens again and again - geography gets explained, history laid out, action sequences sketched with the most cursory attention. The effect is to make the book incredibly episodic, like a season of Xena, Warrior Princess (without far less character development). Which brings us to...-- Characters -- A weak plot can be saved by great characters. But even the eponymous character was one-dimensional and, frankly, boring. I frequently forgot who was who simply because they all talk and act the same, until the author reminds us why we're supposed to like or hate that character. But rather than subtly reminding us by something the character actually does or says, the author simply... tells us the person is good or bad. Making it worse, some character interactions make no sense. **spoiler** Irona's son, for example, is alternately pleasant or a hellion, but Irona responds exactly the same. Maybe this is supposed to reflect maternal feelings, but if someone saves my life and then says he's going off to rape some prisoners, I'm going to feel at least a teensy bit conflicted and might actually follow up on that later. Irona just goes back to moping about how she doesn't understand her son. And what's with the rape scene? Irona shows virtually no reaction other than a few lines of ""gee, how terrible that was,"" and never once does the story speculate on why it happened. Your lover has probably been possessed, definitely rapes you, and likely falls off a cliff. Maybe you want to look into that, just a smidge? How about when he starts leaving you messages from the grave? No? Just going to act like none of it happened? Huh, okay. **end spoiler**-- World building -- This world has some great potential. Looking past the Disney names (Maleficence, Craver, and Caprice are among the named gods, who each act exactly as named. A backwater town is named Brackish. Yes, I am serious.), the evil magic kingdom and its mysterious inhabitants could really pack a narrative punch. The king of kings and his elaborate family sound intriguing. Even the inner workings of the hero's kingdom could offer excitement. But instead of giving us depth, the author barely explains any of it. This would be fine for fringe elements, but at least color in the main plot points. **spoiler** For example, the ""fixes"" that play such a key role are completely vague, but not in a deliberately shadowy way. They're simply unexplained, and we're supposed to know that they're something no one is supposed to have, but everyone does. Even Podakan's ""journey to evilness"" remains unexplained. Was he created from an evil seed? Was he a normal kid that heard voices? Did he only become evil when killed by the bad guy? We'll never know. **end spoiler**I could go on about the rushed, 24-page climax and denouement, or the terrible love scenes*, or the constant, bizarre ""leering,"" or how emotionlessly deeply emotional scenes are told (**spoiler** not just the rape, but Jamarko's betrayal of 680, or Vly's death **end spoiler**), or a whole bunch of issues. When I finished the book, though, I realized it's utterly forgettable. I don't regret reading it, so two stars for that. But I can't recommend it, and I won't look at a sequel.*Actual text: ""She wanted to drag him off to bed right away, but she mustn't"" and ""[She was surprised that] a lover could be diffident, attentive, and obedient in public, but insistent, tyrannical, and irresistible in bed"" and ""Fatigue forgotten, she was going to rush Vly straight home to bed, *rip* off his tunic, and *ravish* him.""

"Like other Avery products in this line, these plastic pockets are great for making sections of my home binders really pop. They're generously sized, so the tabs poke out far enough to be seen even past slightly-oversized documents. The pockets hold around 10 sheets of paper easily, and the plastic seems durable enough not to rip with normal use. (I'll update this review if this changes)My biggest issue with these pockets is that the plastic is so flimsy. They have about the same bend as a piece of paper, so they don't hold papers very securely. They're also too flimsy to make flipping around the binder easy, like the old-style paper pockets did. I also find that the holes usually get stuck as I'm turning sections, so I have to constantly adjust them.Note that the product description refers to a ""Unique tab design keeps inserts from falling out."" This does NOT refer to the pocket design, which has no features to keep your papers in place. Instead, it's talking about the little tab on the side, where you insert your labels. I'm not sure what the ""unique design"" is since they look like every other tab I've seen, but my labels have stayed in just fine if I use appropriately-sized labels.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1HZ3QNKTIYOV5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00V2M9O98#wasThisHelpful","R1HZ3QNKTIYOV5","A1QXE7OX7MSL2H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1QXE7OX7MSL2H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm using these bookmarks in a couple of binders for a home renovation, and they've turned out to be pretty helpful. They're easy to spot inside the binder, given both the bright colors and the ample length (they poke out above the binder's edge, in fact). For just marking a spot in the binder, they're great.I wasn't familiar with ""snap-in"" inserts, so for anyone else who may be fuzzy on this - it simply means the binder holes are slit to allow the bookmark to be moved without opening the clips. This isn't really a feature I find terribly helpful, since I don't find opening the binder clips to be that big a deal when I need to move something. (Over-stuffed binders could make opening the clips a nuisance, so others might really like this feature.) BUT if you turn to the section you want by grabbing the top of the bookmark, you're likely to pull the bookmark at least partially out of the holes. I find this annoying, and spend more time re-inserting the bookmarks than I'd spend opening/closing the binder clips. But they're also too flimsy to use them for turning back and forth between sections, so...If you're only using these as decorative placeholders, they're pretty useful. If you want to use them to flip among sections, look elsewhere.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1WIP9UP3QN2WZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00X7HWY6G#wasThisHelpful","R1WIP9UP3QN2WZ","A1QXE7OX7MSL2H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1QXE7OX7MSL2H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The light I received doesn't match the specs in the listing. According to the box, this lamp is 20"" tall and comes with a 50w bulb - which is what I received. What I liked: the dimming function works very well, and the head also adjusts easily for directional task lighting. The finish is a very matte nickel, with noticeably less sheen than, say, my satin nickel switchplates or doorknobs from a big box store. The shiny finish pictured in the listing isn't even close. I actually prefer the matte finish of this lamp, and find it doesn't show any fingerprints.What I didn't like so much:I agree with another reviewer that the action on this lamp can stutter, and probably won't stand up to daily use. I also found that the base isn't quite heavy enough to keep the lamp from lifting off the desk when I'm raising the arm. This can be mitigated by unscrewing the adjustment knob almost all the way, but it's still not terribly stable.My biggest issue with this lamp is that the swing arm wobbles side-to-side no matter how I adjust or tighten the base pin.

"Digital planners only do so much for me, so I'm always looking for a great paper planner. This one came at just the right time, when I decided to start a new project mid-year, and wanted a dedicated planner for it.If you like this size planner (which I really do), this is a solid choice. Each week has a two-page spread with plenty of room for daily notes, plus one additional space for general notes for the week. The month pages also span two pages, and include major and minor holidays in bright orange print (so that stand out well when you're scanning the month). The month pages also have space for additional notes, plus little calendars of the previous and next months. I love this last feature, especially, so I don't have to flip around as much when planning multi-week schedules.The back has several lined pages for notes, plus a list of holidays by date for four years (!), including what day of the week each holiday will fall on. There's also one page for a one-year at-a-glance event calendar, and a surprisingly handy map of US time zones and area codes (although I'll probably still just use the internet for that stuff).The cover is thick enough to provide support without being too rigid, and it looks great. My only quibbles are that the pages don't turn as easily as I'd like, and I have to futz with the cover to re-close it after it's been opened front-to-back. I think the wire binding is a little too small for it to work perfectly. Also the plastic sleeve for loose paper is nice, but too small to hold a lot, and papers are likely to slide right out if not secured with a paperclip.But all in all, this is a great planner that I'm likely to use a lot.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3D4XZJTNS353Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UCC4WUA#wasThisHelpful","R3D4XZJTNS353Y","A1QXE7OX7MSL2H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1QXE7OX7MSL2H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This dryer has all the features I've been looking for in a travel dryer: folding handle, retractable cord, cool shot button, variable heat & air, dual voltage, and concentrator attachment. I'm indifferent to the ""ionic conditioning"" gimmick, since I've never found it makes a difference in any dryer I've used. This dryer is also relatively lightweight, which helps with carry-on weight. So overall, it's a decent travel companion.There are few reasons it's only a travel dryer for me, though, and will never replace my everyday dryer:1. It only dries my collar bone-length hair decently if it's on high heat and high air. Anything lower, and not only does it take a while, but my hair just goes flat. So essentially, I only ever use one setting even though it has more.2. The concentrator doesn't concentrate enough. I'm accustomed to a much tighter shot of air from these attachments. This one does focus the air a little, but not as much as I like.3. Even on the high settings, my hair never looks quite a good as with my Croc dryer. I tried alternating them in case humidity or something else was impacting this, but my Conair days are consistently less satisfying.Because it's still better than other travel dryers I've used (especially at this price), I'm likely to use this dryer for short trips, when I'm only taking a carry-on. If I'm checking a bag, or my hair really matters to me for a certain trip (like a wedding), I'll probably lug the heavy, big Croc out.

"These types of produce keepers are a great idea solution you don't eat all your produce before it goes bad. Like other reviewers, I have something similar built into my refrigerator drawers, so this keeper is a nice addition for extra produce on the shelves. It's nicely sized for a pint of strawberries (I received the small size). The build is typical, solid OXO quality, exactly what I would expect from this brand. Assembly is ridiculously easy.  Although nothing in the packaging tells me it's dishwasher-safe, I ran it through my dishwasher with no problems (sanitized it, even).I was disappointed in the packaging, since all it says is basically a repeat of the marketing language. More helpful would have been an explanation of what produce needs high vs. low humidity, produce care tips, or something else educational. There's also no explanation of the slider under the lid, and I'm hoping a reader can explain to me what that's all about (it doesn't have any apparent function, just... sliding...). Note, too, that the ""optimal humidity level"" option is just ""open"" or ""closed."" From the description, it sounded to me like there were, say, three or four settings for different types of produce. Nope, just two. So if your fridge drawer has more settings, you might find it more useful for long-term produce storage.Of course, this keeper means you have one more filter to buy and remember to replace, and one more piece of kitchenware to keep clean. You can sign up for OXO's reminder service or just set a reminder on your calendar - but you still have to remember/buy regularly for this to work. If this isn't a problem for you, and your fridge drawers aren't enough, you might find this a perfect solution.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R8M0KJ65BBRS7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TO8X3B2#wasThisHelpful","R8M0KJ65BBRS7","A1QXE7OX7MSL2H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1QXE7OX7MSL2H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I've been using the Schick Hydro Silk razor for a while, since that gives me the best shave I've found so far. So I'll compare this razor to that one, to give a sense for how it stacks up.1. Size. The Remington is overall bigger than the Schick, both in size and heft. Anyone who likes a heavier razor or feels that the Schick is flimsy might like the Remington better. That said, the larger Remington head means it doesn't maneuver as nicely in tight corners. Winner: Schick, but only by a little.2. Hold. The Remington sits nicely in the hand, with good balance and shape. The Schick also has nice balance, and only suffers in a side-by-side comparison. But this razor is very comfortable to use, with good grippiness when wet. Winner: Remington.3. Accessories. Both come with shower holders, but the Remington's holder is huge by comparison. It also requires you to ""click"" the razor in and out of place, so a less-than-perfect suction will make the holder pop off the wall when you're removing the razor. The Schick's holder has a tiny footprint and relies only on gravity to hold the razor. I've never had it come off the wall in the year+ that I've used it. Winner: Schick. (that said, you can probably use your Schick holder with your Remington razor. Just sayin'.)4. Price. These razors appear to be priced about the same, until you get to refill blades. The Schick refills are almost twice as expensive (based on Amazon prime pricing at the time of this review). Winner: Remington by a mile.5. Shaving action. Both have great pivoting heads that maneuver easily over knees and ankles. Neither gave me any cuts or nicks. Both gave me perfect, smooth shaves. BUT when I got out of the shower, I found that the Remington had given me razor burn up and down both legs. I haven't had that happen anytime in memory, and I chalk it up to the plastic head and lack of ""moisture strip"", although it could be that the six blades actually shave a little too close. In fairness, I don't use shaving cream, so those that do may not have any problems with razor burn. But the Schick never gives me the slightest irritation, even when I only shave with soap and/or water. Winner: SchickSo between these two razors, the choice seems to depend on whether a person uses shaving cream and/or minds the higher price of the Schick refills. But I can probably buy a whole lot of shaving cream for the price difference, so it may be worth a trial to get the same performance.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RBX7SZMLMNAW9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00T7V7XHG#wasThisHelpful","RBX7SZMLMNAW9","A1QXE7OX7MSL2H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1QXE7OX7MSL2H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is another great Holmes air purifier, working much as the floor versions do. I really like that the ""select your filter"" feature that these air purifiers have, so I can decide whether I'm more worried about allergens, odors, or general dust.

This purifier is ""desktop"" only in that it sits horizontally instead of vertically. I'd need a pretty big desk/nightstand/bookshelf to hold this without crowding everything else. The box and packaging actually don't say anything about this as a ""desktop"" purifier, so that's in the online description only.

"Unlike the other reviewers, I haven't had any luck with this weed killer. At first, I was very happy with the spray trigger action and how easy this was to apply. I've found that Roundup triggers seem to get stuck or have weak spraying action, so this was a nice surprise. But the nice surprises ended there.I sprayed liberally on the weeds during a warm, sunny day, with no rain expected for the next week. Within 24 hours, I noticed the weeds had browned a little, but a week later they all look lush and healthy again. I expect two-three treatments within a few days would be needed to be effective (unlike Roundup, which kills everything first try). Not only does reapplication take more time, it also makes this weed killer much more expensive over time. I'll update this review if I'm able to kill the weeds with 2-3 applications closely spaced.So if you're concerned with killing your grass along with the weeds, and you don't mind extra applications, this may be just the thing. If you're only concerned with killing the weeds first go-round, you might want to keep looking.","2.0 out of 5 stars","March 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3RNY35VI09Q9Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005LD2CR0#wasThisHelpful","R3RNY35VI09Q9Q","A1QXE7OX7MSL2H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1QXE7OX7MSL2H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We live in a 1923 house with plaster walls, which we've discovered spell the end of wifi signal indoors. Although our router and modem are centrally located and our house is only 1,900 sq. ft., we had no signal at either end of the house. I'd tried another brand of extender with no improvement, so I had low hopes for this one. But this range extender actually solved the problem completely.As others have noted, setup isn't completely seamless. My first attempt failed, but all I had to do was reboot my router & modem once, then everything worked exactly as promised. We now have four bars at the furthest point from the router.I was unhappy briefly when we lost power once and I couldn't get the extender to work again. I couldn't find anything in the documentation to help, but the fix was simple. I just used a paperclip in the ""reset"" button on the side of the extender and ran through setup again. I'd hate to have to do this every time we lose power, but at least I didn't have to reboot the router & modem this time around.I haven't used the audio capabilities, so can't speak to how well that's implemented. But as an extender, I'd recommend this highly.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R12RWA7Q8CQJ40/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SSSCAZE#wasThisHelpful","R12RWA7Q8CQJ40","A1QXE7OX7MSL2H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1QXE7OX7MSL2H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Since bone meal is bone meal, this product is really rated based on the packaging and ease-of-use. I was a little skeptical about how easy the bag would be to use, but it turned out that the built-in ""handle"" made spreading the bone meal really easy. Having the screw-on cap also meant I could use only what I needed and store the container without worrying about spilling or moisture. The only mild caveat I had with this product was that the hole for dispensing was a little small. The bone meal sometimes clumped a little when pouring, but this was easily solved by shaking the bag a little. Overall, I really liked the spreadability and ease-of-use. I'd definitely get this again.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RI9MV1Z3SB9BG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N6XE1GC#wasThisHelpful","RI9MV1Z3SB9BG","A1QXE7OX7MSL2H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1QXE7OX7MSL2H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a decent spot cleaner that's not too heavy, but the performance and build were disappointing. I had a SpotBot for many years and really liked it, but gave it up when I moved cross country. I'll compare this machine to that one, since that's the spot cleaner I'm most familiar with.What I liked:1. The internal heater to maintain water temperature was a nice idea. (That said, I'm not really sure it made any difference in cleaning.)2. The size is fairly compact, which makes this easy to store. It's a little smaller than the Spotbot, but not by a lot3. The handle is rubberized and comfortable for carrying.4. The hose is plenty long enough for cleaning a fair sized area without moving the unit. I believe it's longer than the hose on the Spotbot, although it also seems narrower in diameter and less flexible.5. The attachments, cord, and hose store neatly on the unit.What I didn't like as much:1. This unit seems heavy for true portability (over 8.5 pounds by my scale), and of course is heavier when filled. I'd definitely place it on the ground, which might make it awkward for cleaning stairs. The Spotbot had the same problem.2. The suction is mediocre. I used clean water to test out how much would get picked up. I then cleaned by spraying an area and then going over the same area two or three times more without spraying. Two cups of water went into the machine, but only 0.75 were in the dirty water container when I finished. So I left 1.25 cups of water on my carpet, or somewhere inside the machine.3. The hose construction makes suction worse. The bristles make the brush attachments (two of them, the only ones in the package) sit on the carpet so that the nozzle doesn't actually come in contact with the surface. If you tilt the nozzle forward to improve suction, the sprayer sprays all over. So it's not really feasible to spray and suction on the same pass (unlike the Spotbot).4. The sprayer sprays beyond the edges of the nozzle. Even with the bristles squarely on the surface, lots of water comes out either side. Again, this makes one-pass spraying/sucking impossible, but it also means you're using more solution than you need to. It might be more efficient to spray the area once, scrub with the brush all over, and then finally suction two or three times.5. The build quality is less impressive than the Spotbot. The handle on the brushes seem too long for comfort, and the sprayer button feels really flimsy. My water tanks wobble quite a bit, and the rubber tank covers take a lot of fidgeting to close. I suspect there are lots of leak points in this machine that the Spotbot didn't have - and the added product instruction page confirmed this. It includes several ""tips"" on how to keep the unit from leaking.Overall, I'd buy the Spotbot again, but I wouldn't recommend this spot cleaner.","3.0 out of 5 stars","February 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2X8D7OIB48IAS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SBA5N26#wasThisHelpful","R2X8D7OIB48IAS","A1QXE7OX7MSL2H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1QXE7OX7MSL2H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is good, basic pasta in a very useful shape, and having extra protein and fiber added mean less guilt about eating such a starchy food. It cooks up at about the same rate as regular pasta, and seems interchangeable with all my regular pastas as far as quality and ""toothiness."" That said, this pasta definitely has more of a starchy flavor, making dishes seem a little drier and bland. (This really surprised me, since I expected *less* starchiness.) The difference is made up for by adding a little more water and seasoning than usual, so it's not a deal-breaker.

"I've been using this morning and night under La Mer creme and Algenist Genius cream, respectively. Like other similar products I've used, I put a little in my palms and pressed the treatment onto my skin after cleansing, then let it soak in before applying moisturizer. Previously, I've used La Mer and Algenist serums, serums/toners from various other brands like Fresh and Jurlique, a couple of facial oils, and plain old mineral water under my moisturizer to help with product penetration and moisture. I've never noticed any ""brightening,"" ""smoothing,"" or other benefits from any of the serums or oils, despite their claims. This one is no different.What I liked:1. There's very little fragrance, and what little there is fades very quickly.2. My moisturizer goes on nicely after I apply this treatment. Not any better than anything else I've used, but it's fine for that3. It didn't cause my skin to break out. I tend to be sensitive to new products, but this one didn't bother me at all4. The product absorbs quickly and completely. There's no tackiness or feeling of ""product"" once it soaks in.What I didn't like:1. The bottle came unsealed in an unsealed box. This is cut-rate packaging for a VERY expensive product, and of course it does nothing to protect product integrity.2. Neither the box nor the bottle had any instructions of any kind, and there was no insert with instructions. If you're at all bewildered by what to do with this product or what's in it (what's ""pitera essence"" anyway?), you'll have to look online (or talk to a rep at the store and hope they know)3. While it didn't cause break-outs or oily shine, it also did... nothing else. This treatment gives every appearance of being nothing more than water, for all the effect it had. When I went online to figure out what it was *supposed* to be doing, I had to laugh. Based on the marketing hype, I'd expect some sort of facial miracle from this treatment. Based on experience with other brands, I'd expect at least a little smoothing/brightening. But what I got was no different from spritzing my face with mineral water.Maybe this product does something if used for months, but I'm not willing to pony up the price tag to find out. I'll happily pay for a product that works (like La Mer), but I can't recommend this one.","2.0 out of 5 stars","February 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3ES5QG1BXZZTS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000H723LU#wasThisHelpful","R3ES5QG1BXZZTS","A1QXE7OX7MSL2H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1QXE7OX7MSL2H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I use my pizza stone for everything, including cooking sweet potatoes (delicious!), and that means lots of stuck-on mess. It never occurred to me to purchase a just-for-the-pizza-stone cleaner, but it seems like a great idea. However, I was disappointed by this.First off, the scraper part is pretty unpleasant to use. It feels like metal-on-metal and sounds equally awful. My husband commented that was as bad sounding as fingernails on chalkboard. When I do clean my stone, which sadly is not often enough, I use a dough cutter, and I pulled it out and compared the two. The dough cutter, though it has a similar edge, must be smoother, and it cuts through burnt on remains more cleanly and without the awful feeling. This scraper is also pretty small, so it's more work, and I can't get as much leverage with it being on the end of the long brush. So, on that score, this tool was a fail for me.The brush does a pretty good job, but it leaves a lot of residue behind that one needs to clean up with something else. I use a small (and cheap) mini-broom and a paper towel for that job.So, this works fine, but I wouldn't recommend it.","2.0 out of 5 stars","November 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2O6S4ERMT3PE2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N0L5QLO#wasThisHelpful","R2O6S4ERMT3PE2","AU0LLORGK9IDR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AU0LLORGK9IDR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm an artist who also does crafts and loves to fool around with different mediums and materials. When I want to cut shapes, usually for handmade envelopes, personalized gift cards, and the like, I use a scissor, an x-acto blade, a self-healing mat, a rotary cutter or a paper cutter. I make little books and recently I've been making tiny drawings with glass cabochons over them. Those were driving me a bit crazy because cutting out perfect little circles is not easy, even with all the cutting tools I own.In the midst of my frustration, I was offered this machine as a member of the Vine Program. I figured I'd pass but then thought better of it. It was the solution to my circle-cutting problems! Ideas of what else I'd do with the machine danced through my head, and I was excited.Setting it up was pretty difficult. Maybe I'm a dolt, but since I have no experience with a machine such as this and have never seen one in person, I wasn't really sure what was what. The instruction booklet is not very good. It is for many different models, the pictures often do not correspond to this one, and for some procedures one has to jump from section to section way to much for ease of understanding. Since I'm not especially technically inclined, I have found referring to the instruction manual very frustrating every time I've had a problem with the machine, not just with the set-up.Nonetheless, I did get the machine up and running. The first time I did a test, it did not cut. The second time, after adjusting the blade, it cut into the mat quite far. It took a lot of fiddling to get it right. Not the biggest deal, but my mat is already quite beat up, and I really wonder why it can't be made out of a self-healing material. But, I do not know if any of the competitors use that, so it's neither here nor there, I suppose. Still, I can see that the mat will need to be replaced often.I was thrilled to play with the pre-set patterns that are in the generally easy-to-use touchpad. For making collages and decorations, this machine is a blast. I pulled out all sorts of papers and had some easy fun for a few days.It's when I wanted to get down to business that things got wonky. Perhaps I wanted to do stuff that was too advanced too quickly. I succeeded in cutting out all my little circles, but when I tried to set up a page of shapes that were all lined up properly on a 12 x 12 page for a display that was behind the cut-outs, I had this experience: I tried cutting the same page of shapes 16 separate times and only two of those times the ""margin"" was the same! That's a real problem. I don't know if this is my particular machine, but that's what happened. So, after wasting a lot of high quality paper on that experiment (which I should have photographed before throwing away, for it's hard to explain), I just gave up. I was really stressed and frustrated and that's one reason I forgot to take photos. For those with low technical problem frustration thresholds, be advised!The next day I scanned some totally clean line drawing templates for fancy hand made envelopes. The scanning function is even wonkier! It picks up the slightest things like minute differences in the paper, dust, and who knows what. I spent hours trying to figure out how to set the machine to scan a perfectly good image that scanned clean in my regular scanner. The manual just frustrated me even more, as the instructions for scanning are definitely not appropriate for this model (unless I'm really missing something). Finally, even though the scanner missed one object completely, I got two out of the three scanned images on the mat perfectly well, saved them, and cut them out.The cutting is beautiful. That I'm delighted with.I've found the machine highly frustrating because I see its potential and there's so much one can do, but I find it's not as precise as I imagine it should be and it's got a steep learning curve. I wish that the touchscreen would show the measurements of the mat at 400% and not doing so seems an oversight. I wish the instructions were better. The instructions on YouTube that I've seen are excellent.I didn't try the rhinestone kit because I have no interest or knowledge of this kind of thing. It seems superfluous as an ""extra"" for this machine; the $50 online activation card would have been a better extra and really should have been included in a package of this price.I have a Chromebook, so I wasn't able to hook it up to the machine, but I can see that using this with a computer would open up a lot of possibilities.I am concerned about the lack of availability of the extras and even essentials one needs for this unit. I am very interested in printing stickers and while I know one can do it oneself (I tried), the sticker kit sounds like a better idea for a beginner. Only the pricey starter package was available last week. This one thing made me wonder if a machine like Cricut might be better for most people, but as I have no experience with it, I can't say for sure.Lastly, even with my limited experience, I think this machine is probably best if you're cutting out discreet shapes that don't need to align to things perfectly. It does a great job of cutting. I think it would be wise for an potential consumer to do a lot of research into which is the best machine for their money and desired use. I am not sure my review is that helpful except for saying that and propose that this is not the machine for a rank beginner such as myself. Two women in a knitting group I belong to rave about their Cricut machines and for a beginner, it's probably great to have a friend to guide them. Just something to think about. I rather wanted to give it three stars, but I ""like it"" more than think it's just ""okay"".Addendum: I'm not amending my review, but adding this: Today I spent the entire day fooling around with the pre-set designs. I cut out all sorts of designs and glued them to envelopes I'd made using my own templates. The results were so professional that my husband said I might have trouble convincing people they were handmade. I'm really pretty smitten with this machine, frustrations and all, but that may be that I'm smitten with what machines like this can do. Anyway, I'm enjoying using it very much. It's a creativity enhancing machine, even if it's not perfect! Added a photo of a pile o' stuff I cut out. I'm having a blast!","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1H7YTVIZBC4CE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014EE7UZ0#wasThisHelpful","R1H7YTVIZBC4CE","AU0LLORGK9IDR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AU0LLORGK9IDR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This charging dock is, simply, ""just okay."" I like the way it looks, though be aware the white in the photo is really a light gray. The difference in the color from the photo was a bit of a shock! However, I was happy to get this because I use my little iPod (yes, an iPod) to listen to music while I'm working and it generally is at the edge of my large desk, just waiting for me to knock it off and crack the glass yet again (sigh). Putting it in the dock while it's hooked up to my Bluetooth speakers is a good way to avoid any more accidents, and looks a lot better, too.However, I was disappointed by the fact that the plug is raised so far up. It sure looked like it would be a nice secure fit for a an iPhone or iPod, but it seems to be designed to accommodate a design with a case on it, yet others complain that it needs modifications for use with their models and/or cases. So, this design isn't ideal for most folks. The high plug  keeps any device from being seated at the bottom of the dock. The device is not steady at all and tapping hard enough for it to register makes the device move backwards quite a bit, enough to be worrisome for the connection.  If all you're using this for is charging your device on a nightstand and perhaps only punching in your code in the morning when the alarm goes off, no big deal. But if you want to do more with your device while it's plugged in, it's not the best choice.Still, perfectly functional and modern looking.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3BC24LLQ1OYJM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00E965FGK#wasThisHelpful","R3BC24LLQ1OYJM","AU0LLORGK9IDR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AU0LLORGK9IDR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've heard so many good things about this series of brushes and am totally disappointed. The first time I used this brush, with watercolors, I noticed that it felt dry. I needed to load it with more water and/or paint  than I normally do to get the paint to flow smoothly. Still, it seemed like a nice little brush with a good tip. Three nights later, it's not holding its point. It's splitting into two separate parts unless it's dripping wet and laying down a wash as big as something over a size 10 brush. This is a size 2! I'm going to put it in my collection for students to fool around with.I've got some two-bucks brushes that held up longer than this one and two painting sessions doing very small work is not a high bar.

"Ever pick up a book that you think you'll love and just can't get into it? Well, that happened to me. I don't have a burning interest in cheese, but I like reading non-fiction about subjects like food. I very much enjoyed all of Michael Pollan's books, for instance. I've read a whole book about olive oil, and one about mushroom foraging.As a member of Amazon Vine, when I was offered this book, I was excited. I live in part of New England where there are many artisan cheese makers. I thought it would be great fun knowing more about the ubiquitous cheddar cheese.Like a blind date that doesn't go right and you can't put your finger on it, I just didn't like the author's writing. I kept trying to read it, really, I did, but every time I put the book down, I found it hard to pick it up again. I tried reading different chapters. Nope.Unfortunately, as a Vine member, I can't pass on reviewing. If I wasn't a Vine member, I would absolutely not review this book, as I don't like to review books which I think are simply not to my taste (like gorgonzola). The author's sense of humor doesn't tickle my funny bone and there's no particular reason for it.So, even though I really found it a slog to read, I give it three stars.

"I originally gave these a poor two-star review, but after washing them twice and using them quite a bit, I've trashed that review (instead of trashing the dishcloths). I didn't like them at first because they were stiff, even with one washing, and seemed to repel water slightly. The very tight weave combined with the ink of the printed design seemed to make them particularly water non-absorbent.I think the color and design are extremely pretty - a combo of modern color and old design that I love - so I kept them hanging up in my kitchen. When I stopped thinking they were dish towels and trying to use them that way, I started using them to dry dishes, cups, and silverware. For that? They are fantastic. That tight weave?

"This is not going to be a technical review because I haven't the qualifications for that. Here's my impressions:Set-up: Unless you already understand how to set up a printer, you may well be baffled by the set-up instructions. Luckily for me, I've set up six new printers in the last year and know the drill. First off, I didn't use the CD with driver that came with it as I had no need. After unboxing and installing the ink cartridges, wi-fi set up was easily done from the touch screen on the printer. I installed the Epson printing app on my iPod and registered with that. Then, on my Chromebook, I set up Epson services, the ability to scan to the Cloud (my Google Drive), and was up and running in less than a half an hour.Then, the great part: Fantastic printing!! First, I simply copied some calligraphy I'd done on cheap ""regular"" printing paper that I buy at the dollar store. The page printed damp, but I was astonished at the color accuracy. I set it down on a table and when I came back and it was dry I was even more astonished as how much it looked like the original hand-lettered calligraphy, ink subtlety and all. Then and there I swore to stop buying cheap paper!I printed out a photograph of some other artwork I'd done only low quality photo paper. It, too, was stunning.I was going to put off writing a review until I'd gotten some better paper, but I can't give this any more than five stars, so why bother? Even with low quality paper, this printer produces stunning prints.This is something of a specialty printer. The Epson XP-950 has a document feeder, fax, and uses the same six colors of vibrant Claria ink. This all-in-one doesn't fax nor does it have a document feeder, but it does print large format prints. For me, that's much more useful than the ""business"" features of the XP-950, but one does have to ask if the price is worth it or if you need the features of the other printer. I'd prefer the large format as I've never (ever!) used a document feeder in my life. I use a printer for scanning and printing artwork and flyers. This isn't true pro quality printing, though it sure comes close and I'm really thrilled with it. Also, the ease of printing from all the devices in my household (Apple, Android, Chromebooks, and Linux) is fantastic!!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2LY1TX2TABNYD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010UU5Y1O#wasThisHelpful","R2LY1TX2TABNYD","AU0LLORGK9IDR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AU0LLORGK9IDR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It was love at first write! I started using a fountain pen a few weeks ago and discovered I had not one piece of paper or any notebooks that were smooth to write on. I love grid paper but read that the popular Rhodia pads' grids are thick. After reading some reviews, I passed on all the usual suspects of pads and got this one. I am delighted that I did!! I tested a page with a number of pens including two that write really wet and none have any bleed or show through. One can write on both sides of the paper and it's a real delight. I didn't realize that the back was blank - what a bonus! Plus, you get cute but subtle Japanese cartoons of how to use the pad on the inside of the cover. Oh, the back is really solid. LOVE it! Enough exclamation points for ya? Ten stars!!! I'll never buy another pad of paper. Too bad it's ten times the cost of the same size pad at my local store. Who cares? It's a small luxury that goes a long, long way. Update: Still love the paper, but I hadn't used a flex nib on it yet. It seems to lay down thicker than on other paper and with a wet flow, using Pelikan Edelstein ink, there is some bleed through, though not enough to get on the next page. Still a great paper. There's no feathering, even with the seemingly thicker line.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R4G7HO1FGKRHV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001A1VB74#wasThisHelpful","R4G7HO1FGKRHV","AU0LLORGK9IDR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AU0LLORGK9IDR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm not going to be too technical because I don't know much about that. There are some excellent technical reviews here and you can read them.Here's my thing: I'm an artist who uses a printer now and again. I really don't need a document feeder (never used one), two-sided printing (never used that, either) or any number of things. I want a printer to be easy-to-use and to print well enough. For really good printing, I send stuff to a professional.I have used Epson printers for well over a decade and went from liking them (not loving them 'cause the ink is so expensive) to hating them. Back in the summer, I bought three different Epson printers, each one successively more expensive, and not one of them worked out of the box. For that, I went and bought a Canon printer. I like it a lot.So, when I was offered this printer as a member of the Vine program, I was hesitant. Truth be told, I needed a second printer for my studio, and I didn't want to be saddled with a non-working printer, even if it was free. Now that is a truly bad pre-review, isn't it?Well, surprise surprise. This one works. I set it up pretty quickly - about a half an hour - but mind you, I'd spent a few weeks setting up similar Epsons during the summer. It works well, easy to set up from a Windows machine. Easy-to-use touchscreen on the unit which makes me happy 'cause I mainly use that as I'm doing lots of copies. Very nice job. I love the six colors of ink.I have yet to try it with my iPhone or Chromebook and if it's problematic I will come back and adjust this review; unfortunately, us Viners have deadlines and this review is due. My apologies.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1GXWBDCNF9IFN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010UU5XSS#wasThisHelpful","R1GXWBDCNF9IFN","AU0LLORGK9IDR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AU0LLORGK9IDR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've used this product four times, twice in the morning and twice at night. I must be allergic to something in it. During the day, my eyes were red. When I woke up in the morning, my eyes were not only red, but my under-eye puffiness was more pronounced. If it weren't for the fact that I'm a Vine member and must do a review, I wouldn't. This is obviously my problem and not the product's per se, though it is rare that I have such strong allergic reactions. Some of my morning eye puffiness is due to allergies and this product either adds or accentuates that, so perhaps this may be a problem for other allergy sufferers.","1.0 out of 5 stars","October 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2GC7CZVVIKMA1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LHZC06E#wasThisHelpful","R2GC7CZVVIKMA1","AU0LLORGK9IDR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AU0LLORGK9IDR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love the sound of this speaker. It has great bass, as expected, It doesn't sound boosted, though I have to admit I did not listen to any pop or dance music. I wanted to try this speaker because I have an art studio that is almost thirty feet long and I've been using an old set of powered AR speakers. There's nary a speaker that I find to be as good. But, I was tired of using up desk space having a device or computer hooked up to the speakers just to have ambient music in the studio. Someone suggested I get bluetooth speakers just as I was offered these (as part of the Vine program).They are perfect for my space. It's a ""loud room"" and it needs a speaker such as this. I can play it very loud (complaints) or softly. It sounds good at both volumes. What was a surprise to me is that podcasts and classical music sounds good. I didn't expect that. I listened to some modern music and discovered I wasn't hearing it clearly before!I'm sorry this isn't a technical review - that I can't offer you. What I can say is that this speaker holds up to a high standard - that AR pair I've had since the 1980's. As far as being portable - well, I wouldn't want to walk anywhere far with it. The ""handle"" is really just an indent that is barely big enough for my fingers to fit into. It is neither comfortable nor secure feeling and the speaker is pretty heavy. It's portable insofar as it's light enough and sturdy enough to toss into the back seat of a car and bring somewhere.It's a good looking speaker. It's rather big for indoors, but it's got big sound. I find the buttons on the top of the speaker redundant and unnecessary and did not find them useful. My iphone's controls worked perfectly. Set-up was a breeze.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1XZKXLPGIJ8HD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014JFMLS0#wasThisHelpful","R1XZKXLPGIJ8HD","AU0LLORGK9IDR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AU0LLORGK9IDR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've never used a Swiffer duster so I can't compare it to them. Upon receiving this product, I immediately used it as the room I was standing in was sorely in need of dusting. I have a cat and I work with textiles, so dusting is something I need to do frequently. But, I don't, so there was a LOT of dust.I found ""fluffing"" the Swiffer to be a bit difficult, but even though I don't think it's was fluffed all that much, it worked quite well. Within five minutes, the thing was completely covered with dust bunnies, dust, and cat hair.Worked great! Most of the dust came off by tapping it hard against the inside of my garbage can, which was great because I thought, ""I have to buy one of these twice a week?!""I wish it had come with the extender; it would be much more useful. The handle is quite short.Honestly, I much prefer a lambswool duster. It can last years and years and does a great job. But, in lieu of that, this works very well.

"I love bubble bath and was looking forward to trying all three of the trio. My first impression of all of them, smell-wise, was terrible. The Nourishing Milk and Honey has almost no odor. The Hibiscus is almost sickly sweet. Lastly, I sniffed what should have been an easy one, lavender, and well, it doesn't smell like lavender, at least not any good lavender essential oil. And that's what I want in a bubble bath, and what I would have expected from this brand. I read the ingredients list and was surprised to discover that there are some ""real"" ingredients such as honey in these as they don't look, smell or feel like anything approaching a natural product.They don't lather much and they are rather drying. They will make a very good lingerie wash. That's what I always do with bubble bath that doesn't satisfy.

"These are lovely. They are crocheted, which can't be done by a machine. Though they're sold as dish scrubbers, they make very nice washcloths because they exfoliate without scratchiness. They are also perfect for those little scraps of bar soap. Just pop them into the fish's mouths and the cloths will lather up beautifully! I'd rather use these for my shower than the sink, as I don't want to get them stained. They are just that cute!So, why didn't I give them five stars? It's because they're ten dollars and I don't know where they are made. It doesn't say on the wrapper, nor does it  say here on Amazon. And I do want to know. It's a fair guess to assume they're made in China. Even if they are, ten bucks for two of them is a ridiculously low price. We may like it, but if one considers that Now Designs sold it wholesale, can you imagine how little the person who crocheted these made? As a crocheter, I feel guilty about even liking these. It would take a fast crocheter at least a few hours to make one of these.

"I live in a fairly small space with a combination of rugs and bare floors. I have been using a Panasonic canister vacuum, which has been satisfactory. Ever since my old Electrolux bit the dust I've not been that happy with any vacuum. They're all just ""good enough."" This vacuum is better than that on rugs, for sure. It's as good as my Electrolux. For rugs, I give it five stars plus! It took me about 1/4th the time I usually take vacuuming my bedroom, where I have enough rug real estate to essentially be wall-to-wall. I live in an old house and the places where the floor dips are hard spots for vacuum cleaners, especially when there's a rug over the spot. There's a place near a doorway that I never feel gets cleaned enough and this vacuum stood right up to it without a hitch! Bravo!The down side is that vacuuming the bare floors with the beater bar turned off is so-so. The ""dust"" attachment works fine for bare floors, but wow, that'd take a long time. So, I stuck on the floor attachment from my other Panasonic. It fits and works great. For the price, this vacuum should have come with a floor brush. I'm guessing anyone buying a non-upright vacuum is looking for something that works equally well on carpets and bare floor. This will, with a bare floor brush, and at this price point it should have been in the box, not something that one would have to buy separately.The upholstery attachment works well. I like the fact that there's a place for the crevice and dust attachments on the wand and it would have been perfect if there was a way to store all the attachments on the unit, but it's not a deal breaker.The cord is nice and long. The telescoping wand is long enough for me (and short enough, too), but I'm only a tad over five feet tall. I'm guessing this vacuum might be short for those who are tall, especially since the rug attachment works significantly better when one holds the wand at an extreme angle. The dust cup is easy to clean. All in all, I'm quite satisfied with this vacuum and very impressed with it on rugs.It is heavy, but not as heavy as any good canister vac. It rolls easily, and it never tipped over once when I was vacuuming, It also didn't get hung up on furniture like my regular canister vac does. It's cute and is great size for a smaller house or apartment for both vacuuming and storage.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1YPNCUSP74GJI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZHUEZIQ#wasThisHelpful","R1YPNCUSP74GJI","AU0LLORGK9IDR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AU0LLORGK9IDR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've used this three times and can't bring myself to trying it again. First off, the smell. It's nice enough; it smells quite a bit like a European soap or Cashmere Bouquet, but on me, the scent did not dissipate quickly. The first time I used the product, I applied it in the morning (and quite sparingly), and I could still smell it hours later. All that scent right up in my face gave me a low level headache. I wear perfume, too, so it's not that I'm all that sensitive to fragrance, but really, I'd rather not have my facial products compete for my olfactory attention. The other problem I had is that I felt as if my skin was sticky or had a film on it for hours. It felt rather like I had a soap film on it. I tried the product two other times, at bedtime. The first time my husband objected to the odor. The second time I applied after he'd fallen asleep, and at that point, I decided that this simply isn't a product I want to use again.Did it moisturize my skin?

"This bra is close to perfect for me, which is quite a feat. I usually wear a 28 or 30G. Since I read that this one ran small, I ordered a 30GG. It was a bit big in the cup and I went right to the last set of hooks, so I ordered a 28GG. It is a true 28 inch band and fits me without any movement. The cups fit perfectly. Even though the straps are wide set and where the cups meet the straps sit right in my armpits, I was shocked to discover that I could wear the bra all day without any chafing. For the first half a day of wearing it, I thought, ""Wow. This is what it feels like to wear a bra that fits!"" I also looked smaller (which I appreciate). It even looked good and natural under a t-shirt, though I have to admit I've never had that much lift, even when I was 14!Unfortunately, it's not an all-day wear for me, though I tried, and wished it would be. Maybe it will be when it's broken in some. I'm not used to wearing the correct band size.I really appreciate that there are four hooks in the back. I've been very frustrated by the fact that the majority of bras in small band sizes, even if the cup size is large, have only two hooks. My favorite bras are long line ones, which I modify by cutting and sewing the the center front so that it rises up.This bra is SO close to perfect, and it's such a great price.

It's getting it to stay that way that's the trick!When my hair was dry, it looked great. I thought, ""Wow. That's a lot of hold without hair spray!""Unfortunately, one of my pet peeves - scent - reared it ugly head. Like most hair products these days, this stuff is highly scented. I can't tell you what it smells of exactly. It's a bit fruity, I suppose. The bottom line is that it was too strong, at least for my taste, and on a hot and humid day it was really annoying me.  I also wear perfume, and frankly, I'm tired of hair products competing with my perfume!But, if it had really held my hair in place I may have been less unhappy with the scent.

I listened to a track of Bach that I've listened to for over four decades now, and I wondered where the low end had gone.

Getting enough sleep, eating a good diet, protecting my skin from the sun,and washing my face with high quality mostly natural products has been my strategy. I was blessed with a good complexion and tight pores.I think it would be bizarre to be my age and have no visible signs of aging. To want for that seems ridiculous, in my estimation. But, of course, I want to look my best, as we all do. My skin is fairly dry, has some age spots and lines, and the skin has become less taut. So, with great skepticism, I tried this. I've used neem oil in the past, as it's been used in India for a long, long time. I prefer oil to moisturizer, as I dislike the feeling of product sitting on one's face. Neem and coconut oil both are excellent moisturizers, but they both left my skin too greasy.Much to my surprise, this Nia 24 really made my skin look and feel great upon the first application. It can be used alone or with another product. I used it alone first; three drops were plenty for my entire face. My skin felt moisturized without any greasiness and stayed that way through the day. I didn't make my skin red or tingly, as some others report. In addition, I was quite pleased that this product has a nice natural smell of citrus. A few minutes after application, I no longer noticed the smell, which is unusual these days with most skin care products. Very nice indeed!As the week progressed, my skin really did look more healthy. I kept asking myself, ""Is it because you know this is pricey?"" Considering my extreme skepticism about any beauty products, I think the answer is no. I like how my skin feels and looks, and the sheerness of this product. As for the age spots, I have not noticed a difference, but if I do, I'll come back and give this five stars. Honestly, the only reason I'm not giving it five stars is that I can't really believe that $71 is a reasonable price. I know there are more expensive products out there, but there are also less, and I'm guessing someone is making a tidy profit. Of course, that's what companies do, but at this price, it's just a luxury that most people would have to think more than twice about. Sure, it's less than a shot of Botox, but that's not a great thing to compare it to. Still, I can't say anything else bad about this product other than the price is too high for this shopper. If it were less, I would definitely purchase it, though. I love the way my skin feels!I used the product with some under-eye product and this worked really nicely.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1MS3ZY37SYZCS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MI1CNRC#wasThisHelpful","R1MS3ZY37SYZCS","AU0LLORGK9IDR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AU0LLORGK9IDR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Full disclosure: I received this item free through the Amazon Vine program. It didn't come with the recommended Scott-Vincent Borba Anti-Fatigue Corrective Concealer Tool with Line Smoothing Tear-Drop Blending Applicator ($40), which costs more than the concealer itself, so I used my finger to apply this product. And though the tool is probably useful, I'm sure using a finger or another brand of applicator is just fine.It is thick, but not so thick as to make it difficult to use. I have dark circles and redness under my eyes, and this isn't a great product for me unless I apply a good amount of foundation makeup over it. Why? Because it's not a true ""color correction"" (CC) product. Though technically speaking, color correction claims can be made when there's anything that ""diffuses light"" in the product (in this case, supposedly citrine diamonds), true color correction for red comes from a green concealer. Simply applying something lighter, thicker, and close to your skin tone on red or dark under eye circles will make them look grey. That is true in my case, and it's not a great look, to be sure. So, for days when I do want to wear a lot of makeup, this is a perfectly fine product, as it does what many other products like this do, even out skin tone and cover ""imperfections."" Then, if one has to do true blending and color correcting, one puts full foundation and even a finish of powder over that.I prefer to wear the least amount of makeup that I can. I think the level of ""perfection"" that we're increasingly being told we need to aim for as women is ridiculous. This is fine for days I want to wear a lot of makeup, but for a quick swipe of under eye concealer on days I want people not to see how tired my eyes look, I'll reach for something else. I think it's best to buy that in person, where there are many, many different shades, and one can pick one that's just right for one's skin. I am very pale, with a yellow cast, which is unusual in someone so light skinned. So, for me, it's important to buy some products in person and from lines that have a lot more choices that match one's skin tone. Otherwise, it's awfully hit or miss. And, I've found that one can use a lot less product when it's really right for one's skin.I may be ranting a bit, but this product, like most beauty products, comes with a lot of hype (though there could be even more). Citrine diamonds are lovely amber colored stones. Are they really in here, ground up? If so, I think this product would be much pricier. Will the ""Black Algae and Sustainable Red Palm Oil increase cell turnover?"" I have no idea. I have no idea what ""InvisiVeil Technology"" is. It's just advertising hype. But, Scott-Borba's hype is no better or worse than other companies, so it feels almost unfair to be calling them out on this. However, as I do use (and buy) some pricey products from companies such as Dr. Hauschka, whose claims to using natural and beneficial products are backed up with easy-to-read and accessible ingredients lists and information about the products on their websites, I do feel it's important to point out unsubstantiated claims in makeup products when I see them.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3C4FVO9CR53CE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SH8Z872#wasThisHelpful","R3C4FVO9CR53CE","AU0LLORGK9IDR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AU0LLORGK9IDR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I got this book through Amazon Vine, and because of that, I have to review it. If not for that, I would probably not write a review. If I can't finish a book, I figure it's my problem, it's not for me, and I don't like to write bad reviews. But, I don't have that option here.Bottom line: I could not conjure up a shred of interest in Eytan Bayme's life. The book felt like it had one punch line, over and over again; He's a kid who's Orthodox and - gasp! - he wants to masturbate, look at porn, have sex and eat pork!  As my grandmother would have said, ""Enough already!""I had read some of Eytan Bayme's writing on his website and found it good and amusing, but this extended foray into his childhood left me more than cold. I could not help thinking, repeatedly, that he's no Philip Roth and this was no Portnoy's Complaint.One could say that well, that was then and this is now. Maybe that's so. Maybe it's a generational thing, but some books transcend that. This one doesn't, at least for this reader. If you want to read a great book about a Jewish boy's coming of age and dealing with lust and masturbation and all the rest, this doesn't hold a candle to Roth. And perhaps the fact that it isn't fiction makes a world of difference. I am not sure. But, by halfway through this, I had really had more than enough.","2.0 out of 5 stars","April 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1X5PHM71GZN05/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250067227#wasThisHelpful","R1X5PHM71GZN05","AU0LLORGK9IDR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AU0LLORGK9IDR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I found this book captivating. At first I was a bit put off by the style. As another reviewer noted, this book is not ""poetic."" It's not beautifully written, but neither is it poorly written. It's plain spoken, and that turns out to be quite refreshing. So is Henry Marsh (called Mr. in Great Britain). He's done a lifetime of good work, but is humble. A surgeon who recommends that a patient's family sue him? Not in America. And I suspect not likely anywhere.Traumatic brain injury and death have visited my family more than the usual amount of times. Because of this, instead of feeling adverse to reading about neurology and neurosurgery, it interests me greatly. Knowing more than usual served me well when faced with one of the difficult conversations  with neurosurgeons Henry Marsh repeatedly writes about in this book.It is refreshing in the extreme to read about a surgeon who can admit his mistakes and understand how much luck plays in both life and surgery. Marsh writes about the arc of his career as a neurosurgeon and the wisdom, humility, and even distancing that he's had to develop in order to work in this difficult specialty. In some ways, he doesn't give away too much personal information; we know his first marriage ended badly on account of his being a neurosurgeon, but what that really means is never explained. I suppose it's unimportant, a salacious detail.This book is about surgery, the life of a doctor in the hospital, first and foremost. It is about neurosurgery, in language most laypeople can understand.There's something a tad dry about this book at times, but it underscores the times when Marsh is not dry. At one point he indulges in cursing for an entire paragraph, and (unlike another reviewer), I found it rather thrilling. He could have indulged in a rant about bureaucracy and the National Health Service in a more coherent fashion, but he did not. He's a human being, not a superhero, and that is, in fact, what this book seems to really be about. Neurosurgeons are flawed human beings doing the job that gives them nearly God-like powers. Henry Marsh knows that he is not a God indeed, and for that I'm glad to have read his very human book.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3CR6E21HM0BQG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=125006581X#wasThisHelpful","R3CR6E21HM0BQG","AU0LLORGK9IDR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AU0LLORGK9IDR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Adam Benforado sheds new light on the inherent biases in our justice system or, more precisely, the ones inside our minds, that we are incapable of seeing. He does with, too, with writing that is readable and compelling. I haven't read a book that I quoted to friends and family so much in a long, long time.In this book, police and prosecutors aren't cast as villains but as people who believe they are doing the right thing (which is generally the case). The same with solitary confinement, long prison sentences, and the like. We have a system that is based on what we believe to be results, but increasingly, there is not a correlation between what we want - a safe society, fairness - and how we judge and incarcerate people. This book is fascinating for in it is a broad question - do we really want fairness in our system or do we want to continue to do what we want because we simply believe that it is right? Do we want to exact revenge and punishment and allow those with the most money to buy the verdicts they want or do we want a fair, safe society that is best for all?I think most people do want justice to be fair. We also want our justice system to work. We want to keep criminals off our streets and out of our homes. One hard truth is that when justice is not fair, people tend to lose respect for the law, or if they are among those whom the scales of justice falls more heavily upon, learn to be afraid of it. This does not make for a safer and good society. I hope it is safe to say that one needn't be ""liberal"" or ""conservative"" to understand that these issues need to be addressed. That is why this is an important book, one that I found almost impossible to put down. Adam Benforado not only finds fault, but shows us ways to improve our system. I applaud his work.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R26KDFDWEF0XI5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0770437761#wasThisHelpful","R26KDFDWEF0XI5","AU0LLORGK9IDR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AU0LLORGK9IDR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have to admit to a strong preference for natural products. I use Dr. Hauschka Cleansing Cream, 1.7-Ounce Boxwhen I want a facial scrub. But, that is an expensive product, and so when I got a chance to try this Neutrogena Scrub for free, I figured I'd give it a chance.Yes, it left my skin clean without being stripped. However, I didn't find using it to be all that pleasant an experience. The ""green tea"" smell is not bad, but I was keenly aware of how fake it was, especially as the entire product has the consistency of a gritty shampoo. The exfoliating grit is also so small that one needs to be very careful not to get it into one's mouth or eyes.I'd never thought about the actual consistency and content of exfoliators before using this product.  I'd never been concerned about getting any into my mouth or eyes when I've used a product that uses oatmeal or almond for exfoliation. I suppose once you start using natural products it becomes hard to go back. Still, this facial cleanser does what it says it will do. It's not the kind of product I want to use on my skin, but at least it neither leaves a residue, a strong odor, or strips the skin of its natural oils, so if you want an exfoliating product and haven't developed an aversion to non-natural products, it's perfectly fine.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2O31V71254VW9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NR1YQFE#wasThisHelpful","R2O31V71254VW9","AU0LLORGK9IDR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AU0LLORGK9IDR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I usually buy Lundberg rice, but I thought I'd give this one a try because I like the company.  Sadly, it's disappointing. Though a mix of different rice, it is fairly bland and lacks the nuttiness I expect from brown and red rice. The consistency is sticky and bordering on porridge-like.

I would venture to guess that lovers of the more recent religious thrillers might find this book a tad too dense, but I may be wrong. I omitted a star for being a bit of a plod at times; it could have used some trimming. The book it reminded me of most was Anthony Burgess' ""Earthly Powers,"" though this book is not the audacious, oftentimes funny masterpiece that was.

No intricate emotional twists and nuances. Did I miss something?I was interested up to a point. In the end, it just came down to this: I have other books to read. We all have a limited amount of time in our lives to read fiction. This book did not hold my attention. If I haven't explained it well enough, I'm sorry.

"This peeler was such a disappointment! My first impression was ""Wow!"" because the handle and grip feels absolutely perfect in my hand. If it weren't for that, I'd give this product one star.First off, I used it to peel the skin off fresh ginger. Ginger is difficult to peel; I usually use a knife, but I figured that the serrated edge would work well. I was not wrong about that; I was impressed with how thin a peel I got. As I usually do, I peeled towards me, and twice had the serrated blade stick in the skin of my thumb. Not a full fledged cut either time, but not pleasant.  I haven't had that happen to me since I first learned to peel vegetables properly (decades ago). It did a great job on the ginger. My assessment was it might be worth learning to respect this blade as the peel was nice and super thin, almost grated. I washed the peeler, had the blade nick me once again, and put it aside for my husband to try on some other veggies. My thumb had had enough.He peels away from himself, the opposite of me. He used it on both sweet and white potatoes. He said he would not use it again: ""Too much work. The peels get caught in the serrated edge and one has to clean it out too often."" I was standing right next to him and could see that it was true. It also seemed to take him twice as long to peel those potatoes as usual and indeed he said it seemed so.I see that this may be good for tomatoes. I have never peeled a fresh tomato; if I ever do so and discover this is indispensable for that purpose, I'll revise this review. Otherwise, I can't see the benefit of it. On top of that, I think the blade is too wobbly. I have a Kitchenaide peeler that looks like a knockoff of the OXO one; the blade does not have as much play, and because of that, I find I can be much more precise in my peeling.Too bad!

"If I were reviewing this book simply for myself, I would give it two stars, but I think it is a generally good book. However, it is not what I was expecting. I did not expect the bulk of the book to be ""how-to technique.""What I was expecting was an in-depth book about acrylic paint. I know it's called ""Painting in Acylics,"" but the description I read lead me to think there was more about materials than technique in this book.  Perhaps that was wishful reading on my part. The materials sections are good, but they are not detailed in the way that the technique section is. The section on the paints, while good, are no more than twenty pages in a 300 pages plus book. Furthermore, the photos of pigments are small for this large book. One reason I selected this book is because I've recently become interested in using some unusual acrylics (eg. interference colors). There is information on colors such as these, but it's only one page. Not in-depth at all. This book has great basics on materials, but not more than that. In fact, I just decided to edit this review because one person commented that there is nothing on the toxicity of paints. That is a big oversight in a book that is otherwise so detailed and well organized.If you're a hobby painter and like how-to books to follow along with, you'll love it. Me? I doubt I'll look at it again after than a few perusals. I do like ""how to"" books, but I want as much information about materials as I can possibly get. The technique part? From my training, I think it's best to know your materials, experiment, and practice. This book has what I'd call a ""rigid"" approach. Not to my liking, but I can see it is excellent for many, so I can't dismiss it because of that. If you like a lot of short tutorials on technique to follow along with, this book may be your holy grail.

"This is a very nice product. I don't like the smell but it's bearable. What does it smell like? Rotted apples. I live in the country and know what that smells like. It's not the worst smell and after a few minutes, I didn't notice it much. Still, it's not what I'd call enjoyable.Anyway, I did a patch test (which is neither on the box or the jar of product, but only here on the web). No problems, so I went ahead and used the product.This is a gelatinous goop. I slathered it on my face and neck, carefully avoiding my eyes, set a timer for ten minutes, and waited. The product does tingle quite a bit but it's rather a pleasant feeling. By the ten minute mark, it had almost dried up and felt a bit tight on my face. That too, was rather a pleasant feeling. It performs more like a masque than a peel. I took a washcloth with hot water to wash off the product. I didn't want to splash water on my face as I assumed that getting this in one's eyes wouldn't be a good thing.I was pleasantly surprised to see that this product does a lovely job. My skin felt scrubbed clean without being stripped of oils. It was noticeably softer. Even my husband noticed a difference (and he's indifferent to most things such as this).I can not attest to whether or not this helps with hyperpigmentation because I haven't any on my skin, but it does a fine job of what I'd call ""super cleansing."" I've only used one other product that worked as well as this, Philosophy's Microdelivery Peel. That product is harsher, abrasive, and warms up on the face. I think this does about as good a job, is comparably priced, and is a more natural product. I was going to give it four stars because I didn't like the smell or the sliminess of the product, but y'know what? In spite of these things, I'm giving it five stars, because my skin feels and looks good without a lot of nasty ingredients.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RSPFUF37K7W39/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0018APVTG#wasThisHelpful","RSPFUF37K7W39","AU0LLORGK9IDR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AU0LLORGK9IDR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The story of my experiences with mattresses and mattress pads is long and complicated enough to write a book about, so I won't get into it too much. Making a very long story short, after years of trying every conceivable mattress, my husband and I bought a high end Stearns & Foster with a light pillow top. We erred on the extra firm side because it one can always put mattress toppers on, but you can't make a soft bed more firm.I have chronic joint pain and found myself waking up feeling terrible in the mornings. So, I purchased a memory foam mattress topper. We'd had a memory foam bed and I liked it, but it was hot, and my husband hated it. I thought an inch of memory foam might be okay, but it didn't help much, so I put a gel foam topper on top of that. That turned out to be quite good, but after a year, the gel topper was worn out, or I got worse, or both, and I was once again waking up in a lot of pain.I have a latex pillow and sometimes I sit on it, so I did some research into latex mattress toppers. I liked the fact, too, that they are all natural (or can be). This one is.So, I got it. I can not tell you how happy I am! It is what I have been needing and wishing for for years. Even though this one is marked ""soft"" it isn't really. It has spring and it doesn't squash down all the way to the mattress. I can't guarantee that will be the case with you, as it does differ with weight; both my husband and I weigh under 150 pounds.Anyway, I love the way it feels. I love the fact that it isn't off-gassing some petroleum product. As the other reviewer noted, it has a smell rather like almonds, but I couldn't smell it once I put a mattress cover over it. Covering this topper is a must as it can be ripped quite easily. I put a waterproof mattress pad over it which holds it in place quite well and also protects it from my cat's claws.I am waking up in less pain. It is cool. It is comfortable. The price is great for a 100% natural latex pad. My husband likes it, too. From what I understand, this will last a good long time. I am delighted with this mattress topper and wish I'd found it sooner! If you have pressure points, arthritis, or other issues that make you wake up in pain, I can't recommend this highly enough.Tip I learned from this company's website: If you have a ""good mattress"" a one inch pad is enough. If your mattress isn't good, you would be better off with a two inch pad. I really appreciate the fact that the seller of this product isn't pushing their most expensive product. Kudos to them!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R4PS1GWXSWC28/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00F49AY44#wasThisHelpful","R4PS1GWXSWC28","AU0LLORGK9IDR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AU0LLORGK9IDR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a wonderful (but slim) collection of essays; Donald Hall's musings on his past and present. He is (obviously) in his eighties, and his voice is clear. In our youth obsessed culture, we need to hear more from the old and for that alone I am glad for this book.I don't appreciate reading synopses of books, so I won't write one, and anyway, this volume is thin enough that telling you much about it would spoil the fun of reading. I came to it fresh, not having read him before (indeed), and found it a wonderful read. Mr. Hall's style is spare, pointedly witty, and often wise.I read this book on an afternoon where we had no power in our home in Maine; I read bits aloud to my husband.  We're in our late fifties and  live in a town where we are on the younger side of middle and old age. So, reading this spoke to much of our condition.So, we (not just I) enjoyed Mr. Hall's sharing of his life and memories, and sharing his gratitude for that life, both past and present. Even more, I enjoyed that he did so without veering into either sweet sentimentality or the (terribly overdone) stance of an old curmudgeon. He has led a good and robust life and still does, though now from a wheelchair. There's no self pity in that; the life of his mind is rich indeed, and he had led a fairly charmed and privileged life before (and I suppose he still does).We need to understand the richness of simply looking out a window. Mr. Hall tells us about this without preaching it. He may be an old man, but his voice sounds totally fresh. He is simply telling us what life has been and is for him. He is a writer, so he writes it. And anyway, this isn't a self help book.I've written enough; I'm not a writer, but Mr. Hall certainly is.In all, I felt I'd spent an afternoon with someone I'm glad I met. Hall's beautiful writing was a pleasure to read and I can not recommend a book more highly. Now I'll go back and read what came before.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R34AEJ81OLUTBY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0544287045#wasThisHelpful","R34AEJ81OLUTBY","AU0LLORGK9IDR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AU0LLORGK9IDR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Great, high-quality product. The only thing that would make this product better is wheel locks. The spinner-style wheels make rolling through the airport or down a plane aisle a breeze.

"The case seems well-constructed. But I was hoping to use it for checking my guitar on flights. It doesn't feel as solid as the SKB case I've been using for this purpose, which has a hard plastic shell. The leather-like exterior of the ChromaCast case looks nice but certainly wouldn't stand-up to airline handling. Feels like it would get easily scuffed and perhaps even tear. Not what I expected for something labeled as a ""hard case.""My Seagull dreadnought fits a bit loosely and slides up and down. My Martin dreadnought fits better. The case is fairly deep, which means a bit more room in the goody box under the neck. But it's also bulkier and a bit more awkward to carry than my previous case. This case feels heavy, even when empty. The leather handle actually has sharp seams and isn't particularly comfortable. And the case didn't come with the pick sampler, which isn't a big deal except that a product should come with what it says it should come with.I don't dislike this enough to return it. It looks nice and it's okay for toting my guitar locally.

"A great little mixer for the money. But mine arrived with channel 1 dead, so I'm having to return it for replacement. Bless Amazon for making returns so easy.Pros:  Compact. Good mic preamps with no background noise (bonus points for this because it's both critically important and rare in low cost equipment). Logical controls. Flexible outputs with a separate Record, Aux and Effects bus.Variable level of effects for each channel.Cons: Effects quality is okay, but not outstanding. Only one effect at a time--you can't cascade effects or choose different effects for different channels. Selecting a different effect or setting effect parameters requires lots of button pushes.I haven't tried the USB interface yet, so I can't comment on that.

"Making hard/soft boiled eggs in this unit is relatively straightforward and seems to work well. Poached eggs, which is the main reason I bought it, is another story.The poached egg cups are too small to hold a regular large egg. When the heat comes on, the eggs expand and drip into the water underneath, which confuses the sensor. The buzzer, which is extremely loud and obnoxious, goes off after about a minute while the eggs are still completely raw. There is no way to turn just the buzzer off. You have to turn the unit off, remove the poached egg pan, clean the base unit, refill with water and try again. The egg cups are also oblong rather than round. So if you're making eggs benedict or putting the poached eggs on an english muffin, they don't fit well.The cooking time is adjusted on this unit with microscopic changes in the amount of water you add via their special measuring cup. The difference in water amount for a different number of eggs is literally a few drops. Plus, their recommended amounts of water doesn't always work, so you'll need to experiment. Not a great way to control cooking time.I didn't hate it enough to return it. It does seem to do okay with boiled eggs. But I wouldn't buy it again.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R19QVZKX3YD72H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001GL6MJK#wasThisHelpful","R19QVZKX3YD72H","AT6G2AGQQWML2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AT6G2AGQQWML2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I've been using a T1 for a few months now.  It's a good news/bad news situation.Voice quality is good on both end of the calls.  Setup is easy.  I don't find the voice control particularly useful, but some people might.  The biggest problem is securing the T1 to your ear.  The over the ear option is clunky and not particularly comfortable.  The in-ear pads are comfortable, but not secure.  Even with the largest ear pad, the headset is constantly falling out of my ear.  Worse, the ear pad's are difficult to put on do not stay securely on the headset.  That means if you keep the T1 in your pocket and pull it out to use it, you're likely to find the ear pad doesn't come with it.Because the ear pad is constantly falling off, I managed to lose it, meaning I had to pay $16 (including shipping) for 2 replacement ear pads just to be able to use the headset I paid $60 for.  The USB recharging cord is also ridiculously short, but it's a standard connector, so you can pretty easily find a replacement.I want to like the T1.  But having to spend a couple of minutes fiddling with the ear pads practically every time I want to use it and having it constantly fall out of my ear makes it not particularly useful. I can't recommend it unless you are satisfied with the over-the-ear option.","2.0 out of 5 stars","August 29, 2010","http://www.amazon.com/review/R5YTVHYBZTYZU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003R2P9CW#wasThisHelpful","R5YTVHYBZTYZU","AT6G2AGQQWML2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AT6G2AGQQWML2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I was gifted a copy of this box set for my honest review. Often it's hard to rate a book with so many authors so I will do the best I can by rating it in whole. I am putting a written review for the following books although all were wonderful stories.Close Liaisons by Anna Zaires & Dima ZalesNew to me authors.Mia is curious about the beings who are now residing in her state / country. She meets one while at the park one day named Korum. He is fascinated by her and Mia kind of thinks he is sexy. Well one thing leads to another and they end up in bed where Mia finds it's not exactly what she thought. Mia likes Korum but she isn't sure of what can become of them. She knows he cooks a mean meal. He is very open about talking to Mia concerning his kind. Mia hates him but she doesn't.This wasn't a bad story although I would have preferred a bit more story prior to their bedroom scene. Also Mia is some what whiney.Shifted Undercover by C.E. BlackNikki is keeping something from her new husband. But she is not the only one. Adam and Nikki haven't been married long but both are keeping something  from the other.When Nikki finds out what her husband Adam is and whom he works for all crap hits the fan pretty much. Adam is determined to keep Nikki safe but she is a strong and determined female. Nolan wants neither of them to tell each other their secrets but it happens. Their boss now has no idea what to do when both are taken hostage.  I enjoyed this story as I loved the Alpha Division series by  this author. Very well written and tons of action and suspense and super hot romance.Capturing Her Bear by Charlie DayeNew to me author.Berend has been held captive by scientists who have been doing testing’s on him for months.Aspen has now been captured and the scientists who captured her have made her into something / someone she doesn't know?A nurse is told to extract a sample from Berend then what happens is shock to both Aspen and Berend.Berend knows what the doctor is trying to do and he also knows its likely he succeeded with Apsen he just wishes his bear was happy about it.Aspen is not shocked that he is a bear shifter only because her hand did the same kind of change. Aspen escapes but not with her bear. But can she save him? And will his bear claim her? Well no because he sends her off to find his friend Torben who very well may be Aspens mate. But can these two save Berend?This was a really hot , and an emotionally intriguing story.Bitten By Choice by Izzy SzynThis story is about a girl named Becky who is taken and turned after her step brother takes her to meet his boss. One of her captures Ryan however decides to help her. She wants to go home she misses her boyfriend and her friend and family. But the evil vampire they are running from is going to be hunting them as he is Death. He is threatening her family so she has no choice but to get back to her family and protect them from Caleb.Not a bad story. It could use more proofing.Dragon's Chase by Mina CarterI love dragon shifter books so I had to read this one. This was a new twist for me. It is nicely written and had a lot of action and romance unbound.Zane by R.E. ButlerNew to me author.This was a really well written gorilla shifter book. I have never read one but this one was fantastic. Kudos to this author for giving us something different.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1YN6DXW4SBIF7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016DUDE4Y#wasThisHelpful","R1YN6DXW4SBIF7","A1J3AF55IL2ST3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1J3AF55IL2ST3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Everything was good as far as story line and characters. But finding out about Colin and why certain things happened to him I would have liked more reason or details.Ferocious - M.H.

It has a romance span of 10 years so nothing was fast about this couple.Snow Leopard Bound - Wednesday RavenBrock was tired of being cheated on. He wants something more than a random fling. Brock and his bestfriend make a wager. Now can he keep what he wagered? Chance was living life as if he was dying tomorrow which wasn't to far fetched.

"This is a book bundle that has a little something for everyone in the romance department. I have written reviews for a few although all are really good and the writing styles are fantastic. You can't go wrong with this bundle.My Review - Out Of The Box, Regifted – Jennifer Theriot - 5 StarsFrom the very first word this book grabbed and kept me wanting to read more. I just loved Olivia and Ash and all the grown up kids between them.Olivia is a older woman in her 50’s who goes through something horrible after 30 years of marriage and Ash is the man there to save her from herself. He also is the man who teaches her about Intimacy , Passion and how a woman should be treasured.The book takes you on ONE hell of a rollercoaster ride though I went from Laughing, to Seething Angry , to Crying.I whole heartedly recommend this book to anyone who loves a uplifting and romance involved book.All I can say is WOW !!!My Review - Scary Modsters – Diane Rinella - 5 StarsRosalyn is head over heals for dead rocker Peter Lane and her Ouija board is trying to tell her something. While out with her girlfriends she meets Niles’s and although they aren't totally compatible he is a nice enough guy but she wants Peter. Rosalyn and Nile's figure out that Peter Lane was murdered and take it among themselves to figure it out.Can Niles finally win Rosalyn's heart? Can they help the now dead Peter Lane?Rosalyn is way into the old music and Niles well he needs to get onboard or get lost. This book was well written although the jumping back and forth from each character got me a little lost.My Review - Cheating To Survive – Christine ArdigoThis story evolves around three women who work at the same place and are friends. Each are married with families but missing something in their marriages. We venture with each one on how they handle things and find happiness finally in their lives. I really enjoyed this story.My Review - Chain of Title - Robyn RozeIn this story we have a cheating husband who loses the one thing he can no longer have. We also have tons of deception, a world never known about , and a past so strong it almost crumbles what is left of a family. We also get a woman with a strength and protectiveness that devours any in her way and a Man who will destroy anyone who tries to take what is now his. We have a new beginning and others will find their ending.

"As noir novels go, this one is definitely in the upper ranks, though not quite a perfect performance.  I have not read Ted Lewis's other novels, though I know Get Carter from the movie adaptation.  If this is a good sample of his work--and I suspect it is--then I am sure i would enjoy the others and will seek them out.  Most of this novel works like a well-oiled noir machine, smoothly purring its way through the layers of suspicion, paranoia, mayhem and murder that characterize the genre at its best.  The central character and narrator manages to ingratiate himself with the reader, even though he is quickly established as a ruthless and insatiably greedy criminal who happens to be in a ""business"" that is peculiarly repellent and far from admirable--that is, he is a producer, maker, distributor and merchant of violent sadomasochistic pornographic films of the most extreme kind.One of the fascinations of such characters at the center of stories of crime as a business, especially when he or she is the first person narrator of the story, is the apparent calm and ease with which the ""boss"" exercises power, even life and death power, over the people around him.  The suave and low-key approach to delegating criminal exchanges, disciplinary or revenge killings (which, because of the expertise of the perpetrators, can be exercised sometimes with no remaining evidence or with sufficient misleading evidence that the investigators are directed elsewhere and the narrator and his cronies suffer no consequences), while maintaining a luxurious public lifestyle, tends to glamorize the narrator even as one finds him despicable.  If necessary, well-placed agents inside the police hierarchy can be counted on, thanks to substantial bribes that are mere pocket change for the criminal, to misdirect the investigation or conveniently misplace crucial evidence.  On the surface, all is orderly and controlled.The lurking dangers to such a criminal power are, primarily, two:  first, the ambitious assistant or agent who figures out the patterns of behavior and the structure of the criminal enterprise in such as way as to make it possible for the assistant to invade and even take over the criminal territory, and second, the ""hero's"" mix of paranoia and obsession with exercising what he believes to be his unlimited powers of comprehension and control, prompting him to begin to believe in the reality of imagined threats, while forgetting that there is always at least someone out there who may be smarter and more ruthless even than he is.It won't do to reveal any details of the plot of this novel--it starts spinning rapidly, and except for several brief stumbles where it seems to go offtrack or into needless repetition, is continued with the kinds of surprises and shocks that are the main reason for reading such a work.  If we want to philosophize about the apparent similarities between the criminal enterprise and the standard day to day operations of late Western capitalism--well, even that has been anticipated, at least as early as John Gay's The Beggar's Opera.  This kind of crime story is about power and influence and the will to impose one's wishes wherever one needs to.  Lewis offers a fast and satisfying noir experience.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1NLS8WYM2SJK4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1616955503#wasThisHelpful","R1NLS8WYM2SJK4","AX6NA5JAL2B1K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AX6NA5JAL2B1K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Potential readers need to know what this book is not.  It is not a biography of Ted Hughes, the great twentieth-century poet, though it does qualify as a charming memoir of the life of his elder brother, Gerald, who expresses love and pride throughout and does offer a number of brief anecdotes and character sketches of Ted's life.  Neither, thankfully, is this book a source of more sensational or shocking details about Ted's life with Sylvia Plath (and other women).  Gerald supplies a respectful and somewhat affectionate account of Ted and Sylvia's early married life and the tragedy of her death, but he does this mostly through information from letters and relatively brief encounters with the couple while they lived in England.  All this said, the book is readable, enjoyable, and it does offer insights (perhaps fanciful) into Ted Hughes's poetic genius.  Most of the book, however, is devoted more to Gerald's life and experiences—especially a fascinating account of his activities as a RAF plane mechanic, stationed mostly in North Africa, during World War II.In portraying his own and Ted's childhood experiences, Gerald comes closest to providing insights into the character of Ted Hughes.  He describes the almost idyllic environment of Mytholmroyd, a mostly rural area though supported by industrial works, where he and Ted were able to fish, ride bicycles, camp out in places not too remote from home, and generally live the lives of ""boys"" as they were experienced during the 1930s.  A move to a larger town, Mexborough, and a change of profession for their father, forced some changes in their lives, but both seem to have found ways to occupy themselves and remain upbeat and cheerful, even during the darker days of the Depression.  Gerald regularly provides details about Ted's early experiences with poetry and with music (tracing his early and lasting love of the music of Beethoven, for example), and constantly reminds us of the passion for hunting and fishing that he and Ted shared and that Ted continued to pursue through much of his adult life.  (This latter is well described in Boyanowsky's memoir, Wild Gods, Silver Ghosts: Ted Hughes in the Wild.)Gerald emigrated to Australia after his stint in the RAF during the war, and so much of his adult life was spent (including his marriage and fatherhood) half a world away from Ted.  That would include most of the fateful time that Ted was married to Sylvia Plath.  Gerald is careful to indicate the secondhand nature of much of his description of their relationship, though he and his wife did spend some time in England during one of the more positive periods of the Hughes/Plath marriage.  But he avoids engaging with any of the controversy (though he mentions its negative effect on Ted's emotional life).  In other words, this book will give nothing to those who still hope to dig for more than is known about that sad period.Gerald has been an avid painter and drawer since his early years, and that also is a subject of his writing here.  Indeed, Gerald comes through this narrative as a generous, loving, and engaging man who truly wants to produce a tribute to his beloved younger brother, and he succeeds in that. The prose narrative is written in a genial conversational style that creates the sense of sitting comfortably over a drink with a talkative friend who has had an interesting life. It is not a great memoir, but it is certainly of interest to anyone who cares for Ted Hughes, and it can be recommended.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R10WOJ48GAPOP1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250045274#wasThisHelpful","R10WOJ48GAPOP1","AX6NA5JAL2B1K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AX6NA5JAL2B1K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am afraid there is more interest in trying to figure out what prompted David Park to arrange this trio of narratives as he has and then call it a 'novel,"" which it could only be if there were some perceptible interconnections among the three narratives, some cross references or recurring imagery that prompted the reader to think about the ways in which the several stories (of quite different lives) might comment on or illuminate each other, achieving some kind of unity that would justify the term ""novel,"" than there is to be gained from reading it.  Yes, many works of fiction exist that include disparate narratives intertwined and played off against each other (famously, David Mitchell has made a career of constructing such complicated intertextualities), and when they work, they are marvelous.  Fans of Charles Dickens can cite examples in his work, as well, and we could look further back.  But I have looked in vain for a reason to accept the term ""novel"" in relation to this book, and so I would have to say that we have three narratives of women's lives, of unequal length and quite different mood, and I guess I must consider the three individually.,The first long short story (not really a novella) is based on what little is known of the life of Catherine Blake, the wife, companion, supporter, and collaborator with the great English poet, William Blake.  Park has decided on a kind of interior monologue as his narrative mode, and we first encounter Catherine as she is adjusting to life after the death of the man whose presence and personality had dominated her during her whole adult life.  She thinks about William, about her difficulty in understanding his visions and the full significance of his art (some of which deeply unsettles her by its violence and sexual explicitness, but she refuses to be offended by it because it is his and she has confidence that he has known best what it meant and could never intend anything obscene or evil), and she remembers, not in chronological sequence, experiences and events (some of them known to be apocryphal stories debunked by later scholarship--as, for example, the story of Catherine and William sitting in their garden, both nude, reading aloud from Paradise Lost--a story she tells and indicates that she could not refrain from blushing when a friend came unexpectedly to call on them) from their lives together.  Here is where the work begins to fall apart.  The reader gets what is expected--the familiar stories, whether true or fabulous, of those events, combined with accounts of what is known--that William taught her to read, to work in watercolor, to help him to illuminate his works, to help with the printing.  It is known that they did not have children and she (in this story) expresses some regret about that.  The stories of William's outrage at injustice and cruelty are repeated, as well as the famous arrest and trial for treason when he is falsely accused by a drunken soldier of damning the King..  But where is the insight, the illumination, the addition to what we could know from reading a thorough encyclopedia article?  We learn of Catherine's steadfast love, as she expresses it, and her faith in William's wisdom and genius, and her determination to stay with him and to wait until she can join him in eternity.  Much of this is narrated in rather flat prose which includes, as an ominous warning, frequent descents into cliched imagery that is not sourced from William and not fairly loaded onto Catherine.  So the story, in my view, adds nothing to our understanding or thinking about Catherine that is not readily available elsewhere.The second novella, also about a wife deeply devoted to her husband and especially to preserving his great poetry, is based closely on the life of Nadezhda Mandelstam, widow of Osip, who was exiled to a work camp for writing and reciting a satirical poem about Joseph Stalin.  As it happens, Nadezhda Mandelstam, herself, has provided incomparable testimony and memoir about this same life in her masterpiece, Hope Against Hope and its companion volume, Hope Abandoned.  I could enumerate the many ways in which Parks narrative merely recapitulates the most famous and familiar stories from her great works, and I could point out the obvious--while it was an ambitious idea to attempt to add something of depth to our understanding of one of the greatest pairs of lovers in modern history, it was an essay in futility.  Again, the narrative is flat, often cliched, and it adds nothing to what is better encountered in Nadezhda's own works.The third novella, fictional (though it has enough material in it to offer evidence of the model for the character of the poet), gives us again an interior monologue, this time more in the manner of some other modern writers (Colm Toibin, Colum McCann and John Banville come to mind, but with Virginia Woolf lurking in the background), and also, this time, in a very different tone.  This widow is at her seaside cottage on the north coast of Ireland to carry out her dead husband's wishes by emptying his ashes into the sea from a jetty near the cottage.  She has persuaded their two daughters, both living in London, to join her for the ceremony their father had specified, or perhaps demanded.  She is obsessed with the absence of their son, who died somewhat mysteriously in Morocco at an early age.  In this case, the relationship is far from that of Catherine or Nadezhda to their husbands--this widow feels intense ambivalence, at best, extreme resentment at worst, at the memories of her life with her poet husband, a man whom she and her daughters both remember as self-centered, unconcerned for anything except his career, and unfaithful in his marriage on numerous occasions.  The wife feels profound mistrust and doubt about the veracity of her husband's poems, suspecting that he has merely written what is understood to be appropriate feeling in his poems--never expressions, so she thinks, of true feeling about anyone but himself.  So the idea of honoring his wishes and memory by carrying out this sea burial is hardly a positive one from her perspective.  The feelings and interactions of the three women when they are together in the cottage, which is filled with memories of the poet, including a final manuscript which the wife has read but has not admitted even exists--suggesting the possibility that she might hide it or even destroy it, but she knows in her heart that she will not betray his legacy, but will deliver the work to his publisher--are uneasy and necessarily tentative.  Some moments of direct feeling and communication do occur, but each must work to reconcile herself to participation in the ritual.The third novella, therefore, reverses the pattern of relationships between the poets and their wives: in the first two, both wives are totally devoted to the work and to preserving the memories of their husbands; in the third, Park creates a wife who not only does not love her dead husband, but who has serious doubts about the quality of the work she might be responsible for preserving.  Unlike Mary Shelley, for example, who devoted her life to preserving and protecting the reputation of her husband, this wife (and her daughters) would like nothing better than to empty the urn into the sea and blot out his memory entirely.  Or at least, that is her wish at some points--at others, ambivalence takes over and she re-thinks her feelings and the reasons for them.  At the center of her problematic feelings is always her lost son.The third novella ought probably to have been published by itself.  It is psychologically more complex and as fictional drama, more intense and engaging than either of the other two.  As a fiction (at least nominally) it has the freedom to explore experiences and emotions in ways not constrained by the known facts of the other two lives. Even so, the prose often droops into the prosaic or cliched, and the narrative plods at times.  That is not a positive quality in a brief novella that needs to make its effects quickly and consistently, never allowing the reader to feel that things are dragging.This is far from the only recent novel to attempt to reconstruct aspects of the lives of known persons, and it is certainly not the worst of them, but neither is it in a class with the powerful works that succeed in convincing us that we have not only a narrative that conforms to what is known of the person's life, but one that suggests a deeper and more comprehensive understanding of that person's life.  (I think, for example, of Colm Toibin's The Master, and of Bruce Duffy's The World As I Found It, and Joanna Scott's Arrogance.) In this case, the writer seems not to have been able to think deeply enough about his subjects' lives, nor even in the fictional narrative has he been able to create a narrative that resonates or evokes sympathy.  I cannot recommend this book.","3.0 out of 5 stars","December 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3F735858088AI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1408846470#wasThisHelpful","R3F735858088AI","AX6NA5JAL2B1K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AX6NA5JAL2B1K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This novel disappoints on so many levels that I am tempted to drop to two stars, but in fairness, the ambition of the project is worthy of praise and the fact that the author has made so many awkward choices or plain missteps does not detract entirely from its very limited merits.D'Aguiar sets out to provide a fictional account of a well-known recent outrage--the massacre of a large number of people who were variously duped or mentally controlled by a charismatic ""preacher"" who insists on being called ""Father"" and who is revealed (repetitively) to be a scheming and delusional, self-centered manipulator focused on his own aggrandizement.  The historical figure--""The Reverend"" Jim Jones, may have shared many such qualities and certainly was responsible for taking his followers into a jungle environment where he subjected them effectively to slave labor conditions and extreme mental and emotional abuse.  It seems that D'Aguiar has aspired to create a portrait both of the perverse leader and of the more or less pathetic souls whom he has recruited or manipulated into following him, perhaps in an attempt to provide insight (or even answers) into the questions so many have asked about how and why he could gain such control over so many people.In pursuit of his novelistic goal, D'Aguiar focuses on several characters--a young girl, Trina, being the most prominent, a gorilla named Adam being the most improbable.  Trina's mother and a riverboat captain who falls in love with her are also prominent, with the Preacher himself being the other major character.  (Several peripheral characters, including two young men who are close friends, perhaps lovers, and who are guards in the compound, become recognizable, but most of the characters are interchangeable.)  Among the missteps by the author, the choice of reporting the internal thought processes of the mother and Trina, as well as of Adam.  Yes, Adam is presented to us (perhaps with the hope that recent research into primate thought processes might make this characterization almost plausible) as a creature who is gradually gaining reasoning power and even language.  I do not deny the impressive possibilities exhibited by some primates in research situations, nor do I ignore the likely fact that Adam's ""character"" is part of the structure of ""magical realism"" that is the other major misstep by D'Aguiar.  Whatever the case, there is little to be said in favor of inserting what becomes a deus ex machina of sorts in the form of a gorilla into this narrative.  Nor is the preternatural wisdom of Trina presented convincingly.  We are to experience her mind and her behavior as representative of a very lively, courageous, intellectually precocious child, and all those things are credible in her sections of the novel, as are the growing strength and determination of her mother as she realizes more fully how evil and destructive the Preacher has shown himself.The characterization of the Preacher seeks complexity--he is selfish, self-indulgent, prone to irrational tantrums, ruthless in controlling those around him even if it means physically abusing or even killing them, and obsessed with what he believes is the persecution he experiences at the hands of any officialdom he cannot control with bribes or fabricated shows of benevolence and order.  D'Aguiar includes many moralistic passages--repetitive, flat, prosaic--that add nothing to the depth of the characterization but shield him from any suspicion that he is using this ""villain"" for sensational purposes in his fiction.The novel is also larded with extensive descriptions of the jungle environment, especially as contrasted with urban and impoverished areas from which most of the ""believers"" have come.  The descriptions take on an almost mechanical predictability--if there is a glimpse of the jungle--a trail, the trees, animals or birds emerging from or disappearing into the area, just a walk along a path from the compound to the pigsty--there will be lush colorful passages evoking images rather like those of Le Douanier Rousseau's paintings.  Some of these passages are effective and convey the wonder experienced by the former urban dwellers, but the repetition finally makes them feel like padding and they are added to the plodding passages of moralism that also seem simply to extend the novel to no good purpose.The spasms of violence increase as we near the end of the novel, but for much of the final section we are left uncertain whether we are reading the hallucinations of characters who are actually dying of the effects of the cyanide administered to them, or that they might just possibly be experiencing the chances for escape or rescue that could be real if they are not dreams.  While there are ways in which this approach can work effectively, here the final sections of the novel seem merely evasive.Neither realistic nor convincingly poetic or magical, this novel finally fails to cohere or to convince, and the times when the reader pauses with an exasperated ""come on!"" may seem much too frequent. A work of this kind seeks to deepen or extend our understanding of complex historical and personal events, but there is neither depth nor illumination to be had--just a sense of a writer grasping for intriguing or, in some cases, familiarly formulaic, variations on the possibilities, with little to say beyond the cleverness.  D'Aguiar is a respected and accomplished writer, but here the weight of his subject has been more than he could carry.","3.0 out of 5 stars","December 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RLQPZXOIKAFJ3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062277324#wasThisHelpful","RLQPZXOIKAFJ3","AX6NA5JAL2B1K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AX6NA5JAL2B1K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I had not heard of, nor read the work of, Patrick Modiano before the announcement of his Nobel Prize for Literature.  Curiosity ensued.  My first encounter has been with this curious book (both an odd work and one that explores deeply the nature of human curiosity), a cross between novella and brief, focused memoir.  The voice of the narrator lets us know early that a determined search for information about the fate of a young woman, Dora Bruder, identified as being ""missing"" from her school in Paris, according to a notice posted by her parents in Paris-Soir on December 31, 1941 is to follow.  Indeed, the narrative persists in a search through printed records, possible eyewitness sources and whatever else may reveal or bring to light the situation and circumstances of Dora's life after her flight from her school.  Early in the work, the narrator states: ""Il faut longtemps pour que resurgisse a la lumiere ce qui a ete efface.  Des traces subsistent dans des registres et l'on ignore ou ils sont caches et quels gardiens veillent sur eux te si ces gardiens consentiront a vous les montrer.  Ou peut-etre ont-ils oublie tout simplement que ces registres existaientt""  And he concludes the thought with what might be the governing idea or at least a guiding motto for this narrative, ""Il suffit d'un peu de patience.""  (Please excuse the absence of the proper diacritical marks.)The narrator mixes details of his own life, both his youth and his recent history, with the details he uncovers and discovers from the various sources about the life (and death) of Dora and, for that matter, of both of her parents and vast numbers of others rounded up and deported to death camps by the occupying Germans.This powerful exploration of, one might also say meditation upon, the possibilities of ever knowing with certainty what has happened to others, especially in the past, as well as whether what one remembers about oneself is real or accurate, and whether or how one may interpret the ""evidence"" of photographs, printed records, identity papers, etc., appears to be one of the recurrent themes of Modiano's fiction.  It is, perhaps, most precisely focused here (though I will have to read much more of his work to feel confident of this) because he has chosen a specific person who is not personally known to him, but whose fate he nonetheless wishes to establish.  In the process, he recovers information about a number of other persons, also deported or otherwise destroyed by the ""univers de boucherie et d'apocalypse"" that was the European experience during the Second World War.The narrator reflects on the art of fiction and the use, in classic novels, of coincidence, of the possibility of a kind of prophetic clairvoyance arising in a novelist who expends intense imaginative concentration on events--possibly actual events, possibly those only imagined:  ""cela fait simplement partie du metier:  les efforts d'imagination, necessaires a ce metier, le besoin de fixer son esprit sur des points de detail--et cela de maniere obsessionnelle -- pour ne pas perdre le fil et se laisser a aller a sa paresse -- toute cette tension, cette gymnastique cerebrale peut sans doute provoquer a la longue de breves intuitions ""concernant des evenements passes ou futurs""  (p. 53).  And that is a pretty good description of the narrative procedure of Dora Bruder.  It is a fascinating sojourn with the mind of a master detective, a profoundly intuitive and ratiocinative mind, devoted to exploring the nature of human experience in times of extremity.  The very nature of human identity--challenged by fear and oppression, forced into disguise and self-denial in the face of threats, transforming the self from a familiar to an alien entity while retaining some degree of consciousness of the necessary deception and the underlying truth--all these are aspects of Modiano's narrative, and all contribute to the emotional and intellectual impact of this wonderful work.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R87GWGM5J2Z0R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=2070408485#wasThisHelpful","R87GWGM5J2Z0R","AX6NA5JAL2B1K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AX6NA5JAL2B1K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"First novels are usually worthy of publication (some editor and publisher must have thought so) and sometimes offer promise of a novelist who will offer excellent work in the future--maybe she or he will even be among the great novelists of our future.  We always hope for a few.  Mr. Weil's novel offers many familiar elements, starting with a dystopian society (victim of a combination of uncontrolled technological ""advances"" providing both some benefits and also dependence on some of the familiar ruthless agencies of control that dystopian planners inevitably find necessary to prevent ""regression"").  Familiar, also, is the pair of twin brothers, one energetic, intelligent, determined to make his way upward in the vertically organized society that has developed in his lifetime, the other a dreamer, also intelligent but devoted to memories of the rural world he grew up in, wishing to save enough money (partnering with his brother) to buy the land on which his childhood and youth were spent in rural pursuits.  Several other almost predictable elements are deployed (some very violent men and women whose ruthless behavior is both ""political"" and self-serving; a Russian oligarch, head of the tech company that intends to transform the world, ruthless also, in his own way, and determined to control the elder brother; a mother declining into dementia.)  Not so familiar, but appropriate in the particular environment of this novel, a rooster that lives in the apartment of the dreaming brother and his mother.The ""great glass sea"" is set in a part of the former USSR, now essentially under the control of a corporation started by the oligarch that is constructing a combination of satellites and receptor mirrors and solar panels designed to transform the climate and the ecosystem of the area of Ukraine (it seems) for the sake of maximal crop production.  This ""development"" is one of several burdens on the novel that finally drag it down.  The complexity of the ""science"" and the industrial transformation of the country requires far too much exposition and seems to drive the author to recapitulate material and situations over and over, even when the ""point"" has been made.  At the same time, even a very attentive and patient reader, going back over already read sections to try to clarify the situations as they develop, may find that the nature of the industry is never entirely clear nor comprehensible.Similarly, while the relationship between the twins is deep and complex and credible, and emotionally compelling at many points, it is also predictable and finally not very satisfying.  Neither are the relations that develop between the dreamer and the violent resisters (really not revolutionaries, though they imagine themselves in that role now and then) nor the practical brother's relationship with Bazarov, the oligarch, which has layers of mutual manipulation, some hints of homoerotic connection, and plenty of menace, but not much is revealed or resolved that, again, could not have been predicted.  Nor, and this is painful, do I feel that the main development in the life of the dreaming brother--his discovery that he can recite classics of Russian poetry--especially Pushkin's Bronze Horseman--to admiring and enthusiastic crowds, finally inspiring many of them to rebel against the constraints of the new society that provides none of the values nor rewards of the classic (only partially remembered) society of pre-Revolutionary Russia--never achieves its full symbolic nor fictional status in the work.  Of course, he is thwarted and exploited and threatened with personal destruction, but like his brother's nearly abortive effort to achieve within the society, his efforts lead only to further destruction and death.I do not mean to suggest that Weil is merely borrowing standard tropes from similar dystopian narratives, but there is a tendency here to depend on familiar, almost archetypal, situations, and because the novel is set in Russia, there are also moments reminiscent of some of the great Russian writers of speculative fiction, Evgeny Zamyatin, for example, and Mikhail Bulgakov, but especially the Strugatsky Brothers, who make use in many of their novels of characters and narratives derived from the peasant traditions and folklore of rural Russia.  Allusions to Baba Yaga and other such characters are occasionally overt, at many points implicit in Weil's novel.But I must here exercise a kind of turn.  While I have emphasized the predictable content of the novel, and would also suggest that the repetition leads to a feeling of padding, of added pages that offer no further clarification or revelation of the importance of the events, I want to conclude with words of praise.  After all, I read this novel all the way through, and I did so without worrying about the repetitions and familiarity because there were, at so many points in the narrative, wonderful (and I do mean ""full of wonder--and beauty!"") passages of prose poetry--as though Weil suddenly were possessed by the muse and launched writing that, as truly brilliant prose--sometimes lyrical evocations of the land, of childhood experiences, of the sheer beauty of the night sky, at other times powerful dramatizations of the inner conflicts of men and women trying to be honest with themselves while trapped in a system that forces evasion and dishonesty, and sometimes the aching power of love, especially unrequited or hopeless--far surpasses and outweighs all the plodding plot elements.  Whenever one of these passages was under weigh, I felt the presence of a writer of true power and imagination, and I was forced to acknowledge that though this novel is finally not successful, it certainly does show the promise of a writer with the ability to produce great work.  He will need to be more willing to cut excesses (and trust his reader to get the points implied) and maybe to work beyond the kinds of plot turns and set scenes (some of the scenes of violence, especially, which are not gratuitous but add little of the power that violent narrative may bring to a novel).  I am reminded in this way of the works of China Mieville, some of them massive (Perdido Street Station) and brilliant, but others (The Kraken) excessively and tiresomely padded, whereas his shorter and tighter and sometimes more difficult works (The City in the City, Embassytown) provide both the imaginative power and the sense of artistic rigor that the best such works can offer.  It seems to me that Weil may give us work of the latter quality and I look forward to it.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R22AW7C11KNFDS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0802122159#wasThisHelpful","R22AW7C11KNFDS","AX6NA5JAL2B1K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AX6NA5JAL2B1K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

When I stay at one of those hotels that offers a buffet variety of pillows of many shapes or sizes (the last hotel bed I slept in had six pillows of slightly different shapes piled on it--to no particular end as far as I was concerned), I am interested mainly in the display.

"I haven't counted how many times John Gallaher mentions John Cage (and Silence: Lectures and Writings by John Cage) in the pages (among the poems) in his new book, In a Landscape, starting as he does with an epigraph—quotation from John Cage--and another from John Ashbery—but  I am sure it is quite a few, and every such reference (there are not so many direct references to Ashbery, but one  might say the whole collection is in some sense a continuing allusion to Ashbery—one might, and one hopes that is not offensive, since it is not intended to be, but quite the contrary) every such reference, I say, is a welcome reminder.  [Cause/Effect statement:  Reading In a Landscape caused me to, among other things, dig out from its obscurity my very old copy of John Cage's Silence and indulge the pleasure of reading it again.]  Indulging pleasures (as well as sometimes ruing unpleasantnesses) is not only an effect of reading In a Landscape, but also a subject of a fair number of passages in the LXXI segments  of this continually surprising book: ""Have you had a good life?""  Good question.  In the grand scheme of things, we're all fairly equal.  We just travel in varying degrees of comfort. ""  (from number LIII)I also have not figured out exactly at what point in my reading that the thought – ""something's going on here""—popped into my head, forcing me to stop briefly and consider what that might have meant.  The ""something"" was the troubling realization that the voice of these poems had cunningly taken over my own inner voice, replacing the tiresome hectoring that I usually treat myself to with a kind of quiet musing and meandering tone and procedure, not to mention syntax and vocabulary, not to mention plenty of references to things I might think I have in common with the voice/mind invading my voice/mind via these pages of long-lined (some short, to be fair) poems, numbered with Roman numerals (also a topic of queries and explanations, some humor,  some dread) and continuing, as we are told, to our relief, past their original ending point, which was to have been  XLI or possibly XLII, but ""I changed my mind.  I was going to stop writing this poem, but now I'm not, because I heard someone say, in the hallway earlier, that she had changed her mind, and it seemed a lovely idea, the way it struck me, to 'change my mind.'""  (from number XLII)and so he goes ahead all the way to LXXI.In this connection, and in passing, let me mention that reading the CONTENTS page of this volume is a fascinating experience in itself, though perhaps only after one has actually read through the whole book.  The CONTENTS lists the poems by their full first lines, each attached to its Roman numeral.  No, it does not form a coherent poem (that would be a neat trick), though it makes every bit as much poetic sense to read the opening lines in sequence as it does to read some pages of John Cage's Silence.What is it like to read these poems?  As already indicated, it is like having one's mind invaded and occupied by a quirky ambling mind, moving more or less through free association from topic to topic, image to image, narrative to commentary, exposition to homily, or sometimes to a shrug (""So there you are,"" rather like Gail Collins pausing in her quest for reasons why Republicans still exist, contrary to all evolutionary expectations or simple common sense).  And in case anyone wonders, it is an experience that I have found enjoyable and definitely in the realm of what I think of as poetry.It's always dangerous to offer comparisons or associations with other poets when talking about a specific poet's new book, but I don't care.  He took over my mind and it reacted by popping up every now and then with associations of its own.  Some are painfully obvious—those pages filled with long lines—are we in Whitman territory here? No.  Christopher Smart? No.  Ashbery?  Sometimes.  How about C.K. Williams?  Not really.  At some moments, Thomas McGrath?  Definitely, though rarely as belligerent.  David Antin?  Different style.  John Berryman?  (How about ""The earth, friends, is doing fine.""  Well I think so.)  But Gallaher's lines are finally his own.  Reading through this book in a long sitting, I have felt that he has found a cadence and rhythm (if those are distinguishable) perfectly suited to the manner of thinking of these poems.The ""voice"" prompts some other, maybe less pertinent (not intended to be impertinent) associations.  A touch of Andy Rooney here and there, or (many folks are too young to remember this) the late night radio monologues of Jean Shepherd from Cincinnati or later WOR, or even, now and then, Bob and Ray.  Drawing the past into the present and fitting them comfortably together has to be one of the aspects of these poems that I find particularly fascinating.  Many questions, some answered, many not.  Lots of invitations—  ""A moment of silence then  where my stories that are not being told  can mingle with yours.  Let's drive across the state.  Let's go over the river.  Let's run off  into the woods with them.""  (from number LVII)Sometimes deep questions combine with tentative reassurances :  ""We want to feel that our lives  have meaning, and the easiest way to ascertain meaning  is to look behind one for signs of having been  there.  The legacy starts now.""  (from number LII)And there can be passages that stop us dead in our tracks:  ""First warm day after a series  of cold days.  Guessing at intentions and inner lives  has always left me standing on train platforms late at night,  in winter, inappropriately dressed.""  (from number LXII)In years past, I have been interested, amused, engaged by John Gallaher's earlier volumes.  In some ways, they anticipate this one, but I would say that In a Landscape seems to me a kind of breakthrough, a fulfillment of the promise of those two books, but more importantly a break with them.  They offer many pleasures, but they also have seemed to me consistent with fashion—not a bad thing, necessarily, but prompting anticipation.  And here, for example, in LIV, we have ""Where's the line between what constitutes repetition and what constitutes change? Right now I'm thinking forgetfulness  is just as good as careful planning, similar to how doing nothing  is usually just as helpful as quick, decisive action.  Chance actions.  John Cage made detailed plans on chance.""Indeed.  We might shiver at an echo of Paradise Regained here, or a glance at Prometheus Unbound, but what we have is Gallaher, in the company of Cage once again, raising those questions about tradition and change, about influence and independence, about daily life and transcendence (or adaptation) that every poet must face.  The pleasure of the company of a mind exploring and recounting, and practicing the art of poetry with subtlety and clever craft—all things making this book worthy of strong recommendation.  Do read it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2JNGC5GKCFYU5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1938160509#wasThisHelpful","R2JNGC5GKCFYU5","AX6NA5JAL2B1K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AX6NA5JAL2B1K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The author of this novel (memoir? fantasia?) worked hard to keep any prospective reader from feeling comfortable or confident that she or he could depend on previous reading experiences to aid in navigation through the ""letters"" that compose the parts of the text.  Not only is the reader invited to read the parts in any order whatever, but that challenge, it becomes obvious very soon, offers an unnecessary further ""complication""--the letters are not, in any case, chronological, nor are they written/spoken/narrated by the same ""voice,"" nor is it always apparent that the same narrator is ""present"" in all the letters.  One can start with the premise that though names and genders shift and relationships, such as they are, may be fluid or imagined, fantasized or distorted by the shifting moods of the narrator of the moment, the narrative voice is always the same, only putting on alternative masks.  But that is a question--at any given time, the voice of the narrator may be congruent with that of the author, but the rapid shifts of attitude and tone regularly move the reader to wonder whether, in fact, this narrator is truly a ""divided person,"" one with multiple personalities or one driven into fragmentation by the extremes of her own emotional reactions to the friends, lovers, helpers, enemies with whom (or toward whom) the letters are to be exchanged. For the most part, the letters all appear to be intended for one particular faraway lover, Xu, even though some are addressed to Yong, and other characters are named, even addressed, even in the context of the letters supposedly addressed to Xu.The narrator(s) is/are writer/artist/university student/Taiwanese citizen/Parisian flaneur on occasion/underground person, and more.  Sometimes generous--seeking presents to give, offering loving thoughts; otherwise, grasping, demanding, insistent on having her own way on her own terms.  Sometimes female, occasionally male, lesbian, heterosexual, queer-asexual.  Through the many transformations of consciousness and -- if we dare use the word -- identity, we nonetheless ""hear"" the voice of a young person desperately seeking love, reacting hysterically or angrily or with despair to perceived rejection, refusing the love of those who offer it, demanding love of at least one who runs from her because of her demands and, perhaps, her instability.  One oddity of the novel--the narrator is undoubtedly a fractured personality, and by comparison, those around her seem stable, well put together, able to function in a ""normal"" society, though she suspects (and diagnoses) that they have found stability only through espousing false, fake, artificial personas, assumed because they perceive them to be socially acceptable.The narrator's letters often reach a crescendo of conflicted emotions--""So my desire became unhinged and my pain excruciating.  When you stop wanting me--withdrawing your eros--I go insane, truly insane.  I've reached an apex of insanity (ha ha).  Why am I laughing?  Because I have a fatal, mortal, terminal passion for you.  Ultimately I have no choice but death: an unconditional allegiance, an eternal bond to you.  (The ultimate rule of desire/eros is this: At their peak, ""sexual desire"" [erotic desire], and ""desire for death"" [the death wish] are the same.)  I'm a passionate person, and as you're someone I would die for, death seems inevitable, though it's still painful thinking about it.""  This heightened rhetoric and nearly hysterical tone are characteristic of the language and substance of many of the letters.  As a result, this reader, at least, frequently felt that I was being harangued, subjected to a self-indulgent rant by a person who, in the best of times, is self-centered, selfish, and probably destructive (not only self-destructive).  And that is when one, as a reader of this narrative, must retreat into thinking of it as, after all, a literary construct.  This incessant hyperemotion is not a person talking to me on the phone, but a character (or is she?) in a fictional (albeit heavily autobiographical, apparently) narrative.  But that takes us back to the beginning--the author has done her best NOT TO ALLOW us, as readers, to experience this as a literary artifact.  In this sense, the book may be reminiscent of some other experimental writings that do their best to force defamiliarization and alienation as the primary reading experiences.  (I think of, for example, Djuna Barnes's Nightwood, a far more conventional work in some ways, but also demanding of the reader, or the strange and alienating narrative by Anna Kavan, Ice.  One might even add E.A. Poe's The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym, or Sterne's Tristram Shandy.)To the extent that there is a ""story"" here, it includes the death of a pet rabbit and its burial, encounters with a famous woman scholar and writer, journeys back to Taiwan and Japan and then returns to Paris, ""quiet days in Clichy,"" though not so quiet as all that, and some visits to art galleries and performances. Names of some artists and writers, and especially movie directors, are dropped.  I don't mean to mock this--the author makes no pretense of constructing a coherent narrative, though the reader (this reader, at least) is likely to indulge the lifelong habit of constructing coherence where it is not apparent, weaving a plot line where none exists, working to frustrate the author's apparent wish to create a work without a plot and with no characters in the conventional sense of those terms.  As a kind of mental wrestling match between the reader and writer, this book is arguably fascinating.One might mention that the focus on what is crudely called gender-bending, or more recently ""queering"" relationships, is pervasive and in a few passages generates some erotic fascination.  While readers who are phobic about such subject matter might avoid the book, one can say that there is little in it to shock or dismay the reader who is familiar with the explorations of alternate sexualities in so much of modern literature.I did not take the challenge of reading the chapters randomly (I had enough of that when I faithfully followed the printed and then the proposed alternative order of chapters in Cortazar's Hopscotch many years ago), but the challenge itself, of course, put me on notice that there would not be a linear narrative, and indeed, the chapters might be said to spin around each other, creating not a plot nor stable characters, but a kind of galaxy of interacting (if not illuminating) parts, related but not kept in order.  I did several times return to re-read earlier letters, and that was interesting enough as the re-reading revealed perceptions I had not realized during the first reading--that, in itself, might be a strong argument for randomly re-reading the whole.  But I think I will not.If it were possible, I would probably give this 3.5 rather than 4 stars, but 3 seems a bit too stingy.  There is much to admire in the energy and imaginative ingenuity of this work, whether or not we want to call it a novel.  But the hectoring and ranting tone of many of the ""letters"" finally becomes irritating (as it would in ""real"" life), and as a reader, I found it distracted me from whatever kind of admiration I might be constructing from the shards of the experience..","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R9VPPYIHF6SX3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1590177258#wasThisHelpful","R9VPPYIHF6SX3","AX6NA5JAL2B1K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AX6NA5JAL2B1K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Readers familiar with David Vann's earlier fiction (Legend of a Suicide, especially) already know of his extraordinary ability to render physical sensations--the feeling of moving in stressful situations, the power and pain of a punch or a knife penetrating the skin, the pleasures of the many sensations when one is alert to the scents, the breezes, the movements of the natural world around us.  And more--Vann explores the the conflicts and pleasures of human relationships, especially as they begin to collapse into violent confrontation or rise to the ecstasies of loving encounters.  And always, Vann explores the intricacy of the psychological and moral challenges experienced when behavior leads to disaster or death.In Goat Mountain, we are party to the re-telling of a horrific childhood experience by a narrator who lived it and has grown older, scarred by the aftermath and still uncertain of the full significance of what he did at the time and what the longterm effects of what he did have actually been.  The basic situation is simple:  the boy, his father and grandfather, and a close friend of his father, go on an annual deer hunt that takes them to land in a wilderness area owned by his family.  The boy is 11 years old, ready to kill his first buck and ""become a man.""  These elements, so baldly iterated, make the story sound familiar and even hackneyed.  The story Vann tells us, however, spins off into extreme violence and horror of a kind that Vann is very skilled at telling.Not to give away too much, the boy shoots a stranger--a poacher on their land.  This killing occurs very early in the novel, and its impact on his father and grandfather and their friend, as well as on the boy himself, is the story that unfolds with frequent allusions (characteristic of Vann's narrative style) to other murders--the story of Cain and Abel being most often mentioned.  Thinking back on the significance of the murder he has committed, the boy examines his understanding of the story of Cain--a view of the story that is not traditional:  ""It may be a long time before he brings that stone down, and it's in this moment we can know Cain.  The momentum of his life, everything out of control, everything misunderstood and recognized too late, that's how we are descended from Cain.  All that was instinctual suddenly bearing consequence, our animal nature betrayed by consciousness.""  And much later, realizing that he has not understood the behavior of his relatives:  ""I didn't know them and they didn't know me. All familiar things can become unfamiliar.  One of the tricks of this world is the feeling that we belong.""That is the voice, of course, of the adult man, thinking back many years (we don't know how many) to the traumatic experiences of his eleventh year.  Though Vann drops a few clues about what might have happened to the boy as he grew to manhood, they are only hints and may be misleading, so the focus remains on the adult's memories of his eleven-year-old consciousness.  The boy is from a Cherokee family, and the teachings of his tribal elders are present (if not settled) in his mind, though he finds it easy to set them aside.There are some problems with this narrative, perhaps already indicated in what I have written here.  It sometimes seems that Vann is stretching far, overreaching in order to force us, as readers, to recognize and think about the powerful themes he is exploring--the nature of human violence, the relation between morality, social behavior, religious belief, and the violence that we seem sometimes to choose without thought or pause--as though all the teaching and rules we know simply disappear in the moment of excitement (of whatever kind) that leads to the dominance of the ""Cain"" that Vann suggests is present in all of us.The novel is intense, painful to read at times, and occasionally overwrought--but I can recommend it for anyone who is willing to share the experience of great physical stress and pain, of moral uncertainty, and the fear of abandonment that becomes very real to this boy as the aftermath of his action becomes increasingly desperate and destructive.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RMVSNQF324Y2S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=006212109X#wasThisHelpful","RMVSNQF324Y2S","AX6NA5JAL2B1K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AX6NA5JAL2B1K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have found myself more frequently discussing this novel as though it were a work of cultural criticism or even anthropology, rather than a work of fiction.  The Ruins of Us is impressive as a portrait (from several differing perspectives) of a social and cultural milieu that very few American readers will have had direct knowledge of--the private worlds of family and business and daily life in Saudi Arabia.  Because we know that Ms. Parssinen has lived for many years in that country, we are inclined to read with some confidence that she has the authority to interpret the customs and attitudes of her Saudi characters, as well as those of her American characters.  Because of this, the book provides the pleasure (which has been a main value of many fine novels) of immersion in a foreign or unfamiliar cultural environment, satisfying our curiosity and, I think, correcting some misconceptions and false stereotypes, while confirming (with sympathy and understanding) our sense of the radical differences between western secular customs and attitudes and those held (even, it must be said, enforced--by morals police) among traditional Saudis.At the same time, and this will lead us to the particular drama of her plotline, Parssinen shows us the tensions and conflicts that occur when a traditional culture such as the Saudi encounters and chooses to interact with a very different--corrosively different--culture, such as that of the 21st century western world.  In order to do business with U.S. and western European governments and corporations, the Saudis must, with reluctance, open spaces within their sovereign nation to accommodate (even to allow if not endorse) customs and behavior that are anathema to their Islamic traditions and laws.  That this creates deep divides and dissonances in the lives of their people is vividly dramatized by Ms. Parsinnen's central characters--a wealthy Saudi businessman, his American wife, and their children, all conscious of the divisions between their Saudi and their American relatives and heritages.  When these conditions are exacerbated by the husband's choice to take a second wife, as allowed by Islamic law, resulting in traumatic emotional responses from both his first wife and (in different ways) both his children, the plot develops and the differences in character, belief, and loyalties become apparent.Ms. Parssinen, then, makes good use of personal relationships to embody and dramatize social and cultural conflicts, and the unfolding of the essentially melodramatic (and quite familiar) plot turns will allow the reader to understand and sympathize with the several different points of view among the main characters.  But though this is an effective literary device, it also must be seen as a weakness in the overall planning of the novel.  The familiar domestic drama is dressed in unfamiliar cultural costumes, but is nonetheless a story we know, and so is predictable in a number of ways that make the middle of the novel feel overly long and unnecessarily drawn out.  We understand that the several characters need time to absorb the situation and to contemplate their responses.  (Ironically, several of the minor characters feel underdeveloped in part, I think, because so many pages are devoted to the ruminations of, especially, the teenage son as he confronts his mixed love and hatred, his wish to assert himself as a true Saudi man and proper heir to his admired grandfather, while also recognizing his love for his mother, whose behavior he must, in his Saudi self, reprehend and repudiate.)One result of the familiarity of the plot is that the genuine interest of the portrayal of the layers and complexity of Saudi society becomes the dominant positive quality of our reading experience.  While any reader will be engaged and concerned about the outcome of the final confrontations that lead to the denouement of the plot, that probably will not be the main memory carried away from the book.  But one thing seems clear--Ms. Parssinen is a very good writer--her style is strong and consistent, and she knows how to create engaging and fascinating characters.  I would hope and expect that she will write and publish more novels, and that they will continue to be superior, even better.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2Z9M32I7J9Q4O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062064487#wasThisHelpful","R2Z9M32I7J9Q4O","AX6NA5JAL2B1K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AX6NA5JAL2B1K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I would not say that this is the worst novel I have ever read, but it is certainly the least successful of any that I have read in recent years.  There are reasons why one would have hoped this would be a deep and powerful exploration of a world seldom encountered in fiction, though recently at least on display in some novels and films--the world sometimes described as ""queer nation,"" a world of challenged or repudiated gender roles and sexual identities, bisexual, transsexual, as well as homosexual.  Unfortunately, the novel Ms. Schrag has written, while it takes us into the upscale parties and the sleazy sex clubs, as well as into the worldviews of several persons who live the lives (because one point of the novel is that very few people of any persuasion live similar lives--every life is importantly different), is finally not much more than one of those ""romcoms"" that we see opening with some regularity at the local multiplex--some sophisticated, some sentimental, some just terminally stupid.  Adam, as a novel, is a mix of those qualities.  What makes this novel different from, for example, John Rechy's pioneering City of Night, with its excursions into what was then a deeply hidden, secret, closeted world of menace and blackmail, is that the setting in 2006 allows the characters to assert and explore their identities with public defiance of the repressivenorms that made Rechy's world so much darker; the gay, queer, transsexual demands for equality (in this case, a rally for marriage equality occurs in New York at a significant point in the narrative) are part of the growing openness about and acceptance of gender differences in our society.  There are, of course, as we are reminded several time, dangers in the form of gay bashing and other forms of violence, as well as discrimination and various self-inflicted wounds that affect or even destroy the lives of queer people.At the center of this novel is a seventeen year old California high school junior, Adam Freedman (get it?), who is (as is apparently universal among teenagers) uncertain of his social standing with his ""friends"" at school, uncertain of his ability to have a successful sex life, uncertain of what he wants in his future, uncertain of how to spend the summer, uncertain about his feelings toward his parents, his sister, even toward the young woman he would like to identify as his girlfriend and sex partner.  He knows how to use the standard technological devices (computer, smart phone, social media) but is not always successful in getting what he really wants from them, rather than just the information about what he wants, which may be no help.  The main action of the novel occurs when he decides to spend the summer in New York, living with his lesbian sister and her roommates, looking for his own possible sexual enlightenment or maturation.  Adam is characterized as something of a cross between Candide, Holden Caulfield, Alexander Portnoy, and several characters recently played by Michael Cera in films by Jason Reitman and others.  Naive, but not innocent; bright, but not aware of how to use his intelligence; not bad looking, but sexually uncertain and unsuccessful; shy, sometimes sensitive, but unable to act on his best impulses.  On the whole, a familiar type.Adam's problem in New York is that he falls in love with a young woman who self-identifies as lesbian and who is attracted to him because she mistakenly believes he is a tran--a woman who is in transition to being a man.  The complications for Adam (building a relationship on a set of lies that could be revealed at almost any moment and the desperate efforts he makes to re-construct himself as the person Gillian imagines him to be) are the bulk of the narrative.  We spend a lot of time inside his head as he calculates or just desperately sorts through the pros and cons of his alternatives--he wants to tell Gillian the truth, but every attempt is deflected or interrupted by their activities or by his fear that the time for openness and honesty is not quite right, so he must wait till next time.  When Adam is not reminding us of a Michael Cera character, he unfortunately stumbles into Adam Sandler territory.My references to popular movies are appropriate in part because much of the language and conversations in the novel involve references to the popular culture images and popular phenomena that would, of course, be the normal currency of adolescent conversation.  Even though Adam is mostly (at 17) the youngest of the characters, who are more his sister's age (22-28, maybe), we are immersed in the kinds of enthusiasms and simple cynicisms of high school and college upper middle class kids.  Well and good, if Ms. Schrag were able to probe and explore these characters with anything more than surface observations and some pop psychology.  True, when Adam is trying hard to validate his impersonation of a transsexual, he does some online ""research"" that allows Ms. Schrag to fill some pages with facts and definitions and explanations about such matters as ""top surgery,"" ""bottom surgery,"" ""T"" and other details of the transformative processes and experiences of her characters.  But beyond some fairly bald and simple ""explanations"" of how and why her characters are living as they do, we find little insight and little beyond some formulaic plot turns to get us through to the entirely predictable ending.Many will find this novel entertaining, perhaps, or even revelatory if they have no prior knowledge of the inner lives and behavior of the characters portrayed.  But finally, the plot is too familiar and the characters and details hung on its somewhat frayed line are not enough to rescue the book.","2.0 out of 5 stars","May 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJFP5V0ILCKKG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0544142934#wasThisHelpful","RJFP5V0ILCKKG","AX6NA5JAL2B1K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AX6NA5JAL2B1K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Any translation of one of the Homeric epics is a massive undertaking, presumably attempted only by scholar/poets who revere and love the work and feel moved to make it available (as the translator experiences it) to readers unable to read the original Greek.  Whether by Chapman, Pope, Rieu, Lattimore, Fitzgerald, Fagles, or any of the several more recent authors, such work must at least be given the respect due to serious effort in pursuit of a noble goal.  Emeritus Professor of Classics, Barry B. Powell, now offers his translation of the Odyssey (which was preceded by his Iliad), and it comes to us with a variety of attractions:  helpful explanatory footnotes with definitions or convenient identifications of unfamiliar names; reproductions of classical art works--paintings, decorated pottery--to exemplify and make concrete the imagery of the poem; useful maps and an informative introduction.  All these commend the volume to the student or novice reader of the epics, and certainly they are welcome.The translation itself is another matter.  Homer's poetry is notoriously ""beautiful"" and notoriously ""untranslatable,"" especially into English, since the prosody of the Greek poem is not easily imitated in English--long lines tend to feel either cumbersome or broken-backed in English, and they often plod, especially when the vocabulary and syntax try to reproduce the original phrase by phrase.  Does Powell do this?  Yes and no.  His work is loosely called ""free verse,"" which is to say that his line lengths vary quite a bit, but tend toward length--12 to 15 or even more syllables per line, with usually, as he tells us, five stresses per line.  He also states freely that ""I hope to convey the sense of each word and phrase in the Greek, without prettifying or embellishing.  I am not concerned with sounding 'poetic' or beautiful or clever, because that would be to falsify the plain style of the original Greek.""  He follows this stated principle, and so we readers can feel confident that he has made at least an honest effort at giving us an ""accurate"" translation, as near as possible in sense, if not in sound, to Homer's original.  The result is, unfortunately, many lines that creep across the page, flatfooted or lame, and though every translation I have read (those mentioned above and a few more) has suffered at some point from those ills, I have to say that this one has more flat and more stumble than most.  There is very little sense of the beauty of Homer (which, for what it is worth, I do find in both Fitzgerald and Fagles, and most certainly at many points in Chapman and Pope), though we do find a story told well, if in somewhat plodding language and at a pace that will leave many modern readers wondering what all the fuss is about this ancient epic.I can imagine that this translation would make a good textbook for undergraduate introduction to the work as an important monument of western civilization.  I wish I could offer more praise, but it is just not a version that I would pick up if I wanted to read and remind myself of the power and beauty of Homer's works.  There is always something to gain in publishing a new translation--opportunities for new insights or transformed aesthetic experiences, but in this case, I cannot see any reason to prefer this over any of the earlier outstanding offerings.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1BV1LL0EPAPB8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0199360316#wasThisHelpful","R1BV1LL0EPAPB8","AX6NA5JAL2B1K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AX6NA5JAL2B1K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"At almost every point of Francine Prose's ambitious narrative, there is something interesting to encounter, almost always the realization of one's hope that there will be more learned about the characters she portrays.  Prose manages impressively to ""present"" a number of disparate characters, using letters home, an autobiographical memoir, a biography written by an uncertain and self-critical author, a written record of the life of one who asserts that her documentation of herself must be destroyed at her death, though it obviously has not been, and the self-revealing essays of an American expatriate describing his life in Paris during the 1930s. There are also chapters of third-person narrative, though they have no greater ""authority"" nor credibility than the first-person or derived narratives of the others.  The voices are distinctive, so that we feel we are in the presence of several different persons and we experience the sometimes sharp differences in their understandings of their overlapping experiences.Some of the characters are readily recognizable as based on known figures from the period:  Lionel Maine is surely a portrait of Henry Miller; Gabor Tsenyi has several clear connections with the great photographer, Andre Kertesz, and others (Lily de Rossignol, Yvonne, and others) can also probably be traced to known ""originals,"" though that is finally not a satisfying exercise.The narrative begins with a letter from Gabor Tsenyi to his parents and that launches us into the Paris of 1932, especially the sometimes louche, sometimes criminal, but also fascinating and seductive underworld of the Chameleon Club (and related venues), where men and women may go to live their social lives according to their self-chosen genders, cross-dressing if wished for, romancing persons of their own or indeterminate gender, and so on.  The entertainment at the club is full of the purposeful transgressive and satiric songs, dances, skits, even acrobatic performances that reflect the preferences and wishes of the patrons.  And of course, some patrons are only there to observe the oddities (from their perspective) of the regulars.  All this shows us that the novel is both constructed of multiple perspectives--the same events and experiences seen/felt through the eyes of very different participants, and also it is very much about those multiplicities.At the heart of the narrative is a woman, Louisianne Villars (or just Lou), who prefers to dress as a man, who pursues a career as a auto racing driver at a time when women are either excluded from, or confined to roles as curiosities, in the international racing world she wants to dominate.  But the more extended and disturbing development in her life--the question that seems to drive her biographer, Nathalie Dunois, to write is how such a woman could have become not just a Nazi collaborator, but a passionate devotee of Adolph Hitler and an active participant in the torture of French citizens active in the Resistance by the SS.  It's a daring effort on Prose's part to portray in sympathetic terms a character who becomes a moral monster yet retains the readers' interest and some degree of sympathy.  Prose does this, in part, by creating a complex shield between herself and Lou, in the person of Nathalie Dunois, the biographer who cannot resist putting herself prominently into the story of the woman whose life she has researched and is dedicated to explaining through the biography she attempts to write.  I say ""attempts,"" because we are reminded that she recognizes her own failure, and at the same time, we see that the failure is, perhaps, a kind of authorial complicity.  By putting Dunois between herself and Lou, at least fictionally, Prose avoids the problem of eliciting the readers' condemnation for treating a dedicated Nazi with sympathy.  (Jonathan Littell works mightily toward the same end in his magnificent Les Bienveillantes, a novel that presents the first-person narrative of a high-level SS officer.)  While the goal seems to be to show how a ""normal"" person could be drawn into the Nazi worldview, and the portrayal of that process is certainly convincing up to a point, it is not clear to me that we have any deeper understanding of Lou as a Nazi once we have read the novel.The other characters, the Baroness and her homosexual husband, the Hungarian photographer and his devoted French wife, the American writer, the Chameleon Club owner, and several others provide interesting variations on our sense of what is going on and how the period from 1932 to the invasion of France by the German armies and beyond has affected the lives of Parisians and French citizens in general.  It is a period in modern history that has been written about extensively, both in recent memoirs and in a number of important fiction works of recent times.  Francine Prose provides insights and dramatic interactions that often seem to extend our understanding of the period and the actors in it, but at about two-thirds of the way through the novel, I found myself being disappointed and even distracted--as though the work had lost momentum and fallen into unnecessary repetition or even excess elaboration.  Of course, the relationships are complicated, the social and political (and military) conflicts are complex, and so much needed to be explored and possibly made explicit.  Nonetheless, as my title for this review indicates. I came away feeling that some judicious editing would have helped to strengthen the overall impact of the work.  It is ambitious and it is in many ways fine, but just a shade too long for its own good.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R7ARZ3S4XAIRC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0061713783#wasThisHelpful","R7ARZ3S4XAIRC","AX6NA5JAL2B1K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AX6NA5JAL2B1K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

It's too early in the spring to have much to do with the snakes (I don't wantto eliminate them, just discourage them from setting up housekeeping on myfront porch), but the gopher(s) do seem to have moved along since I sprayedtheir main area (at least, where I know they have been), but I have no ideahow long the discouragement will last.

ON the whole, this seemsto be a good product and, I have to say, one of the best characteristics of itis that it does not produce the choking and unlivable stench that two otherproducts unleashed when I tried to use them last year.  It is not scentless, butwhat it produces is mild and bearable.

"Having greatly admired and enjoyed several of Jean Echenoz's novels (1914, Running, Ravel, especially), I approached Je M'en Vais with high expectations.  I cannot say that I was disappointed, but neither was I impressed.  The novel is entertaining and very cleverly crafted, certainly indicative of the skilful and disciplined methods Echenoz has offered in his other fictions.  But where the other three I have mentioned have all been deeply serious, Je M'en Vais is much more an entertainment--a light and often funny crime caper novel, with ironic twists and characters that require little profundity in the writing (as is found, certainly, in the three others mentioned).  It is as though Echenoz set out to show that he could write a very good example of genre fiction, with suspense, a cold and calculating murderous villain, and he could combine that with some sharply observed satire of the pretensions and falsity of the contemporary art market--perhaps internationally, but certainly in Paris.The central character, Ferrer, is the owner of a fashionable art gallery in Paris; he caters to wealthy collectors, regularly seeking the new ""hot"" artists and sponsoring their works, promoting their reputations while profiting from the eagerness of his regular customers to purchase good examples of the latest ""big thing"" in contemporary art.  Ferrer is not merely a cynical profiteer, however; he actually cares about art and does make an effort to find work that is not merely chic and exploitative.  He has no interest in cheating his customers, but he is well aware that the tides of fashion have little to do with artistic merit and much to do with the eagerness of some who can afford it to be in on the latest popular trend.The novel begins with its title:  that is, Ferrer says in the opening sentence, ""Je m'en vais"" as he collects his suitcase and belongings on the way out the door, telling his wife ""Je te quitte; je te laisse tout mais je pars.""  And he goes. It does not take long to discover that this Ferrer is not going to be without female companionship for long--in fact, he is a relentless chaser and seducer, always on the lookout for an available woman who fits his preferences.  So his departure from his wife sets up a sequence of encounters of varying degrees of success with other women. Not long after, we learn that his gallery is having cash flow problems and his business has been off, so that he needs a quick financial boost, but has no luck dealing with banks, none of whose financial officers care to advance him the needed loans.  Next (all this is early in the novel), he learns of a possible cache of valuable native American artworks, stranded in a derelict ship iced in near the North Pole, and the ""caper"" aspect of the novel moves into full swing.  He makes the trip, arduous and dangerous, to the North Pole, finds the ship (this is still early in the novel), and the reader will surely anticipate that there is, really must be, a plot afoot to deprive him of his financial cushion--surely when he returns, the precious artifacts will be stolen.The second main character in the novel is Baumgartner, cold, clever, obsessive, elegant and ruthless, and determined to have the artifacts Ferrer has gone to such trouble to acquire and smuggle back into France.  And that is as much of the story as one is willing to tell--the thriller, complete with mysterious women and cold-blooded killing--moves rapidly to its conclusion.The satiric scenes that punctuate the thriller segments are all based at the gallery or in the company of artists and art customers.  The pretensions and delusions of the artists are carefully manipulated by Ferrer and his assistants and the scenes of their conflicts and negotiations, as well as those of Ferrer persuading his wealthy customers of the desirability of the art he has for sale, are genuinely funny.This, then, is a neatly composed and elegant example of the kind of artistry it satirizes--fashionable, consistent with popular taste, but created with the highest level of craft and fashion consciousness.  And it is good fun, though not a candidate for the upper level of Echenoz's canon.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ASIBY47O8SO4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=2707316865#wasThisHelpful","R2ASIBY47O8SO4","AX6NA5JAL2B1K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AX6NA5JAL2B1K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""Hide long enough from your fear,/Mother said,/and you too disappear.""The above sentence may or may not be the central idea around which much of this ""novel in verse"" might be said to revolve, but it's a good candidate.  The narrator and main character, Henryk, has many reasons to want to be invisible or to disappear, and for the most part, those involve his retreat from what he fears.  In the ""present"" of the novel (which is 1968) he fears induction and shipment to Vietnam; in the earlier periods of his life that he invokes as he shifts backward in time to his early childhood in Poland (1941) through his adolescent years in Chicago and his later graduate program (seeking an MA in philosophy with a thesis on the thought of Ludwig Wittgenstein) to a series of part-time jobs (taxi driver, maintainer of vending machines, teacher of English as a second language) until he reaches the basement of the California Department of Social Services building in San Francisco, where he has become the Head Clerk of Closed Files, working in a subterranean environment that qualifies him as a cross between ""underground man"" and Kafka-like bureaucrat, he experiences many kinds of fear.About that childhood in Poland:  Henryk as a child lives in Jedwabne, site of one of the more horrific pogroms during the Nazi occupation of the area.  Henryk's Polish mother attempts to hide and rescue some of their Jewish neighbors, concealing them in a hole under the stalls in their barn; Henryk, as a small child, witnesses atrocities against his neighbors, knowing that the Polish townspeople had herded the Jewish citizens of the town into a barn which they then set on fire, incinerating hundreds.  And more.  In the course of this novel, the adult Henryk attempts to translate into English the volumes of his mother's eyewitness descriptions of the atrocities kept in diary form and carried along on their flight from Poland.  These provide, one might say, one extremely violent and horrific ""bookend"" for the chronology of the novel, the other end being Henryk's perceptions of the Vietnam war which he hopes to avoid, though he has no way of evading the violence of our society at the time and is unable to forget or cut loose ""from a vast personal history/of defeat and occupation,/of anger and despair,/among other things.""Along with the war, 1968 was the time of assassinations (RFK, MLK, among others) and, in San Francisco, the rampage of the Zodiac killer, as well as the widening ""movement"" of resistance, rebellion, rejection of mid-American manners and values and violent backlash against the resisters.  And along with the violence that swirls around him, Henryk must deal with his memory of his own inadvertent killing of his best friend – a killing for which he was absolved of guilt or legal responsibility, but for which he cannot forgive himself and certainly he cannot forget.This is a novel, then, that explores the mystery of human violence and hatred by forcing attention to particularly egregious examples of it, instances that cannot be explained or justified by any of the usual analytical, statistical, ethical or philosophical methods one might use in discussing them.  Whether it is the ringleaders of the Jedwabne pogrom, the individual demented killer who taunts the authorities with his riddling letters invoking astrology, or the ""best and the brightest"" insisting on the need to rain napalm on Vietnamese peasants who have no ships, no planes, no prospect of invading the United States, but must be defined as threats to US national security, Henryk tries to understand, using narration and observation as the only tools at his disposal, though often, he harks back to his study of Wittgenstein, who appears regularly as ""Ludwig"":  ""'What does it mean to know who is in pain?'/Ludwig asked himself./What criteria determines what can be tolerated/in any one place and time?""  Trying to confront these kinds of questions, Henryk mixes his past, his present, and ""awakened/at four in the morning/by my radio screeching a cabbie/was found in the Oakland Hills,/shot straight through the back of his head,/I finally understood such sundry vulgarities/as the Tet Offensive, Sleszynski's barn"" and other atrocities.There is more to the story, of course; Henryk's sexual liaisons with the wife of his thesis adviser, Betty, and with the ""free spirit"" Heddie, his encounters with veterans of Vietnam in his English language class, his exploration of the remains in and around the Clerk's office of his predecessor's work.  All of these and the nature of his final job, itself, filing away the documents and evidence of appeals from desperate (or fraudulent) applicants for social welfare funds, in effect, disappearing their memories by placement in closed files.  And always, we are aware of the title—""Wherewithal""—an odd word, referring in some contexts merely to financial stability – having the wherewithal to get by, or perhaps to get ahead, based on the ability to pay – but also metaphorically to mental capacity – having the wherewithal to understand a situation, to pursue a goal, to achieve or to surpass -- and we are reminded that Henryk is almost always financially distressed, and in his own mind, at least, almost always perplexed and inadequate when faced with even the more ordinary sources of embarrassment, humiliation, pain, or even positive experiences such as being desirable to a beautiful woman.The novel is divided into six segments, each one preceded with an illustration—one of the famous ""Carceri"" of Piranesi—elaborate imaginary prisons, vast and complex visions of multistory buildings with columns, many rooms and sub-rooms, dungeons and cells, torture machines and shackles.  In Henryk's office in the basement, there is a reproduction of one of these designs, tacked to the wall, and that prompts several specific references to Piranesi's imaginative projections of prison but possibly refuge.  Each of those six sections is further divided into sixteen parts.  Those parts shuffle chronology, so each section may have part of the mother's Jedwabne diary, part of the account of Henryk's accidental shooting of his beloved friend, Rossy, part of his description of his work as a cab driver in San Francisco, part of his experience refilling vending machines on the U.S.S. Constitution aircraft carrier, and so on.  These are not necessarily in chronological order, but there is no problem as a rule, in keeping track of the narrative.And of course, this is a poem.  We notice that the epigraph to this review, with its interpolated attribution (""Mother said"") is split by slashes, indicating line divisions, indicating that this sentence is part of a poem. Other quotations in this review have had similar indications that the sentences are not continuous and the margins will not be justified on both sides.  As every page of Schultz's ""novel in verse"" reminds us, the experience of reading poetry is different in important ways from reading prose.  The supple and variable free verse of the work could probably be printed continuously, like prose, and readers would read it as prose, perhaps.  And what would be lost?  A great deal.The idea of a ""novel"" in verse has been with us on and off for centuries, preceded by the long narrative poems (epics, chansons de geste, Ovidian tales, and more).  It has had its moments of seeming popularity, as seems to be the case now, since a number of contemporary poets have offered novels (as well as memoirs, even biographies, and other nonfiction forms) written in verse, with varying degrees of success.  The success of Philip Schultz's novel is in its power, and that power rests comfortably in the verse form.We read poetry differently.  We read it more slowly in most cases; we pause with it; we are more aware of the language and punctuation, of the often multiple connections among words and phrases that would be obscured in a prose layout.  We may be more likely to notice repeated words or phrases that take on multiple connotations, or images that recur and become multivalent.  All this happens in this novel, to considerable effect.  And so, if there is sometimes a question as to whether there is an advantage or ""value added"" to a novel written in verse, the answer in this case is decidedly yes.  Schultz uses free verse most of the time, though there are some interpolated prose passages (the letters from the Zodiac killer, for example, and some news stories), and the verse is irregular but always has a noticeable rhythm and important shifts of emphasis where the emotional tone or temperature of the narrative benefits from them.Finally, however, it is the profundity of the material that has a great impact on the reader of this work. It is a brave writer who takes on the Holocaust, especially in first-person narrative, as he does with the mother's diaries; it is a challenge for any writer to take on the crosscurrents of the social and political upheavals created by resistance to the Vietnam war.  In a very different realm, creating a character who is obsessed with Ludwig Wittgenstein's ideas and finds many occasions to apply them—at least speculatively—to his own daily life (which is what Ludwig would have wanted, of course), is also a considerable challenge, and again, Schultz succeeds.The Wherewithal is complex, bringing together not only verse forms and novel forms, but  graphic art forms, and history (some still disputed), anthropology, philosophy, and more—all to set out without preaching or dogmatizing, the perplexing human experience of painfully familiar human behavior.  It's a powerful book and highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2G0GZX2CYYVOZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0393240940#wasThisHelpful","R2G0GZX2CYYVOZ","AX6NA5JAL2B1K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AX6NA5JAL2B1K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It is dangerous to use the word ""facile"" in connection with a writer's work unless one really wants to denigrate that work, and that is not my intention here.  Peter Ackroyd has a long career as a writer of fiction and non-fiction.  His novels are set in London in various periods of the city's history; they are carefully researched so as to re-create the layout of the city, its atmosphere and customs in the period set; Hawksmoor, Chatterton, The Lambs of London are particularly good examples.  He has also written readable and respectable biographies of London literary figures, including Chaucer and Shakespeare and William Blake, as well as Isaac Newton.  Both the novels and the non-fiction works are of uneven quality (The House of Dr. Dee, for example, is a disappointment by any standard, and the biography of Blake, though readable, is not to be recommended for accuracy).  But always, and here comes that word again, Ackroyd makes the job of writing the work look easy, even though none of these can have been easy to write.  His prose style is smooth and nicely adapted (by vocabulary and syntax and rhetoric) to the periods portrayed, and his plots run smoothly.In these senses, Three Brothers: A Novel qualifies as ""facile""--the plot is neatly constructed so that the fortuitous intersections of the lives of the major characters seem both inevitable and predictable, without undermining the pleasure of the narrative.  What seems easy, that is to say, need not be considered inferior.  The three brothers--left by a disappearing mother to be brought up by a near-absentee father--emerge in London in the late 1960s to develop quite separate lives in different ""levels"" of London life: the eldest, Harry, moves from being an errand boy in a newspaper office quickly up through a reporter's status to editor in chief and moving toward editor/publisher.  Daniel, one year younger, by dint of serious, even obsessive study and self-discipline, manages to find a place at Cambridge University while living the life of a closeted and desperate homosexual in a time when his personality would have been considered criminal and subject to many dangers.  The third, by far the most interesting, is the youngest, Sam, a kind of ""holy fool,"" in an almost Dostoevskian mold (think Prince Myshkin and Alyosha Karamazov), a child-man whom some women and some men feel moved to adopt and protect, a near-mystic who finds refuge in half-understood religion and who behaves with greater charity and kindness toward others (or at least, he thinks and wishes he should and could so act, when sometimes prevented by circumstances from doing so) than do most who have public or professional ""roles"" that are assumed to be directed toward helping their fellow human citizens of London.These three are all, in various ways, affected by the presence--invisible to them, though they are not invisible to her--of their disappeared mother, who is, in various ways, linked to people who are directly involved with her sons.  Their fates are all worked out, again with seeming facility, with results growing from their connections to her.There are also several other female characters, including Harry's mother-in-law and his wife, as well as a somewhat mysterious nun, and others, but the focus of the novel is directly on the brothers and a few other men who are either involved in a business way with Harry or in a romantic way with Daniel, or as possible destroyers of the innocent Sam.And so, like most of Ackroyd's novels, this is an enjoyable read--patterned in a satisfying way, informative about some odd bits of history of London, evocative of sympathy where merited.  It is not a profound novel, but it would be unfair to dismiss it for that.  It has no ambition to profundity, but it has something serious to say, and it says it in the course of entertaining us.  (One might say, for example, that Eleanor Catton's much admired Booker winning novel, The Luminaries, is more ambitious and more effortful only in that it is so many times longer, and it is similarly entertaining and evocative, but hardly profound at all, and that is not intended to be a negative statement. Ackroyd's novel has similar virtues, but in far fewer pages and with fewer characters to keep track of.)  It is probably worth more than three stars, but not so many as four, which is about what I would award to most of Ackroyd's work--maybe excepting Hawksmoor and Chatterton.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RLIJJ864GUGYK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385538618#wasThisHelpful","RLIJJ864GUGYK","AX6NA5JAL2B1K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AX6NA5JAL2B1K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Edward Hirsch has offered a one-man version of the venerable Princeton Encyclopedia of Poetry and Poetics, now in its fourth edition, and for many, perhaps most, readers, Hirsch has made an offer we should not refuse.  I have valued the Princeton volume since it was first published.  It is packed with information about all aspects of prosody, poetic traditions in English as well as most of the other languages of the world.  It has the scholarly authority and gravitas not only of its publisher but of the crowd of scholars and critics who supplied the individual encyclopedic entries.  One would not want to discard it, but for the pleasure of reading and thinking about poetry, the lively, more personal, and generally more engaging volume Hirsch has produced would probably be the choice of most readers.  For quick reference and information, the Princeton volume is valuable; for the fun of reading about one's favorite topics, Hirsch is both dependable and a fine entertainer.As the book's title suggests, this is a ""glossary,"" a vast collection of terms and labels and concepts, organized alphabetically from ""abecedarian"" to--700 pages later--""zeugma,"" with hundreds of entries informing us of the shapes and backgrounds of obscure poetic forms in Sanskrit, Arabic, French, Yoruba, Japanese,  indeed most of the languages in which poetry can be known.  Whether one needs to know the meaning of ""qasida"" or ""reverdie,"" ""ekthesis"" or ""cynghanedd,"" Hirsch offers etymologies, contexts, sometimes examples, always in a genial and understated manner.  The pleasure of browsing the book is finding unfamiliar but always fascinating new terms, many from non-anglophone traditions (the Afghan traditional form, ""landay,"" has recently become familiar thanks to Poetry (Chicago), and Hirsch provides helpful background); anyone who cares about poetry at all will want to add these new concepts to her or his memory bank, while seeking out more examples where possible.Hirsch also, of course, provides definitions and details about the more familiar terms and practices of the Anglo/American and European traditions:  scansion, verse forms, schools, movements, revolutions and fads.  Typical of Hirsch's charm and restraint is the big one--his ""definition of ""POETRY""--where he essentially adheres to the tradition that poetry is the use of language that we cannot define, though we know it when it hits us--""an inexplicable (though not incomprehensible) event in language""--and he then goes on to offer quotations and paraphrases of variations on the same ""definition"" from a couple of dozen poets ranging across many centuries and traditions.  The modest and yet dependably well-informed tone and procedure of the many entries reassure the reader while maintaining an inviting and enjoyable reading experience.Most of us do not, of course, read a reference book--especially not one half seriously described as ""having something of the madness of a Borgesian encyclopedia--from cover to cover.  It is a book to be sampled, though it is likely that most readers will be drawn to do just what I did when I first opened it--start reading here, turn to there and there and more and more beyond--""what does he say about scansion? what does he think of L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E poets? is there an entry for ""dissociation of sensiblity? (yes) or ""poetry slam"" (yes), and so on.  It was easy to spend a good part of an afternoon and then an evening just flipping back and forth in the book, cross-referencing or just randomly fishing for eye-catching words.  At the same time, it is certainly useful for people who just want to find a quick definition of a term of art related to an art form they care little about (but for that, of course, the internet offers even quicker, though usually less valuable, definitions).Other poets have offered poetry dictionaries, collections of terms, guidebooks, and those by John Hollander and John Ciardi, Paul Fussell and Mary Oliver and other venerables will remain useful and helpful, but Edward Hirsch, respected poet and scholar himself, has added a more comprehensive, more engaging work that all lovers of poetry will find valuable.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R10LRJXK046Y34/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0151011958#wasThisHelpful","R10LRJXK046Y34","AX6NA5JAL2B1K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AX6NA5JAL2B1K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Scholars of literary modernism, of twentieth century American literature, of Paris in the Twenties, and some other specialties will have many reasons for reading this book.  In one sense, they are the proper reviewers of it, since it is a meticulously edited scholarly edition of the letters of Ernest Hemingway written during a brief but extremely important period of time, from 1923 to 1925, important both in Hemingway's development (he was writing some of his most important fiction, including The Sun Also Rises), and in the history of literary modernism.  Hemingway's friends and associates--Ezra Pound, William Carlos Williams, F. Scott Fitzgerald, Gertrude Stein, Robert McAlmon, Sylvia Beach, and many others are central to the literary developments of that period, and there are letters from Hemingway to those friends, mostly worth reading.  The scholars will find the work to be a valuable addition to the Hemingway record, or they will judge it from their positions of authority for the quality of its editing and presentation.For the rest of us, for those who are Hemingway fans or just admirers of some of his fiction, but not professionals, the interest is nonetheless pervasive in the collection, and the editors have made it all wonderfully accessible by providing careful annotation, informing us of the identities and relevance of many obscure and some famous persons, the locations and qualities of many places, even the meaning of some of Hemingway's playful slang and neologisms.  (It's a comfort, for example, to find a note explaining his sentence to Ezra Pound"":  ""It was good to lamp the underwooding again.  I thought you were offa me.""  The editors remind us of that brand of typewriter.)  That kind of scholarly detective work is what we may all be grateful for, even as we wonder whether Hemingway might have been spending time with James Joyce.For many readers, an interest in biographical details or, especially, the kinds of trivia that fill many (though definitely not all) pages of personal letters is considered trivial, maybe evidence of celebrity worship replacing serious literary experiences.  To some extent, this can be true--knowing how Hemingway reacted to his first bullfight in Spain is interesting, but should not replace the experience of reading his fiction and nonfiction accounts of bullfights, nor should one assume that one understands the fiction better from reading such letters.  But they are not entirely ephemeral or worthless.  For one thing, the evidence of the author's style as it develops in these informal writings may provide a sharper insight into her or his artistry; the emotional reactions to lived experiences may suggest motives for fictional re-creations of those experiences, and so on.  So long as one does not assume the letters ""explain"" the literary works, one can find interest and even some insights into the author's character and creative processes.  Certainly these letters are no substitute for Hemingway's fiction (though a few are much more enjoyable reading than his lesser self-parodying works); this volume, in particular, must be especially interesting because of the crucial time period it covers.  Even one who does not value Hemingway's fiction may find interest in the insights into his friends, his associates, his rivals and enemies, his milieu during one of the most important periods in modern literary history.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RT59Z3YO55CE8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0521897343#wasThisHelpful","RT59Z3YO55CE8","AX6NA5JAL2B1K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AX6NA5JAL2B1K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Readers familiar with Peter Matthiessen's earlier novels will find some qualities that they already value, but in many ways this is a new direction for Matthiessen, an uncompromising and occasionally fierce exploration of the ways human evil flourishes, as well as the bewilderment, even despair, those who try to oppose evil may experience at their repeated failures.  Matthiessen quotes a poem by Anna Akhmatova as an epigraph--it begins ""Everything is plundered, betrayed, sold,/Death's black wing scrapes the air,"" and that is fair warning.  A visit to Auschwitz--the most notorious in some ways of the Nazi death camps--is not an opportunity to salve one's personal guilt, nor to plump up one's easy conscience and self-esteem, as the central character, Prof. Clements Olin, discovers, to his pain but also, perhaps, toward his enlightenment.There is nothing simple about this narrative, though the situation can sound simple:  Prof. Olin, a student of modern Slavic literature with a special interest in the works that emerged from the Holocaust, arrives in Poland on his way to Auschwitz, where he is to join (more as an observer than participant, or so he thinks) an ecumenical religious group planning to spend days on the selection ramp, meditating and witnessing on behalf of the murdered millions.  Olin (whose family name has a history as that of an aristocratic family, Olinsky, who held property in the vicinity of Oswiecim) is also, secretly, in search of information about his mother, who did not leave for America when Olin's father and grandparents fled.Olin encounters a wide variety of people--a ""Nordic-Jew"" as his roommate; a group of Zen meditators; Jewish groups from Israel and America, German descendants of SS officers, a Polish priest, a pair of novices aspiring to be nuns, a defrocked monk, and more.  The uneasy interactions among these disparate people, occasionally bursting into heated argument as their stereotypic assumptions and prejudices emerge to contradict the official reasons for their presence--to atone for the sins of the Holocaust and to forge unity among the various religious and social views they bring with them.  In the cold and oppressive environment of the remains of the death camp, the psychological impact of the memories--both stimulated by documentary films and museum exhibits and also evoked by the feelings of the ""presence"" of the millions of dead--is heavy and unsettling.  Olin, who expects to be engaged at a scholarly or academic level, even in approaching his search for evidence of his mother's fate, undergoes strong challenges to his sense of his self--more than just ""identity crisis,"" the near collapse of his sense of who he is and why he continues to live.Matthiessen has presented intense and powerful characters in earlier works--Far Tortuga, Killing Mr. Watson, especially--but here he is probing deeper and more painfully into the fundamental questions of the relation between our ""selves"" and our responsibility for behavior--both our own behavior and that which we witness and either condone or try to ignore or, under some circumstances, stand up, oppose, resist, even attempt to prevent or stop altogether.  Part of the testing of those human characteristics in this novel comes from the presence of a Mr. G. Earwig (an assumed name, of course) who purposely separates himself from all the others, mocking, reprimanding, denouncing, deeply insulting the others, calling into question all of their values and characters and assumptions.  He is, in this way, a person in the mold of Thersites, the mocking cynic and nihilist who appears in Homer's Iliad, but also, even more destructively, in Shakespeare's Troilus and Cressida.  He becomes the dark side of Olin as the narrative progresses, and his presence, and then his life story (which may or may not be true) serve as catalysts for Olin's own crisis of identity.There are other elements of Olin's story that are better left for the reader to discover.  But as my title for this review indicates, there are no easy ways out of the moral challenges and dilemmas these characters face, and no simple resolution.  This novel leaves this reader shaken and impressed.  Yes, some parts of it are open to question or criticism, but the quibbles are unworthy of mention.  Yes, Olin himself reminds us that many have felt that there is an impropriety, an inauthenticity, even an outright dishonesty in writing about the Holocaust by anyone who did not experience and survive it.  From that perspective, all others should be silent.  But Matthiessen makes a powerful case for the honest and wrenching effort to confront that history, even as one who comes at it from a position of privileged distance, comfort, abstraction and analysis.  Certainly this is a novel worth reading, and more than once.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2JNJCUQ2DTGWC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1594633177#wasThisHelpful","R2JNJCUQ2DTGWC","AX6NA5JAL2B1K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AX6NA5JAL2B1K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Teju Cole's Every Day is For the Thief is the kind of book that reminds the reader of the comforts provided by awareness of genre.  It is much easier to discuss a book if one knows what kind of book it is--a novel, a memoir, an autobiography, a travel narrative, a collection of essays.  All those are possibilities in this case, and in some ways one might consider that the indeterminacy of the work's generic identity might qualify as an interesting challenge, even an advantage--some might claim that it is an adventurous effort to blur generic conventions, to reject the cliches of narratives about young men returning home after some years away in a very different cultural environment.  That--the return home--is on one level exactly the kind of narrative we find, when we find narrative, in this book.We also find in -- or on -- this book, the assertion that it is ""a work of fiction,"" with the usual assertion that any resemblance to real persons or places is purely coincidental.  We are also assured, in promotional information included by the publisher, that the author's earlier book, Open City, received high praise, nominations, and prizes as an excellent ""novel.""  But at no point do we see this book referred to as a novel--though we are assured that it is a fictional narrative.I make these points because I have had to struggle with my impatience and disdain, my outright annoyance, with the way this book proceeds.  I know that Teju Cole has published essays, including travel essays, because I have encountered some of them in periodical publications.  If I were to say, therefore, that this book consists of a number of essays more or less pasted or stitched together, each of them expressing the author's responses to the changes in his native country--especially the city of Lagos, Nigeria, on his return to that place after fifteen years (or whatever period actually may have passed), and that those essays are written in a bland, cliched, and surprisingly voiceless prose, with details repeated for no apparent reason, I think the description would not be totally unfair, though it would be admittedly somewhat reductive.Consider this chapter opening:  ""One sign of the newly vital Nigerian economy and one of the most apparent, is the proliferation of Internet cafes.  There had been none when I left home.  Now there are several in every neighborhood and there must be hundreds in Lagos alone.  The Internet cafe is symbolic of a connection to goings-on in the larger world, an end to Nigeria's isolation.""Or this:  ""The proliferation of new eateries designed on the American fast-food model surprises me.  When I left in the early nineties there was just one, Mr. Bigg's.  Now there are several, many of them operating on the franchise system, in every neighborhood of the city.""  And so on.Yes, in the chapters following these openings, we are give interesting descriptions.  In the first, we learn that the famous e-mails from Nigeria, offering us the opportunity to receive a fortune from a deposed general if we will send his widow a sum of money (or many variations on that), are actually being produced by young men working frantically in the internet cafes the narrator mentions.  In the second, we learn that the system of franchised fast-food restaurants has grown, but not according to the expectations we might have of McDonald's or Burger King--in fact, the narrator goes out to one to have his favorite meal of ""peppered snails and stewed spinach with peppercorns""--a meal I would be interested to try myself.  The problem here, however, is that these chapters, and those describing the narrator's visits to the National Museum, to a privately funded music conservatory, and even to the homes of old friends, are all told in a style consistent with travel essays we might expect to encounter in the Sunday NY Times Magazine or some glossy magazine devoted to interesting new places to visit.Even the descriptions of the perils of not knowing the local assumptions about giving bribes to almost anyone who stops one and indicates the expectation of ""payment"" for nothing but permission to continue where one is going, or the accounts of the epidemic of home invasions and burglaries, or the horrific descriptions of the effects of belief in various kinds of witchcraft or spirit possession, all tend to read like the observations of a nonfiction writer, intent on picking up the ""vibrant"" local details and behaviors for the sake of the reader who might want to be ""in the know"" about what to avoid on the streets or in the markets of Lagos.  In other words, by far the majority of pages of this ""fiction"" read like the work of a modestly talented travel reporter.The narrator of this ""fiction"" is a young man who had left his home in Lagos after a number of conflicts with his family and the failure of his expectations about his future in Nigeria.  He has lived in the U.S. for a number of years.  He wonders what he will find; he thinks about the ways his expected encounters with old familiar places are disappointed; he marvels at the increase in corruption--the incessant demands for money from every petty official, policeman, even casual passerby, the assumption that all business will be conducted with only the immediate profit of the seller or contractor in mind, with no expectation that the customer will receive or be satisfied with what he or she has paid for, and no recourse, since complaints to police or other officials will be met with further demands for money under the table or behind the back.  He is both impressed and appalled by the changes he encounters.This nameless narrator also gives us some glimpses into family life through encounters with his aunts and uncles, nephews and nieces, with some old friends.  These narratives have more of the feel of a novel, and one might want in fairness to conclude that they do provide enough fictive context to frame the obviously nonfiction writing as part of the narrator's responses.  But really, nothing helps.  This is not a novel, not a collection of short stories, not a memoir; it is a collection of fairly interesting essays about the situation in Nigeria in the early 21st century.  Cole could have (perhaps did) publish them separately in any number of periodicals, ""spicing"" them with his fairly frequent, but not very useful, allusions to writers he admires--Michael Ondaatje, Gabriel Garcia Marquez, others.  But he has not done the work of a fiction writer, he has not produced a novel nor, I would argue, even a hybrid form that would qualify as experimental.  I find this book to lack literary value, though it has some interesting anecdotes and some entertainment value.  But the voice of the narrator--listless and confused--is all too appropriate to this poorly conceived work.  I do not recommend it.","2.0 out of 5 stars","March 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2RTR3CNSCMAHA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0812995783#wasThisHelpful","R2RTR3CNSCMAHA","AX6NA5JAL2B1K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AX6NA5JAL2B1K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In the second section of Virginia Woolf's To the Lighthouse, she narrates the passage of a number of years in a relatively brief few pages, describing in precise and evocative detail both the persistence through time and the changes through time that happen in and around the summer house that had been the location of the opening section.  Among the details about the house, which becomes the central character in that section, Woolf drops bits of information about the lives of the human characters who had inhabited the house during section one, some of whom would return in section three.  The account of the passage of time, as symbolized by the changes in the house, is poetic, powerful, disturbing.In chapter three of John Steinbeck's The Grapes of Wrath, he describes, with the feeling of an epic journey, the effort of a large turtle to cross a hot dusty highway.  This memorable description stays with the reader throughout the novel, and is enhanced by other interpolated chapters, not all similar, but all designed to convey a sense of both the permanence of the natural world and the fragility, the brief temporality, of physical objects—especially human beings--in that world.  The turtle's journey is a straightforward metaphor for the  trials of the Joad family on their trip from Oklahoma to California.I mention these familiar narrative strategies--many other writers have used variant versions to create a sense of continuity or to assert a kind of universality--because we find similar gestures in Jenny Erpenbeck's brilliant novella, Visitation.  Interestingly, she opens the story with a brief ""Prologue,"" printed in italic in the edition I have read, describing the passage of ""approximately twenty-four thousand years"" in the area immediately adjacent to the house that will become her version of that house belonging to the Ramsey family in Woolf's novel.  Erpenbeck wants us to be aware of the very large and long ""history"" affecting the space surrounding the vacation home that is the location of her extended narrative.  She opens with a condensed anthropology of the lives and customs of the people who live in the immediate area, describing superstitions and rituals of birth, growth to maturity, marriage, death and burial.  From there, we have the context for the coming stories of the owners, lessors, inheritors, visitors and vacation renters, who will inhabit the house during a period of years.First, however, we meet ""The Gardener,"" a man whom almost no one knows:  ""No one in the village knows where he comes from.""  But many become aware of his presence, of the work he does, of the support he provides the inhabitants of the vacation house--indeed, of his essential contributions to keeping the house in repair, the grounds and accessories to it well groomed and functional, the trees growing, pruned, cut down and chopped up for firewood when necessary, and so on.  The gardener is the permanent, persistent presence, providing continuity and a degree of memory.  He knows what needs to be done to keep the house going and he does those things, without complaint, nearly without compensation; ""he lives alone in an abandoned hunting lodge at the edge of the woods, he has always lived there,"" where he is a familiar sight and presence and source of help and information, but no one knows his name.  He is, for this novel, the metaphor taking the role of Steinbeck's turtle.  He appears in short chapters between the longer chapters devoted to the people who come to live (for varying lengths of time) in the house he maintains.  Erpenbeck uses repetition--subtly varied descriptions of his work with the grounds, the woods, the crops, the dock on the lake, and so on--to emphasize both the continuity and the subtle but inevitable forces of change.As we read, we become aware that the narrative has settled in time of war--specifically of the period leading up to the Second World War and through it; allusions to the changing fortunes of the people (some of them Jewish, others not, and so not in the same jeopardy) who have owned and used the vacation house; we learn indirectly or by allusion of their fates--being herded into cattle cars and sent to final destinations, and so on.  The pain--and there is great pain in this novel--is that we know that we already know what has happened, what will happen, to so many of these people, and we know the guilt that may or may not be consciously present in the minds of some of the other people, the responsibilities acknowledged or ignored.  We have lived with these images so that we don't even need to have them presented explicitly--passing references to tiny details are enough to trigger what we have always already known because we are creatures of the twentieth century, with all its horrors.  Perhaps this novel will require notes and explication in the future, for readers who have never experienced the particulars of this history, but for now, the impact on memory and on conscience cannot be ignored.Jenny Erpenbeck's skillful deployment of these literary devices--metaphor, allusion, evocation of small details that combine to contribute a sense of inevitability as well as continuity, the exercise of what might be called institutional memory--is comparable to the enormous power of her narration in The Book of Words, a novella that feels more like a fable, in part because the central consciousness of it is a child (or a woman reconstructing her sense of the world when she was a child), and so works even more by hints, allusive details, clues, and abstractions that allow us to generalize from the situation of that child to larger historical contexts.  Visitation is, I think, marginally less powerful than The Book of Words--more dependent on familiar sentiments, even certain cliches of fictive narrative, but the margin is so small as to be unworthy of much attention.  This is a powerful work by an author of extraordinary depth and compassion.  I am eager to read ever more of her fiction.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1RVCDMQN3P466/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=081121835X#wasThisHelpful","R1RVCDMQN3P466","AX6NA5JAL2B1K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AX6NA5JAL2B1K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It's not a book review, nor is it really literary criticism.  Neither is it a straight memoir, though it is certainly close to that.  We have had a number of similar books recently--explorations of the relationship between a reader and a particular book.  Dawn Potter's wonderful Tracing Paradise: Two Years in Harmony With John Milton, which I reviewed here a few years ago, comes to mind.  (The ""Harmony"" of that title is the name of Potter's hometown, Harmony, Maine, by the way.)  Similar accounts--some only essay length, others as ambitious and detailed as Sarah Bakewell's How to Live:  A Life of Montaigne in Twenty Questions, which does for Montaigne's essays what Mead does for Middlemarch--makes it a book one immediately wants to sit down and read.  Rebecca Mead has lived with and valued George Eliot's Middlemarch since she was seventeen years old, rereading it, visiting the places associated with Eliot's life, and generally allowing herself to ""live into"" Eliot's world while exploring the ways that Eliot's masterpiece has helped to form herself and the world as she experiences it.Mead's book describes both her reading experiences and the ways they fit into (or interrupted) her own life, as well as her efforts to learn as much as possible about the life of Mary Ann Evans/George Eliot, at least as much as was in any way pertinent to Eliot's composition of Middlemarch.  Mead visits Eliot's notebook in the rare book collection of the New York Public Library, and many places in England associated with the life (daily life, especially) of the author.  In all these passages, Mead offers intelligent and empathetic links between Eliot's experiences and characters and events in the novel.  She does not suggest simplistic cause and effect relationships, but traces where possible analogies and inspirations, suggesting ways that they illuminate Eliot's purposes (not ""intentions"") in developing the novel as she did.We know that works of literature can have great impacts on readers--especially young readers.  John Keats's first encounter with George Chapman's translation of Homer's Iliad is immortalized in one of the best known poems in the English language.  Many other writers have provided testimonials to the power of a novel or drama or poem by writing introductions to new editions or essays that combine the deep observation of the significance of the work in itself with careful observation of the ways that work has influenced the writer.  Some of the greatest literary criticism is close to this kind of writing, but the recent examples of such memoirs have made a bid to establish it as a genre all its own.  Potter and Mead have offered splendid models of how such books may be written, and suggest that they can, by themselves, have much the same kind of impact as they are describing.  (Of course, and sadly, one might also suspect that they are appearing at this time--a time of concern among many over declining numbers of serious readers and the fear that such experiences will cease to be part of most people's lives.)This book has received much praise, with prominent reviews by famous reviewers (front page of the NY Times Book Review, written by Joyce Carol Oates, for example), and there is not a lot I could add to the praise it has already received, except to say that as one who spent 40 years teaching literature, and who always hoped that by sharing the wonder and enthusiasm and joy that great works such as Middlemarch have given me, I might encourage younger people to join me in the experience of reading.  Mead refers at the end of her work to ""a landscape changed by books, reshaped by reading,"" and that is a fitting conclusion to her fine reconstruction of the life of Eliot though careful attention to Eliot's greatest work, always acknowledging that she has filtered all this through her own responses to that work--coming to us with honesty and clarity and offering the best she can--the invitation to join her in reading an unparalleled masterpiece of the human spirit and the writer's art. Anyone who loves reading will enjoy this vicarious tour; all may benefit from the wisdom Mead has gained from her reading and telling.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RAYURTKQ51JX6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0307984761#wasThisHelpful","RAYURTKQ51JX6","AX6NA5JAL2B1K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AX6NA5JAL2B1K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The world of The Book of Words is both a dreamworld of poetic fascination and a nightmare world that suddenly reveals itself as the narrator's attention shifts from, perhaps, a real present toward memories of a real but dreamlike past: ""I  walk into my room and there she is standing at the window gazing at the mountain.  I see  Marie, and at the same time I  look right through her at the mountain, and the mountain, for which the window-frame was always too tight a fit, now has  plenty of room inside Marie's body. I pull a chair up the the table so she can sit down beside me, there's already a plate of cake there. Your housekeeper brought it for me, Marie says.  But eating isn't so easy for me anymore, she says, and only now, when she turns around, do I see she no longer has any hands, they've been cut off just above the wrist."" The girl gazing out the window  at the mountain, the mountain seen through the girl, the mountain too large for the window but comfortably framed within the girl's body--a succession of images consistent with certain surrealist artists' practices, both in poetry and in visual representations, and then the conventional moment--polite chat about a plate of cake explodes into the horror of the girl's missing hands. We learn bits and pieces of the background of this story, scattered through the pages of fragmentary and disjointed memories, presented in a kind of stream-of-consciousness narrative that includes recurrent (some will say repetitive) phrases or whole sentences that crop up just as, in all our conscious self-narratives, certain images and ideas, words, phrases, pop up either as prompted by similar events or feelings, or seemingly inadvertently and out of place, but still comprehensible with some thought, maybe disturbingly tied to what otherwise seems an innocent or insignificant moment--making that moment humorous or portentous, grotesque, horrifying. The poetic power of this passage is characteristic of the experience of Jenny Erpenbeck's brilliant novella, which begins with the narrator telling us that her eyes ""see but see nothing,"" her ears ""hear but hear nothing,"" and she must struggle to deal with ""all this strangeness in my head.""  This narrator seems at first to be a troubled child (""Father and mother.  Ball.  Car.  These might be the only words that were still intact when I learned them""), but as we readers allow this voice to enter, we realize that she is a timeless, ageless consciousness, often a small child perceiving a father who is ""a man who stays taller than you for a long time,"" but always a mind talking to itself, telling itself the kinds of stories that we all tell ourselves about ourselves, though most of us are fortunate not to share the kinds of details this mind has to integrate into her stories about her own past. Time passes as the narrative progresses, but it passes according to its own system of measurement, according to a calendar superposed to replace the ""normal"" calendar.  The dislocations and contradictions--we are never sure where we are, what country (though it seems to be somewhere in South America in a country in decline, governed by increasingly desperate and ruthless dictators, who appear as dinner guests of the narrator's parents or as statues in a park) or what time period.  These uncertainties contribute to the surreal and nightmarish qualities of the story which is told, however, in a nearly affectless tone by the voice who begins as a small girl, seems to mature to at least late adolescence, but who may be reconstituting her life story in this narrative from the perspective of an older woman attempting to understand the accumulated falsehoods and distortions--the betrayals of language and feeling and human decency--that make up her experiences during her childhood--experiences characterized by euphemisms and platitudes, easily seen through but hard to replace with any sense of clarity or understanding.  We readers recognize the hints about the actual circumstances in the narrator's city--the disappearances, the tortures, the drastic measures, the decline of all services and amenities, even of basic necessities, the ability of her parents to accumulate to themselves and in their household all the ""fine things"" that are taken from those who either do not need them any more, did not deserve them in the first place, or simply are not around to take care of them or assert ownership Other writers have used the device of presenting a story through the mind of a child or young person who sees and experiences, but is either too young to understand the implications or, as she grows older, is prevented by adults from drawing her own conclusions, developing her own understanding, of the ""adult matters"" that are concealed or distorted by euphemisms and outright lies.  The consequent distortions of consciousness may well create the kind of surrealist nightmares that we find in this narrator's telling of her tale and of her rescue from, at least, the circumstances of it, if never from the memories, which gradually come into focus, though never become acceptable.  We might think of Henry James's What Maisie Knew, or even Holden Caulfield in Catcher in the Rye. But seldom has an author captured the poetic power of a consciousness dealing with the eternal return of the almost musical phrases--even leitmotifs--of horror as effectively as Jenny Erpenbeck has done in this tiny but mesmerizing and unforgettable novella. It should be said, in addition, that too often the translators into English of works in languages we readers may not know are left unmentioned.  Not here.  I have not seen the German text of Erpenbeck's novella, but I feel confident that Susan Bernofsky's translation has given us a faithful and impressive experience that must be comparable to the original work.  She has captured the poetry and the horror with evident skill and artistry, and her work should be honored. It may seem odd, even perverse, to encourage readers to enter a labyrinth of horrific experience, even filtered through a profoundly poetic sensibility, but this novella makes us mindful of the realities of lives lived under the power of vicious and murderous tyrants--men of impeccable manners, fine dressers and connoisseurs, who know how to deal with the question, ""what to do with the material?"" That there is no such simple answer as the one the narrator's father imposes is only one of the things we must learn from this powerful work.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2UNE1YF4Z3ZEG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=081121706X#wasThisHelpful","R2UNE1YF4Z3ZEG","AX6NA5JAL2B1K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AX6NA5JAL2B1K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Imagine a character more domineering and more brutal than Miss Jean Brodie (of the famous Prime); a teacher who fishes and probes her students' lives, drawing out their secrets and using them to give herself some degree of control over their behavior; a teacher who openly mocks, patronizes and satirizes the parents, especially the mothers, of her students when they come for a ""conference"" or to ask advice; a teacher who both denies all personal feeling about or for her students, and grasps at them with fierce possessiveness when she wants responses to her advances.  That would be ""the saxophone teacher"" (otherwise unnamed) who is at the center of one of the main plot lines of this novel.  Early in the novel, she asks a mother, rhetorically:  ""I ask my students . . . is your life a gift worth giving. . . . Of course it isn't, and the reason for that is that they simply haven't suffered enough to be worth listening to.""  This comment indicates an aspect of the saxophone teacher's view of her own role--it is in part to protect but more, to make sure that her students experience some instructive suffering--and tell her about it.Imagine a young man, 18 or 19, beginning his studies to become an actor at a prestigious, highly selective, dramatic academy, where he encounters teachers and fellow students who regularly undermine or obliterate his sense of himself, of his aspirations and emotions.  He is told in one class ""You cannot mime what you don't understand.  You cannot penetrate death, or God, or a woman.  To attempt any of these things is to aim for sincerity rather than truth.  Sincerity is not enough for students of this Institute.  Sincerity is a word for hawkers and hacks.  Sincerity is a device, and we do not deal in devices here.""  He is asked to link this view with the related assertion, by the Head of Acting, that ""an untrained actor is a liar merely.  . . . you are all liars, not calm persuasive liars but anxious blushing liars full of doubt.""  The truth of his art is what the young man seeks, but he finds there are no convincing models either among his fellow students or his teachers.  That would be Stanley, the central character of the second plot line of this novel.  One of the recent graduates of the Institute, who stops in to give words of encouragement to the first year aspirants, says ""Remember that anybody who is clever enough to set you free is always clever enough to enslave you.""  This comment, very early in Stanley's career, has a certain prophetic power, though it is not exactly predictive.While Stanley is being initiated into the secrets and techniques of avoiding sincerity and never lying, a scandal erupts at the neighboring high school when a male teacher is accused of having ""raped"" one of his female students.  This scandal, with the inevitable arrival of a ""counselor"" assigned to ""save"" the young women of the school from the traumas of even hearing about such a terrible event (what many of them know or suspect is a consensual sexual affair between the young woman and the teacher), happens to involve the younger sister of the victim of the rape, as well as a couple of other young women, all of whom are students of the saxophone teacher.  And at a certain point, Stanley becomes ""involved"" with Isolde, the younger sister, with unsettling consequences.Eleanor Catton's novel is overtly about the relationships between art and truth, between art and neurosis or emotional disturbance, between sexuality and personality and identity, all of which problems are explored in sometimes comic, but always threatening ways as the two plot lines work their way out.  The lines between ""reality"" and fantasy, between the real self and the invented or fantasized self, whether in the body of the actor or in the behavior of the young women who ""perform"" in various ways for the saxophone teacher, will blur.  Who influences whom​?; who controls whom?; is the controlling one actually in charge, or is she a prisoner of her own fantasies of control?  Catton complicates the scenes where these questions are explored by mixing chronology.  Each section of the novel is labelled either with a day of the week or with a month; the months are Stanley's life; the days of the week are the saxophone teacher's and her students' days.  Sometimes these are jumbled out of sequence so that we realize we are reading an event that happened earlier than several that we read about many pages before--and the newly revealed past moment offers a new perspective on what we thought we knew had happened on earlier pages.I won't reveal more about the plot lines because it would be too easy to spoil surprises.  It is enough to say that the ""progress"" of the two lines--which finally draw together because of the connection between Stanley and Isolde--is unsettling, uncomfortable.  There are many uncertainties for the reader, not least of which is how much to believe of the saxophone teacher's view of her own behavior and of her interactions with students and parents; on the whole, one would certainly have to conclude that she is an uncommonly untrustworthy narrator whose notion of what is happening at any one moment is probably a much-distorted version of what the other participants might have believed was going on.  On the other hand, Stanley is mostly trustworthy, if only because he openly fails to understand what we, as readers, will surely understand by fair inference--precisely because we know how those things work and we can see that he has not yet suffered enough to understand them as we do--which, of course, puts us in the shoes of the saxophone teacher (or of one or another of the several teachers at the dramatic arts institute) as cynical viewers of the naivete of the young.Eleanor Catton has recently triumphed with her second novel, The Luminaries, and so has confirmed the talent demonstrated in her first work, but The Rehearsal is a novice work, full of the flash and ingenuity of a very smart and clever writer who apparently enjoys showing off her skills.  There is a cold and calculated manner of presentation that sometimes leaves her characters underdeveloped and caricatured (as though performed by the novice actors in Stanley's class), and like many contemporary fictional narratives, there is a kind of slippage to and fro, leaving the reader uncertain of the genre of the work--at times a sharp and biting satire, almost Juvenalian (as in the portrayals of Stanley's father, a psychiatrist, and of several of the mothers, but also of a few of the students at the high school), but at other times an adolescent coming-of-age story, more or less realistic in its presentation of the confusions caused by burgeoning sexual drives and the social dynamics of teenage social divisions into cliques and hierarchies, bullying crowds and confiding pairs of friends--at least for now.  A different kind of slippage occurs in the characterization of the saxophone teacher, as the reader begins to realize just how untrustworthy her descriptions and claims about her experiences really are.On the whole then, I doubt I would have read this novel through if it were not for my curiosity about how Catton performed in her first major effort.  I am impressed that she made such a massive jump from the level of this work to the level of The Luminaries.  We can hope that the second novel is a more accurate antecedent for any future novels she may give us.","3.0 out of 5 stars","February 3, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R32D5MWQFFLKI1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0316074322#wasThisHelpful","R32D5MWQFFLKI1","AX6NA5JAL2B1K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AX6NA5JAL2B1K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Late in this memoir, Gary Shteyngart alludes to the work of ""one of my favorite contemporary writers, Chang-Rae Lee, telling us that Lee's work shows ""what fiction about immigrants can get away with.""  Specifically, ""scenes in Native Speaker that are not teased out with . . . laughter and hairy ethnic weeping but shouted, with anger and resignation, at the sky, scenes that make me question the relative insignificance of what I am trying to do with a 'comic' novel . . .""  In other words, Lee's works do not depend on the tricks that Shteyngart himself has used.  A few pages later, he admits ""On so many occasions in my novels I have approached a certain truth only to turn away from it, only to point my finger and laugh at it and then scurry back to safety.  In this book, I promised myself I would not point the finger.  My laughter would be intermittent.  There would be no safety.""  Along with one much earlier comment (""We Soviet Jews were simply invited to the wrong party.  And then we were too frightened to leave.  Because we didn't know who we were.  In this book, I'm trying to say who we were.""), these stated commitments set a high bar for success, ambitious claim to a high seriousness and deep human sympathy to be carried through this narrative of, roughly, the first forty years of his own life, and the 60 to 70 plus years of his parents' lives.It's not easy to assess the success or failure (I would say there is a mix) of this book in fulfilling Shteyngart's ambitious project.  He manages some undeniably readable accounts of his earliest years in Leningrad and then in Queens.  His descriptions of his high school years are recognizable and evoke sympathy.  His account of his dissipated and sometimes riotous college career at Oberlin can be funny if one is not (parent-like, older-generation-like) too deeply saddened by the waste and damage done by his frantic efforts to live down to his most cynical views of what he wants from college and how he believes he can get it.  His painful (but not all that distinctive) efforts to succeed sexually with women are comical, but not unusual in an era of letting all hang out.  Throughout, we are kept aware of the very painful and conflicted relationship with his parents--Russian immigrants to Queens who bring with them attitudes and beliefs that prompt a kind of ""assimilation"" into American culture in the Reagan era that may suit them but must be, finally, more damaging to young Gary than even he realizes as he is growing up.  He is something of a momma's boy (because his mother provides a refuge from his father's temper), but he passionately wants acceptance, admiration, and especially love from the father who nastily calls him ""Snotty,"" along with other denigrating nicknames.Gary learns that being the joker in the room provides cover and some immunity from the bullying and mockery that he inspires in his classmates in elementary and high school.  That same kind of japery, mixed with bouts of competitive drunkenness and efforts to be the biggest ""head"" on the Oberlin campus, where he has strong competition for that status, are part of his continuing development and, arguably, decline.  When he finally discovers that the psychoanalysis he enters with smirking irony, hostility, disdain, actually 'works' for him, helping him out of both the depressions and discombobulating confusions that make success (especially success as a writer, which is what he most wants to achieve) ever more remote, the narrative settles down, resulting in a moving and unusually straightforward account of his taking his parents on a homecoming trip to St. Petersburg, where they visit the scenes of his childhood and effectively resolve many of the conflicts that have made their lives often miserable, occasionally chaotic.Shteyngart achieves an impressive literary feat in his manipulation of point of view--his own--in this narrative.  He manages to give us Gary from about 5 to high school age in a voice that is consistently ""true"" to a boy that age, including all the misimpressions, compulsions, confusions, and comical mishaps that go with that age range, and he does it with no hint of cuteness.  (In fact, one term that may often apply to such childhood narratives, cute, could never be attached to any part of this book.)  As he moves us into the high school and then college years, the persona changes, grows, becomes more cynical and ""knowing,"" more defiant but also more painfully self-conscious and ferociously self-critical at the same time that it is more and more assertive of the certainties that an adolescent and young adult may carry with him until they are shattered by experience.  This control of style, this deft manipulation of differing narrative voices, must be said to be the ground of whatever success this work achieves in carrying out Shteyngart's stated goals.  The book is funny, irreverent, a long standup monologue by a very clever and sometimes witty comedian whose sense of timing is excellent. At times, however, it feels reminiscent of the stale patter of a comic who depends on repetition of familiar jokes--take my punchline, please!The strengths of the book are undeniable, and yet ----.  Perhaps I should say that I have not been a fan of Shteyngart's fiction--especially not Super Sad True Love Story, which I reviewed some time ago.  Though I am not sorry to have spent the time reading that book and this one, I find myself still being less than enthusiastic.  The self-display, especially during the stories of the Stuyvesant and Oberlin years, is regularly undercut by the self-deprecating humor, and we are reminded that there is pain behind the mocking grimaces.  It would be hard, however, to give this book much credit at all, even with the masterful manipulation of tone and perspective, if it were not for the final section devoted to the trip to Leningrad/St. Petersburg.  But good as that section is, it also feels suspiciously convenient--so many bits and pieces, images and motifs, are neatly tied together that it feels like a package produced way before and saved in the attic until it's ready to come out with a TA-DA!  Fixed!Shteyngart is funny and bright, and I probably will read his next and the next after that, but I hope this represents the settlement with his past that will let him get on with his creative future.","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R36WKN46KYKV31/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0679643753#wasThisHelpful","R36WKN46KYKV31","AX6NA5JAL2B1K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AX6NA5JAL2B1K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have never had a chance to use a French Coffee Press until this one arrived.  The instructions are easy to follow and the Press is an elegant and easy to use machine.  My first attempt at using it was a bit awkward and I think I miscalculated the amount of coffee to put in, so it was not perfect, but the second batch was fine--a rich coffee flavor and on the whole a very smooth drink.  I am sure I will enjoy using this whenever I have the time to do so, and I can recommend the Press to anyone who is curious to try it.

"I am really uncertain why this book has annoyed me as much as it has.  I have admired several of Paul Auster's novels and would rate them high; I have enjoyed reading his essays in periodicals when I have encountered them.  I know that he is admired and awarded as a writer. But this book has struck me as so tiresome and trivial that I had a hard time finishing reading it.The memoir purports to describe Auster's childhood and early adult years.  The opening paragraphs offer a charming child's view of the world around him, not really reminiscent of Joyce's similar self-portrait in Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man, but having some of the same naive appeal.  But in the opening paragraph, Auster begins what is one of the narrative tics that he continues throughout the book--the narrator separates himself from the subject (himself as a younger person) by addressing that younger person as ""you"":  ""The face of the clock was a human face, each pea in your bowl had a different personality, and the grille on the front of your parents' car was a grinning mouth with many teeth.""  And later:  ""There was no problem in believing that the man in the moon was an actual man.  You couild see his face looking down at you from the night sky . . .""Of course, it is true that a 65 year old man is in many ways NOT the same person as the toddler or even himself as a 22 year old writing to a lover, soon to be lost.  The span of this memoir is from babyhood to about 22 (1947 to 1969), and Auster frequently reminds the reader that he has no records--no photos, no letters, no documents--to support the claims he makes about his experiences.  He bases his narrative on his memory, and we all know that memory is untrustworthy--gapped, inclined to fill in or even fabricate what we would like to have had happen, whether it did or not, and so on.  So Auster constantly asks us to remember his ""authority"" as a narrator by asserting his honesty in saying that these may be false memories, though he is doing his best to tell the truth as he remembers it.  But then in part three, ""Time Capsule,"" he reports that his former wife has returned a batch of letters to him, those he had written to her over a period of several years, including his time at Columbia University in the late 1960s, when the turmoil of the rebellious student takeover of the campus occurred--part of his own experience, reported at that time.All through the memoir, Auster speaks to ""you,"" then, as though the younger self were a separate entity, even though he acknowledges and hopes we will agree that his memories of that other self are part of himself now.  The subject of thememoir is the problem of writing memoir--one does or does not have documentation to support the validity of one's memories; one is or is not the same person one remembers being at an earlier time; one is or is not the product of the earlier experiences, feelings, readings, viewings, fights, romantic crushes, and so on.  And what if the truth is that one is NOT a product of the past, but a constantly evolving new entity--if that were so, what would be the point of repeating all those stories, which have no relationship or outcome.  Of if one is the same person, why would one write a memoir as though it were a letter of advice and interpretation to the ""you"", the separate person, who lived these experiences and is now being reminded of them from a voice separated by many decades.  And so on and on.Part Two of this memoir is devoted almost entirely to detailed scene-by-scene recapitulations of two movies that had a powerful impact on the earlier Paul Auster. The first, ""The Incredible Shrinking Man,"" and the second, ""I Am a Fugitive From a Chain Gang"";  both movies are thought-provoking and emotionally engaging in ways that Auster makes clear--both in terms of their impact on his earlier self and, by describing them in detail, showing that they still have the power to challenge and move viewers.These movies are two titles among many--Auster tells us of many of the books he read during his youth and college years, and speaks often of influential movies.  Anyone who grew up in the 50s and 60s will recognize the titles, probably will have read and seen many of them during the same period.  A reader might well agree that Diary of Anne Frank and On the Beach and many of  his other titles were formative in one's own experience.  And there is part of the problem.Auster effectively disowns the effort to claim or to portray the power and the fascination of his early experiences.  They all happened to the ""you"" he addresses, often in sympathetic tones.  It certainly makes sense to treat with some skepticism the attitudes, enthusiasms, tastes, and supposed experiences of a much younger person, especially if one is not confident that the earlier person can be trusted as a construct of oneself.  But how is that of interest to a reader?  At one point, Auster tells us that he started to write a journal when he was 18, but quit because he could not see the point of writing about what he knew had just happened, and he concludes that his self at that time did not understand that the audience for that journal was his older self.  Indeed.The final section of this memoir is a collection of drawings and photographs, mostly still shots from the movies he has mentioned, a few news photos, especially of the Newark riots and the Columbia University insurrection, and for the most part, the photos are impersonal, except that they are all related to details narrated earlier in the book.  They do not include pictures of Paul Auster.I shared many of the experiences Auster describes, including much of the reading and many of the movies mentioned, as well as living near many of the dramatic events (even having been involved in a few) described.  So why would I not be interested in reading Auster's account of them.  It's very odd, but I was repeatedly bored and irritated and had to force myself, as I have already said, to continue to the end.  I have no idea who the audience for this book might be--except for Paul Auster.","2.0 out of 5 stars","January 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R222LR9G1LS0LH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0805098577#wasThisHelpful","R222LR9G1LS0LH","AX6NA5JAL2B1K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AX6NA5JAL2B1K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Patterns. Repetitions. Rules. Freedom. Mastery.In her essay ""On Beauty and Being Just,"" Elaine Scarry poses a question:  ""What is the felt experience of cognition at the moment one stands in the presence of a beautiful boy or flower or bird?  It seems to incite, even to require, the act of replication.  Wittgenstein says that when the eye sees something beautiful, the hand wants to draw it.  Beauty brings copies of itself into being.  . . . Sometimes it gives rise to exact replication and other times to resemblances and still other times to things whose connection to the original site of inspiration is unrecognizable.""  Scarry has much more to say about the experiences of beauty in our lives, but her constant point is that beauty is not useless and not escapist--that beauty moves us to make better lives, a better world, not just for ourselves, selfishly, but for all humanity.Readers of Richard Powers's novels have become accustomed to his challenges--to the layered and complex issues his narratives raise and force us to consider, maybe contemplate, while we follow the fortunes and misfortunes of his characters.  In his most recent novel, Orfeo, the composer/chemist hero, Peter Els, confronts many challenges to his youthful belief that making music is creating beauty--a belief that is decidedly out of fashion during his days as a student and young adult.  When the novel begins, he is a retired teacher living with his aging Golden Labrador and engaged in a hobby based on his first college major, chemistry:  that is, he is doing research into gene splicing because he is interested in whether music (the making of music, responses to music) is genetically determined.  If humans (and some animals) have similar responses to certain chord progressions or melodies, does that fact indicate a genetic predisposition?  And could that suggest that DNA programs are chemical music?  Could genes be composed like musical phrases?In the midst of one such experiment, Els realizes his beloved dog, Fidelio, is perhaps dying; he calls 911 and sets in motion the calamitous series of events that constitute the crescendo finale of his life.  But interspersed in the narrative of his painful encounters with what we know as the ""surveillance state,"" we have the narrative line portraying Peter's childhood and youth, up through his marriage and the birth of his daughter--and along with that, the descriptions of his obsession with music, his lesser interest in chemistry, and the complications in his personal relationships brought on by his efforts to create music inspired especially by his romantic attachments.  Along the way, he encounters composition teachers and other musicians who are all angrily seeking the new and revolutionary art forms, whether musical or theatrical or graphical, that will convey the reality of the world of the 60s, 70s, 80s of our era--periods of senseless wars, assassinations, brutal repression of protest and assertions of freedom, claims of the right to take off one's clothes (thanks to the Living Theater), to participate in happenings that embody the idea that random and un-ruled and spontaneous behavior creates art of the instant, ephemeral (who needs permanent monuments, they are repressive) and mind-blowing.  A mistake-free culture fueled by John Cage's aphorisms, including prominently and repeatedly ""A 'mistake' is beside the point.  Once anything happens, it authentically is.""  This, and comparable though diverse comments from Harry Partch, George Crumb, Milton Babbitt and other thinkers struggling with the question of the purpose of art and the problem, confronted by Peter Els, ""Music is awareness flowing in through the ear.  And nothing is more terrifying than being aware"" are scattered in boldface type through the text. [I did not notice Schoenberg's comment:  ""The laws of art consist mainly of exceptions.""  Perhaps too subversive of the main argument.]The story of Peter Els's advances and retreats in the world of musical composition intertwine with the description of his flight from the agents of the security state--the year is 2011 and the panic that engendered the Patriot Act is in full cry.  In this respect, parts of Powers's narrative feel as though they could be reports on yesterday's events, as mutatis mutandis, they are.  One of the aphorisms was true in the 80s:  ""I wanted to believe that music was the way out of all politics.  But it's only another way in.""  It's true today, differently.Because the central character lives in a world of music, there is a great deal of very informative and even inspiring commentary about music--especially about pieces Peter listens to during his lifetime--and so readers are treated to lucid and even revelatory analyses of Messiaen's Quartet for the End of Time, Steve Reich's Proverb, Peter Lieberson's Neruda Songs (written for and performed by his wife, transcendent mezzo-soprano Lorraine Hunt Lieberson), and several other works, including Peter Els's own imagined opera and his Borges songs, works that might as well be (maybe Powers has composed them and will let us hear them someday?).  There is also a fair amount of discussion of gene chemistry, of the strategies of avant-garde theatrical directors, and other technicalities related to Peter's life and work.  The novel never lets us forget that artistic creation is part of the social and political fabric of the world in which we live, both transformative in some ways, but vulnerable, even victimized, when the forces ""in charge"" turn their baleful eyes of death in its direction.  This last comes home to us in the deep commentary on Shostakovich's Fifth Symphony, written ostensibly as an ""apology"" to the Russian people for his sins against the reality of the Soviet, though perceived, perhaps rightly, as a gesture of defiance to the moustached leader crouched in the Kremlin.As may be apparent, I am impressed and enthusiastic about this novel, but must admit that it may not be popular with all readers.  Some may find that it assumes a degree of familiarity not only with music but with the art scene that such readers may find ""elitist,"" or exclusionary.  My recommendation--find recordings or performances of those works--listen, then re-read.  The novel is fascinating, enlightening, and deeply moving.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJKVZU5IAJ3NC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0393240827#wasThisHelpful","RJKVZU5IAJ3NC","AX6NA5JAL2B1K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AX6NA5JAL2B1K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"[Full and open disclosure:  I have been acquainted with the author, Phong Nguyen, for a number of years, have been aware that he was working on this book, and have awaited its publication with great curiosity and high expectations.]On some simple level, almost everyone at some time in life will construct ""alternate history.""  It may be as simple as fantasizing about how much better everything would feel if only one had managed to make that basket at the buzzer, to hit that high note perfectly without the crack, to have remembered the familiar formula that stubbornly remained blank in mind when the question appeared on the exam.  We can imagine how it might have been, just as a number of popular writers have shown us versions of what the world would be like if the Confederacy had won the Civil War, or the Axis Powers had defeated the Allies.  Imagining the ways society, government, some individual lives might have been different if past choices or phenomena had moved in different directions is a kind of mirror version of the speculative science fiction that projects into the future the developments arising from a recent scientific discovery, or from a striking change in society as a result of social or political shifts that portend either utopia or dystopia.  We may think of recent works--Harry Turtledove's novels about the victorious Confederacy, Philip K. Dick's The Man in the High Castle about the aftermath on the American continent of the victory of the Axis powers, Margaret Atwood's Handmaid's Tale about the takeover of America by fundamentalist Christians, and many more.Phong Nguyen's chapters present alternate versions of the lives of important men and one woman, focusing not so much on large social or political changes, but on the ways the lives and characters of these people would have been different if they had responded to influences or impulses, ambitions or just circumstances, that led them in directions other than those we believe (from conventional history) they actually followed.  What if Judas did not betray Jesus?  What if Joan of Arc was not condemned and burned, but lived to become a mother?  What if Ben Franklin, as his mother wished, did become a clergyman in the style of Jonathan Edwards?  What if Ho Chi Minh had traveled to live in Harlem and had ""revolutionized the food industry and ushered in a new era of packaging and distributing edible goods,"" specifically ""Uncle Ho's Ready Bake Frozen Dough.""In most of these chapters, the alternatives are not developed in large-scale societal or political terms, though we can infer that the paths these famous people have taken in these stories must imply significant changes in the world around them by contrast with what we believe we know happened in their ""actual historical"" lives.  There is a sly and effective, but low-keyed humor running through this book, as the great achievements of these historical figures are wiped out of history, replaced perhaps by actions or accomplishments of less historical interest, but perhaps psychologically fascinating to themselves and by extension to us.  Joan's discovery of her sexuality--still wearing inconveniently located parts of her armor as she learns what it is not to be a virgin warrior--leads to her fulfillment of her prophecy that she will be the mother of three sons.The opening sentences of Chapter 9, ""Napoleon Invades Louisiana"" offer a sample of the mixture of humor and subversion typical of Phong Nguyen's development of his alternate histories: ""Napoleon Bonaparte, Emperor of West America, nearly lost his colonial empire when his navy  was threatned by a slave revolt in the colony of Saint-Domingue ('Hayti' to the locals).  It was only by means of an alliance with their leader, the former slave Toussaint L'ouverture, that  Napoleon was able to invade Louisiana and establish West America, keeping his continental  colonies from being sold off to East-American President Thomas Jefferson.""In this we can see that changing the behavior of one ""great man"" will inevitably shift the histories of other great men with whom the first one interacts, and further and more dramatically as one extrapolates from the first move.  Among other things, putting alternatives into play has the effect of undermining, even discrediting, the tired old ""great man theory"" of human history (and Thomas Carlyle turns in his grave).  As the rest of this chapter proceeds, the story becomes more complicated and dramatic, more humorous and satirical, and the reader is treated to the mental exercise of imagining an East/West split on the American continent (not an impossibility, just what did not happen in the ""actual history"") instead of North/South, with Western expansion.Scenes and dialogue of confrontation and instruction occur in most of these chapters, providing the human interest as well as the humor as we observe historical figures acting ""in character"" but according to alternative circumstances that lead them to relationships and goals not previously recorded in official accounts of their lives.  In a few cases--Jesus and Judas, Napoleon and Toussaint, Einstein and Leo Szilard--one is tempted to wonder which of the two is the real focus of the chapter, or more likely, whether the significance is not found more in their interaction than in anything attributed to the ""big name,"" either in this alternate or in the ""actual"" history of the lives.  It won't do to offer spoilers here.Th frame of this novel is presented by a nameless computer nerd who works for The Workshop, a company that specializes in recovering data from damaged hard drives; he manages to detect and identify a massive text--""a terabyte full of images and text--more than two billion words, with half a million maps and timelines"" on a badly damaged circuit board belonging to one Obediah Lister.  This text is the alternate history most of which is subsequently lost, though the narrator has managed to copy a couple of hundred pages, which he smuggles away from The Workshop and arranges to publish.It is fair to say that this book does not conform to expectations one might have had, thinking of it as alternative history.  For one thing, the chapters are brief and most focus on only a few moments in the great lives, so there is not a sense of a ""sweep"" of history, though individual anecdotes of these kinds can and do imply much wider significances.  Neither do the alternative events seem to offer either utopian or dystopian outcomes, or not in all cases.  The reader is invited, rather, to think through the possible meaning of these alternate lives, and is provided at the end of each chapter with ""Suggestions for Class Discussion"" that sometimes are oblique and gnomic, sometimes seemingly out of touch entirely with any possible meaning of the story, but all signal to the reader the need to consider ways of understanding.  Further questions may pester us--is there a common thread running through the narratives that, if detected, would offer a means of drawing together the separate chapters into a coherent whole, perhaps with a single (though complex) message?  Is there a reason for the inclusion of the particular names presented--a principle of selection at work that might also enlighten us if we could tease it out?  These are, I suppose, questions for discussion if not grounds for hot debate.Phong Nguyen's book offers many pleasures and some challenges to the reader.  I recommend it enthusiastically.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1I380O1DXN1M9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1938466233#wasThisHelpful","R1I380O1DXN1M9","AX6NA5JAL2B1K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AX6NA5JAL2B1K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It's not exaggerating to say that this is one of the strangest books I have ever read, and I have read a whole lot of books, many of them pretty strange.  (Consider, maybe as a benchmark, E.A. Poe's The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym of Nantucket, or Lewis Carroll's The Hunting of the Snark or Anna Kavan's Ice.)  Atlas has won the Science Fiction and Fantasy Translation Award as the best 2013 work in long form (i.e., novel, or maybe novella), and that is a fact that might well lead a number of readers into an unexpected and disorienting reading experience.  Of course, that is what many of the best works of science fiction aspire to do, but this one works differently.Most science fiction is grounded in one or more familiar sciences--physics, biology, chemistry, anthropology, even economics or political science  when we explore dystopias.  In the case of Atlas, we have a novel that emerges from (and explores, analyzes, defines and re-defines) cartography--the art of mapmaking.  Fifty-one chapters, mostly no more than 3 pages long, some only 2--divided into four sections:  Theory, The City, Streets, Signs--the novel seems to be narrated by a single voice, though at some points there are suggestions of new voices entering.  From the beginning, the narrative is about the island city of Hong Kong.  The narrative is not chronological nor sequential--rather, each chapter has reference to a number of maps produced over many centuries by people of different nationalities and races, different perspectives (both visual and political), different motives or agendas, and so on.  If a reader has believed that there is something solid and dependable about the information gained from looking at a map, that belief will be thoroughly and inexorably demolished by reading this work.What is the relation between a map and the territory it purports to represent?  How large does a map have to be, with what degree of conformity to the size of the territory before it is trustworthy or sufficiently informative?  What is the relationship, cognitively, between the signs on the map and the reality of the places it ---- identifies? names? acknowledges or establishes as ""real""? What if the same place (or group of places, as in an archipelago near a mainland) presented on different maps, drawn by different cartographers from different backgrounds and different periods of time, seems to be shaped differently, named differently, juxtaposed with its neighbors at different angles or with different topographical relationships?  What if the map represents the topography of an earlier period, whereas the topography has changed radically in the historical period since the map was made?  Consider  Canal Road East and Canal Road West on Hong Kong Island: It was the fate of Canal Road East and Canal Road West (as with so many other places in Victoria) for a separation  between sign and reference to take place in the course of successive stages of time and space.  A more thorough deconstruction would be to take the argumenent one step further, that is, when the signifier for the sign ""canal"" no longer had a natural connection  with its signified, then only the phonetic form remained in ""canal,"" acting as a plac-name, while the content of ""canal"" was abandoned.  The underground waterway no longer existed in reality, no matter whether on a map or in people's comprehension.  The street name not only made it impossible for anyone to trace its source, it actually tells us how the city deconstructs itself in its unceasing growth.  (p. 98)Notice the reference to ""Victoria""--that is the name of the city founded by British colonialists on Hong Kong Island, a city that can be located on a map of Hong Kong, but which serves as a reminder of the unstable and complex ""identities"" of the place represented:  British architecture, British customs, British allegiances, British military and commercial interests, superimposed on native Chinese language, Chinese people (coolies, servants, tailors, rickshaw men, etc.) along with place names that may have several different meanings, even exist in different languages, so conveying different information about the character of the places, and so on.  You will notice also in that passage the vocabulary of Saussurean structuralism juxtaposed with Derridean postmodern theory, both at the service of an analysis of the fleeting quality of cultural and social meaning in a colonized world.  These are themes that float and transform and occasionally illuminate the chapters, which also draw on Foucauldian archaeology (as the book's title suggests), constantly reminding us of the relationships of power (not always obviously consistent with the surface appearances) and even the tectonic shifts and volcanic eruptions that may affect the lives and security of the inhabitants.As the chapters accumulate in the reader's mind, the suspicion that there is an agenda along with all these mindbending (and sometimes very frustratingly opaque) analyses of very old maps (16th century, 18th century, 20th century and more) of Hong Kong, Kowloon, Macao, and the New Territories.  Indeed, it appears from comments (on the dust jacket, for example) that these chapters are a compilation of interpretations and analyses by cartographers far in the future, attempting to reconstruct the cities of Victoria/Hong Kong and surroundings, following a catastrophic decline of the whole area, the nature of which is never explained.In other words, the whole book is an examination of what we can know, if anything, about a place by examining a map of it.  Is the map in any sense at all comparable to the territory--or is it merely a mental construct, an idealized or degraded ""picture,"" corrupted away from ""reality"" by the intrusion of human intentions, human myths, human fairy tales, human human interest stories?  Many of the streets and locations have such stories attached to them, perhaps signalled by texts or even ""legends"" attached to the maps.  So also the whole island and the complex culture of it.  As we learn at the beginning of Chapter 16: The legendary city of Victoria was, like Venus, born from the waves of the sea.  It is not known  how it disappeared in the end.  The legend thus brings us face-to-face with an archaeological question:  by what means can we verify a city's existence?The book is about all that.  It must be said that the opening chapters, especially, require patience and persistence of the reader.  The numerous names flood the brain, the shifting theoretical and philosophical perspectives purposely disorient and confuse.  And there is very nearly no payoff for all the effort it takes--while there are anecdotes along the way, there is no plot line, no set of knowable characters.  The experience is of a massive mind game and provides all the pleasures for the brain of working out whatever can be known from thinking about dozens of maps one has not even seen, but only known through verbal descriptions that are themselves full of uncertainty.  For the right reader, it is a heady pleasure, but it certainly feels at the end as though one has finally found that boojum, and one is nowhere as a result.  And happy to be so.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R25T32AAJNNFG5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=023116100X#wasThisHelpful","R25T32AAJNNFG5","AX6NA5JAL2B1K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AX6NA5JAL2B1K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Written in 1946, during the last year of Victor Serge's life, and not published in Europe until 1971, this novel was finally translated into English and published in 2008.  In spite of age and neglect, Unforgiving Years must be considered a major, if belated, addition to twentieth-century literature, and especially to the shelf of works that portray unevasively and incisively the nature of the tyrannies that flourished and nearly prevailed during the years leading to the Second World War and through the Cold War years afterward.  There is no lack of tyranny and danger in the present, but the effort to analyze and understand the several evils characteristic of National Socialism and Stalinism is ongoing and still necessary.  Not that the purpose of a novel is necessarily to expose or even comment about specific political or social evils--it may well do that, but there is in the best novels a greater dimension of understanding and empathy with the passion, the suffering, and the humanity even of the people who may espouse those worldviews, however evil, but especially those who see and understand and have the courage to live to resist the power of evil.Serge divides this novel into four sections of unequal length.  The first section, ""Secret Agent,"" is set in Paris during the period leading up to the German invasion; the world the characters experience is one of intense anxiety, constant suspicion or near paranoia, as they feel themselves under constant observation, subject to arrest or abduction and assassination because of their imagined deviations from the party line.  The atmosphere feels very much like the gloom of movies such as The Third Man or Touch of Evil, with the menace all too real as the four characters (Sacha, Nadine, Daria, and Alain) encounter each other and others while attempting to arrange flight from France.  Each of these characters will appear under different names in the later sections of the novel.The second section focuses on Daria as she tries to carry out her political duties--keeping records of communications of all kinds--during the siege of Stalingrad, surrounded by starvation, madness, and the ""discipline"" of military officers, gradually declining into hysterical adherence to patterned behavior.The third section occurs during the final days of the Third Reich, focusing on ordinary Berliners dealing with the collapse of order, bombardment day after day, near starvation, rapacious marauders and rapists.  The portrayal of a whole city gradually dying comes into focus with the reappearance of Daria (at this time calling herself Erna), working as a nurse among people trying desperately to survive, clinging to, or reacting skeptically to, the absurd reports of fantasized victories, new overwhelming weapons that will guarantee victory, even as the allied bombers pass over, pulverizing whatever remains standing in the city.The final section is set in Mexico; Daria arrives at the remote Mexican village where Sacha and Nadine using the names Carlo and Noemi Battisti,  are settled in an isolated area, farming and trying to make a life undetected by the agents of the government that continues systematically to try to track down and kill them.  Serge, as a former Trostkyist, knows exactly how this feels; the contrast between the almost idyllic situation they have found for themselves in Mexico and their awareness that there is no such thing as security for them, leads to probing discussions of the nature of freedom and creativity.This novel is intense, often painful to read as we gain and then lose hope for the welfare of these characters, formerly idealists committed to making a better world, but who have recognized that though they tried to improve the world, they forgot to include humanity.  The dialectical thinking of Sacha and Daria, especially, conveys the anguish of committed revolutionaries who see the perversion of their ideals in the political and economic machinations--and the culture of wanton destruction--they have inadvertently created.  This final work from Victor Serge is a masterpiece of fair warning.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2KDLF33ZI1BGS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1590172477#wasThisHelpful","R2KDLF33ZI1BGS","AX6NA5JAL2B1K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AX6NA5JAL2B1K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Hikmet's Life's Good, Brother is a poet's novel.  That is, along with being a novel by a writer who is renowned as a great poet--according to many, the ""Father"" of modern Turkish poetry--it is also a novel that uses, effectively, many tactics associated with his narrative poetry.  Readers familiar with Hikmet's magnificent ""epic novel in verse,"" Human Landscapes from My Country, will experience moments that remind them of  Hikmet's use of the kinds of striking juxtapositions, based on sharp, tight observations of human character and behavior as well as physical objects and environments, that let him create multilayered and complex scenes that illuminate rather than obscure or complicate the social and political conditions he is concerned to portray in the lives of his characters.  To say that it is a poet's novel is not to say that it is lyrical in any conventional sense; rather, it features the rhetorical and imagistic gestures of the poet in the service of a narrative that reveals the human struggles, the brutality and heroism, that went with the revolutionary efforts of people in many areas of the world during the 20th century, focusing especially on the transformations of Turkey as a nation.The novel is, we are told by its translator, substantially autobiographical, and may be said to have only two underlying characters -- Hikmet, himself, and the ""nation"" of Turkey as a collective self -- but those two are divided into several voices with different names and situations.  This allows Hikmet to focus variously on aspects of the revolutionary history of Turkey that he experienced.  As a committed Marxist, he was persecuted, arrested, censored, finally exiled during his lifetime, but he never lost (as is obvious from his writings) his deep love for Turkey and his fellow Turks--even those who were his political enemies and persecutors.The narrative of Life's Good, Brother shifts both places and times; one of the main characters, Ahmet,is a journalist and activist who goes into hiding at the beginning of the novel, hoping to establish a clandestine press where he can print and distribute news about political change in Turkey; the authorities are determined to prevent any such publications, so he hides in a remote rural area, but his situation is complicated by his being bitten by a stray dog that is very likely rabid; isolated and forced to stay in hiding, Ahmet and his friend, Ismail, find that the incubation period for rabies is 40 days, and so they begin to count, watching Ahmet closely for any signs of the symptoms of the onset of rabies.  During this time, Ahmet triggers memories of time spent in Moscow as a student during the 1920s, witnessing the early stages of the development of the Russian soviet era, encountering students from other areas of the world (China, France), and falling in love with a revolutionary woman, Anushka.  Scenes in Russia are interspersed with his hiding and waiting for the symptoms to appear; he has told his friend, Ismail, that if he does develop rabies, Ismail must shoot him and bury him secretly. He keeps track of the waiting period by drawing a line in chalk on the door of their hideout, and the chapter divisions are identified by the line numbers as the two watch and wait.Ismail is the second most prominent character and his story picks up later in the 1920s, when he is arrested for illegal political activities (including his involvement with Ahmet and the printing press), and he realizes that Ahmet was right to believe that almost no one could be trusted in the turmoil of political conflict that set natural allies against each other when they needed to protect themselves from the authorities; everyone mistrusts everyone else, even close friends and lovers.  Ismail is tortured horrifically in prison, scenes that are particularly painful reading and run parallel, in a sense, to the growing tension as each day passes in the wait for Ahmet's body to declare whether he does or does not have rabies.  In the meantime, the political activities, the negotiations, the schemes and the failures of the revolutionaries go on.This novel is uncommon in its structure and narrative, powerful in its portrayal of committed revolutionaries, moving in the exploration of the interplay of public and private commitments and emotions.  It is a work I recommend highly.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1P4ZDXAW832F1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0892554185#wasThisHelpful","R1P4ZDXAW832F1","AX6NA5JAL2B1K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AX6NA5JAL2B1K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Brian Payton has worked as a journalist and has published several nonfiction works as well as one earlier novel.  His experiences as a journalist and nonfiction writer, combined with his ambition to write novels, would account for both the strengths and the weaknesses of his new novel, The Wind is Not a River. The broad historical context of the story is the little-known Aleutian campaign of the Second World War.  The Japanese had invaded and established bases on parts of the Aleutian Island chain, which was United States territory.  The U.S. military command suspected this was an effort to create a launching area for an invasion of the American mainland.  There was little knowledge of the characteristics of the sparsely populated islands, but the military moved quickly to evacuate (""for their own protection"") the indigenous inhabitants of the territory, interning them on the mainland in much the same way Japanese/American citizens had already been interned.  The military launched an effort to destroy the Japanese bases and eject their troops.  This operation was problematic because of the lack of familiarity with the extremely hostile environment and terrain of the islands; it was also kept secret as much as possible (to protect the element of surprise in the counterinvasion), so that strict censorship was imposed on the press and on personal communications from the area.The fictional component of Payton's novel focuses on a journalist, John Easley, who has made a career writing especially about the environment and wildlife, with contributions to the National Geographic, and his wife, Helen.  Easley had been working in the Aleutians before the war, documenting bird and animal migrations and plant life, and he knew the terrain--rough, barely able to sustain life, raked by intense storms.  When he realizes that the islands have been invaded by Japanese (but with almost no details to support the story), he is determined to return there to tell the story of the war.  Having no luck getting a press pass, he masquerades as his own brother, an officer in the Canadian Air Force who has been killed in Europe.  John counts on that information not having reached the American authorities and successfully joins an Air Force group (as an observer) in the Aleutians.  As the novel begins, in April, 1943, he has been forced to parachute into the sea as his plane crashes, killing all aboard except himself and one very young American airman who also manages to make it alive to the small island where they are forced to undertake heroic measures to survive--no food, no water, no shelter, hostile Japanese encampment on the other side of the island.  Because John is there under an assumed name, no one knows where he is nor who he is.In the meantime, John's wife, Helen, realizes it has been too long since she has heard from him and begins to search for information about his whereabouts.  She finally manages (with another act of masquerading) to join a USO troupe that is going to Alaska to entertain the troops.  She has no experience as a singer or performing in public, but manages to fake it and finally arrives in the Aleutians, determined to find her missing husband.The main body of the novel, then, alternates the narrative of John's increasingly desperate efforts to remain alive in the hostile environment and Helen's gradually successful efforts to get close enough to where he is that she might have some hope of finding him.  There are moments of real emotional power, and the revelation of the meaning of the title is affecting.  But there are problems.Payton's characterizations both of his two main characters and several secondary characters who are recognizable and sympathetic are effective, and the reader is drawn into the adventure and drama of the situations.  Payton's prose style, however, which is a sturdy journalistic style, is not well suited to the kind of adventure and love story that he has chosen to tell about his main characters.  Frequent shifts from a reasonably effective fictional narrative style into the plain expository prose expected in a substantial feature story in a serious magazine (such as National Geographic or the Sunday New York Times magazine) are jolting and on occasion very unwelcome.  The emotive power of the fictional narrative dries up for a while and we feel we are being lectured, even hectored, by a writer who has a determination to set straight the faulty or incomplete story of the Aleutian campaign for readers who do not know or appreciate the importance or value of the sacrifices made by the military forces involved.I have no doubt that it is better to have an authoritative account of this part of the war effort, and it seems likely that many readers will feel themselves much better informed about it after reading the novel.  But as a novel, the work falls short.  Some of the later surprises feel contrived, the tendency to demand sympathy and understanding feels supererogatory, and one may finally wish that the author had decided to write a substantial article correcting the deficiencies of earlier journalistic and historical accounts, rather than attempting a romantic adventure narrative that finally feels flat and unconvincing.","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 3, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2MBCQFVWQAGCX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062279971#wasThisHelpful","R2MBCQFVWQAGCX","AX6NA5JAL2B1K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AX6NA5JAL2B1K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Just about halfway through The People in the Trees,the hero, who has been narrating his own account of the adventures and observations that have led to his receiving a Nobel Prize in Medicine, describes his efforts to understand a phenomenon he has observed among the people of a previously ""unknown tribe"" in a remote area of Micronesia.  The evidence seems to suggest that these people have had contact with something that significantly prolongs their lives, and he is trying to find out what might have caused this and what its effects might mean.  As he analyzes, he also begins to think about the idea of immortality and the different ways people react to the idea of it.  At the time he is writing, he is in his 70's, and he makes the following comment:  ""There is a point--for me, it arrived perhaps a few years ago--when, without even realizing it, you switch over from craving more life to being resigned to its end.  It happens so abruptly that you cannot help but recall the moment itself, and yet so gently that it is as if it comes to you in a dream.""  This idea of acceptance of mortality as a given of human life comes in the context of his realization that the immortality of these Micronesians is ""a curse.""Why would indefinitely extended life be a curse?  It is, in fact, one of the oldest stories in the human literary tradition: the names Tithonus and Struldbruggs come to mind, tied to the realization that physical life, even with relatively good physical health, is no guarantee of continued mental competence, wisdom, or spiritual enlightenment.  Tithonus becomes, finally, a cricket, endlessly scratching out his complaints about being ever older and lesser.  The Struldbruggs may live forever, but they age like any other humans, becoming increasingly infirm and miserable as the years pass--and they are isolated from human society as being accursed in this way.  As Dr. Norton Perina discovers, the Ivu'Ivuans who have acquired physical longevity (as much as 300 years, with no necessary limit at least to continued physical life) have no hope of retaining mental acuity, passing through stages that are parallel to the known progress of Alzheimer's, though that disease is never mentioned in the novel.  Even the word ""dementia"" appears only once or twice.  The mental deterioration of the pathetic Micronesians inspires pity and appears to be irreversible, incurable. As a continuing theme in the novel, the questions of the meaning of life and death are explored if not with Montaigne's lighthanded complexity, then with a degree of seriousness.Dr. Perina arrives on the island as a junior member of a team of researchers led by a famous and charismatic anthropologist, Paul Tallent; he and his assistant are the lead researchers, while Perino having recently gained his M.D., is mostly along to do medical tests and observations of the physical condition of the ""subjects.""  This expedition, by the way, takes place during the 1950s, well before the scandalous revelations about experimentation with human subjects that led to the creation of the National Commission for the Protection of Human Subjects of Medical and Biological Research, and the treatment of the subjects in this case would provide more evidence of the need for such an oversight committee, though Tallent and Perina are, for the most part, portrayed as both well-intentioned and benevolent.  But of course, it is Perina for the most part, doing the portraying.This novel comes to the reader in the guise of Perina's written narrative, composed while he is in prison, about the expeditions and subsequent research; the main narrative is framed by an introduction by Perina's research assistant, Ronald Kubodera, who also provides frequent and detailed footnotes, either supplementing or even correcting statements made in Perina's narrative.  This gives the novel the appearance of a nonfiction work, a memoir with scholarly apparatus, even including a glossary of some words in the language of the Ivu'Ivuans.In addition to the trappings of scholarly publication, the prose of the narrative is dense with the kind of detail--in this case, imagined, and testifying to the fertility of the author's imagination--that an observant scientist would want to include in a report on such an expedition.  Perina actually mocks the writing of Esme Duff, Dr. Tallent's other assistant, as being pedantic and repetitive, focused on minutiae that make her descriptions unreadable; even so, Dr. Perina's own descriptions are graphic, detailed, somewhat repetitive, and may inspire a degree of impatience in the reader.  The lush prose describing the treks through the jungle, with the imaginative creation of unknown and fascinating flora and fauna in that jungle, will either fascinate or annoy.  In addition, a certain coyness about the details of the activities of the several characters may also either intrigue or exasperate the reader, depending on that reader's interests.There is much more in the novel than the description of the expedition and discovery.  The psychological and sexual peculiarities of both Perina and Tallent, for example, are hinted at and finally given some dramatic relevance.  The disastrous aftermath of the publication of Perina's discoveries--the descent on the fragile island and indigenous peoples by rapacious researchers, especially those financed by several of the major international pharmaceutical companies, the insistent and finally successful destruction of the native culture by missionaries of various sects, especially Mormons--are all presented in detail.  Some of these dramatic events--especially the impact on the lives of the native peoples by not just contact with Western culture, but the imposition of Western consumerism and religion (hand in hand) -- have been portrayed in the nonfiction accounts of some famous writers--most prominently, perhaps, the British travel writer, Norman Lewis--and so there is a sense of verisimilitude added to the fanciful narrative about the immortality gained by the natives.The profusion of materials in the novel, in fact, provides both some of the kinds of interest one can enjoy in reading a nonfiction narrative and, unfortunately, some of the factors that make the work a less than fully successful novel.  If we think of the story of Perina's life as the main line of the fictional narrative, which becomes dangerously complicated when he both arranges to bring a few of the ""immortals"" back to a laboratory in the United States while, at the same time, adopting some children from the Ivu'Ivuans and taking them into his own home to raise them as Americans, then we are forced to wonder whether the intrusion of the many side issues and ""scholarly"" materials are really justified as part of the work.  Most novels include, even attempt to illuminate, issues that are related to but not central to the life of the main characters.  In that sense there is nothing wrong with a novelist trying to broaden the scope and relevance of her novel, but in this case, there is a feeling that some of the materials are pasted in, added on or just included because they seem interesting or came to mind as the author was composing and seemed, perhaps, too good to be left out.  But they create a degree of confusion, of lack of focus, as the reader is likely to wonder just what the book is actually ""about.""While it is too long in ways that should have been edited out, this novel is rich in fascinating detail and frequently prompts serious thought about serious issues--even leading to re-reading passages to see how they fit into the ongoing narrative.  A patient reader will find much to enjoy, much to think about, in this novel.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3BZML8CORU8JL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385536771#wasThisHelpful","R3BZML8CORU8JL","AX6NA5JAL2B1K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AX6NA5JAL2B1K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Whether we think of Lot leading his family away from the ruins of Sodom or Noah gazing over the limitless waters, the diminishing group of survivors in Shute's On the Beach, or Bruce Dern in Silent Running leaving behind a declining ecosystem, or the many other efforts by many writers, especially in the late 20th century until now to portray the decline or collapse of human civilization, the destruction of the life-supporting elements of the physical world or the elimination of the social and financial institutions that sustain what many understand to be normal life, or combinations of all of the above, we know that the imagination of disaster has flourished in some creative minds throughout the recorded history of human artists to portray the unthinkable -- the end of life as we know it.  For some, the blame is on the scientists who create the instruments of destruction (for an excellent example, see Angela Carter's Heroes and Villains); for others, the destruction of the liberal social contract and imposition of various tyrannies (Margaret Atwood's Handmaid's Tale, or the not-so-famous Arslan, by M.J. Engh), not to mention countless movies about intrepid heroes attempting to survive against invasions or plagues or  universal sterility or uncontrolled metamorphoses.  The bleakest and most relentless of these visions remains, I think, the concluding sections of H.G. Wells's The Time Machine--confronting almost infinitely in the future the death of the universe itself.In The Last Man Standing, Davide Longo gives us a somewhat limited but nonetheless horrifying vision of the end of society--the society of Italy, so far as the characters and the reader can know, since among the earliest casualties of the collapse is ""the news,"" and so all we know about what may be happening in the rest of Europe, during the time that Italian law and order, military units, banks and financial systems, supply lines, and most of the infrastructure that makes possible the genteel life of the main character, Leonardo, is that the French and the Swiss have closed their borders and refuse to allow refugees from Italy to cross.  The result, first vigilante actions by local peoples to protect themselves from ""outsiders"" (anyone not Italian, it would seem, immigrants, gypsies, etc.), followed by increasingly violent and effective marauding by self-selected gangs of young people who arm themselves and ruthlessly take whatever they want, slaughtering livestock and humans whenever it suits their whims.As the novel opens, we meet Leonardo, a formerly successful novelist and teacher of writing whose career has been destroyed by a highly publicized trial for sexual harassment and abuse of a student, who has accused him of forcing her into a sexual relationship in order to advance her academic career.  There are never many details about the nature of the charges, but we learn that the outcome is his loss of his teaching position, divorce from his wife and separation from his beloved daughter, and a general retreat to a small town where he lives in seclusion as the society begins to crumble around him.  As the situation becomes more dire, people in the town are fleeing and urging him to flee; his wife arrives with their daughter and a stepson, asking him to care for them while she goes to try to find her second husband, who has disappeared.  Of course, she does not return for the children and Leonardo is left to care for them and try to survive the desperate and violent situations that ensue.On the whole, the opening sequences of this novel feel familiar, even formulaic, for anyone who has read more than a few novels about the collapse of society (or even, one might say, accounts of the deteriorating circumstances for Jewish and other peoples in Germany during the 1930s--the efforts to ""make the best"" or even to live in denial of the coming catastrophe are similarly familiar from memoirs of that period), but Longo tells the story well and has created, in Leonardo, a character that may be appealing especially to avid readers who will be familiar with many of the literary allusions that occur throughout the novel as Leonardo, well-read as well as widely published, remembers and finds (for a while) some solace in the hundreds or thousands of stories he has read both for pleasure and for professional reasons.  The famous story by Gustave Flaubert. ""Un Coeur Simple,"" becomes almost a leitmotif, certainly a repeated point of reference for Leonardo as he confronts the arrogance, greed, cruelty, and destructiveness of many ""survivors"" of the collapse.  There are many other such references, though few--except for the fascination of one character with the novels of Thomas Bernhard--have as much relevance to the emotional and moral development of the novel as the Flaubert story.  (Leonardo's loss of career, marriage, reputation, has parallels also in a number of novels and plays, including David Mamet's Oleanna, J.M. Coetzee's Disgrace, and John Williams's Stoner, to name a few.)It won't do to repeat many of the events of the plot.  The novel does not depend on surprise for its power, but surprise has its pleasures; the predictable elements of this kind of story--shortages, thievery, survival efforts, chases, extreme cruelty, torture, rape, near-death experiences--all occur more or less on schedule, escalating as the desperation increases.  This is not to say that Longo is merely borrowing and imitating, though there are some parts of the novel that will remind the reader of other works--including, oddly enough, the novels of Yann Martel: toward the end, Leonardo, who already has a dog, acquires an elephant--no secret, since it is portrayed on the cover illustration.  It is at that point that the suspicion that this very tough and uncompromising narrative may be about to go soft and sentimental, which is often what happens with these stories.  The plot has to end somehow, the ending probably will suggest either that humanity is indeed doomed and about to be extinct or, on the other hand, may have begun to show signs of political and spiritual enlightenment of a kind that might result in resurrection, restoration, even redemption.  (One thinks of the concluding sections of Walter M. Miller's great A Canticle for Leibowitz.)  While The Last Man Standing continues to be compelling reading right to the end, the more positive formulas do prevail, though there are surprises right to the final paragraph.Longo's novel has pretensions of straddling the boundary between genre (the familiar after-the-disaster narrative) and literary fiction (a character study of a man struggling to recover from an experience that seems to destroy everything he has supposed himself to be and to believe); it is not fully successful as either, but it is fascinating, engrossing, recommendable.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RKOJJKC49M6EX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1623650348#wasThisHelpful","RKOJJKC49M6EX","AX6NA5JAL2B1K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AX6NA5JAL2B1K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Desire.  Possession.  Plenitude.  Desire wants always to have the person or object desired, totally; or in the mirror, Desire wants to be had, to be engulfed by the desired one, consumed or transformed into the essence of the desired one.  Desire wants to possess or be possessed by, and can only be satisfied by the totality, the plenitude of possession.  Desire may be the driving force behind feats of creativity or acts of self-obliteration.  When desire transforms, there may be no self left as it disappears into the desired, or there may be no desired left as it is subsumed into the desiring self.  Boundaries, definitions, genres are blurred or erased; there are no limits, psychically, between self and other, between male and female, between human and not human.  Desire may dehumanize--the person has no name, no character, only the desired attributes--blonde hair or red or black, breasts or genitals of this or that size or shape, scents whether appealing or repulsive, degrees of tumescence or flaccidity, welcoming or forbidding orifices.  The one desired may be armed or unarmed.In one of his greatest sonnets, Shakespeare offered a conclusion about all this, perhaps too pat and somewhat evasive, but perhaps definitive: ""All this the world well knows, yet none knows well To shun the heaven that leads men to this hell.""In The Fata Morgana Books,"" Jonathan Littell offers four short works (the fourth being long enough to be called a novella; otherwise, short stories of varying length); these narratives are spoken by a voice, though there may be several speakers, who may be called the ""desirer"" except when he or she feels no desire; the desirer may or may not be able to see the images in the mirror of the desired and the desiring self  (mirror images are a constant motif--leitmotif​?-- in these stories).  The desirer may or may not have the key, may open the door to the right room or the wrong one.  The person waiting in the room, or the persons encountered on the street or at the swimming place (swimming is a constant motif, along with showering), may or may not be the objects of desire or, conversely, the threatening ""eyes"" pursuing (with evil intent?) the narrator.  The elaborate parties and sexual encounters may or may not be dreams:  ""my desires floated freely, coming to bear on everything and nothing, settling only to take off and settle on their opposite, before coming back or going elsewhere, and I no longer knew if I was man or woman, unless someone told me."" The children encountered, playing, swimming, endangered, threatened, may or may not be related to the narrator.In the realm of desire, objectification, dehumanization, may drain characters of individuality; they are A or B or the woman with the artfully arranged blonde hair or the men in dark coats under umbrellas.  This has the effect, in fictional narrative, of focusing ""interest"" on the actions and the anticipations of the narrator, and the appeal of the narrative may depend on whether the narrator inspires interest; if he or she is no more than Desire, the appeal may be limited.  There is a coldness and impersonality to these stories that forces readers to pay attention to the ebb and flow of desire, while wondering whether any of the actions, observations, or feelings of the narrator have any significance at all.  Does it matter if the speaker feels hungry, ill, drunk, hungover, rejuvenated, lustful, sated, fearful, battered.  Seldom do these feelings have consequences in the narratives.  But that may be the point of desire.Jonathan Littell is best known for his massive Prix Goncourt-winning novel, Les Bienveillantes/The Kindly Ones.  This much shorter volume, seemingly organized like the four movements of a symphony,  offers a very different kind of narrative, reminiscent of some other writers who focus on erotic subjects--Georges Bataille, for instance, in Story of the Eye or Blue of Noon, Samuel R. Delany in his Mad Man, Michel Houellebecq, or recently, Nicholson Baker, whose House of Holes might be seen as a comic mirror image of Littell's work.  As with their ancestor, Marquis de Sade, these writers describe sexual activity in graphic detail, for which the reader should be prepared.  Beyond that, in Littell's stories (though I would suggest that the narrator is always the same and the stories are segments of an ongoing story--perhaps a kind of symphonie fantastique), the activities of the narrator always suggest serious or portentous events, though the reader soon realizes that this is because they are formulaic scenes from literary narrative, used to suggest impending significance only to be drained of it by shifting focus, returning us to the ever-problematic desire.This is a difficult book to ""grade"":  it is hard to like, easy to admire, up to a point.  One is inclined more to warn potential readers, rather than to recommend it to them.  What to say?  The writer is a genius and the book is fascinating, but definitely special, in a troubling sense.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 16, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2BC2FCDYD2OJ0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1931883343#wasThisHelpful","R2BC2FCDYD2OJ0","AX6NA5JAL2B1K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AX6NA5JAL2B1K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This lyrical and almost dreamlike novel has an uncanny similarity to a short story, ""Queen of the Pacific Tides,"" by Rose Whitmore, which was published about a year ago in the Missouri Review, and Danticat's novel also occasionally feels reminiscent of the wonderful movie, Beasts of the Southern Wild.  The connecting element among the three stories is the young girl--in the case of Danticat's novel, the title's Claire, in the Whitmore story, Ruby, the daughter of a Pacific coast fisherman lost at sea, and in the movie, Hushpuppy, who also lives beside and often on water.  For Claire, it is her mother who is missing, and her father who agonizes over the challenges of raising a daughter in poverty and uncertainty; for Ruby, her father is gone, washed overboard in a storm, though she is not convinced he is dead, since his body has never washed up on the beach she constantly patrols, looking for him and encountering other bodies, human, mammals, fish, that wash up in his stead.  Hushpuppy has an ailing father and a determination to hold on to the life and the place where she lives, the people she knows.  Because of these heroines, and because each of them has a semi-mystical sense of identity with the sea and with almost mythic creatures, the lyricism of the narratives is sustained through contact with the girls' thoughts, perceptions, emotions, and perhaps even their visionary experiences of the world around them.I could extend the list of narratives (novels, stories, films) that feature children of varying degrees of innocence and fresh perception as they try to interpret, understand, survive the people and events surrounding them, often threatening them,sometimes sustaining them.  In the case of Claire, several adults are involved with each other in ways that impinge onher life.  Her father has thought it would be good for her if he were to send her to live with a woman who would know better how(and be better able to afford) to raise her.  That woman, and several other characters (the proprietor of the private school where Claire has been a scholarship student, his son, a woman who has been raped and made pregnant by that son, and more are entangled in conflict and even murder.All this happens in a beautifully described area of the south coast of Haiti.  The fishing village where Claire and her father live is adjacent to a small but growing town that has begun to suffer all the woes of pollution, corruption, crime, delinquency associated with big cities that have no political stability, no infrastructure.  In the village, life seems almost idyllic and more like a pre-twentieth century world than the present, but as characters move to the nearby city for business or entertainment, the calamitous effects of random and unregulated modernization become apparent, and the vulnerability of the village to the destructive elements nearby is apparent, so that the world around Claire divides into the somewhat nostalgic and perhaps disappearing simplicity of the village and the destructive forces of struggles for dominance among competing gangs, as well as the pressures to conform to modern life that distort the feelings and identities of the other characters.  Sexism, homophobia, political corruption, gang violence are all factors in the world Claire is growing into.  There is a sense that the powers of tradition and traditional beliefs have no hope of surviving, and Claire's sense of connection with her dead mother, which has been part of her sense of self, is sorely tested.While there is beauty in this novel, and dramatic power, it feels incomplete and unrealized as the story closes.  That is why I have left it at 4 stars, rather than 5.  I understand the strategy that juxtaposes a series of fragmentary scenes, evokes broken relationships, and leaves the reader with unresolved mysteries, unanswered questions.  In this case, however, the wish for ""more"" seems to me a legitimate one--the fragments do not shore up against the ruin.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 3, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1KXCLVCWBAOVN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=030727179X#wasThisHelpful","R1KXCLVCWBAOVN","AX6NA5JAL2B1K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AX6NA5JAL2B1K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A few pages into this new Doctorow novel, I was reminded of one of his regular narrative strategies--that is, he often begins his novels by creating confusion in the reader's mind.  The narrator's voice shifts, the chronology is confusing or just random, the location of the action (or discussion) is unclear, and so on.  The characteristics of narrative that give the reader a sense of where and who and what and why are scrambled.  It takes a while for the attentive reader to sort them out.  This happens at the beginning of Andrew's Brain, but it's not a longterm problem with the novel.  As it happens, the reader soon learns that the voice of Andrew is speaking to (or in some cases writing to) his analyst, an unnamed presence who responds with questions (often left unanswered) and occasional comments about Andrew's state of mind, motives, good or bad choices.  Andrew tells the analyst about the failure of his first marriage and his panicky effort to have his first (now former) wife take over the care of his infant daughter by his second wife, who is deceased.  We learn all this if we read attentively through the first sections of the novel.  I would add that there are no spoilers here.With reference to spoilers, I have to say that I hesitate to tell much of anything more about the events Andrew narrates to his analyst, other than that he tells the story of how he meets and marries his second wife.  Beyond that, it would be unfair to reveal the sequence of events that form the main body of the narrative of this uneven but finally very powerful novel.  (I started early thinking it might be a 2 star, as I was exasperated by the triviality of much of Andrew's narrative and the too-clever devices Doctorow was using to mix the chronology and the characters to sustain uncertainty and suspense.  But once the latter half of the narrative was under weigh, I was ready for a 3 star and even considered 5 star at some point near the end, but 4 seems reasonable.)Andrew, by the way, is a ""cognitive scientist,"" and he is talking with a psychoanalyst.  Early in their discussions, he comments:""Your field is the mind, mine is the brain.  Will the two ever meet?""  This question underlies much of the speculation that Andrew attempts in his professional research and in his teaching, about which we learn a bit as the novel continues.  Andrew is interested in the ways the brain works, how its constitution and structure affect the thought and actions of human beings and other animals, and so forth.  Further, Andrew is convinced that he is, in some way, a person who causes disasters--from the trivial, such as breaking a piece of chalk as he is trying to write his name on the chalkboard, to the fatal, as in his conviction that he was in some ways personally and causally responsible for several deaths, as well as some serious accidents.  This conviction is based on his observations of his coincidental presence at, or involvement with, the fatal events.  But this novel is in no sense a mystery thriller, as I have seen it incorrectly described.  It is a drama of perception, precise and distorted, clarified or confused.  Andrew is, as we learn early, driven to distraction, possibly to what we would call madness, by the cognitive dissonance that occurs when he realizes his well-intentioned or entirely innocent, or just casual actions result in calamity, usually for others.Doctorow unleashes some of the most dramatic and traumatizing writing of his career in this novel (yes, I have read all his other novels and some short stories), and that is what must be reserved for the reader to find out.  Having said that, why not 5 stars?  It would be nice to be able to rank the novel at that level, but the deficiencies of the first third, nearly first half, of the novel are real, and very disappointing.  But it is a very good example of a novel that should NOT be treated according to the ""rule"" that many people cite, that if a novel does not ""catch"" one in the first paragraph (sometimes the first few pages), then it is not worth continuing.  This one may be more annoying than engaging in the first few chapters, but persevere.  It's not a long novel, and the rewards kick in soon enough to carry you breathlessly to the end.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 3, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1EWAOEXLO1HJ7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1400068819#wasThisHelpful","R1EWAOEXLO1HJ7","AX6NA5JAL2B1K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AX6NA5JAL2B1K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was very fond of fountain pens when I was a kid, and always preferred them to ballpoints, even though I almost always blotted some ink somewhere when I was writing with a fountain pen.  I haven't used one for a number of years, but thought this would be an interesting experiment.  I am very pleased.  This is a nicely designed, attractive looking, pen that works with a replaceable ink cartridge.  The nib provides a smooth and dependable (so far) writing process, and I am very happy to have it and to be able to expect to use it for some time to come.  I don't know whether the same brand's ballpoints and pencils work as well, but since this seems to be very high quality, I would guess that they would.

"The epigraph to this novel signals the source of the title--it's an excerpt from lyrics of a song by Antony and the Johnsons, with the same title.  ""For today I am a boy"" carries with it both a kind of concession--as in, ""okay, I will cooperate this time,"" and at the same time a gesture of defiance--""today, yes, but I decide what I want from now on.""  And that conveys the ongoing dramatic conflict of the narrative, between the forced acceptance of ""his"" gender identity, as assigned by his parents and most folks around him, and the conviction in Peter Huang's self-consciousness that he is actually she, that the father's chosen name for his son, ""juan chaun,"" which means ""powerful king"" in Cantonese, is just one of the many errors made by the narrator's parents, relatives, and neighbors about this child's identity.  As we sometimes hear in discussions of transgender persons, this is a girl in a boy's body, a woman in a man's body.  So this novel joins a number of others (Eugenides' Middlesex, Irving's In One Person are two recent examples) exploring the lives and consciousnesses of men and women who live in the wrong sex's body.  Or, in some fortunate cases, manage to choose the changes needed to correct the problem.Kim Fu's novel is written in a straightforward narrative voice, the voice of Peter Huang who may become (may have become, since the story is told retrospectively) Audrey.  Peter has three sisters and would have preferred to be the Huang's fourth female child, though Peter's father was determined to have a son and for a while, determined to impose masculine identity on Peter.  This near obsession on the father's part had severe emotional and psychological effects on Peter, which are narrated in a calm but emotionally compelling manner through the whole novel.  The story proceeds chronologically, though with a few skips forward or backward in time to add pertinent details.  Peter experiences some bullying and violence from boys at school, then breaks loose from the family and the small town in western Canada to move to Montreal, finding work in a restaurant and beginning, through observing others, interacting with fellow workers, as well as experimenting with cross dressing and other experiences, to explore the possibilities of sexual and emotional life previously denied.  Several other characters, including Peter's sisters and his mother (after the death of the father, her husband) also develop as they explore alternatives to the lives defined by traditional (Chinese) social and gender roles.Kim Fu's approach to this narrative is almost more didactic than artistic--the reader is always aware that the story is telling us about the tyranny of traditional patriarchy, about the misguided assumptions patriarchal societies impose on developing children, about the narrow and destructive limits on behavior and expression, even thought, imposed by societies.  Peter chooses not to be limited either by those who want to force masculine roles or by those who understand and want to help Peter toward self-identification.  But by the time we reach the end of the narrative, these points have been made repeatedly and dogmatically.  The reader realizes that the novel is almost more a tract than a fiction.  It's not bad--just predictable.  For many readers, perhaps, living through Peter's experiences, sharing Peter's perspective and emotions through Peter's feelings and words. will be a way of gaining understanding of the differences among humans--perhaps these will be new and surprising revelations to them, but while the novel is nicely put together and Peter's voice is distinctive enough to keep us reading and hoping for a better outcome, it is finally a work that has little to say.  The table is set, the meal is served, it is good enough, but there is not really much beyond the initial taste to take with us.  There is value in what Kim Fu has to offer, but there is no sense that the novel has anything to say about it.","3.0 out of 5 stars","December 2, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2O8IK9YQXLK70/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0544034724#wasThisHelpful","R2O8IK9YQXLK70","AX6NA5JAL2B1K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AX6NA5JAL2B1K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Among the many remarkable (as in ""worthy of comment"") achievements of Eleanor Catton's superb novel (some of which will be discussed below), one is particularly interesting:  in a long and complex narrative involving the lives and a few deaths of a large cast of characters (only three of whom are women), by far the most sympathetic and engaging characters are also in some senses the most remote, alien, ""different"" others--two men from China and one a Maori of New Zealand.  The rest of the characters are all Caucasian, of European background, mostly young.  To varying degrees, they are speakers of English (or its dialects), and only one, Benjamin Lowenthal, is Jewish--indeed, an observant Jew--while the others are at least from Christian backgrounds. The two Chinese men, Quee Long and Sook Yongshen, have, one might say, washed up in northwestern New Zealand, the first a goldsmith and prospector, the second, proprietor of an opium den that caters to the needs of men and women most of whom work in the gold fields of that part of New Zealand, hoping for a strike that would allow them to pay their way home, wherever that might be.  Neither man speaks English well nor hears it with any great comprehension, though Sook (contemptuously called ""Johnny Sook"" by the European citizens of Hokitika, a town existing entirely to cater to the needs of the prospectors, ""Johnny"" being the term of convenience that white men use to address all the Chinese workers they encounter, not unlike the ""Boy"" used by white men with African slaves in the South) has a better sense of the language than Quee, and that is significant to the plot. The Maori man, Te RauTauwhare addressed as Ted, is, of course, indigenous (""native"") to the land these people inhabit, and their government has designated certain parts of the land as belonging to the Maori (in practical terms, only so long as it is convenient for the white men to leave it so), and the Maori are most definitely ""different""--Tauwhare's extensive body and facial tattoos are a permanent and striking reminder to everyone who encounters him of the great differences between his cultural and religious background (very little understood by the whites) and their own.  Tauwhare pursues, so far as possible, the ways and customs of his ancestral people, but is treated with more respect by the white men, perhaps because of his more or less protected status, perhaps because he is dignified and formidable, perhaps just because the need of the whites to condescend to or oppress those they choose to perceive as their inferiors (and to exploit through indenture rules little less owned than slaves) is satisfied by their treatment of the Chinese men among them. These three men, I would suggest, are the most sympathetic and emotionally appealing characters (to somewhat different degrees) in this novel, and that strikes me as a major achievement by its author.  Her descriptions of them, including passages in which they speak their native languages with little translation provided, and including detailed and vivid descriptions of their feelings and the distinctive ways they perceive the world around them--notably different from the ways the whites perceive that same world--offer the reader insights and expanded perceptions not available through the eyes or minds of the more familiar white European characters.  Tauwhare, in particular, because of the religious traditions of the Maori people, with their ancient and profound sense of identification with the natural world that sustains them and that they protect and preserve, worshiping its sacred character, provides a window onto the world we might not otherwise have access to.  (I make no judgment about the accuracy of Eleanor Catton's portrayal of the Maori or Chinese worldviews--I believe she has taken trouble to reconstruct them based on both information and sympathetic understanding, but accuracy is not relevant to the point I am making--that these characters are successfully ""other"" and provide a major part of the pleasure of reading this novel.) None of this is meant to say that the white characters are all unpleasant or evil, nor that there are none whom we might like or even identify with.  The first character we meet in detail--Walter Moody, is on the whole a very sympathetic character--a decent man who finds himself more or less invited to become part of an inquiry--or one might say a conspiracy--to uncover the answers to several interlocking mysteries that have roiled the town of Hokitika, including a mysterious death, the disappearance of a prominent citizen, the possible suicide attempt of a recently arrived prostitute, the calamitous outcome of a much-promoted ""seance,"" all having occurred along with the wreck of a barque that had arrived in port the same day as many of these events occurred. It will not do to offer any details about these complicated interactions--a disappeared trunk perhaps lost at sea, a frightening apparition on board a foundering ship, possible forged documents, and so forth.  For that is another great achievement of this novel--the creation of a richly intertwined series of events, gradually revealed through the activities of a number of different characters, each of whom is introduced to the reader in detail, with careful analyses of his or her personality and outlook, moral and philosophical views, and when appropriate, revelations about past behavior that affect the reader's view of the person and his or her likely future behavior.  There is the prosperous hotel owner and pimp, a second hotel manager, the proprietor of a pharmacy who deals in opium (not illegal), men involved in various aspects of shipping industry (very important to this mining town on the New Zealand coast), the editor/publisher of the local newspaper, a banker, a magistrate, a politician engaged in an election campaign, various gold prospectors, the Governor of the Hokitika Gaol (an institution that would incorporate the functions of almshouse and asylum), and the clergyman destined to be the Chaplain of that Gaol. among others. Three women--Lydia Greenway/Wells/Carver (a woman of various identities), Anna Wetherell, a young prostitute and opium addict, and Margaret Shepard, wife of George Shepard, the Governor of the Hokitika Asylum and Jail, a woman perceived by most to be pathologically shy--perhaps agoraphobic, though the term is not used.  Each of these women is (as we learn over many pages) admirable in various ways, whether for intelligence and determination, sensitivity and emotional commitment, loyalty, perhaps even love for others.  Each is also complex and imperfect in important ways.  And it is fair to say that though they are all white, European, they are also, in this environment, entirely ""other"" and so comparable in some ways to the Chinese and Maori men. One aspect of the novel that requires acknowledgment is the pervasive role of astrology as a point of reference.  As I am not familiar, except in the most superficial way, with the arcana of this traditional ""science,"" I have to say that the many ""charts"" and references to the influences affecting the various characters are mostly closed to me. Of course, one knows about the Zodiac and its signs, and the general beliefs of this ancient worldview are familiar in many contexts, especially literary, but thefiner points of the differences of influence are not familiar to me.  As it happens, each of the twelve major divisions of this novel is introduced with an astrological chart ""locating"" twelve of the major characters for the period during which the action takes place, and we know that several of the characters, most prominently Tauwhare, take seriously the influence of the stars, or at least are willing to exploit belief in those influences.  The author's introductory ""Note to the Reader"" offers the suggestion that stubborn adherence to a known error is characteristic of ""persons born during the Age of Pisces, an age of mirrors, tenacity, instinct, twinship, and hidden things.""  That description of the qualities of the Piscean age would also make a very nice summary of the qualities of this narrative, all of which make it so fascinating. It is right to call The Luminaries a thriller, and I would suggest it is a thriller of a traditional kind.  If it had been published in weekly chapters in a periodical, like the novels of Charles Dickens or Wilkie Collins or many others of the late 19th century, its way of proceeding and its regular approach to what we would call cliffhangers would perfectly suit it to that genre.  While many might invoke the memory of Dickens as comparison for this novel, I think its intricacy and rapid movement make it more akin to Wilkie Collins's best work, The Moonstone, perhaps, or Woman in White, though it also has affinities with late Dickens, Mystery of Edwin Drood, especially.  I also am inclined to speculate that we might anticipate a sequel.  While certain parts of the plot are ""solved"" and the problems resolved, there are several characters and situations notably left hanging, with uncertain outcomes, and those would more than supply material for a following novel, if the author chooses. Long works of prose fiction (""big books,"" or maxi-novels) such as this can provide many different kinds of pleasure.  In this case, the fascinating characters, the exotic setting, the constant twists and turns of the plot, the uncertain identities and surprising revelations, all contribute to a narrative that pleases by confounding the reader, who is compelled, indeed propelled to keep on reading, even at the risk of missing pertinent details.  I found myself checking back to earlier chapters, preceding bits of dialogue or description, time and again, to assure myself that I was not entirely lost or wrong about developments.  This was not a fault or a failure of the narrative--it was one of its genuine rewards.  While this novel has important things to say about human relationships, it is not profound; we do not keep reading in hopes of the depth of a Dostoevsky, the refinement of a Henry James, the historical sweep of a Tolstoy; we are rather entertained and moved, and we feel satisfied.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 16, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2HWZI1ET95MRP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0316074314#wasThisHelpful","R2HWZI1ET95MRP","AX6NA5JAL2B1K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AX6NA5JAL2B1K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Just about four-fifths of the way through The Museum of Innocence, chapter 69 is called ""Sometimes.""  It is six tightly printed pages long (most of the chapters in this novel are fairly short--some as few as two pages, few more than eleven or twelve), and its title is significant.  In this chapter, every sentence begins with the word ""sometimes"" and every sentence reports events small or intense, emotions familiar or surprising:  ""Sometimes we'd see lightning in the distance, and the sky would rumble.""  ""Sometimes I would help take the dirty plates into the kitchen,""  ""Sometimes I was absolutely positive that life itself wasn't somewhere else, but right there, at that table.""  The reported events or feelings are not grouped chronologically, nor according to any particular sequence of types or characteristics; they are not grouped logically, nor contrasted by degrees of significance.  They are, or are intended to create the impression of, randomly remembered moments. And the chapter in many ways reinforces the reader's sense that this is a novel about time.The narrator, Kemal, refers several times during his detailed and minute description of roughly ten years of his life to Aristotle's writings on time--in particular, the view that the present is made up of many isolated moments, experienced as ""now,"" and ""time"" is the line that connects all of them to make up our past and our sense of duration.  Since each person experiences the ""now"" differently, with different combinations of the discrete moments that make up the present, the ""past"" which is all such moments connected by our sense of their sequence and duration will be different for each person.Kemal, in fact, talks incessantly about aspects of time and the way time impinges on our consciousness, even including a chapter about the ways technology--from primitive timekeeping mechanisms to increasingly precise clocks and watches, to the presence of radios and then televisions which usurp the place of timepieces in determining our sense of the passage of time--has changed our consciousness of time, even inducing forgetfulness and the obliteration of time.  As Kemal tells us at one point, ""Sometimes I would forget Time altogether, and nestle into 'now' as if it were a soft bed.""With time as a major theme, the questions of identity, of relationships, of the possibility of knowing anything for certain, of the roles of social and political change in individual lives, of religious belief and superstition, of the possibility of stepping outside of time and most importantly, of the role of love and its effect on the meaning of time in anyone's life--are all (and this list is not comprehensive) important aspects of Kemal's meditations on his experiences and his efforts to retain evidence--by collecting objects--of what has happened and to whom in his life.  In that sense, the title is the giveaway--in this novel about obsession (or at least about an obsessive character, Kemal)--we participate in the evolution of the museum of Kemal's life and loves, which he assembles and then attempts to create and open to the public so that ""visitors to my Museum of Innocence must compel themselves, therefore, to view all objects displayed therein--the buttons, the glasses, the old photographs and Fusun's combs--not as real things in the present moment, but as my memories.""Of course, the novel is not really ""about"" time, but tells a story of hopeless love:  Kemal is engaged to marry a cultivated and socially prominent woman whom he loves, but he falls in love with a ""shopgirl,"" a very beautiful and ambitious young woman (Fusun) with whom he has a torrid sexual affair while involved in planning for the engagement party and subsequent wedding to his fiancee, Sibel. This situation forces consideration of the many social and moral tensions in Turkey brween 1975 and 1985, the main duration of the narrative; Turkey, with its proud commitment to secular republican values and ambitions to modernize and become more European is nonetheless wracked with dissension because of the growing power of the traditionalist Islamists and their commitment to restoring the social control and political power of the religious traditions they value.  So ""time"" is also about the fissures between traditional custom and modern thought, between women wearing headscarves and long dresses and others wearing European dress, bikinis, smoking, driving cars and openly showing affection (necking in public with their boyfriends), which contrasts (as we know in our own society) force awareness of the changes that go with the passage of time. The problems are further complicated by the class divisions of which Kemal (as the son of a wealthy businessman, who has led a life of privilege and almost no financial anxieties) is painfully aware, both because of Fusun's much lower social and economic standing but because of his involvement with a number of friends who represent various levels of, and attitudes toward, the economic disparities in Istanbul, as well as the contrasts between the urban and rural cultures.Stories about obsessions, especially about obsessive characters who are mostly unaware that they are behaving obsessively, can become tiresome--obsession involves repetition, after all, and at some point repetition becomes boring or even exasperating.  At some early stages of my reading of this novel, I wondered whether that would become a serious problem.  I have read and greatly enjoyed most of Orhan Pamuk's novels, and have learned to be intrigued and pleased by his metafictional games as well as by the depth of the characters (in more traditional senses) that he creates.  In this case, the early worries were not borne out.  The novel is repetitive in some ways, but the repetitions enhance the power of the narrative as the variations on familiar themes and the plot twists (involving a number of other characters, such as Kemal's mother and brother, Fusun's family, various business associates) keep the story moving, though admittedly at a deliberate and constantly self-examining pace.  (Orhan Pamuk is, himself, a character in the novel, appearing as a guest at the engagement party and in a more important role later which I will not specify for fear of creating a spoiler.)Late in the novel, perhaps inevitably, Kemal alludes in passing to his having found solace in reading Proust and Montaigne.  The overt references to two writers who are unquestionably antecedents to the themes and narrative strategies of this novel is typical of Pamuk, both as an acknowlegment and as a challenge:  we must consider whether he has lived up to his literary ancestors.  While The Museum of Innocence has much of the rich and deep qualities of those writers' works, and I have greatly enjoyed reading it, I have to conclude that as compared with the best of Pamuk's own works (My Name Is Red, Snow, The Black Book), it is not quite on the same level.  By almost any standard, it is a very fine work and I do recommend it enthusiastically, but the danger of writing obsessively (even with comic intent) about an obsession is not entirely avoided.  I hope, however, that many readers will try it for themselves, as it offers great rewards.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 14, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RPAVPTXEV09H4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0307386244#wasThisHelpful","RPAVPTXEV09H4","AX6NA5JAL2B1K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AX6NA5JAL2B1K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It seems almost churlish to complain about Billy Collins's poetry; he works so hard to be ingratiating while maintaining the appearance of effortless composition.  He is popular in several senses--among contemporary poets, ""popular"" meaning appealing to a large and varied audience, is a rare quality, and yet to all appearances, Collins has gained and maintained an uncommonly wide readership.  To his fans and his critics, this is attributable to his approach to poetry--he writes what any reader would agree is ""accessible"" poetry--poems about chance encounters with familiar objects that prompt odd thoughts or responses, providing new perspectives or witty comments about the familiar; or recognitions of unfamiliar objects or experiences that somehow impinge on his consciousness and force him to reconsider the ways the new perceptions force rearrangements of the old and the familiar.  The reader is treated to the shared recognition of that feeling of comfort and familiarity, or the feeling of oddness and possible shock, only to be reassured that the new fits with the old, if only through the exercise of some witty transformation or transition.  And there is always wit.  Perception and wit, clever verbal manipulations of ideas and feelings--what else could we want from poems?Yet, the repetition of pretty much the same method -- a sharp perception or evocation, a clever move toward defamiliarizing, and comforting reversal returning us to the familiar -- many of the poems reproduce this pattern and suggest to the reader who is traversing many pages of Collins's poems that his work is better read in moderation, a few poems at a time, with long rests between.This is because the patterns so often seem to be the only excuse for the poem.  Collins depends on his sharp senses and his witty manipulation of words to keep the readers' attention while entertaining and reassuring them that they have enjoyed a good poem.  That is often true, but ""good"" is about as much as one can say for them.  They are well crafted, they amuse or entertain, on a very few occasions, they may prompt serious thought or deep feeling, but mostly they skim surfaces and allow easy exits.Collins is very aware of these reservations from his critics.  In this collection, we find several poems, a few from years back, a couple from the ""new"" section, wherein he comments on the ""problems"" with poetry and with being a poet.  ""The Suggestion Box,"" for example, is especially relevant.  He humorously describes a day during which several people tell him that he ""could write a poem about that.""  People who know he is a poet offer ""subjects"" for poems--a waitress spills coffee in his lap, there is a fire drill interrupting classes, he encounters a man with a face full of tattoos, and so on.  He jokes that people expect him to write about quirky experiences, and he suggests to himself ""Maybe I should write a poem/about all the people who think/they know what I should be writing poems about.""  And so the cute and witty turn--he is writing a poem about writing a poem in the context of  readers' expectations.  And that poem entertains, especially with its final image of a pair of ducks emerging from the water, in exactly the way the people expect.  It also, to some extent, gets Collins off the hook, since he is acknowledging that there are some who think his poems are shallow while, simultaneously, and justifiably, claiming that there is a difference in depth and significance between his poems about objects and occasions and the triviality of the subjects offered by his readers--he is better than they think, he claims, and that is true.In another such poem, ""No Things,"" opens with a reference to ""This love for everyday things,"" and mounts a defense of finding the poetic wonder in what another poet called ""the stuff of what happens,"" while giving a backhand to the poets of ""no,"" with Philip Larkin's name prominently displayed as a poet of everyday life who finds darkness, misery, even despair, in the elements of an ordinary day's encounters.  Collins's ironic attack on poets who are always ""banging away on the mystery"" is both a pointed critique (sometimes the doomsayers can be as repetitive and seemingly mechanical in their poetic procedures and Collins is accused of being, but on the negative side) and a pointed self-defense--he values ""the firefly,/the droplet running along the green leaf,/or even the bar of soap sliding around the bathtub"" and implicitly refuses to be forced to see the dark sides of such images.The ongoing battle in the American poetry business between the champions of the ""accessible and audience-friendly poem"" and those who insist that such work is mere versifying at best, kitsch at worst, and certainly not poetry, who assert the superior value of poems as language machines, deep images, surreal or dreamlike experiences (poems are not about anything), leaps of imagination, inspired nonsense, etc., continues and is unlikely to abate, though neither side can produce convincing arguments for the exclusive superiority of their preferred poetic modes.  Collins is a high level practitioner of the charming and accessible poem that is both thoughtful and witty, even occasionally moving and enlightening.  He is unlikely ever to be ranked with the great poets, because our aesthetic tends to value the dark and serious and probing over the light and charming and amusing.  So be it.As for this volume, it offers a generous selection of Collins's earlier poems and a similarly generous selection of previously uncollected poems. It seems to me to be an excellent introduction to his work for a new reader, a pleasant set of additions for anyone who already knows the earlier works.  While there are several very strong poems among the new ones, there is little difference from his earlier work--which is perhaps his strength for those who like his work, though it probably also confirms the negatives for those who do not.  The concluding poem in this volume, it must be said, is a departure--""The Names: (for the victims of September 11 and their survivors)"" is an uncommonly serious poem--an expression of respect for the grief, the pain, the loss, carried forward as a kind of litany/catalogue of names linked with images of time passing, life ended and life going on.

"Since the earlier ""review"" included with this title is of a different book entirely and should be deleted since it is irrelevant, I wouid like to say that this lovely book, edited by Edward Hirsch, is certainly worthy in its own right of a 5 star rating.  The selection of poems that either address, comment on, or mention in passing the presence and significance of the nightingale is wide-ranging and worth reading, individually and in concert with the stated theme of the book.  There are a few surprising omissions (one Latin poem, in particular, that seems to me the most beautiful about nightingales, but perhaps Mr. Hirsch was unable to find a satisfactory translation of it), but the excerpts and complete poems included are all worth reading and contemplating.  Obviously, I recommend the small volume to anyone who loves poetry and birds.  (Of course, there are no nightingales in the USA, since the species is not native to this continent, which may possibly lend a special poignancy to Keats's line, ""heard melodies are sweet, but those unheard are sweeter"".)","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 4, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3XYMVAV1RTNL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0807615870#wasThisHelpful","R3XYMVAV1RTNL","AX6NA5JAL2B1K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AX6NA5JAL2B1K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"From my first encounter with Robert Stone's work--the great Dog Soldiers--through all of his novels since, I have been consistently impressed and moved by his complex characterizations, powerful plotting, and maybe especially his ability to create convincing environments where his characters would live out the dramas that grow from their actions and personal struggles. Not only Dog Soldiers, but Children of Light, Outerbridge Reach, Damascus Gate, and the others have been deeply satisfying works.Death of the Black-Haired Girl?  Not so.  This traditional college campus story of a dangerous romance between a married  professor and one of his students feels forced, cobbled together, and though the characters are complex as well as familiar (from other literary works), they are not finally particularly interesting nor convincing.  Maud, brilliant mind and talented writer who is still emotionally and socially immature; Jo, idealistic former nun working as a counselor and still trying to work out her conflicted relationships with people encountered in her former life; Edward Stack and Lou Salmone, retired cop and Maud's father, still working cop and old friend of Edward--both steeped in the mixture of commitment to the ideal of the cop in service to public safety while caught in morally suspect or underhanded relations; Steven Brookman--the professor who finds himself involved with his student while wanting to protect and preserve his marriage, especially because his wife, Ellie, is finally pregnant with their hoped-for second child.  There is plenty of potential drama here, and much of it works out more or less as one would expect.  The accidental death of Maud in complicated and ambiguous circumstances, seen from different angles by different witnesses, produces a variety of versions of who did what, who should be held responsible.  If Steven Brookman was not directly responsible for Maud's death on a physical level, was he perhaps nonetheless morally responsible for creating the circumstances that brought them together and precipitated the accident.  Moral ambiguity, complexity of character, yes.  Convincing and powerful drama, not really.While no one would want to confine a writer of Stone's excellence to the same territories he has explored in other works, one can wish that he had not decided to tackle the ""academic novel,"" especially in the wake of the several far more successful works in that sub-genre--as far back as Gerald Warner Brace's The Department, John Williams's superb Stoner, or the more recent masterpiece, Disgrace, by J.M. Coetzee, not to mention David Mamet's successful drama, Oleanna. Stone could have surpassed these, of course; it's not that no one could write a better work than Coetzee's or Williams's, but that Stone never manages to lift this novel to their level.  The most effective moments are in the scenes with Eddie Stack, as he tries to work out his desire for revenge when he believes his daughter has been sacrificed to the selfishness and arrogance of Steven Brookman.  But the novel never feels fully realized and the sense of a work forced to its finish overwhelms any strengths it may have in specific scenes.  This is not the Stone I have admired. It feels like a made-for-screenplay composition rather than the kind of committed fiction we value from Robert Stone. It's not a terrible book--just not a book that can stand together with Stone's much finer achievements.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 30, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RRMZJFG1FA5UA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0618386238#wasThisHelpful","RRMZJFG1FA5UA","AX6NA5JAL2B1K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AX6NA5JAL2B1K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Someone must have neglected to suggest to Ms. Fenn that it may not be a good idea to remind readers of the great masters of the genre in which one is attempting a first effort--in this case, a ghost story thriller that has as its title a direct reference to Edgar Allan Poe (and the very ill-judged choice by the narrator of calling a resident ghost ""Poe""), and at several points in the novel, open allusions not only to Poe's greatest works, but to Stephen King's, as well.  King may not be on a level with Poe, but he is pretty formidable and not the best choice for a point of comparison with the story in progress.This may suggest that I do not have much patience with this novel, and that would be correct.  It is clever on a low level, it makes use of materials from classics of its genre, and it attempts to stand on the shoulders of the masters--with little success.  A great part of the problem with this novel is the narrator--supposedly a writer--working on what is a ""1000 page novel about Rasputin"" and working for a smalltown newspaper (how King-like!) writing obituaries. Assigned to ""cover"" a seance at a local ""haunted house"" (the ruin of a family mansion partially burned and left to moulder, but definitely NOT in a class with the House of Usher) the narrator becomes involved in a convoluted and occasionally amusing series of ghostly events, with bloody consequences for several characters.  It is not worth summarizing the plot, but it needs to be said that the narrator, Dimitri Petrov, at no point provides evidence that he is intelligent enough to be the writer he wants to be, and at no point does he manage to avoid the kind of ""action"" that prompts audiences at low-rent horror films to shout ""don't open that door"" at the screen as the silliest person in the film inevitably does open it onto some totally predictable horror.  Dimitri is, of course, the ""puttery mind"" of my title.  He casts about for this or that, examines his conscience occasionally, survives some very unpleasant encounters, but at no point comes to life nor inspires interest.  Nor do any of the ""characters"" he encounters in this small-town story going nowhere near Poe territory, staying far from King land, managing a few Lovecraft moments, but on the whole wasting the time and patience of the reader who almost never fails to anticipate (pages in advance) each of the shocks and thrills.  I cannot imagine who would have chosen this novel for a ""breakthrough"" award.  It is the modest first effort of a writer who should have left it in the drawer along with the novel about Rasputin and gone ahead to write what she probably will later accomplish--a reasonably good novel.  One hopes.","2.0 out of 5 stars","October 30, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R300KMSM3CGVE0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1477848169#wasThisHelpful","R300KMSM3CGVE0","AX6NA5JAL2B1K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AX6NA5JAL2B1K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Although there are some philosophically oriented English/American writers about movies, they tend not to be among those most recognized by anglophone movie fans.  Some very fine writers--James Agee, Andrew Sarris, Pauline Kael, Dwight Macdonald, Murray Kempton,and many others--have produced readable and insight-filled commentaries on specific movies and the art form in general.  It is uncommon, however, in English language writing about movies, to encounter the kind of complex and sometimes almost incomprehensible prose produced by the philosopher-critics of the French tradition.Alain Badiou, as we are reminded in the introduction to this collection, has been writing about CINEMA for more than fifty years.  This collection offers a number of fascinating, sometimes impossibly arcane, sometimes disappointingly boring, commentaries, usually about genres or directorial oeuvres more than about particular movies.  In other words, though Badiou has strong opinions about the importance, indeed the deep relevance, of cinema to western culture, he is not a movie reviewer and does not bother with thumbs up or down, numbers of stars or popcorn tubs, and so on.  As an unreconstructed (though somewhat reconfigured over the years) Marxist, his analyses tend to focus on what he considers the fundamental issues and orientation of the films he discusses, and he shows a strong preference for the kinds of politically oriented films that we associate with Jean-Luc Godard or, in Badiou's case, the surprising examples of the films of Jacques Tati.  He strongly denigrates some of the most famous and revered French directors and their ""quality"" films, which he considers to be mummified museum pieces rather than living works of art.For a reader willing to navigate the sometimes jargon-turgid prose, these essays are often rewarding.  One major drawback for many American readers will be the frequent references to political activities and even politicians indigenous to France and the intricacies of French politics, as well as other distinctly parochial francophone interests.  Some notes--not really copious enough for non-French readers--help to clarify some of those points, but a few essays are really worthless to us because of their arcane nature.  I found, therefore, that reading selectively and being willing simply to skip ahead if an essay became too opaque, was the way to go with this.  From that, I found enough of interest to make the book a worthwhile encounter.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 24, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RS3JZ9D33ZEH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0745655688#wasThisHelpful","RS3JZ9D33ZEH","AX6NA5JAL2B1K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AX6NA5JAL2B1K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Bob Shacochis is admired for his excellent collections of short stories, mostly about life in the Caribbean, an area of the world he knows well.  For his massive new novel, The Woman Who Lost Her Soul, he has taken us back to Haiti, but the more pertinent predecessor to this work is his firsthand reporting of the American occupation of Haiti during the 1990s, The Immaculate Invasion.  That book, a scarifying account of the diplomatic, military and bureaucratic follies of that effort publicly described as intended to rescue the Haitian people from their political chaos, provides all the ""background"" one might want to clarify the action of the new novel.  But rest assured, the novel can be read on its own, and the reader will probably then wish to read the nonfiction work afterward, just because Shacochis is such a good writer and the subject is important.I was initially a bit dubious about this novel.  After the first fifty pages, I wondered if it would turn out to be a romping action novel, with lots of exotic local color and very tough men exercising all their muscles and mechanical equipment to beat up on the bad guys--Rambo Meets Vodou, or some such thing.  But I felt sure I could expect better, if only because of the presence of the epigraph at the beginning by Fernando Pessoa: ""It is no secret that souls sometimes die in a person and are replaced by others.""  That plus an accompanying passage from Czeslaw Milosz, and another from Winston Churchill, seemed bona fide assurances that there would be depths, and there are. It's not that I always assume an epigraph is a guarantee, but it is a kind of promise, and that is fulfilled. As I should have expected from Shacochis.The novel is divided into five sections of unequal length, with locations in Haiti, Croatia, Turkey, various U.S. military and CIA locations, including several famous golf courses, and the Outer Banks.  At the center of the novel, a father-daughter pair (dangerously paired), Stephen Chambers/Stjepan Kovacevic and Dorothy (Dottie) Chambers/with several AKA names; the father is a high official in the Foreign Service with influential connections in many of the ""black"" operations known or not known to have been ongoing during the 70's, 80's, 90's.  Stephen Chambers has more than connections--he has uncanny authority and uses it to bypass whatever obstacles (including legal prohibitions against, for example, assassination), as well as to pursue a goal of revenge against men involved in the death of his father during the Second World War in Croatia.  His daughter, preternaturally beautiful and intelligent, and deeply involved in conspiracy and spying (more or less at the instigation of her father), is the woman of the title.  We learn very early in the novel that she has been killed in an ambush in Haiti, and much of the rest of the book includes, though is not primarily focused on, efforts to identify the reasons for her death and the identity of her killers.Dottie Chambers, known by several other names, is important in her own right, and the third section of the novel is devoted to her teenage years at school in Turkey, where the reasons for her loss of her soul begin to appear, though they are only fully developed later.  Her importance in the structure of the novel is apparent because she is the center of attention of many men, but especially of the several main male characters, Tom Harrington, Eville Burnette, and her father.There is plenty of action in this novel, which need not be previewed here.  What is important about the novel is its rich exploration of a number of important ethical and psychological challenges to the behavior of men and women involved in international ""relations,"" with special reference to the motives that move some to encourage or even generate international or interracial or other forms of conflict in the effort to achieve personal political ends--revenge of a father's death, for example, or defeat of a rival held in contempt, or even sexual rivalry.  The morality (or the rejection of the relevance of morality) of the plotting and enactment of the overthrow of governments or simply the elimination of inconvenient political actors (or criminal elements, such as narco-traders) is explored in depth.  The personal impact on the agents or actors in these activities--the destruction of relationships, the loss of faith or even the ability to trust, the collapse of any sense of self--all these afflict the main characters in Shacochis's narrative, and they lead us to realize that at some point, love may have a redemptive effect, but it may also be just a complicating factor that unravels carefully laid plans and leads to the death of people--some innocent (though almost no one is innocent in this web of intrigue), some beloved but faithless, some possessed of multiple identities and, in traditional noir fashion, equally involved in both or all of the conflicting ""sides"" of these international conflicts.In other words, this substantial, complex, brilliantly written novel is worth your time.  I would say thatit competes on a level with another massive novel of similar complexity, Jonathan Littell's  Les Bienveillantes (The Kindly Ones), and then points of comparison might need reference back to some of the classic novels of international intrigue and warfare.  I recommend The Woman Who Lost Her Soul without reservation.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 7, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RSXLMZFA8NMPA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0802119824#wasThisHelpful","RSXLMZFA8NMPA","AX6NA5JAL2B1K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AX6NA5JAL2B1K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have tried quite a few of this company's products and I really like them because my hair often gets very coarse and damaged. It also gets frizzy most of the time, so I wanted some sort of nice hydrating hair care products and I have found that this line is fantastic - these products leave your hair looking so shiny and healthy while also making it smell so good. I hear a lot about the benefits of using Argan Oil to moisturize your hair, and this company's products are particularly effective.They leave my hair noticeably softer, smoother and shinier without making it feel weighed down or oily. I really like the way these products smell and my husband has also mentioned that he loves the way my hair smells. This treatment is great for restoring and healing hair that is damaged from color treatments and it makes my hair feel so much softer and healthier. I’m very happy I found this line of hair care products and highly recommend it.I received this product free to review.

"I can't explain it, but I am constantly chipping my nails. I can't really get professional manicures because I can only make them last a few minutes. For this reason, I always carry nail files and clippers in my handbag. This is a great set of nail files that are 3.5 inches long and 5/8 inch wide. I think that this 50-pack is perfect because I can leave some in the car, in my suitcases for travel, at the office, etc. and not have to worry about restocking right away. These are mini nail files, so they are very easy to carry with you in your purse. They work very well for shaping your nails; I have been using them to shape my natural nails.

"Ever since our dog got sick, we haven't been able to take him to the groomer, so we have been trying to groom him at home. My little fur baby is super sensitive and is terrified of water, so he will bite my parents when they try to bathe or groom him. I was delighted when I came across this tool because I thought it would be a good way to get him used to being touched or groomed by them. The glove is great because you can use it to gently massage your pet while removing hair, dirt or tangles. You can also use the other side of it to remove fur from your carpet or furniture. It's very nice because he is less scared of this tool than he is of other grooming tools. He actually likes being massaged with it now.

"I am really weird about my eyes; I have a terribly hard time putting anything in/near them as I keep blinking and twitching. I swore off eyelash curlers when I was younger as I used a plain steel one that would often pinch my eyelids. I know that this was most likely due to the fact that I stink at using these, but it still traumatized me a bit. I finally started using them again when I found a pretty comfortable one earlier this year. I wanted to get another nice curler to keep at the office, so I was very happy when I came across this one.It is so pretty (I love anything and everything pink) and I wanted to give it a shot. In hindsight, I’m really glad I did! It’s very gentle and works super well. It gave my lashes just the right amount of curl and make my eyelashes seem thicker and my eyes look bigger.

"I have written about this a few tims, but we have been adding more night lights around the house lately and I love LED lights like these since they are cost and energy efficient. This is an excellent and easy to install light that is great for hallways, cabinets and closets. I am using this particular light for the hallway in our basement. It is particularly handy for me because when I am walking down that hallway, I'm usually carrying a basket of laundry and I don't need to put the basket down to turn on the light anymore. I am very pleased with this product; it is much brighter than I expected. I also like the fact that it runs on AAA batteries as opposed to harder-to-find batteries that I have seen other motion sensing lights use.

"My husband has been obsessed with VR headsets like these ever since they first came out on the consumer market. These are like super cool toys for adults. The concept is very cool; you attach your smartphone to these and use them to play VR games or watch 3D movies. He has a headset that is made by the manufacturer of his cell phone but it is specifically made for the phone model that he has, so I can't use it on my phone. The model he has is also pretty expensive. I was very happy when we came across this headset because I can use it with my Android personal phone or my iPhone.

"This is a very nice mattress protector. Crib sheets and mattresses often get dirty and you can’t really go out and get a new one or clean the mattress as well as you’d like to every time this happens. As a result, I was delighted to find this bamboo terry mattress protector from Hello Baby. It’s super soft and protects the mattress (and by extension, your baby) from stains, mold, bacteria and dust mites. Most importantly, for us anyway, was the fact that it’s made of hypoallergenic and antibacterial material and is non-toxic, BPA, lead, flame retardant and latex free, so I feel good about using it for our child.

"I was very excited to try this product because I like having my own medical instruments. I have some electronic blood pressure monitors, but my home health care nurse tells me that she is old fashioned and trusts these more, so I wanted to get one. To be completely honest, I'm not 100% clear on how to use it, but my nurse has been using it a lot as she has to take my vitals every half-hour when I am having my treatments a few times each week. She tells me that it is very well made and accurate. It's comfortable and comes with a nice carrying case, although it doesn't include any instructions. Overall, I’m very pleased with this find and highly recommend it. I think that this would be a great gift for any medical professional.I received this product free to review.

"While we used to like to walk our fur baby, he has gotten older and sicker so we can't take him out anymore and have been using training pads like these again. These particular pads are great; they are nicely absorbent and very cute (these are the first pads that I have seen that have a nice design on the back too). They also seem to be very comfortable; when I first laid one out for him, he decided to lie down on it for a while.

"We have a lot of adhesive hooks on the walls in our home. This is a habit that we got into when we were renting a home; the landlord didn’t want any holes in the walls, so we started putting adhesive hooks everywhere. Now that we have our own home, we don’t want any holes in the walls, so we’re back to using adhesive hooks. :-) I used an earlier version of mysonger adhesive hooks and I was very happy with them, but this new version is even better! You can use these hooks on just about any wall in your home or office. I use them to hang picture frames, shoe organizers (that I use to hold other things), keys, kitchen utensils, and even for extra towels in the bathroom. These particular adhesive hooks are nice and strong; they are also very easy to use. I have used cheap adhesive hooks where you have to wet the backs and do all sorts of other weird things to get them to work, but with these, you just have to peel the back off.

"I really enjoy knitting and crocheting. I was super happy when I found this set of Ohuhu set of crochet hooks. The set comes with 22 hooks total, with 11 color hooks that range from 2 mm to 6.5 mm in 0.5 mm increments, as well as 11 silver hooks that range from .6 mm to 1.9 mm. This is a very useful set since it has so many hooks in such a wide variety of sizes and the sizes are very clearly marked. The hooks are very comfortable to grip and work pretty well. This isn't a super high-end set of hooks, but it certainly isn't priced like one either. I think that this is a fantastic deal and this set would be perfect for anyone starting out with crochet.

"I have written about this before, but my husband is a photographer. We have owned a studio for many years, and even though we aren't as involved in the day-to-day anymore, he still enjoys taking pictures and likes to go on shoots at least once every few months. We also enjoy going out to take pictures for fun. This is a really nice and attractive bag made of durable non-absorbent canvas. This bag is really cool because the sponge case and partitions are removable, so you can use this bag comfortably even when you aren't bringing your camera or other delicate equipment. The shoulder strap is easily adjustable and very comfortable. There are plenty of handy pockets for you to store things like batteries and memory cards, your cell phone, etc. and the bag is a nice size without being too bulky or heavy. If I had to complain about something, it would probably be that the logo is a little larger than I would have liked, but it blends is well and isn't ostentatious so I am okay with that too.

"I have written a lot about my fur baby. I am very picky about the products that we use for him and I love spoiling him. We have been using a plastic water bowl for him ever since he was younger, but I don't like how it gets dirty and I had some health concerns about using a plastic bowl, so I was very happy to come across these stainless steel bowls. This particular set of bowls is nice because I was planning to keep one for our dog and give one to my sister for her dog. These bowls are very well made and certainly seem durable. They have rubber bottoms, which is nice because this keeps them from moving. I like that they are a nice size; it does seem a shade large for my dog, but I like that because I don't have to worry about him running out of water when we are all out. These bowls are very easy to clean by hand and they are also dishwasher safe.Others have complained about a sticker on the inside of the bowls, but the bowls we received did not have any stickers.

"We travel to visit our family and friends in Asia at least once a year. It's something of a custom to bring our friends bottles of wine or whiskey when we see them. I always bring nice bottles of organic olive oil for my aunts as olive oil is more expensive there. This has always been very stressful for me as I hate having to pack bottles or worry about them breaking. I think that these bottle protectors are genius. They are extremely well made with bubble wrap interiors and zip lock and velcro fasteners. They are easy to use and work very well. To top this all off, they even look nice.

"I have written about this before, but I travel quite a lot for work and I am always on the lookout for cute new products that will make this process easier. I also have super sensitive skin and can't use most of the toiletries that are provided by hotels.

"This year has really flown by; I can't believe that Halloween is just around the corner. I have written about this before, but we have a really big extended family and all throughout my childhood, holidays like Thanksgiving and Christmas were huge deals. We always had formal meals with all of the trimmings and lots of decorations. My dad or one of my uncles would always dress up as Santa and pass out gifts on Christmas morning. Now that we have a family of our own, I love passing these traditions down to our kids. We always have a great time decorating our tree and hanging stockings.
